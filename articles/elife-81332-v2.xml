We addressed how iron affects inflammatory hepcidin levels and the ensuing hypoferremic response. Dietary iron overload did not mitigate hepcidin induction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated wild type mice but prevented effective inflammatory hypoferremia. Likewise, LPS modestly decreased serum iron in hepcidin-deficient <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, model of hemochromatosis. Synthetic hepcidin triggered hypoferremia in control but not iron-loaded wild type animals. Furthermore, it dramatically decreased hepatic and splenic ferroportin in <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on standard or iron-deficient diet, but only triggered hypoferremia in the latter. Mechanistically, iron antagonized hepcidin responsiveness by inactivating IRPs in the liver and spleen to stimulate <underline>f</underline>erroportin mRNA translation. Prolonged LPS treatment eliminated ferroportin mRNA and permitted hepcidin-mediated hypoferremia in iron-loaded mice. Thus, de novo ferroportin synthesis is a critical determinant of serum iron and finetunes hepcidin-dependent functional outcomes. Our data uncover a crosstalk between hepcidin and IRE/IRP systems that controls tissue ferroportin expression and determines serum iron levels. Moreover, they suggest that hepcidin supplementation therapy is more efficient when combined with iron depletion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iron metabolism</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>hepcidin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-159730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pantopoulos</surname><given-names>Kostas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charlebois</surname><given-names>Edouard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 2306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Venkataramani</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Under systemic iron overload, translational derepression of ferroportin mRNA via the IRE/IRP system antagonizes hepcidin-mediated ferroportin degradation to coordinately control serum iron.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic iron balance is controlled by hepcidin, a peptide hormone that is produced by hepatocytes in the liver and operates in target cells by binding to the iron exporter ferroportin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camaschella et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katsarou and Pantopoulos, 2020</xref>). This results in ferroportin internalization and lysosomal degradation but also directly inhibits ferroportin function by occluding its iron export channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aschemeyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billesbølle et al., 2020</xref>). Ferroportin is highly expressed in duodenal enterocytes and tissue macrophages, which are instrumental for dietary iron absorption and iron recycling from senescent erythrocytes, respectively. Ferroportin is also expressed in hepatocytes, where excess iron is stored and can be mobilized on demand. Hepcidin-mediated ferroportin inactivation inhibits iron entry into plasma. This is a critical homeostatic response against iron overload, but also an innate immune response against infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganz and Nemeth, 2015</xref>). Thus, hepcidin expression is induced when systemic iron levels are high to prevent dietary iron absorption or under inflammatory conditions to promote iron retention within ferroportin-expressing cells and render the metal unavailable to extracellular pathogens.</p><p>The hepcidin-encoding <italic>Hamp</italic> gene is transcriptionally induced by iron or inflammatory stimuli via BMP/SMAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang and Babitt, 2019</xref>) or IL-6/STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmidt, 2015</xref>) signaling, respectively. These pathways crosstalk at different levels. For instance, the BMP co-receptor hemojuvelin (HJV), a potent enhancer of iron-dependent BMP/SMAD signaling, is also essential for the inflammatory induction of hepcidin. Thus, <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, a model of juvenile hemochromatosis characterized by severe iron overload and hepcidin deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), exhibit blunted inflammatory induction of hepcidin and fail to mount a hypoferremic response following LPS treatment or infection with <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fillebeen et al., 2018</xref>). Excess iron inhibits hepcidin induction via the BMP/SMAD and IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charlebois and Pantopoulos, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), but the in vivo relevance of these findings is not known.</p><p>Hepcidin-dependent inhibition of ferroportin activity and expression is a major but not the sole contributor to inflammatory hypoferremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deschemin and Vaulont, 2013</xref>). This is related to the fact that ferroportin expression is regulated by additional transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drakesmith et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, ferroportin transcription is induced by iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aydemir et al., 2009</xref>) and suppressed by inflammatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ludwiczek et al., 2003</xref>), while translation of <italic>Slc40a1(+IRE</italic>) mRNA, the major ferroportin transcript that harbors an ‘iron responsive element’ (IRE) within its 5’ untranslated regions (5’ UTR) is controlled by ‘iron regulatory proteins’ (IRPs), IRP1 and IRP2. The IRE/IRP system accounts for coordinate post-transcriptional regulation of iron metabolism proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang and Pantopoulos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muckenthaler et al., 2008</xref>). In a homeostatic response to iron deficiency, IRPs bind to the IRE within the <italic>Slc40a1(+IRE</italic>) and ferritin (<italic>Fth1</italic> and <italic>Ftl1</italic>) mRNAs, inhibiting their translation. IRE/IRP interactions do not take place in iron-loaded cells, allowing de novo ferroportin and ferritin synthesis to promote iron efflux and storage, respectively. The impact of the IRE/IRP system on the regulation of tissue ferroportin and serum iron is not well understood.</p><p>The aim of this work was to elucidate mechanisms by which systemic iron overload affects hepcidin expression and downstream responses, especially under inflammatory conditions. Utilizing wild type and <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we demonstrate that serum iron levels reflect regulation of ferroportin in the liver and spleen by multiple signals. We further show that effective hepcidin-mediated hypoferremia is antagonized by compensatory mechanisms aiming to prevent cellular iron overload. Our data uncovered a crosstalk between hepcidin and the IRE/IRP system that controls ferroportin expression in the liver and spleen, and thereby determines serum iron levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dietary iron overload does not prevent further inflammatory <italic>Hamp</italic> mRNA induction in LPS-treated wild type mice, but mitigates hepcidin responsiveness</title><p>In an exploratory experiment, wild type mice were subjected to dietary iron loading by feeding a high-iron diet (HID) for short (1 day), intermediate (1 week), or long (5 weeks) time intervals; other animals remained on standard (control) diet.

Levels of biochemically detectable liver ferroportin differed substantially between wild type and <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Thus, they were relatively low in the former and highly induced in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), independently of iron load. The differences were more dramatic compared to those observed by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Conceivably, the strong ferroportin signal in Western blots from <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver homogenates reflects high ferroportin expression in hepatocytes, which are the predominant cell population and make up ~80% of the liver cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schulze et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, hepatocellular ferroportin is less visible by immunohistochemistry because the signal is substantially weaker compared to that in Kupffer cells (see also Figure 6E). Interestingly, the LPS treatment visibly suppressed total liver ferroportin in <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on control diet but not IDD, and appeared to modestly reduce it in wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>); albeit without statistical significance. These data are consistent with negative regulation of ferroportin by residual LPS-induced hepcidin in <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on control diet, which could explain the small drop in serum iron and transferrin saturation under these acute inflammatory conditions, as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fillebeen et al., 2018</xref>. However, liver ferroportin remained detectable and apparently functional, as it did not allow significant iron sequestration and dramatic drop in serum iron. Notably, persistence of relatively high serum iron is also evident in LPS-treated wild type mice on HID, despite maximal hepcidin and minimal liver ferroportin levels.</p><p>Next, we analyzed ferroportin in the spleen, an organ with erythrophagocytic macrophages that plays an important role in body iron traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurotaki et al., 2015</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis shows that LPS reduced ferroportin in red pulp splenic macrophages from wild type mice on control diet, but this effect was less evident in wild type mice on HID and in <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on control diet or IDD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Western blot analysis shows a stronger ferroportin signal in splenic extracts from <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), consistent with immunohistochemistry. However, in this assay, LPS suppressed splenic ferroportin in wild type animals and in <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on control diet, but not IDD. This could be a result of residual hepcidin upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>), while the lack of significant splenic ferroportin suppression in <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on IDD may denote hepcidin insufficiency. In any case, the relatively high circulating iron levels in dietary iron-loaded and LPS-treated wild type mice indicate continuous iron efflux to plasma despite hepcidin excess.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Insufficient hepcidin leads to blunted hypoferremic response in iron overload</title><p>We used human synthetic hepcidin to address whether the failure of mouse models of iron overload to mount an appropriate hypoferremic response to acute inflammation is caused by endogenous hepcidin insufficiency or other mechanisms. Wild type and <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice subjected to dietary iron manipulations received 2.5 μg/g synthetic hepcidin every two hours for a total of four intraperitoneal injections. Each dose corresponds to ~200-fold excess over endogenous circulating hepcidin in wild type animals.

We and others reported that excess iron inhibits the major hepcidin signaling pathways (BMP/SMAD and IL-6/STAT3) in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charlebois and Pantopoulos, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). To explore the physiological relevance of these findings, wild type mice were subjected to variable degrees of dietary iron loading and then treated with LPS. All iron-loaded mice could further upregulate hepcidin in response to LPS-induced acute inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This is consistent with other relevant findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enculescu et al., 2017</xref>) and apparently contradicts the in vitro data. While experimental iron loading of cultured cells is rapid, dietary iron loading of mice is gradual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daba et al., 2013</xref>) and most of the excess iron is effectively detoxified within ferritin, which is highly induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kent et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, the suppression of hepcidin preceded ferritin induction in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charlebois and Pantopoulos, 2021</xref>), which may explain the discrepancy with the in vivo data.</p><p>The unimpaired inflammatory induction of hepcidin in iron-loaded wild type mice correlated with significant drops in serum iron, but these appeared inversely proportional to the degree of systemic iron loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, LPS-treated mice on 5 weeks of HID developed relative hypoferremia but could not further reduce serum iron below the baseline of untreated mice on control diet. This can be attributed to mechanisms antagonizing hepcidin action. To explore how iron modulates the capacity of hepcidin to trigger inflammatory hypoferremia, we established conditions of iron overload using wild type and <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with extreme differences in hepcidin expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> demonstrate that iron overload prevents effective inflammatory hypoferremia independently of hepcidin and tissue ferroportin levels.</p><p>We used a~200-fold excess of synthetic hepcidin to directly assess its capacity to divert iron traffic in iron-loaded mice. Hepcidin injection caused hypoferremia in wild type mice on control diet and significantly reduced serum iron in wild type mice on HID and <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on control diet, but not below baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, synthetic hepcidin failed to drastically drop serum iron levels in iron overload models with either high or low endogenous hepcidin. Importantly, synthetic hepcidin promoted robust hypoferremia in relatively iron-depleted <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on IDD, with undetectable endogenous hepcidin. It should be noted that synthetic hepcidin had similar effects on tissue ferroportin among wild type or <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, regardless of iron diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It reduced the intensity of the ferroportin signal in Kupffer cells and splenic macrophages of wild type mice without significantly affecting biochemically detectable total protein levels. In addition, it dramatically reduced the total ferroportin in the liver and spleen of <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. However, in all experimental settings, there was residual tissue ferroportin, which appears to be functionally significant.</p><p>We reasoned that at steady-state, tissue ferroportin may consist of fractions of newly synthesized protein and protein that is en route to hepcidin-mediated degradation. Conceivably, the former may exhibit more robust iron export activity, at least before its iron channel gets occluded by hepcidin. Increased de novo synthesis of active ferroportin could explain why synthetic hepcidin cannot drastically drop serum iron levels under iron overload. In fact, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> demonstrates that dietary iron overload augments <italic>Slc40a1(+IRE</italic>) mRNA translation in the liver of wild type mice. Conversely, relative dietary iron depletion inhibits <italic>Slc40a1(+IRE</italic>) mRNA translation in the liver of <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, in line with the restoration of hepcidin-mediated hypoferremic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Our data are consistent with translational control of liver ferroportin expression via the IRE/IRP system and do not exclude the possibility for an additional contribution of iron-dependent transcriptional regulation of <italic>Slc40a1(+IRE</italic>) mRNA. Direct evidence for activation of IRP responses in the liver and spleen to dietary iron manipulations is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. While translational control of ferritin in tissues is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wilkinson and Pantopoulos, 2014</xref>), regulation of ferroportin by the IRE/IRP system is less well characterized and has hitherto only been documented in cell models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lymboussaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nairz et al., 2015</xref>), the mouse duodenum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galy et al., 2013</xref>), and the rat liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garza et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the physiological relevance of this mechanism remained speculative. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> show that the IRE/IRP system is operational and controls <italic>Slc40a1(+IRE</italic>) mRNA translation in both fractions of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal liver cells. Presumably, this offers a compensatory mechanism to protect the cells from iron overload and iron-induced toxicity. On the other hand, this mechanism attenuates hepcidin responsiveness and promotes a state of hepcidin resistance, as higher amounts of hepcidin are required to achieve effective hypoferremia. Because hepcidin has a short plasma half-life, it is reasonable to predict that the use of more potent hepcidin analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katsarou and Pantopoulos, 2018</xref>) will overcome the antagonistic effects of increased ferroportin mRNA translation under iron overload.</p><p>The critical role of de novo ferroportin synthesis in fine-tuning hepcidin-dependent functional outcomes is also highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Thus, synthetic hepcidin was highly effective as a promoter of hypoferremia in dietary iron-loaded wild type mice when administered together with LPS. LPS is known to suppress <italic>Slc40a1</italic> mRNA in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ludwiczek et al., 2003</xref>) and mouse tissues, with a nadir in the liver reached at 8 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fillebeen et al., 2018</xref>). The recovery of hepcidin effectiveness in mouse models of iron overload was only possible when <italic>Slc40a1</italic> mRNA was essentially eliminated. Under these conditions, LPS treatment alone was sufficient to decrease serum iron in dietary iron-loaded wild type mice below baseline.</p><p>Tissue iron uptake may be another important determinant of the hypoferremic response to inflammation.

Zip14 is the NTBI transporter accounting for hepatocellular iron overload in hemochromatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenkitkasemwong et al., 2015</xref>) and is upregulated by inflammatory cues in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liuzzi et al., 2005</xref>). DMT1 is dispensable for NTBI uptake by hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang and Knutson, 2013</xref>), and its inflammatory induction might promote iron acquisition by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ludwiczek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wardrop and Richardson, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, considering that the fraction of NTBI represents &lt;2% of total serum iron even in the iron overload models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>), it is implausible that NTBI uptake by Zip14 and/or DMT1 substantially contributes to inflammatory hypoferremia. Lcn2 is an acute phase protein that can sequester intracellular iron bound to catecholate siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>), and is more likely to transport iron to tissues during infection. In any case, synthetic hepcidin did not affect expression of iron transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement Figure 4—figure supplement 3E-H</xref>). This excludes the possibility for a synergistic effect on LPS-induced tissue iron uptake that could promote effective hypoferremia in the iron overload models.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. While the data highlight the importance of translational regulation of liver ferroportin as a determinant of serum iron, they do not accurately dissect the specific role of ferroportin expressed in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells; the latter were not separated from other non-parenchymal cells in biochemical assays. The involvement of the IRE/IRP system has been established indirectly, while the relative contributions of IRP1 and IRP2 in the mechanism are not fully defined. The possible role of iron-dependent transcriptional induction of ferroportin in counterbalancing hepcidin actions requires further clarification. The use of diets with variable iron content may have triggered responses to iron availability independent of hepcidin signaling and Hjv functionality. Finally, the physiological implications of translational regulation of ferroportin in the broader setting of inflammation and/or infection have not been explored.</p><p>In conclusion, our data reveal a crosstalk between the hepcidin pathway and the IRE/IRP system in the liver and spleen for the control of tissue ferroportin and serum iron levels. Furthermore, they suggest that application of hepcidin therapeutics for treatment of iron overload disorders should be combined with iron depletion strategies to mitigate <italic>Slc40a1</italic> mRNA translation and increase hepcidin efficacy. Future work is expected to clarify whether optimizing the hypoferremic response to inflammation under systemic iron overload decreases susceptibility to pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild type C57BL/6J and isogenic <italic>Hjv<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gkouvatsos et al., 2014</xref>) were housed in macrolone cages (up to 5 mice/cage, 12:12 hr light-dark cycle: 7 am–7 pm; 22 ± 1°C, 60 ± 5% humidity).

specific inflammatory stimulus, specifically focused on the role of mechanisms of ferroportin regulation to achieve hypoferremia during inflammation. This work is of interest to the community of researchers interested in the interaction of systemic iron regulation and inflammation and possibly ultimately clinicians managing iron disorders. This work also is of novel significance for translational purposes and could lead to the design of better therapeutics for iron related disorders and/or anemia of chronic inflammation. The current study demonstrates LPS and exogenous hepcidin can synergistically lead to hypoferremia even in iron overload conditions and provides data implicating ferroportin translation in contributing to the fully sequestering iron in cells involved in iron flows to induce hypoferremia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81332.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ginzburg</surname><given-names>Yelena</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04a9tmd77</institution-id><institution>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

The later point is aimed at the lack of a mechanistic understanding behind increased FPN synthesis.

While iron overload has previously been shown to prevent effective hypoferremic response to inflammation, the mechanisms thereof are incompletely understood. The current work presents a compelling story of the important finding that inflammation induced hepcidin expression can be made more efficient in inducing hypoferremia by coupling it with iron restriction or exogenous hepcidin. Furthermore, there is an interesting clue that ferroportin can be translationally regulated by LPS to enhance iron egress and prevent robust hypoferremia. However, the authors do not reconcile how this work can be implemented, whether manipulating the nuanced distribution of iron (without decreasing iron overload systemically) has significance, or whether this better understanding is important for management of infection in iron overloaded patients. Furthermore, a substantive part of the presented data is not central to the main story, and in some cases, the conclusions are overstated. In addition, a more robust evaluation of signaling pathways in the liver in response to LPS is missing and important. Finally, it is not clear whether hypoferremia would be expected to decrease susceptibility to pathogens.</p><p>Charlebois et al. present a well written manuscript focused on exploring the mechanism underlying coregulation of hepcidin by iron and inflammation.

In addition, a more robust evaluation of signaling pathways in the liver in response to LPS is missing and important. Finally, it is not clear whether hypoferremia would be expected to decrease susceptibility to pathogens. Some additional questions and clarifications are delineated below.</p><p>1) The authors consider hypoferremia to be serum iron below that of WT untreated mice on standard iron diet. This is not well explained. Why was this definition selected? In some cases, a statistically significant decrease in serum iron in response to an intervention was not meaningful as per the authors unless it resulted in hypoferremia to a certain degree (e.g. Figure 2a-2b). However, this is an unrealistic expectation that in iron loaded conditions that the same dose of LPS or hepcidin mimetic would lead to a proportionally larger decrease in iron than if the starting ferremia was much lower at baseline. This requires some explanation and corroboration.</p><p>2) Serum hepcidin is induced in LPS treated iron loaded mice in Figure 1 but increased hepcidin did not prevent iron overload. The authors interpret this as a decrease in hepcidin responsiveness. However, it would be useful to evaluate the signaling to hepcidin regulation, namely SMAD1/5/8, STAT3, and MEK/ERK1/2.</p><p>3) It is somewhat unclear why the authors are comparing WT iron loaded mice with Hjv ko mice and Hjv ko on an iron deficient diet. The effects in vivo of these composite changes make for inadequate comparisons. Please clarify in the introduction to preemptively elucidate why this is a sound comparison.</p><p>4) The authors overstate the statistics (e.g. page 5, like 93: &quot;slightly elevated&quot; where there is no statistically significant changes) or call things &quot;borderline&quot; when they are not. Please edit throughout to make clear that differences that are not significant are unlikely to be &quot;truly&quot; different one from the other. The only way to make this argument is to increase the number of mice in the repeated analysis. For example, using qualifiers like &quot;profoundly&quot; suppressed (page 7, line 133) or &quot;modestly&quot; affected (page 7, line 134) is subjective when the statistics drive the argument making the &quot;modest&quot; effect without significant difference an overinterpretation of the results. Similarly, page 7, line 147 suggesting splenic FPN suppression &quot;in all animals&quot; when only HJV ko on SD is statistically significant is misleading.</p><p>5) The authors spend a substantial amount of time recapitulating the already known elements regarding Hjv ko mice relative to WT and the effects of synthetic hepcidin. This focus detracts from the main points and all data that is not relevant to the main point should be moved to the supplementary material sections. This mainly pertains to Figure 1, 2, and 4.</p><p>6) The most interesting and novel part of the manuscript is the effects on FPN translation in the setting of LPS treatment. In addition, the effect of LPS on expression of iron transporters and sensors is additionally novel and under-developed. Is there a precedent for this? Please expand in the Discussion section. The manuscript as a whole would benefit from refocusing effort toward the data in Figure 6 and 7.</p><p>7) The authors claim that the results in WB in Figure 3 and 5 are a result of hepatocyte FPN expression despite using liver homogenates for these analyses while simultaneously suggesting the FPN signal in IHC is strongest in Kupffer cells in the liver. This can be resolved by analyzing the 2 populations separately using well-established liver digestion techniques. Otherwise, the first few sentences on page 7 are difficult to interpret objectively.</p><p>8) Page 8, line 171, there is mention that synthetic hepcidin did not promote inflammation but no direct evidence of this is provided. Please add expression and signaling data for inflammatory endpoints in the liver.</p><p>9) The main argument appears obvious, that the higher the iron load in the system, the more hepcidin is needed to induce hypoferremia due to the additional compensatory mechanisms that protect cells from iron toxicity. This should be made very clear in the abstract, introduction, and discussion.</p><p>10) Figure 6 is interesting and novel. However, the polysome data is significant only for WT vs. Hjv ko which is likely multifactorial, not singularly the result of dietary iron loading as the authors suggest (page 10, line 207). Having a WT IDD control would be helpful here. In addition, the generalization that Hjv ko represents all forms of iron overload is an overstatement.</p><p>11) Unclear in Figure 6B and 6C how the specific statistical comparison is important. Is it noted because it is the only observed difference between groups in this experiment or does it have specific importance? Please clarify?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The value of this study is the investigation of the relative role of iron overload and inflammation in the regulation of iron intake and iron distribution. In particular, the Authors investigated if and how inflammation can lead to hypoferremia in presence of iron overload. They analyze the expression of the proteins hepcidin and ferroportin in normal and HJV-KO animals (which are iron overloaded) in presence of administration of LPS, which triggers inflammation and increased expression of hepcidin. They showed that ferroportin is expressed at high levels under condition of iron overload and that administration of synthetic hepcidin is insufficient to trigger hypoferremia in iron-loaded animals. Hypoferremia was eventually achieved when LPS and synthetic hepcidin were administered concurrently. This can lead to design better therapeutics for iron related disorders.</p><p>The paper is well written and clear. The primary claims of the Authors are supported by their data, although some additional experiment are required to complete these studies.</p><p>Figure 7: The treatment with synthetic hepcidin (SH) is done only for one day. Although only the combination of LPS and SH shows a reduction in serum iron, long term affects were not evaluated. I think that a complete analysis of this approach should include longer studies to assess the effect on iron organ concentration comparing SH or LPS alone and the combination of the two reagents. Also, Figure 7 is not showing the effect of the various parameters using SH alone. (this data is somehow presented in figure 4, but it would be better compared the same animals side by side). I suspect that SH alone, in the long term, may also be sufficient to induce hypoferremia and reduce iron overload. Targeting ferroportin + SH is likely to induce hypoferremia and reduce iron overload faster than administration of SH alone.</p><p>In absence of appropriate mouse models, can the authors show, in a cellular model, that cells harboring the ferroportin gene in absence of the IRE sequence are less sensitive to export iron following iron administration, in presence or absence of SH?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The ability of animals to lower their extracellular iron concentration in response to inflammatory stimuli (hypoferremia of inflammation) is an important innate immune response that has been shown to mediate resistance to certain bacterial infections. Early studies of the molecular mechanism of hypoferremia noted that even mild iron overload, caused by excessive iron content of the common mouse diet, interfered with this response.

While iron overload has previously been shown to prevent effective hypoferremic response to inflammation, the mechanisms thereof are incompletely understood. The current work presents a compelling story of the important finding that inflammation induced hepcidin expression can be made more efficient in inducing hypoferremia by coupling it with iron restriction. Furthermore, there is new data demonstrating that iron counteracts the effects of induced hepcidin on post-translation ferroportin regulation by stabilizing Fpn(IRE+) mRNA to enhance its translation, thus enhancing iron egress and preventing robust hypoferremia in response to inflammation. The authors have added significant amounts of data and reorganized the manuscript to increase readability and support their conclusions. Some additional queries and clarifications remain.</p><p>1) Page 7, line 133-139, this paragraph appears out of place. It would be useful to understand why these analyses were done and the meaning of the results. For example, it appears that the authors intended &quot;to evaluate compensatory effects on iron trafficking genes in response to LPS.&quot; Such a statement could be added to explain why these genes specifically were analyzed and what the results indicate at the end of this paragraph. Also, it is unclear why the authors are specifying Fpn(IRE+) here. Is the Fpn(IRE-) result not the same in response to LPS? These results should be presented all together. Please edit.</p><p>2) It would be much easier to read if the data comparing wt and Hjv-/- mice was presented separately from the data on LPS response. Again, much of the results on wt vs. Hjv-/- mice is already well established in the literature; as a consequence, only select comparisons are needed to support the specific points in LPS treated mice. Please consider moving all the wt vs Hjv-/- data to the supplement.</p><p>3) Page 8, line 157, &quot;modestly affect it in wt mice (Figure 2B)&quot; is stated while there is no statistically significant difference reported on the figure itself. Please edit.</p><p>4) Page 9, line 193-194, the authors report that synthetic hepcidin administration suppresses endogenous Hamp expression in the liver as a consequence of suppressed Tfr2(Figure 3G). However, it is not clear what the underlying mechanism would be. If it were just hypoferremia, Tfr2 concentration would be altered between SD and HID in wt mice and between wt and Hjv-/- mice and no such difference occurs. This is conjecture and not central to the major theme of this manuscript. Consider removing or moving to the supplement.</p><p>5) Figure 5A-5D require quantification as the loading controls are not homogeneous in most gels. Please edit to statistically corroborate claims. Also, high exposure gels do not add anything additional relative to low exposure gels. Please remove. In addition, there is still a problem with the non-parenchymal cells containing Kupffer cells as well as other cells and the claims should therefore be tempered as the findings are not specific for Kupffer cells. Finally, please add statistics to Figure 5E panel.</p><p>6) Figure 6A is unclear. What do the authors mean about shift from monosome to polysome? Where is that evident? May be better to break this single panel with many images into individual panels. This is very difficult to interpret as it is and the figure legend is consistently cumbersome, not providing sufficient clarity to enable effective interpretation of the details. The big picture message is that FPN(IRE+) is as expected modulated by iron status in the liver and thus would be expected to counteract hepcidin action on FPN in iron loading. However, as in Figure 5, the concept of whether the effect is in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, or other non-parenchymal cells is not clarified. Please comment and provide additional study limitations on this point in the Discussion section.</p><p>7) What is the proportion of FPN(IRE+) vs FPN(IRE-) in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells? Has this previously been published? FPN(IRE+) in liver is more abundant that FPN(IRE-) but do we know if that is a consequence of changing the fraction of cell types in the liver? Is iron loading responsible for increasing the fraction of cells that express FPN(IRE+) or the amount of FPN(IRE+) expression per cell?</p><p>8) Figure 7 indicates that additional hepcidin can overcome the protective effect of iron overload to offset the effect presumably via an IRE-mediated increase in FPN. However, this is obvious and anticipated and provides only a correlation and not direct evidence supporting the IRE-mediated FPN compensation in inflammation hypothesis. This is also important to note in the discussion as a limitation of the study.</p><p>9) Second paragraph of the discussion (page14, line 304) and also later (page 16, line 342) continue to provide the expectation that hypoferremia is a binary phenomena. However, iron loaded mice also had a relative hypoferremia. This is important as there is no expectation that a higher starting point would be expected to reach the same nadir; this would require that the sensitivity/potency of the regulation was increased. This is not realistic. I would again urge the authors to more clearly define hypoferremia as a relative not absolute threshold concept and edit the discussion in line with this expectation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the study could be potentially impactful, and the authors provided a large amount of data, but I found it difficult to follow as the questions were not clearly laid out, and it was not always clear what questions the experiments were trying to address.

In addition, a more robust evaluation of signaling pathways in the liver in response to LPS is missing and important. Finally, it is not clear whether hypoferremia would be expected to decrease susceptibility to pathogens. Some additional questions and clarifications are delineated below.</p><p>1) The authors consider hypoferremia to be serum iron below that of WT untreated mice on standard iron diet. This is not well explained. Why was this definition selected? In some cases, a statistically significant decrease in serum iron in response to an intervention was not meaningful as per the authors unless it resulted in hypoferremia to a certain degree (e.g. Figure 2a-2b). However, this is an unrealistic expectation that in iron loaded conditions that the same dose of LPS or hepcidin mimetic would lead to a proportionally larger decrease in iron than if the starting ferremia was much lower at baseline. This requires some explanation and corroboration.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reduced the use of the term “hypoferremia” as “serum iron below that of wt untreated mice on standard diet” and replaced it with other terms, such as “…decrease serum iron” (p. 5), “drop in serum iron” (p. 8 and p. 15). The term “lack of hypoferremic response” has also been replaced with “relatively high circulating iron levels” (p. 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Serum hepcidin is induced in LPS treated iron loaded mice in Figure 1 but increased hepcidin did not prevent iron overload. The authors interpret this as a decrease in hepcidin responsiveness. However, it would be useful to evaluate the signaling to hepcidin regulation, namely SMAD1/5/8, STAT3, and MEK/ERK1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have measured markers of BMP/SMAD and IL-6/STAT3 signaling, the major hepcidin-inducing pathways, under all experimental settings. The new data are shown in Figures 1H-I and S6B-C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is somewhat unclear why the authors are comparing WT iron loaded mice with Hjv ko mice and Hjv ko on an iron deficient diet. The effects in vivo of these composite changes make for inadequate comparisons. Please clarify in the introduction to preemptively elucidate why this is a sound comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>On p. 6 we added a sentence stating that these dietary manipulations aimed “to achieve a broad spectrum of hepcidin regulation”. In fact, wt mice on high-iron diet and Hjv-/- mice of iron-deficient diet exhibit dramatic differences in hepcidin expression and have comparable liver iron load.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors overstate the statistics (e.g. page 5, like 93: &quot;slightly elevated&quot; where there is no statistically significant changes) or call things &quot;borderline&quot; when they are not. Please edit throughout to make clear that differences that are not significant are unlikely to be &quot;truly&quot; different one from the other. The only way to make this argument is to increase the number of mice in the repeated analysis. For example, using qualifiers like &quot;profoundly&quot; suppressed (page 7, line 133) or &quot;modestly&quot; affected (page 7, line 134) is subjective when the statistics drive the argument making the &quot;modest&quot; effect without significant difference an overinterpretation of the results. Similarly, page 7, line 147 suggesting splenic FPN suppression &quot;in all animals&quot; when only HJV ko on SD is statistically significant is misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified extensively the manuscript and adhered to these suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors spend a substantial amount of time recapitulating the already known elements regarding Hjv ko mice relative to WT and the effects of synthetic hepcidin. This focus detracts from the main points and all data that is not relevant to the main point should be moved to the supplementary material sections. This mainly pertains to Figure 1, 2, and 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved old Figure 1 and parts of old Figures 2 and 4 to the supplementary material section (Figures S1, S2, S6A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The most interesting and novel part of the manuscript is the effects on FPN translation in the setting of LPS treatment. In addition, the effect of LPS on expression of iron transporters and sensors is additionally novel and under-developed. Is there a precedent for this? Please expand in the Discussion section. The manuscript as a whole would benefit from refocusing effort toward the data in Figure 6 and 7.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new experiments to address the role of the IRE/IRP system in translational regulation of ferroportin. The data are shown in new Figure 5 and discussed. The responses of some iron transporters to LPS are known. This is explained in the Discussion section and appropriate references are provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors claim that the results in WB in Figure 3 and 5 are a result of hepatocyte FPN expression despite using liver homogenates for these analyses while simultaneously suggesting the FPN signal in IHC is strongest in Kupffer cells in the liver. This can be resolved by analyzing the 2 populations separately using well-established liver digestion techniques. Otherwise, the first few sentences on page 7 are difficult to interpret objectively.</p></disp-quote><p>The proposed experiment has been performed and the data are shown in new Figure 5E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Page 8, line 171, there is mention that synthetic hepcidin did not promote inflammation but no direct evidence of this is provided. Please add expression and signaling data for inflammatory endpoints in the liver.</p></disp-quote><p>The proposed experiment has been performed and the data are shown in new Figure S6B. Since Zip14 and Lcn2 are also inflammatory markers, the data in Figure SF-G provide additional support.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The main argument appears obvious, that the higher the iron load in the system, the more hepcidin is needed to induce hypoferremia due to the additional compensatory mechanisms that protect cells from iron toxicity. This should be made very clear in the abstract, introduction, and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this view and have changed the text accordingly, as requested (see for instance p. 4 and p. 16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 6 is interesting and novel. However, the polysome data is significant only for WT vs. Hjv ko which is likely multifactorial, not singularly the result of dietary iron loading as the authors suggest (page 10, line 207). Having a WT IDD control would be helpful here. In addition, the generalization that Hjv ko represents all forms of iron overload is an overstatement.</p></disp-quote><p>The IRE-binding experiments shown in new Figure 5 provide a framework to interpret the polysome profile data in Figure 6 We agree that statistical significance is not reached in the shift of Fpn mRNA to polysomes in wt mice fed a high iron diet; however, the trend is clear. We have performed 3 biological replicates of this technically challenging and laborious experiment and with the additional support of the IRE-binding experiments, we are confident that all results in Figure 6 are biologically significant. We have rephrased the text to avoid the generalization that Hjv ko represents all forms of iron overload.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Unclear in Figure 6B and 6C how the specific statistical comparison is important. Is it noted because it is the only observed difference between groups in this experiment or does it have specific importance? Please clarify?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, the way the statistical analysis was presented was confusing and did not have any specific importance. This is fixed in the new Figure 6B and 6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The value of this study is the investigation of the relative role of iron overload and inflammation in the regulation of iron intake and iron distribution. In particular, the Authors investigated if and how inflammation can lead to hypoferremia in presence of iron overload. They analyze the expression of the proteins hepcidin and ferroportin in normal and HJV-KO animals (which are iron overloaded) in presence of administration of LPS, which triggers inflammation and increased expression of hepcidin. They showed that ferroportin is expressed at high levels under condition of iron overload and that administration of synthetic hepcidin is insufficient to trigger hypoferremia in iron-loaded animals. Hypoferremia was eventually achieved when LPS and synthetic hepcidin were administered concurrently. This can lead to design better therapeutics for iron related disorders.</p><p>The paper is well written and clear. The primary claims of the Authors are supported by their data, although some additional experiment are required to complete these studies.</p><p>Figure 7: The treatment with synthetic hepcidin (SH) is done only for one day. Although only the combination of LPS and SH shows a reduction in serum iron, long term affects were not evaluated. I think that a complete analysis of this approach should include longer studies to assess the effect on iron organ concentration comparing SH or LPS alone and the combination of the two reagents.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the fact that treatments with synthetic hepcidin were done only for one day is a potential limitation. The suggestion to perform long-term treatments is excellent; however, the cost for these experiments is not permissive. Moreover, the plasma half-life of hepcidin is known to be short, and this notion has sparked the development of more potent hepcidin mimetics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, Figure 7 is not showing the effect of the various parameters using SH alone. (this data is somehow presented in figure 4, but it would be better compared the same animals side by side).</p></disp-quote><p>We have generated and embedded here an alternative Figure 7 that includes the hepcidin data shown in new Figure 3 (old Figure 4). If the reviewer feels that this is more informative, we will replace the current Figure 7 with the alternative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I suspect that SH alone, in the long term, may also be sufficient to induce hypoferremia and reduce iron overload. Targeting ferroportin + SH is likely to induce hypoferremia and reduce iron overload faster than administration of SH alone.</p></disp-quote><p>A stable hepcidin analogue would be an excellent tool to address the issue raised by the reviewer. In fact, in preliminary experiments we found that high doses a potent hepcidin mimetic drug can trigger effective hypoferremia in iron-loaded mice. Unfortunately, we cannot include these data here because they are not complete, and we have not received clearance yet. They will be part of a separate ongoing study. Nevertheless, we added in the Discussion the following sentence: “…it is reasonable to predict that the use of more potent hepcidin analogs will overcome the antagonistic effects of increased ferroportin mRNA translation under iron overload”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In absence of appropriate mouse models, can the authors show, in a cellular model, that cells harboring the ferroportin gene in absence of the IRE sequence are less sensitive to export iron following iron administration, in presence or absence of SH?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion that requires the generation of cell lines stably transfected with ferroportin with and without IRE. Because this approach would be time consuming and moreover, may have limited physiological relevance, we opted to focus on determining the IRP responses to dietary iron manipulations in the whole liver and spleen, as well as in isolated hepatocytes and liver non-parenchymal cells (new Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The ability of animals to lower their extracellular iron concentration in response to inflammatory stimuli (hypoferremia of inflammation) is an important innate immune response that has been shown to mediate resistance to certain bacterial infections.

If it were just hypoferremia, Tfr2 concentration would be altered between SD and HID in wt mice and between wt and Hjv-/- mice and no such difference occurs. This is conjecture and not central to the major theme of this manuscript. Consider removing or moving to the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed these data to the supplement, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5A-5D require quantification as the loading controls are not homogeneous in most gels. Please edit to statistically corroborate claims. Also, high exposure gels do not add anything additional relative to low exposure gels. Please remove. In addition, there is still a problem with the non-parenchymal cells containing Kupffer cells as well as other cells and the claims should therefore be tempered as the findings are not specific for Kupffer cells. Finally, please add statistics to Figure 5E panel.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the data in Figure 6A-6D (new numbering) as suggested; the data are shown in the right panels. We think that showing high exposure gels is necessary to demonstrate induction of IRP2. We have considerable experience with EMSA, as indicated by our technical publication on the topic in JoVE (ref. 27). In this paper (attached at the end of this rebuttal letter), we analyzed liver and spleen extracts from wt, Hjv-/-, Irp1-/- and Irp2-/- mice, and show both short and long exposures of the gels to better visualize IRE/IRP1 and IRE/IRP2 interactions. Regarding the issue with non-parenchymal and Kupffer cells, we agree that some statements should be tempered. As suggested, we did that throughout the manuscript (see p. 4, p. 11 and p. 17). We have now added statistics to Figure 6E panel as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6A is unclear. What do the authors mean about shift from monosome to polysome? Where is that evident? May be better to break this single panel with many images into individual panels. This is very difficult to interpret as it is and the figure legend is consistently cumbersome, not providing sufficient clarity to enable effective interpretation of the details. The big picture message is that FPN(IRE+) is as expected modulated by iron status in the liver and thus would be expected to counteract hepcidin action on FPN in iron loading. However, as in Figure 5, the concept of whether the effect is in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, or other non-parenchymal cells is not clarified. Please comment and provide additional study limitations on this point in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 7A (new numbering) by breaking the single panel as suggested. In addition, we revised the Figure legend, to make the description clear. Polysome profiling is a standard technique in the mRNA translation field. The shift from monosomes to polysomes is indicated in the graphs and quantified in the right panels. We agree that the relative contribution of hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and other non-parenchymal cells has not been fully clarified. As suggested, we comment on that in a new paragraph in the Discussion, highlighting limitations of the study (p. 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What is the proportion of FPN(IRE+) vs FPN(IRE-) in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells? Has this previously been published? FPN(IRE+) in liver is more abundant that FPN(IRE-) but do we know if that is a consequence of changing the fraction of cell types in the liver? Is iron loading responsible for increasing the fraction of cells that express FPN(IRE+) or the amount of FPN(IRE+) expression per cell?</p></disp-quote><p>The proportion of Fpn(+IRE) and Fpn(-IRE) has not been analyzed in freshly isolated hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. However, it has been analyzed in whole liver, as well as in hepatoma and macrophage cell lines. In all these settings, Fpn(+IRE) was shown to be predominant (ref. 21); we have indicated this on p. 12. It appears that Fpn(-IRE) is only enriched in intestinal epithelial cells (ref. 21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 7 indicates that additional hepcidin can overcome the protective effect of iron overload to offset the effect presumably via an IRE-mediated increase in FPN. However, this is obvious and anticipated and provides only a correlation and not direct evidence supporting the IRE-mediated FPN compensation in inflammation hypothesis. This is also important to note in the discussion as a limitation of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We comment on this in the new Discussion section highlighting limitations of the study (p. 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Second paragraph of the discussion (page14, line 304) and also later (page 16, line 342) continue to provide the expectation that hypoferremia is a binary phenomena. However, iron loaded mice also had a relative hypoferremia. This is important as there is no expectation that a higher starting point would be expected to reach the same nadir; this would require that the sensitivity/potency of the regulation was increased. This is not realistic. I would again urge the authors to more clearly define hypoferremia as a relative not absolute threshold concept and edit the discussion in line with this expectation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the sentences as suggested.
