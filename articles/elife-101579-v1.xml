Micronucleus (MN) formation is a frequent outcome of genome instability, triggers extensive changes in genome structure and signaling coincident with MN rupture, and is almost exclusively defined by visual analysis. Automated MN detection in microscopy images has proved challenging, limiting discovery of the mechanisms and consequences of MN. In this study we describe two new MN segmentation modules: a rapid model for classifying micronucleated cells and their rupture status (VCS MN), and a robust model for accurate MN segmentation (MNFinder) from a broad range of cell lines. As proof-of-concept, we define the transcriptome of non-transformed human cells with intact or ruptured MN after chromosome missegregation by combining VCS MN with photoactivation-based cell isolation and RNASeq. Surprisingly, we find that neither MN formation nor rupture triggers a strong unique transcriptional response. Instead, transcriptional changes appear correlated with small increases in aneuploidy in these cell classes. Our MN segmentation modules overcome a significant challenge with reproducible MN quantification, and, joined with visual cell sorting, enable the application of powerful functional genomics assays to a wide-range of questions in MN biology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Healthy cells house most of their genetic information, such as their chromosomes, within a dedicated compartment known as the nucleus. Micronuclei, on the other hand, are small cellular compartments which contain pieces of DNA left behind after improper cell divisions or other abnormal events. Detectable under the microscope, their presence is usually interpreted as a sign of aging, disease or negative perturbations such as exposure to toxic chemicals.</p><p>However, new research suggests that micronuclei could also be directly harmful. When they rupture – which they almost always do – the sudden presence of unprotected genetic information in the ‘incorrect’ part of the cell could trigger dangerous cascades of events. To better understand these processes, researchers need to be able to quickly identify and isolate micronuclei-carrying cells within a large population, but such techniques are currently lacking.</p><p>DiPeso et al. aimed to address this gap by developing an AI tool, MNFinder, which can analyse images of live cells and automatically identify micronuclei. This allowed the team to mark and isolate cells in which these compartments were either absent, present, or had ruptured. Further experiments showed that, unexpectedly, patterns of gene expression did not differ between these different groups of cells. This suggests that the cell cannot ‘see’ that it has too many nuclei, or sense when its own DNA is in the wrong place. The disease-associated changes caused by the rupturing of micronuclei may therefore only emerge later, when the cell next divides. At this point, the DNA is heavily damaged and can activate immune checkpoint pathways, which can generate cancer-driving mutations and cellular self-destruct signals.</p><p>By developing and making MNFinder freely available, DiPeso et al. hope that micronuclei will be easier to study for scientists in a wide range of fields. Interestingly, micronuclei occur frequently during early human embryo development and may affect fertility, highlighting another research area that could benefit from these tools. As with all image analysis programs, however, increased usage, data, and model training will expand the use and ease of applying these tools to critical questions in human health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>micronuclei</kwd><kwd>neural net</kwd><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>nuclear envelope</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM124766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiPeso</surname><given-names>Lucian</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Heather Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Hatch</surname><given-names>Emily M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RM1HG010461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pendyala</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name><name><surname>Fowler</surname><given-names>Douglas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA009657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiPeso</surname><given-names>Lucian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatch</surname><given-names>Emily M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA015704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiPeso</surname><given-names>Lucian</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Heather Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Hatch</surname><given-names>Emily M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The development of an automated micronucleus segmentation program enables population-level comparisons between cells with and without micronuclei and defines a highly limited response to micronucleus formation or rupture.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent advances in automated image analysis have led to the development of high-throughput platforms to isolate specific cell classes and match visual phenotypes to specific genetic and expression profiles. These platforms bring the power of population-based analyses and pooled genetic screening to a large range of phenotypes that are defined solely by visual changes in subcellular features. One such feature are micronuclei (MN), nuclear compartments containing a few chromosomes or chromatin fragments that result from mitotic segregation errors or DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bona and Bakhoum, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). Increased MN frequency is a hallmark of carcinogen exposure, cancer development, and aging, and MN are potent drivers of massive genome structural changes, pro-inflammatory and metastasis signaling, and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakhoum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mackenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mohr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). These processes are linked to MN rupture, which exposes the chromatin to the cytosol for the duration of interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatch et al., 2013</xref>), and may contribute to tumorigenesis, metastasis, aging, and immune disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bona and Bakhoum, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Most studies on the biology and consequences of MN formation and rupture take advantage of the fact that MN can be induced with high frequency in cultured cells, for instance by inhibiting the spindle assembly checkpoint kinase Mps1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krupina et al., 2021</xref>). However, these interventions cause diverse additional nuclear and cellular changes, including nuclear atypia, chromatin bridges, aneuploidy, and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flynn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Santaguida et al., 2017</xref>). Sophisticated techniques have been developed to overcome this challenge by identifying micronucleated cells in single cell arrays, inducing missegregation of a single chromosome or chromosome arm without global ploidy changes by CRISPR, and purifying MN from lysed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agustinus et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mohr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Papathanasiou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). These techniques led to new insights into MN functional defects and their mechanisms but have a limited ability to define the cellular consequences of MN formation and rupture. To understand these consequences across biologically relevant contexts, what is needed is a method that can identify and isolate all micronucleated cells from a mixed population in a broad range of cell types and conditions.</p><p>Automated detection of MN using conventional image analysis methods is challenging due to the diversity of MN sizes, their morphological similarity to frequently co-occurring nuclear features, including nuclear blebs and chromatin bridges, and their proximity to nuclei. Machine learning methods, specifically deep neural nets, are a powerful approach to discriminate cellular organelles and were used to develop programs to identify nuclei, mitochondria, and spindle poles with high fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caicedo et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we apply neural network-based pixel classification to rapidly identify micronucleated cells (VCS MN) or pixel and instance classification to segment MN with high sensitivity across multiple cell types and imaging conditions (MNFinder). We demonstrate the utility of these analyses for understanding the consequences of micronucleation by combining VCS MN with a phenotype-based cell isolation method, called Visual Cell Sorting (VCS), to define the transcriptomic profile by RNAseq of hTERT-RPE1 cells that have none, intact, or ruptured MN after induced chromosome instability. During visual cell sorting, live single cells expressing nuclear-localized Dendra2 are photoconverted on-demand based on the results of the VCS MN classifier. Specific cell classes are then isolated by FACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasle et al., 2020</xref>). We show that we can recapitulate an established aneuploidy signature using this method and find that neither micronucleation nor rupture is sufficient to induce significant transcriptional changes. We anticipate that visual cell sorting will be critical to address fundamental questions about how MN contribute to cancer development and enable new high-throughput screens for MN stability and survivability regulators. In addition, we expect MNFinder to have a broad utility for experimenters requiring accurate quantification of MN frequency and characteristics in cultured cells, including those in cancer research, nucleus biology, and virology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development and training of VCS MN to rapidly classify micronucleated cells by fluorescence imaging</title><p>To isolate live micronucleated cells from a mixed population by visual cell sorting, we developed an automated pipeline to rapidly identify nuclei associated with one or more MN. For these studies, we focused on hTERT RPE-1 (RPE1) cells, a near-diploid, non-transformed human cell line that has been extensively used to study chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy, and micronucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kneissig et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mammel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Santaguida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). We co-expressed a fluorescent chromatin marker (H2B-emiRFP703) to identify nuclei and MN with 3xDendra2-NLS (nuclear localization signal) to identify ruptured MN and photoactivate selected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matlashov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We refer to this cell line as RFP703/Dendra. In the absence of mitotic perturbations, RPE1 cells have a very low frequency of MN and nuclear atypia, including blebs and chromatin bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Addition of an Mps1 kinase inhibitor (Mps1i), which blocks the spindle checkpoint and accelerates the metaphase-anaphase transition, induces a high level of whole chromosome missegregation and micronucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garribba et al., 2023</xref>). In RFP703/Dendra cells, Mps1i incubation for 24 hr increased MN frequency from 3% to ~50% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Mps1i also increased the frequency of misshapen nuclei and chromatin bridges, but to substantially lower levels than MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), and only misshapen nuclei were slightly enriched in the MN +population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Most MN +nuclei had only one associated MN and these MN were most likely to contain a single chromosome, consistent with previous analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d–e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garribba et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, the major effect of short-term Mps1 inhibition on nuclear morphology in RPE1 cells was increased micronucleation, specifically micronucleation of single chromosomes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>VCS MN neural net module identifies micronucleated cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Diagrams of the two constructs transduced into hTERT-RPE1 cells to make the RFP703/Dendra cell line and how the proteins localize in micronucleated (MN+) cells before and after MN rupture.

Therefore, we decided to apply machine learning to overcome current challenges in identifying MN from single-channel fluorescence images. For visual cell sorting, we developed a classifier, VCS MN, based on the widely used U-Net architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ronneberger et al., 2015</xref>) using Torchvision’s pretrained ResNet18 model as its encoder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The goal for its design was to rapidly classify MN-associated nuclei in low resolution images of H2B-emiRFP703 fluorescence for subsequent photoconversion and sorting. A second goal was to capture a large proportion of the cells with small MN close to the nucleus, which represent a highly biologically relevant class of MN that is particularly challenging to segment using classical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mammel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joo et al., 2023</xref>). To generate training data, one hundred images of RFP703/Dendra cells either untreated or incubated for 24 hr in Mps1i were acquired on a widefield microscope at ×20. To facilitate ground truth annotation and match the 96x96 pixel input required for ResNet18, we used the nucleus segmenter Deep Retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caicedo et al., 2019a</xref>) to generate nucleus masks, which were then used to crop each field into smaller images centered around each identified nucleus. MN pixels were then manually annotated on each image crop and labeled as either intact (3xDendra-NLS+) or ruptured (3xDendra-NLS-; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Analysis of the Deep Retina results found that it frequently missed highly lobulated MN, resulting in an image set with a higher mean nuclear solidity than observed for bulk Mps1i treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). In total, approximately 2000 single-nucleus crops were used as training data, with 164 crops held back for validation and a further 177 for testing. Because the ResNet18 model takes a three-channel image as input, nuclear crops were expanded to three-channels by duplicating the H2B-emiRFP703 channel and adding a third channel containing the results of Sobel edge detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><p>The initial output of VCS MN are MN label predictions for each image crop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). To identify nuclei associated with at least one MN, these predictions are converted to masks that are mapped back onto the whole field image. MN objects are then assigned to ‘parent’ nuclear masks by proximity. Nucleus masks associated with at least one MN are labeled as MN +and those associated with no MN are labeled as MN-. MN over 40 pixels (26 µm) away from any nuclear mask (~10% of objects) or within a nucleus mask are discarded as likely false positives signals from cellular debris or inhomogeneity in H2B-emiRFP703 fluorescence.</p><p>The accuracy of assigning all MN to the closest nucleus was quantified using the dim cytoplasmic 3xDendra-NLS signal to define the cell boundaries and ground truth MN-nucleus associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Quantification of correct and incorrect nuclei assignments found that the nearest nucleus mask to the MN was in the same cell 97% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d–e</xref>). Cells in the training and testing datasets were imaged at subconfluent densities varying between 10% and 50% confluency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2f</xref>), which is optimal for single cell photoconversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasle et al., 2020</xref>). In these conditions, MN were on average 3.3 times closer to the nearest nucleus compared to the next nearest one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2g</xref>). However, 10% of nuclei had borders less than 6 µm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2h</xref>), suggesting that proximity could robustly MN-nucleus pairs even at high cell densities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>VCS MN classifier performance</title><p>VCS MN model performance was determined by analyzing the pixel overlap between segmented MN and the ground truth annotations on the test set. A single pixel overlap between the predicted and actual MN masks was sufficient to call an MN as a true positive since any MN signal classified the adjacent nucleus as MN+. We quantified the positive predictive value (PPV, the proportion of true positives, i.e. specificity) and recall (the proportion of MN found by the classifier, i.e. sensitivity) of VCS MN. MN were identified with a recall of 70% and a PPV of 89% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This translated to a recall of 86% and 65%, respectively, for MN- and MN +nuclei, and a PPV 73% and 93% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Together these indicate that the MN +nuclei class is highly specific for micronucleated cells and suggest that some MN +nuclei are misclassified as MN-, likely due to VCS MN missing the MN in the initial pixel classification.</p><p>We next analyzed the source of MN identification errors by VCS MN. Chromatin bridges and nuclear blebs were rarely misidentified as MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Instead, false positives were most often dim and likely out-of-focus objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a–b</xref>) that were misidentified as MN. False negatives were the much larger error class and several features were enriched in missed MN, including low H2B-emiRFP703 fluorescence intensity, very small or very large size, and being either very close or very far away from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a–b</xref>). Consistent with smaller MN being missed, we also observed a small, but statistically significant, reduction in recall for ruptured MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), which compact after rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vietri et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether VCS MN could achieve similar specificity and sensitivity in another cell line, we performed additional training on images of micronucleated cells in other cell types, including U2OS, HeLa, and human fetal fibroblasts (HFF). For testing, U2OS cells expressing H2B-emiRFP703 and 3xDendra2-NLS were treated with Mps1i to induce MN and imaged and annotated as for the RPE1 RFP703/Dendra cells. Analysis of this dataset yielded recall values of 82% and 83% for MN- and MN + cells, respectively, and PPVs of 81% and 83%. MN were identified with a specificity of 88% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In summary, VCS MN can automatically identify micronucleated and non-micronucleated cells with high specificity in low-resolution images from multiple cell lines containing a mix of contaminating objects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MN rupture classification</title><p>To identify nuclei with intact or ruptured MN, we added a step to the VCS MN module to determine whether any MN assigned to a nucleus were ruptured. Ruptured MN were identified based on 3xDendra2-NLS intensity, which is present in intact MN and very dim in ruptured MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and f</xref>). The pipeline measures the maximum Dendra2 green fluorescence intensity in the nucleus and associated MN and MN with a signal less than 0.16 of the nucleus are classified as ‘ruptured’. This threshold correctly classified approximately 90% of MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c</xref>). When appended to the VCS MN classifier, this analysis correctly identified 60% of rupture- nuclei (nuclei associated with only intact MN) and 70% of rupture +nuclei (nuclei with at least 1 ruptured MN) with a PPV near 75% in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). The lower sensitivity for rupture MN- nuclei is likely because nuclei associated with multiple MN are both more likely to be scored correctly as MN +and have at least 1 ruptured MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3d–e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Development of MNFinder for fixed cell MN segmentation</title><p>To determine whether the VCS MN classifier could be broadly used to quantify MN frequency, fluorescence, and morphological characterisitics across different imaging modalities and chromatin labels, we analyzed its performance on RPE1 cells treated with Mps1i, fixed and labeled with DAPI, and imaged at ×40 on a confocal microscope. Although nuclear shape and confluency were similar to that in the training set, VCS MN performed substantially worse on the ×40 images (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and MN masks failed to cover most of the MN area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

The cell instance classifier outputs gradient maps, which are used to define cells through watershed-based post-processing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

A third decoder pathway predicts foreground pixels and is used as input for the first two decoder pathways, an architecture that we found substantially improved training speed and model performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, bottom). To reduce neural net complexity, concatenation operations were replaced with addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2022</xref>) and the foreground/ background decoder pathway foregoes the additional skip connections found in U-Net3 +designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>The outputs from the nucleus/MN and cell classifiers are further processed to improve segmentation and nucleus/MN association accuracy. Masks from the nucleus/MN segmenter are passed to a filter that reclassifies nuclei with an area below 250 px as MN and then expands MN mask boundaries to their calculated convex hull to improve pixel capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). ‘Cell’ masks are derived from the cell instance classifier by first summing the distance and proximity predictions and using the output as seeds for watershed segmentation. To correct for oversegmentation, boundary pixels in these objects are then filtered to retain those that touch either a background pixel or a pixel in the skeletonized proximity map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

Importantly, recall and PPV were largely insensitive to image resolution, DNA label, and cell type. HeLa H2B-GFP ×40 images were an outlier in terms of performance for unclear reasons, but also had the lowest MN frequeny. We calculated the per object mIoU to determine the quality of the segmentation and found that most MN were accurately segmented with mIoU values between 74% and 79% despite the median MN area being only 34 pixels after resizing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Quantification of MN frequency (propotion of cells with at least 1 MN) in images used to evaluate MNFinder.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">RPE-1</th><th align="left" valign="top">U2OS</th><th align="left" valign="top">HeLa</th><th align="left" valign="top">HFF</th><th align="left" valign="top">U2OS (Broad)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.706</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.623</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.286</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.5</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.078</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Analysis of MNFinder model errors found that chromatin bridges and nucleus blebs were rarely misclassified as MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>).

Visual cell sorting takes advantage of recent advances in digital micromirror technology coupled with expression of a convertible fluorophore to label multiple populations of cells with single cell accuracy. By illuminating different classes of cells with different lengths of UV (405 nm) pulses, it can generate up to four distinct proportions of converted Dendra2, which can be sorted by FACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

RPE1 RFP703/Dendra cells were incubated with Mps1i for 24 hr prior to imaging to generate MN and Cdk1i was added 1 hr prior to imaging to prevent mitosis, which dilutes the Dendra2(red) signal and frequently leads to MN + cells becoming MN- daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).

Sorted cells were replated in medium containing Cdk1i, fixed, and MN frequency quantified manually. Comparison of classifier PPV for MN +and MN- cells during activation and MN +and MN- cell frequency after FACs found a strong enrichment for the correct cell type in each group, with the increased purity of MN +classified cells being retained during sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). An increase in MN- cells in the MN +group after sorting is likely due to limitations in sorting efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and cells overcoming the Cdk1i block during sorting, plating, and entering mitosis and either dying or producing MN- daughter cells.</p><p>To determine how MN frequency affects our ability to accurately isolate MN + cells, we estimated sorted population purity of untreated U2OS cells, which we quantified as having 7.8% MN + cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). We combined our previously obtained PPV and recall values with a predicted 95% sorting accuracy. The decreased frequency of MN +nuclei meant that the proportion of false positives appeared larger, which decreased purity of the MN +population compared to Msp1i treated RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>). However, the MN +population had a nearly 7-fold enrichment of MN + cells compared to the starting population, similar to the enrichment of tumor cells in patient biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2021</xref>) that have been the basis of cancer driver identification by transcriptomic and genetic analysis. Thus, our data strongly suggest that visual cell sorting can be combined with the VCS MN classifier to generate cell populations enriched for MN- and MN + cells from a variety of conditions and MN frequencies that are highly suitable for multiple downstream applications, including genetic screening, bulk RNA and proteomic analyses, and single cell sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Validation of visual cell sorting for transcriptome analysis of aneuploid cells</title><p>To validate visual cell sorting for aneuploidy-associated transcriptome analysis, we used RNASeq to define gene expression changes in RPE1 cells after Mps1i incubation and optical isolation.

Although it has been suggested that MN rupture induces rapid upregulation of inflammatory genes via activation of cGAS-STING signaling, initial and subsequent studies have demonstrated that this response does not occur during the first cell cycle and also can occur in RPE1 cells that lack cGAS via a RIG-I dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flynn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mackenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mohr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sato and Hayashi, 2024</xref>).

We demonstrate that our MN segmentation pipeline MNFinder can robustly classify and segment MN across multiple adherent cell types and fluorescent imaging conditions. Further, we demonstrate that a separate MN cell classifier, VCS MN, rapidly and robustly identifies micronucleated cells from low resolution images and can be combined with single-cell photoconversion to accurately isolate live cells with none, intact, or ruptured MN from a mixed population. Using this platform, we find that, unexpectedly, neither micronucleation nor rupture triggers gene expression changes beyond those associated with a slight increase in aneuploidy. Overall, our study brings a powerful high-throughput optical isolation strategy to MN biology that enables new types of investigations and a new module for quantifying MN characteristics in adherent cells that will allow naïve users to rapidly and robustly quantify these compartments.</p><p>Visual cell sorting isolation of micronucleated cells has several advantages over current methods to identify the mechanisms and consequences of MN formation and rupture. First, it can be used on any adherent cell line. This overcomes challenges involved with using lamin B2 overexpression to inhibit MN rupture, which is limited to specific cell lines and MN types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mammel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xia et al., 2019</xref>) and is complicated by additional changes in mitosis and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agustinus et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pujadas Liwag et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, visual cell sorting overcomes cell line and MN content restrictions present in systems that induce missegregation of single chromosomes or chromosome arms by enabling analysis of all missegregation events in any genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shoshani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trivedi et al., 2023</xref>). Unlike live single-cell assays, it is highly scalable and eliminates selection pressures and restrictions added by clonal expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mohr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Papathanasiou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, VCS MN isolation captures whole live cells, overcoming limitations associated with MN purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agustinus et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klaasen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mohr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Papathanasiou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tang et al., 2022</xref>), and permits time-resolved analyses of cellular changes and MN chromatin. Visual cell sorting also has an advantage over other optical isolation methods, including image-enabled cell sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schraivogel et al., 2022</xref>), as it can be adapted to any wide-field microscope by adding a digital micromirror to existing equipment, and can be performed on attached cells, which is critical for accurate MN identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Visual cell sorting of MN and our MN segmentation modules do have limitations. Due to Dendra2 signal decay and ongoing MN rupture, only about 200,000 live cells can be analyzed and targeted per visual cell sorting experiment with VCS MN. For optical pooled screening or analysis of rare cells, this limits the number of genes or depth of analysis that can be achieved. Cell fixation would overcome this issue and efforts to improve cell sorting and sample extraction after fixation are ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kanfer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Visual cell sorting also requires the introduction of at least one photoconvertible or activatable protein to mark the cells and a second fluorescent protein to identify ruptured MN. This limits the channels available for additional phenotype identification. However, recent advances in cell structure prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2023</xref>) may vastly expand the phenotypic information available from limited cell labels. VCS MN and MNFinder precision vary across cell types and widely divergent nuclear morphologies from the training set could impair performance. Additional training of the neural net should improve this metric, as has been the case with other cellular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caicedo et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">von Chamier et al., 2021</xref>), but different algorithm architectures will likely be required to identify MN in signal-rich environments like organoids or tissue samples. In these cases, correct association of MN to their parent nuclei may also require using a cytoplasm or cell surface label to define ground truth MN-nucleus associations and/or developing a new module to perform this task.</p><p>Comparison of our RNASeq analysis of aneuploid RPE1 cells with previously published datasets demonstrates that visual cell sorting is highly suitable for bulk genomic analyses. We observed a large overlap between upregulated pathways in our study, previous analyses of Mps1i-treated RPE1 cells, and aneuploidy more broadly, including inflammation, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Santaguida et al., 2017</xref>). We did observe a globally lower change in gene expression levels compared to previous studies. Although the values are within the variation anticipated for different preparation and sequencing protocols, it could also reflect the exclusion of cells with highly lobulated nuclei from our analysis and suggests that nuclear atypia may be a significant contributor to aneuploidy signaling changes. Additional visual cell sorting experiments using nuclear solidity to define cell populations could be used to accurately quantify this contribution.</p><p>Our analysis of micronucleated cells and cells with ruptured MN found only a handful of genes that were uniquely upregulated after MN rupture and we were unable to validate a contribution of either condition to protein changes in the cell. One potential interpretation of these results is that MN rupture or micronucleation does cause transcriptional changes, but that they are masked by signals from co-occurring events. Although we cannot rule this out, we favor the alternative interpretation that MN formation and rupture do not lead to biologically relevant transcriptional changes for several reasons. The first is that, of potential co-occurring nuclear phenotypes we quantified, only nuclear lobulation was frequently observed in Mps1i treated cells and was only slightly enriched in micronucleated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–c</xref>). Furthermore, this frequency was significantly reduced and MN + cell enrichment was lost when nuclei were classified using VCS MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Thus, nuclear atypia, chromatin bridges, and mitotic DNA damage are unlikely masking other transcriptional signals in our RNAseq results. Second, we were unable to validate protein-level increases of two increasingly upregulated genes in cells with ruptured MN by immunofluorescence, suggesting that any missed DEGs are unlikely to be biologically relevant. Third, we were able to identify small changes in aneuploidy gene upregulation in both MN +and ruptured MN cells, strongly suggesting that our analysis was sensitive to small differences in transcript abundance. In addition, we observed an increase in aneuploidy levels in cells with MN and ruptured MN that correlated with the increase in aneuploidy gene expression. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the most likely explanation is that MN, intact or ruptured, do not induce a meaningful transcriptional signal in the first cell cycle.</p><p>A potential limitation of our current data is that the cell line used, RPE1, has reduced cGAS expression. MN rupture has been proposed to activate cGAS/STING signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakhoum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mackenzie et al., 2017</xref>) and the strong localization of cGAS to ruptured MN led to a widespread model where this activation occurred in the first cell cycle. However, the original studies did not observe upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes until several days after MN rupture, suggesting that cGAS recruitment to MN does not activate it, and now multiple lines of evidence strongly suggest cGAS bound to ruptured MN is incapable of activating STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flynn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mohr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sato and Hayashi, 2024</xref>). Therefore, we expect that VCS analysis of MN-associated gene expression in a highly active cGAS/STING cell line will yield the same results as what we observed in RPE1 cells.</p><p>Visual cell sorting is a highly flexible platform that substantially expands our ability address fundamental questions in MN biology. Visual cell sorting MN isolation can be used for optical pooled screening, an unbiased method that would be ideal to identify mechanisms of MN rupture, and, in combination with dCas9-based chromosome labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maass et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tanenbaum et al., 2014</xref>), to identify mechanisms that enrich specific chromosomes in MN and drive cancer-specific aneuploidies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-David and Amon, 2020</xref>). Techniques to improve retrieval and sorting of formaldehyde-fixed cells would significantly facilitate these analyses by enabling collection of a larger number of cells per experiment and allowing use of slower but more accurate MN segmentation modules, such as MNFinder, to label cell populations.</p><p>A current strength of visual cell sorting with VCS MN is the ability to recover a population of live cells with either none, intact, or ruptured MN. This allows, for the first time, large-scale analyses of post-mitotic genetic and functional changes caused by micronucleation. For instance, aneuploid cells with and without MN could be analyzed for acquisition of disease-associated behaviors, including proliferation and migration, and used in in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis assays to directly assess their contribution to cancer development. In addition, a similar method developed in the Korbel lab shows the power of this technique used to quantify the frequency and extent of genetic changes after chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cosenza et al., 2024</xref>). The ability of visual cell sorting to use nucleus masks generated by any image analysis program means that the user can employ any open-source MN segmentation module to optimize for higher purity for these experiments, or a broader recall to identify rare populations in single-cell experiments. In summary, automated MN segmentation and visual cell sorting are poised to provide critical insights into a wide range of questions about how MN form, rupture, and contribute to disease pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T (transformed, kidney)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-3216, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U2OS (transformed, osteosarcoma)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HTB-96.

Camera binning was set to 2 and single section images were acquired.

Images on the spinning disk microscope were captured using an iXon Ultra 888 EMCCD camera and MetaMorph software (v7.10.4).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Micronucleus segmentation and cell classifiers</title><p><italic>VCS MN:</italic> The neural net was created using the FastAI 1.0 library in Python, a UNet with Torchvision’s ResNet18 pre-trained model as its base architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ronneberger et al., 2015</xref>). Training for MN recognition was performed using ~2000 images of individual cells as training data, a further 164 for validation, and 177 for testing. Training images were of RPE-1 NLS-3xDendra2-P2A-H2B-miRFP703 cells after incubation in 0.5 µM reversine (an Mps1 inhibitor, EMD Millipore) or DMSO for 24 hr and taken with a ×20 widefield objective on the visual cell sorting microscope. Nuclei were segmented on H2B channel images using the Deep Retina segmenter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caicedo et al., 2019a</xref>) and 48x48 px image crops were generated centered on each nucleus. For training, MN pixels in cropped images were manually annotated by an MN expert. MN associated with chromatin bridges were not annotated to ensure that labeled MN were discrete nuclear compartments.</p><p>The VCS MN classifier takes as input a two-channel ×20 image. It applies the Deep Retina segmenter to the H2B channel to segment nuclei, discards any nuclei touching the edge of the image, and generates a 48x48 px crops centered on each nucleus. Each crop is processed with Sobel edge detection and linearly enlarged to 96x96 px. To accommodate the ResNet18 3-channel architecture, each crop is expanded to the H2B channel, a duplicate of the H2B channel, and the results of Sobel edge detection. Identified MN are mapped back to the full image and assigned to the closest segmented nucleus. MN more than 40 px away from a nucleus are discarded.</p><p>Once MN are assigned to nuclei, the classifier calculates the maximum Dendra2 MN/nucleus intensity ratio for each MN. MN with a ratio below 0.16 are classified as ruptured. This threshold was identified using the JRip classifier in Weka 3.8.6 to define the optimal threshold to separate manually annotated intact and ruptured MN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Witten et al., 2017</xref>). Nucleus masks are classified as MN +or MN- based on the presence or absence of at least one associated MN. MN +nuclei are then further classified into those associated with only intact MN (rupture-) or those with at least one ruptured MN (rupture+).</p><p>For analysis of MN recall and PPV, MN ground truth labels were generated using PixelStudio 4.5 on an iPad (Apple) for annotation. Recall was calculated as the proportion of all MN that overlapped with a predicted segment. Positive predictive value was calculated as the proportion of all predicted segments that overlapped with a MN. Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) was calculated per object by quantifying the overlap between groups of true positive pixels and their respective ground truths.</p><p>Prior to analysis of U2OS cells, the VCS MN segmentation module was retrained on a collection of images of RPE1, U2OS, HFF, and HeLa cells that had been incubated in 100 nM BAY1217389 or 0.5 µM reversine for 24 hr to increase MN frequency. Live images of RPE1 and U2OS NLS-3xDendra2/H2B-emiRFP703 cells were acquired on the VCS microscope at ×20. Images of fixed cells were taken on either the LSM or spinning disk confocal microscopes at ×40 after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, #15710) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were labeled with DAPI where indicated. ~2300 crops of U2OS NLS-3xDendra2/H2B-emiRFP703 cells taken on the VCS microscope at ×20 were used for training with another 233 held back for validation and 910 for testing. Three images of Hoechst labeled U2OS cells taken at ×20 on a widefield microscope at 16-bit depth were downloaded from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC039v1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caicedo et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ljosa et al., 2012</xref>) and linearly scaled up by 0.5 for testing. For all images in the training, validation, and testing datasets, Deep Retina segmentation was bypassed by manually annotating the nuclei and generating image crops with a custom python program. These crops and masks were then fed into VCS MN to obtain MN masks and nucleus/MN assignments.</p><p><italic>MNFinder:</italic> The MNFinder neural nets were created using TensorFlow 2.0 without transfer learning. Training was performed on 128x128 px crops generated from widefield images of RFP703/Dendra RPE-1 and U2OS cells of H2B-RFP703 and confocal images of DAPI-labeled MCC13 and HeLa cells after Mps1i incubation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Nuclei and MN pixels were annotated by hand by an MN expert.</p><p>For nucleus/MN segmentation, predictions are taken from two UNet-based neural nets, with MN predictions fed into a third ensembling UNet. All UNets are identical, save for the incorporation of multiscale downsampling into one of the input UNets. For “cell” segmentation (instance segmentation) a UNet architecture incorporating 3 decoder pathways is used to predict distance maps, proximity maps, and foreground pixels. The distance and proximity map decoders incorporate features from a UNet3 +design: specifically, additional skip connections from multiple layers of the encoder and decoder pathways and deep supervision during training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Training data were generated from annotated nuclei and MN images by generating a concave hull grouping a nucleus and associated MN using the cdBoundary package in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duckham et al., 2008</xref>). This hull was transformed into a distance map by calculating the Euclidean distance transform (EDT) with each pixel value encoding the shortest distance between that pixel and the background. Proximity maps were generated by setting all pixels as foreground pixels except for those belonging to other hulls and applying an EDT, masked by the cell’s boundaries, and raising this to the 4th power to sharpen edges. Both maps are scaled from 0 to 1 for each cell.</p><p>MNFinder requires images with an image resolution of 1.55–2.8 px/µm, or nuclei around 30 px in diameter. Images taken at other resolutions need to be linearly scaled to within this range prior to analysis. Both single channel chromatin and multi-channel images can be used as input. MNFinder processing proceeds by first cropping input images using a 128x128 px sliding window, advancing the window by 96 px horizontally and vertically to oversample the image. Crops are then expanded into two-channel images, with the second channel the result of Sobel edge detection. These images are processed by the neural nets, post-processed as described, and reassembled by linear blending into a complete field. Recall and positive predictive values were calculated using the same metrics as for VCS classifier validation.</p><p>MNFinder was validated on images of RPE1, U2OS, HFF, and HeLa cells described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. PPV and recall for MN segmentation were calculated for individual input UNets and the ensemble UNet (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Outline of visual cell sorting cell isolation experiments</title><p>Cells for visual cell sorting were plated onto six-well glass-bottom, black-walled plates (CellVis) at a density of 50,000–225,000 cells per well 1–2 days before activation. An extra unactivated well and a well of non-fluorescent RPE1 cells were plated as controls. One day before imaging, 100 nM Mps1i was added to the medium. One hour prior to imaging, cells were washed 1 x in PBS and medium changed to phenol red free (GIBCO) containing 10 µM RO-3306 (Sigma). The plate was transferred to the microscope, the plate center and micromirror device were aligned, and the appropriate journals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasle et al., 2020</xref>) were initiated for visual cell sorting. Imaging conditions were optimized for each experiment. Images were acquired using MetaMorph and analyzed on a dedicated linked computer. 1-bit masks of MN +nuclei and MN- nuclei were transmitted back to MetaMorph, which directed UV pulses at the segmented nuclei. Activation occurred using either a 200ms or 800ms pulse of the 405 nm laser. Classifier predictions were compared to the first 3 and last 3 images from each VCS experiment, each manually annotated prior to downstream analysis, including RNA extraction.</p><p>Activated and unactivated cells were trypsinized (0.25% Trypsin-EDTA, GIBCO), suspended in 2% FBS in PBS, and sorted using a FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). Compensation for PE-blue excitation of unconverted Dendra2 was performed on the unactivated cells. Dendra2 activation-based sorting gates were defined on single cells positive for both Dendra2 and emiRFP703 using the PE-Blue-A/FITC-A ratio, which was found to be more distinct than the PE-YG/FITC ratios. Cells were sorted into 2% FBS then pelleted and either flash frozen on dry ice or replated onto poly-L-lysine coated coverslips.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>CellTrace</title><p>Activation and sorting accuracy were analyzed for RPE1 RFP703/Dendra2 cells by incubating cells in CellTrace far-red (Thermo Fisher) for 10 min at 37 °C, trypsinizing and pelleting cells, mixing 1:1 with unlabeled cells, and plating. A classifier segmented nuclei with the Deep Retina segmenter on Dendra (green) fluorescence and measured the mean far-red intensity in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasle et al., 2020</xref>).

The authors present two image analysis methods, one robust and another rapid, to identify micronuclei (MN) bearing cells. To analyse their software efficacy, the authors study images of cells treated with MPS1 inhibitor to induce chromosome missegregation. Next, the authors use RNA-seq to assess the outcomes of their MN-identifying methods: they do not observe a transcriptomic signature specific to MN but find changes that correlate with aneuploidy status. Overall, this work offers new tools to identify MN-presenting cells, and it sets the stage with clear benchmarks for further software development.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Currently, there are no robust MN classifiers with a clear quantification of their efficiency across cell lines (mIoU score). The software presented here tries to address this gap. GitHub material (images, ground truth labels, tools, protocols, etc.) provided is a great asset to computational biologists. The method has been tested in more than one cell line. This method can help integrate cell biology and 'omics' data, making it suitable for multimodal studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the classifier outperforms available tools for MN segmentation by providing mIoU, it's not yet at a point where it can be reliably applied to functional genomics assays where we expect a range of phenotypic penetrance in most cell lines (e.g., misshapen, multinucleated, and lagging DNA in addition to micronucleated cells). The discussion considers the nature and proportion of MN in RPE1 cells, and how the classifier is well-suited for RPE1 that predominantly display MN structures. Whether the classifier can rigorously assign MN-presenting cells amidst drastic nuclear aberrancies following a spindle checkpoint loss needs to be tested in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101579.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors develop automated methods to visually identify micronuclei (MN) and MN-containing cells. The authors then use these methods to isolate MN-containing RPE-1 cells post-photoactivation and analyze transcriptional changes in cells with and without micronuclei. The authors find that RPE-1 cells with MN have similar transcriptomic changes as aneuploid cells and that MN rupture does not lead to vast changes in the transcriptome.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors develop a method that allows for automating measurements and analysis of micronuclei. This has been something that the field has been missing for a long time. Using such a method has the potential to greatly enhance the field's ability to analyze micronuclei and understand the downstream consequences. The authors also develop a method to identify cells with micronuclei in real-time, mark them using photoconversion, and then isolate them via cell sorting, which could change the way we isolate and study MN-containing cells, and the scale at which we do it.

In addition, we chose to prioritize inclusion of small MN adjacent to the nucleus in our positive calls. This meant that there were more false positives (lower PPV) than obtained by other methods but allowed us to include this highly biologically relevant class of MN in our MN+ population. Thus, for a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of MN formation and rupture, we recommend using the finder as is. However, for other visual cell sorting applications where a small number of highly pure MN positive and negative cells is preferred, such as clonal outgrowth or metastasis assays, we would recommend using the slower, but more precise, MNFinder to get a higher precision at a cost of temporal resolution. In addition, MNFinder, with its higher flexibility and object coverage, is recommended for all fixed cell analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Micronuclei are aberrant nuclear structures frequently seen following the missegregation of chromosomes. The authors present two image analysis methods, one robust and another rapid, to identify micronuclei (MN) bearing cells. The authors induce chromosome missegregation using an MPS1 inhibitor to check their software outcomes. In missegregation-induced cells, the authors do not distinguish cells that have MN from those that have MN with additional segregation defects. The authors use RNAseq to assess the outcomes of their MN-identifying methods: they do not observe a transcriptomic signature specific to MN but find changes that correlate with aneuploidy status. Overall, this work offers new tools to identify MN-presenting cells, and it sets the stage with clear benchmarks for further software development.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Currently, there are no robust MN classifiers with a clear quantification of their efficiency across cell lines (mIoU score). The software presented here tries to address this gap. GitHub material (tools, protocols, etc) provided is a great asset to naive and experienced computational biologists. The method has been tested in more than one cell line. This method can help integrate cell biology and 'omics' studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the classifier outperforms available tools for MN segmentation by providing mIOU, it's not yet at a point where it can be reliably applied to functional genomics assays where we expect a range of phenotypic penetrance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the MNFinder module has limitations with regards to the degree of nuclear atypia and cell density that can be tolerated. Based on the recall and PPV values and their consistency across the majority conditions analyzed, we believe that MNFinder can provide reliable results for MN frequency, integrity, shape, and label characteristics in a functional genomics assay in many commonly used adherent cell lines. We also added a discussion of caveats for these analyses, including the facts that highly lobulated nuclei will have higher false positive rates and that high cell confluency may require additional markers to ensure highly accurate assignment of MN to nuclei.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Spindle checkpoint loss (e.g., MPS1 inhibition) is expected to cause a variety of nuclear atypia: misshapen, multinucleated, and micronucleated cells. It may be difficult to obtain a pure MN population following MPS1 inhibitor treatment, as many cells are likely to present MN among multinucleated or misshapen nuclear compartments. Given this situation, the transcriptomic impact of MN is unlikely to be retrieved using this experimental design, but this does not negate the significance of the work. The discussion will have to consider the nature, origin, and proportion of MN/rupture-only states - for example, lagging chromatids and unaligned chromosomes can result in different states of micronuclei and also distinct cell fates.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and now quantify the frequency of other nuclear atypias and MN chromosome content in RPE1 cells after 24 h Mps1 inhibition (Fig. S1). In summary, we find only small increases in nuclear atypia, including multinucleate cells, misshapen nuclei, and chromatin bridges, compared to the large increase in MN formation. This contrasts with what is observed when mitosis is delayed using nocodazole or CENPE inhibitors where nuclear atypia is much more frequent. Importantly, after Mps1 inhibition, RPE1 cells with MN were only slightly more likely to have a misshapen nucleus compared to cells without MN (Fig. S1C).</p><p>Interestingly, this analysis showed that the VCS MN pipeline, which uses the Deep Retina segmenter to identify nuclei, has a strong bias against lobulated nuclei and frequently fails to find them (Fig. S2B). Therefore, the cell populations analyzed by RNAseq were largely depleted of highly misshapen nuclei and differences in nuclear atypia frequency between MN+ and MN- cells in the starting population were lost (Fig. S9A, compare to Fig. S1C). This strongly suggests that the transcript changes we observed reflect differences in MN frequency and aneuploidy rather than differences in nuclei morphology.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that MN rupture frequency and formation, and downstream effects on cell proliferation and DNA damage, are sensitive to the source of the missegregated chromatin. In the revised manuscript we make clear that we chose Mps1 inhibition because it is strongly biased towards whole chromosome MN (Fig. S1E), limiting signal from DNA damage products, including chromosome fragments and chromatin bridges. This provides a base line to disambiguate the consequences of micronucleation and DNA damage in more complex chromosome missegregation processes, such as DNA replication disruption and irradiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors develop a method to visually analyze micronuclei using automated methods. The authors then use these methods to isolate MN post-photoactivation and analyze transcriptional changes in cells with and without micronuclei of RPE-1 cells. The authors observe in RPE-1 cells that MN-containing cells show similar transcriptomic changes as aneuploidy, and that MN rupture does not lead to vast changes in the transcriptome.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors develop a method that allows for automating measurements and analysis of micronuclei. This has been something that the field has been missing for a long time. Using such a method has the potential to advance micronuclei biology. The authors also develop a method to identify cells with micronuclei in real time and mark them using photoconversion and then isolate them via FACS. The authors use this method to study the transcriptome. This method is very powerful as it allows for the sorting of a heterogenous population and subsequent analysis with a much higher sample number than could be previously done.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The major weakness of this paper is that the results from the RNA-seq analysis are difficult to interpret as very few changes are found to begin with between cells with MN and cells without. The authors have to use a 1.5-fold cut-off to detect any changes in general. This is most likely due to the sequencing read depth used by the authors. Moreover, there are large variances between replicates in experiments looking at cells with ruptured versus intact micronuclei. This limits our ability to assess if the lack of changes is due to truly not having changes between these populations or experimental limitations. Moreover, the authors use RPE-1 cells which lack cGAS, which may contribute to the lack of changes observed. Thus, it is possible that these results are not consistent with what would occur in primary tissues or just in general in cells with a proficient cGAS/STING pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s assessment of the limitations of our RNA-Seq analysis. After additional analysis, we propose an alternative explanation for the lower expression changes we observe in the MN+ and Mps1 inhibitor RNA-Seq experiments. In summary, we find that VCS MN has a strong bias against highly lobulated nuclei that depletes this class of cells from both the bulk analysis and the micronucleated cell populations (Fig. S9A). Based on this result, we propose that our analysis reduces the contribution of nuclear atypia to these transcriptional changes and that nuclear morphology changes are likely a signaling trigger associated with aneuploidy.</p><p>We believe that this finding strengthens our overall conclusion that MN formation and rupture do not cause transcriptional changes, as suppressing the signaling associated with nuclei atypia should increase sensitivity to changes from the MN. However, we cannot completely rule out that MN formation or rupture cause a broad low-level change in transcription that is obscured by other signals in the dataset.</p><p>As to cGAS signaling, several follow up papers and even the initial studies from the Greenburg lab show that MN rupture does not activate cGAS and does not cause cGAS/STING-dependent signaling in the first cell cycle (see citations and discussion in text). Therefore, we expect the absence of cGAS in RPE1 cells will have no effect in the first cell cycle, but could alter the transcriptional profile after mitosis. Although analysis of RPE1 cGAS+ cells or primary cells in these experiments will be required to definitively address this point, we believe that our interpretation of our RNAseq results is sufficiently backed up by the literature to warrant our conclusion that MN formation and rupture do not induce a transcriptional response in the first cell cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I do not recommend additional experimental or computational work. Instead, I just recommend adapting the claims of the manuscript to what has been done. I am just asking for further clarification and minor rewriting.</p><p>(1) The manuscript is written like a molecular biology paper with sparse explanations of the authors' reasoning, especially in the development of their algorithms. I was often lost as to why they did things in one way or another.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript has thorough explanations and additional data and graphics defining how and why the VCS MN and MNFinder modules were developed. We hope that this clears up many of the questions the reviewer had and appreciate their guidance on making it more readable for scientists from different backgrounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Evaluations of their method are often not fully explained, for example:</p><p>&quot;On average, 75% of nuclei per field were correctly segmented and cropped.&quot;</p><p>&quot;MN segments were then assigned to 'parent' nuclei by proximity, which correctly associated 97% of MN.&quot;</p><p>Were there ground truth images and labels created? How many? For example, I don't know how the authors could even establish a ground-truth for associating MNs to nuclei if MNs happened to be almost equidistant between two nuclei in their images.</p><p>I suggest a separate subsection early in the Results section where the underlying imaging data + labels are presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We added new sections to the text and figures at the beginning of the VCS MN and MNFinder subsections (Fig. S2 and Fig. S5) with specific information about how ground truth images and labels were generated for both modules and how these were broken up for training, validation, and testing.</p><p>We also added information and images to explain how ground truth MN/nucleus associations were derived. In summary, we took advantage of the fact that 2xDendra-NLS is present at low levels in the cytoplasm to identify cell boundaries. This combined with a subconfluent cell population allowed us to unambiguously group MN and nuclei for 98% of MN, we estimate. These identifications were used to generate ground truth labels and analyze how well proximity defines MN/nuclei groups (Fig.s S1 and S2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Overall, I find the sections long and more subtitles would help me better navigate the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Where possible, we have added subtitles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Everything following &quot;To train the model, H2B channel images were passed to a Deep Retina neural net ...&quot; is fully automated, it seems to me. Thus, there seems to be no human intervention to correct the output before it is used to train the neural network. Therefore, I do not understand why a neural network was trained at all if the pipeline for creating ground truth labels worked fully automatically. At least, the explanations are insufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the initial lack of clarity in the text and included additional details in the revision. We used the Deep Retina segmenter to crop the raw images to areas around individual nuclei to accelerate ground truth labeling of MN. A trained user went through each nucleus crop and manually labeled pixels belonging to MN to generate the ground truth dataset for training, validation, and imaging in VCS MN (Fig. S2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) To my mind, the various metrics used to evaluate VCS MN reveal it not to be terribly reliable. Recall and PPV hover in the 70-80% range except for the PPV for MN+. It is what it is - but do the authors think one has to spend time manually correcting the output or do they suggest one uses it as is? I understand that for bulk transcriptomics, enrichment may be sufficient but for many other questions, where the wrong cell type could contaminate the population, it is not.</p><p>Remarks in the Results section on what the various accuracies mean for different applications would be good (so one does not need to wait for the Discussion section).</p></disp-quote><p>One of the strengths of the visual cell sorting system is that any image analysis pipeline can be used with it. We used VCS MN for the transcriptomics experiment, but for other applications a user could run visual cell sorting in conjunction with MNFinder for increased purity while maintaining a reasonable recall or use a pre-existing MN segmentation program that gives 100% purity but captures only a specific subgroup of micronucleated cells (e.g. PIQUE).</p><p>To maintain readability, especially with the expansion of the results sections, we kept the discussion of how we envision using visual cell sorting for other MN-based applications in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) I am confused about what &quot;cell&quot; is referring to in much of the manuscript. Is it the nucleus + MNs only? Is it the whole cell, which one would ordinarily think it is? If so, are there additional widefield images, where one can discern cell boundaries? I found the section &quot;MNFinder accurately ...&quot; very hard to read and digest for this reason and other ambiguous wording. I suggest the authors take a fresh look at their manuscript and see whether the text can be improved for clarity. I did not find it an easy read overall, especially the computational part.</p></disp-quote><p>After re-examining how “cell” was used, we updated the text to limit its use to the MNFinder arm tasked with identifying MN-nucleus associations where the convex hull defined by these objects is used to determine the “cell” boundary. In all other cases we have replaced cell with “nucleus” because, as the reviewer points out, that is what is being analyzed and converted. We hope this is clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Post-FACS PPVs are not that great (Figure 3c). It depends on the question one wants to answer whether ~70% PPV is good enough. Again, would be good to comment on.</p></disp-quote><p>We added discussion of this result to the revision. In summary, a likely reason for the reduced PPV is that, although we maintain the cells in buffer with a Cdk1 inhibitor, we know that some proportion of the cells go through mitosis post-sorting. Since MN are frequently reincorporated into the nucleus after mitosis (Hatch et al, 2013; Zhang et al., 2015), we expect this to reduce the MN+ population. Thus, we expect that the PPV in the RNAseq population is higher than what we can measure by analyzing post-sorted cells that have been plated and analyzed later.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) I am thoroughly confused as to why the authors claim that their system works in the &quot;absence of genetic perturbations&quot; and why they emphasize the fact that their cells are non-transformed: They still needed a fluorescent label and they induce MNs with a chemical Mps1 inhibitor. (The latter is not a genetic manipulation, of course, but they still need to enrich MNs somehow. That is, their method has not been tested on a cell population in which MNs occur naturally, presumably at a very low rate, unless I missed something.) A more careful description of the benefits of their method would be good.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion on these points and hope this is clarified in the revision. We were comparing our system, which can be made using transient transfection, if desired, to current tools that disambiguate aneuploidy and MN formation by deleting parts of chromosomes or engineering double strand breaks with CRISPR to generate single chromosome-specific missegregation events. Most of these systems require transformed cancer cells to obtain high levels of recombination. In contrast, visual cell sorting can isolate micronucleated cells from any cell line that can exogenously express a protein, including primary cells and non-transformed cells like RPE1s.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other minor points:</p><p>(1) The authors should not refer to &quot;H2B channels&quot; but to &quot;H2B-emiRFP703 channels&quot;. It may seem obvious to the authors but for someone reading the manuscript for the very first time, it was not. I was not sure whether there were additional imaging modalities used for H2B/nucleus/chromatin detection before I went back and read that only fluorescence images of H2B-emiRFP703 were used. To put it another way, the authors are detecting fluorescence, not histones -- unless I misunderstood something.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we altered the text to read “H2B-emiRFP703” when discussing images of this construct. For MNFinder some images were of cells expressing H2B-GFP, which has also been clarified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) If the level of zoom on my screen is such that I can comfortably read the text, I cannot see much in the figure panels. The features that I should be able to see are the size of a title. The image panels should be magnified.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision, the images are appended to the end at full resolution to overcome this difficulty. Thank you for your forbearance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The methods are adequately explained. The Results text narrating experiments and data analysis is clear. Interpretation of a few results could be clarified and strengthened as explained below.</p><p>(1) RNAseq experiments are a good proof of principle. To strengthen their interpretation in Figures 4 and 6, I would recommend the authors cite published work on checkpoint/MPS1 loss-induced chromosome missegregation (PMID: 18545697, PMID: 33837239, PMC9559752) and consider in their discussion the 'origin' and 'proportion' of micronucleated cells and irregularly shaped nuclei expected in RPE1 lines. This will help interpret Figure 6 findings on aneuploidy signature accurately. Not being able to see an MN-specific signature could be due to the way the biological specimen is presented with a mixture of cells with 'MN only' or 'rupture' or 'MN along with misshapen nuclei'. These features may all link to aneuploidy rather than 'MN' specifically.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and added a new analysis of nuclear atypia after Mps1 inhibition in RPE1 cells to Fig. S1. Overall, we found that Mps1 inhibition significantly, but modestly, increased the proportion of misshapen nuclei and chromatin bridges. Multinucleate cells were so rare that instead of giving them their own category we included them in “misshapen nuclei.” These results are consistent with images of Msp1i treated RPE1 cells from He et al. 2019 and Santaguida et al. 2017 and distinct from the stronger changes in nuclear morphology observed after delaying mitosis by nocodazole or CENPE inhibition.</p><p>We also found that the Deep Retina segmenter used to identify nuclei in VCS MN had a significant bias against highly lobulated nuclei (Fig. S2B) that led to misshapen nuclei being largely excluded from the RNAseq analyses. As a result we found no enrichment of misshapen nuclei, chromatin bridges, or dead/mitotic nuclear morphologies in MN+ compared to MN- nuclei in our RNASeq experiments (Fig. S9A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) As the authors clarify in the response letter, one round of ML is unlikely to result in fully robust software; additional rounds of ML with other markers will make the work robust. It will be useful to indicate other ML image analysis tools that have improved through such reiterations. They could use reviews on challenges and opportunities using ML approaches to support their statement. Also in the introduction, I would recommend labelling as 'rapid' instead of 'rapid and precise' method.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated the text to reference review articles that discuss the benefit of additional training for increasing ML accuracy and changed the text to “rapid.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The lack of live-cell studies does not allow the authors to distinguish the origin of MN (lagging chromatids or unaligned chromosomes). As explained in 1, considering these aspects in discussion would strengthen their interpretation. Live-cell studies can help reduce the dependencies on proximity maps (Figure S2).</p></disp-quote><p>The revised text includes new references and data (Fig. S1E) demonstrating that Mps1 inhibition strongly biases towards whole chromosome missegregation and that MN are most likely to contain a single centromere positive chromosome rather than chromatin fragments or multiple chromosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) is a good measure to compare outcomes against ground truth. However, the mIOU is relatively low (Figure 2D) for HeLa-based functional genomics applications. It will help to discuss mIOU for other classifiers (non-MN classifiers) so that they can be used as a benchmark (this is important since the authors state in their response that they are the first to benchmark an MN classifier). There are publications for mitochondria, cell cortex, spindle, nuclei, etc. where IOU has been discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We added references to classifiers for other small cellular structures. We also evaluated major sources of error in MNFinder found that false negatives are enriched in very small MN (3 to 9 pixels, or about 0.4 µm<sup>2</sup> – 3 µm<sup>2</sup>, Fig. S6B). A similar result was obtained for VCS MN (Fig. S3B). Because small changes in the number of pixels identified in small objects can have outsized effects on mIoU scores, we suspect that this is exerting downward pressure on the mIoU value. Based on the PPV and recall values we identified, we believe that MNFinder is robust enough to use for functional genomics and screening applications with reasonable sample sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 5 figure legend title is an overinterpretation. MN and rupture-initiated transcriptional changes could not be isolated with this technique where several other missegregation phenotypes are buried (see point 1 above).</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to keep the figure title legend based on our analysis of known missegregation phenotypes in Fig. S1 and S9 showing that there is no difference in major classes of nuclear atypia between MN+ and MN- populations in this analysis. Although we cannot rule out that other correlated changes exist, we believe that the title represents the most parsimonious interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>(1) The sentence in the introduction needs clarification and reference. &quot;However, these interventions cause diverse &quot;off-target&quot; nuclear and cellular changes, including chromatin bridges, aneuploidy, and DNA damage.&quot; Off-target may not be the correct description since inhibiting MPS1 is expected to cause a variety of problems based on its role as a master kinase in multiple steps of the chromosome segregation process. Consider one of the references in point 1 for a detailed live-cell view of MPS1 inhibitor outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed “off-target” to “additional” for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 3 or S3, did the authors notice any association between the cell cycle phase and MN or rupture presence? Is this possible to consider based on FACS outcomes or nuclear shapes?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work by our lab and others have shown that MN rupture frequency increases during the cell cycle (Hatch et al., 2013; Joo et al., 2023). Whether this is stochastic or regulated by the cell cycle may depend on what chromosome is in the MN (Mammel et al., 2021) and likely the cell line. Unfortunately, the H2B-emiRFP703 fluorescence in our population is too variable to identify cell cycle stage from FACS or nuclear fluorescence analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 5 - Please explain &quot;MA plot&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>An MA plot, or log fold-change (M) versus average (A) gene expression, is a way to visualize differently expressed genes between two conditions in an RNASeq experiment and is used as an alternative to volcano plots. We chose them for our paper because most of the expression changes we observed were small and of similar significance and the MA plot spreads out the data compared to a volcano plot and allowed a better visualization of trends across the population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Page 7: &quot;our results strongly suggest that protein expression changes in MN+ and rupture+ cells are driven mainly by increased aneuploidy rather than cellular sensing of MN formation and rupture.&quot;. This is an overstatement considering the mIOU limits of the software tool and the non-exclusive nature of MN in their samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we cannot rule out that an unknown masking effect is inhibiting our ability to observe small broad changes in transcription after MN formation or rupture. However, we believe we have minimized the most likely sources of masking effects, including nuclear atypia and large scale aneuploidy differences, and thus our interpretation is the most likely one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, the authors need to explain their methods better, define some technical terms used, and more thoroughly explain the parameters and rationale used when implementing these two protocols for identifying micronuclei; primarily as this is geared toward a more general audience that does not necessarily work with machine learning algorithms.</p><p>(1) A clearer description in the methods as to how accuracy was calculated. Were micronuclei counted by hand or another method to assess accuracy?</p></disp-quote><p>We significantly expanded the section on how the machine learning models were trained and tested, including how sensitivity and specificity metrics were calculated, in both the results and the methods sections.

What do the authors mean by diminished performance (what metrics are they using for this?).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a representative image and calculated mIoU and recall for 40x magnification images analyzed by MNFinder after rescaling in Fig. 2A. In summary, VCS MN only correctly labeled a few pixels in the MN, which was sufficient to call the adjacent nucleus “MN+” but not sufficient for other applications, such as quantifying MN area. In addition, VCS MN did much worse at identifying all the MN in 40x images with a recall, or sensitivity, metric of 0.36. We are not sure why. Developing MNFinder provided a module that was well suited to quantify MN characteristics in fixed cell images, an important use case in MN biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should compare MN that are analyzed and not analyzed using these methods and define parameters. Is there a size limitation? Closeness to the main nucleus?</p></disp-quote><p>We added two new figures defining what contributes to module error for both VCS MN (Fig. S3) and MNFinder (Fig. S6). For VCS MN, false negatives are enriched in very large or very small MN and tend to be dimmer and farther from the nucleus than true positives. False positives are largely misclassification of small dim objects in the image as MN. For MNFinder, the most missed class of MN are very small ones (3-9 px in area) and the majority of false positives are misclassifications of elongated nuclear blebs as MN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Are there parameters in how confluent an image must be to correctly define that the micronucleus belongs to the correct cell? The authors discussed that this was calculated based on predicted distance. However, many factors might affect proper calling on MN. And the authors should test this by staining for a cytosolic marker and calculating accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated the text with more information about how the cytoplasm was defined using leaky 2x-Dendra2-NLS signal to analyze the accuracy of MN/nucleus associations (Fig. S2G-H). In addition, we quantified cell confluency and distance to the first and second nearest neighbor for each MN in our training and testing image datasets. We found that, as anticipated, cells were imaged at subconfluent concentrations with most fields having a confluency around 30% cell coverage (Fig. S2E) and that the average difference in distance between the closest nucleus to an MN and the next closest nucleus was 3.3 fold (Fig. S2F). We edited the discussion section to state that the ability of MN/nuclear proximity to predict associations at high cell confluencies would have to be experimentally validated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors measure the ratio of Dendra2(Red) v. Dendra2 (Green) in Figure 3B to demonstrate that photoconversion is stable. This measurement, to me, is confusing, as in the end, the authors need to show that they have a robust conversion signal and are able to isolate these data. The authors should directly demonstrate that the Red signal remains by analyzing the percent of the Red signal compared to time point 0 for individual cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We found a bulk analysis to be more powerful than trying to reidentify individual cells due to how much RPE1 cells move during the 4 and 8 hours between image acquisitions. In addition, we sort on the ratio between red and green fluorescence per cell, rather than the absolute fluorescence, to compensate for variation in 2xDendra-NLS protein expression between cells. Therefore, demonstrating that distinct ratios remained present throughout the time course is the most relevant to the downstream analysis.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we replotted the data in Fig. 3B to highlight changes over time in the raw levels of red and green Dendra fluorescence (Fig. S7D). As expected, we see an overall decrease in red fluorescence intensity, and complementary increase in green fluorescence intensity, over 8 hours, likely due to protein turnover. We also observe an increase in the number of nuclei lacking red fluorescence. This is expected since the well was only partially converted and we expect significant numbers of unconverted cells to move into the field between the first image and the 8 hour image.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors isolate and subsequently use RNA-sequencing to identify changes between Mps1i and DMSO-treated cells. One concern is that even with the less stringent cut-off of 1.5 fold there is a very small change between DMSO and MPS1i treated cells, with only 63 genes changing, none of which were affected above a 2-fold change. The authors should carefully address this, including why their dataset sees changes in many more pathways than in the He et al. and Santaguida et al. studies. Is this due to just having a decreased cut-off?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points out that we observed an overall reduction in the strength of gene expression changes between our dataset of DMSO versus Mps1i treated RPE1 cells compared to similar studies. We suggest a couple reasons for this. One is that the log<sub>2</sub> fold changes observed in the other studies are not huge and vary between 2.5 and -3.8 for He et al., 3.3 and -2.3 for Santaguida et al., and -0.8 and 1.6 for our study. This variability is within a reasonable range for different experimental conditions and library prep protocols. A second is that our protocol minimizes a potential source of transcriptional change – nuclear lobulation – that is present in the other datasets.</p><p>For the pathway analysis we did not use a fold-change cut-off for any data set, instead opting to include all the genes found to be significantly different between control and Mps1i treated cells for all three studies. Our read-depth was higher than that of the two published experiments, which could contribute to an increased DEG number. However, we hypothesize that our identification of a broader number of altered pathways most likely arises from increased sensitivity due to the loss of covering signal from transcriptional changes associated with increased nuclear atypia. Additional visual cell sorting experiments sorting on misshapen nuclei instead of MN would allow us to determine the accuracy of this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Moreover, clustering (in Figure 5E) of the replicates is a bit worrisome as the variances are large and therefore it is unclear if, with such large variance and low screening depth, one can really make such a strong conclusion that there are no changes. The authors should prove that their conclusion that rupture does not lead to large transcriptional changes, is not due to the limitations of their experimental design.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that additional rounds of RNAseq would improve the accuracy of our transcriptomic analysis and could uncover additional DEGs. However, we believe the overall conclusion to be correct based on the results of our attempt to validate changes in gene expression by immunofluorescence. We analyzed two of the most highly upregulated genes in the ruptured MN dataset, ATF3 and EGR1. Although we saw a statistically significant increase in ATF3 intensity between cells without MN and those with ruptured MN, the fold change was so small compared to our positive control (100x less) that we believe it is it is more consistent with a small increase in the probability of aneuploidy rather than a specific signature of MN rupture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The authors also need to address the fact that they are using RPE-1 cells more clearly and that the lack of effect in transcriptional changes may be simply due to the loss of cGAS-STING pathway (Mackenzie et al., 2017; Harding et al., 2017; etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>As we discuss above in the public comments section, the literature is clear that MN do not activate cGAS in the first cell cycle after their formation, even upon rupture. Therefore, we do not expect any changes in our results when applied to cGAS-competent cells. However, this expectation needs to be experimentally validated, which we plan to address in upcoming work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
