Consequently it places great demands on the nervous system, muscles and the skeleton to ensure that it can be performed successfully and repeatedly. These movements are frequently used to escape from predators so that the cost of failure is high. In insects different jumping mechanisms have evolved independently several times, but all that use the legs for propulsion fall into two broad types. First, contractions of the muscles act directly on long levers. Examples of insects which use this mechanism are bush crickets, the propulsive hind legs of which can be up to 2.6 times the body length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burrows and Morris, 2003</xref>). The length of the levers enables them to generate the necessary leverage, but take 20–30 ms to be moved to full extension and accelerate the insect to take-off.</p><p>In the second jumping mechanism, the propulsive legs are short relative the body and deliver their power in a few milliseconds by using a catapult-like mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennet-Clark, 1975a1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennet-Clark and Lucey, 1967</xref>). The champion jumping insects, as judged by their take-off velocities, all use a catapult mechanism and belong to two groups of the true bugs (Hemiptera), the closely related planthoppers (Fulgoroidea) and froghoppers or spittle bugs (Cercopoidea). The refinements of the body for this mechanism are thus likely to be developed the most in these insects. The adults of both may live in similar habitats feeding on the sap of plants which they suck with piercing mouthparts. They jump prodigiously propelled by their hind legs. Planthoppers nymphs live freely alongside the adults and are also very able jumpers. By contrast, the nymphs of froghoppers do not jump and instead live a rather restricted life either underground, or on plant leaves, surrounding themselves with a protective froth which they make by blowing air into their urine. The adults generate take-off velocities ranging from 4 to 5.8 m s<sup>−1</sup> in their best jumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burrows, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2014</xref>). They achieve these remarkable velocities by accelerating their bodies in about 1 ms and in so doing experience forces that can reach 700 g; most humans pass out with forces 100 times less. The power needed to generate such rapid and powerful movements can be 1000 times greater than the contractile limits of normal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Askew and Marsh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ellington, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Josephson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Weis-Fogh and Alexander, 1977</xref>). A complex motor pattern is fashioned by the nervous system and delivered to the muscles so that they build up the required force slowly and without moving the two propulsive hind legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burrows, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burrows and Bräunig, 2010</xref>). The energy of these slow contractions is stored in mechanical distortions of specialised cuticular structures of the thoracic skeleton associated only with the hind legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burrows et al., 2008</xref>). The energy is then released suddenly, by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood, to generate rapid propulsive movements of the hind legs. These energy storage devices must be able to deliver the necessary power repeatedly and reliably without fracturing. The insects must also ensure that the starting point for the movements is always the same so that they can perform jumps with predictable outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brackenbury, 1996</xref>). This requires that the stores must be both strong and elastic, properties that come from their constituent composite materials, hard cuticle and cuticle containing resilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burrows et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The elastic protein resilin was initially discovered in the tendons of flight muscles that must reliably generate many repetitive cycles of movement during the lifetime of an insect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weis-Fogh, 1960</xref>), but has since been found in many different places in the cuticle of arthropods. In particular, it is associated with energy storage devices in a range of insects from fleas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennet-Clark and Lucey, 1967</xref>), froghoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burrows et al., 2008</xref>) and planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burrows, 2010</xref>). The latter two examples have some of the largest volumes of resilin relative to body size in any insect.</p><p>The great speed and power of the jumping movements also requires close interactions between the neurons, muscles and the skeleton. This is particularly important in synchronising the movements of the two propulsive legs to within 30 µs of each other in planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burrows, 2009</xref>). Without this synchrony, the body will spin with little accompanying forward movement, as much of the mechanical energy acts to rotate the body. Such levels of synchronisation are beyond the limits of neural control but are accomplished by mechanical means such as the interactions between functional gear wheels on each propulsive hind leg of nymphal planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burrows and Sutton, 2013</xref>). These enmeshed gears ensure that when one hind leg moves, the other also moves at the same time.</p><p>To understand how these fast jumping movements are generated, we have reconstructed from confocal scans the 3-D structure of three elements of the jumping mechanism to address three questions. First, what is the structure of the thorax that enables the energy generated by the muscle contractions to be stored and power a jump? Second, what is the distribution of resilin in these structures? Third, how do the muscles and their mechanical advantages change during jumping movements? We then analysed different species of planthoppers and froghoppers to seek common features or differences in these mechanisms. This approach has given insights into the functional design of the energy stores, how energy is stored and then released, and how the rapid propulsive movements of the hind legs are generated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>General thoracic structure for jumping in planthoppers</title><p>The adults and nymphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) of planthoppers are all adept at jumping, propelled by the synchronous, rapid depression movements of the two hind legs. The front and middle legs set the attitude of the body but apparently contribute little to propulsion. The metathorax of both adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) and nymphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) is reinforced internally by large, paired pleural arches (apodemes) that are substantial and complex structures in comparison to those in the other thoracic segments. From their ventral articulations with the two hind coxae, these arches run anteriorly and dorsally to articulate with the hinges of the hind wings. In adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) each enlarged pleural arch forms a tight linkage with an anterior and dorsal extension of a hind coxa. By contrast, a pleural arch in a nymph has a more blade-like structure and its articulation with a coxa is clearly delineated by a flange that allows some movement between the two elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). In the images of the nymphs, the lateral and dorsal outer layers of thoracic cuticle and the dorsal walls of the coxae have been removed to show these features more clearly.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23824.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the skeletal elements in the metathorax of planthoppers associated with jumping.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Side view of an intact nymph of <italic>Metcalfa pruinosa</italic>.

These muscles fill most of the internal thoracic space, and power the rapid movements of the hind legs in jumping. In nymphs the anterior origins of these paired muscles are continuous with and a part of metathoracic pleural arches. The mesothoracic pleural arches form a support for the middle legs and do not contribute to the structures of the jumping apparatus of the hind legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> inset). In adults, however, the anterior ends of the metathoracic pleural arches articulate laterally with flattened expansions of the mesothoracic arches to form the origins of the trochanteral depressor muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>. For each Figure shown in 3D, we provide a 2D version). Each trochanteral depressor muscle then inserts onto a prominent funnel-shaped tendon in the thorax that tapers to a stout rod as it passes through a coxa to insert on the medial wall of a trochanter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23824.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the structure of the pleural arches in nymphs of five families of planthoppers.</title><p>(<bold>Ai</bold>) Delphacidae, <italic>Stenocranus acutus</italic>.

This action pulls on the trochantera with the result that the pleural arches are bent and their curvature increased (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, Supplementary material). The positions of the most anterior articulations of the pleural arches with the wing hinges stay constant but the posterior articulations with the coxae, and the coxae themselves, move forwards as a unit. Then, as the pleural arches unfurl, the coxae move rapidly backwards and the hind legs straighten by depression at the coxo-trochanteral joints and extension at the femoro-tibial joints to propel the jump. The coxae thus form a stable base which allows cocking (levation) and propulsive (depression) movements of the trochantera about their dorsal and ventral articulations with the coxae. This stability enables the femora and tibiae to straighten and transmit the propulsive forces for a jump to the ground through the tarsi.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-23824-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23824.005</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Bending of the pleural arches of a planthopper during natural jumping.</title><p>High speed movie taken at 30 000 frames per second and with an exposure time of 0.03 ms of the jumping movements of an adult planthopper <italic>Issus coleoptratus</italic>.

Through the transparent ventral cuticle of the thorax, the tendons of these bilateral muscles could be seen to move anteriorly in unison within the metathorax as the hind legs were depressed to propel a jump, and then posteriorly as the legs were levated in preparation for the next anticipated jump. The rim of cuticle that forms the mouth of the funnel is not a complete circle and this shape suggests that when the muscle contracts it may be distorted and thus store additional energy. More posteriorly, the tendon tapers markedly so that as it passes through the coxa it is a narrower and rigid, rod-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>).

A possible mechanism by which this might be achieved is for the lever arm of the tendon to change in sign relative to the pivot of the coxo-trochanteral joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorb, 2004a2004</xref>). In this way, when the hind leg is fully cocked in readiness for a jump, the tendon would be to one side of the pivot axis so that the action of the muscle would be to levate rather than depress the leg. If another muscle were to move the loaded tendon to the other side of the pivot axis, the action of the depressor muscle would then be to depress the trochanter and propel a jump. To determine whether the lever arm of the depressor muscle does reverse in this way relative to the pivot axis, the images making up the three dimensional stacks were analysed individually and the positions of the tendon and the ventral and dorsal pivots of the joint were marked. This enabled the lever arm of the depressor tendon to be determined relative to the axis of rotation of the trochanter about the coxa (lines drawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). The whole process was then repeated with the trochanter held at different angles relative to the coxa throughout its whole range of levation and depression movements. Two examples are shown; first with the trochanter almost fully depressed about the coxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>); second with the trochanter fully levated (cocked) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). When the joint was fully depressed the lever arm of the tendon was at it furthest (medial) position relative to the axis of rotation of the joint and thus had its greatest mechanical advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). At its most levated position, the lever arm was close to the axis of rotation of the joint but was still medial to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The lever arm thus became smaller as the joint was levated but its sign always remained the same. Thus throughout the entire range of trochanteral movements, the depressor muscle always acted to depress the trochanter.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23824.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Muscles controlling movements of the hind trochantera of planthoppers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Medial view of a whole nymph of <italic>Metcalfa pruinosa</italic>.

The nymphs also lack functional wings and do not fly. They also lack the large thoracic muscles that would power flying. By contrast, the metathorax of adult froghoppers is dominated by the pair of large trochanteral depressor muscles that propel jumping and the mesothorax by large muscles that power flying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The origins of the froghopper trochanteral depressor muscles are larger and more ventral than in planthoppers. Enlarged pleural arches extend from the coxae to the articulation of the hind wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), but the articulation of each coxa with a pleural arch allows rotation through a greater range of angles. As in adult planthoppers, the origins of the trochanteral depressor muscles include part of the mesothoracic pleural arches.

Close to these insertions and still within the thoracic cavity, the tendon branches into a thinner lateral and anteriorly directed part to which the pinnately arranged fibres of M133b insert along its length. As the combined tendon enters the coxa it tapers gradually to assume a dorso-ventrally flattened shape. Along its medial side is the insertion site of a small part of the muscle (M133a) that originates on the ventral medial wall of the coxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). As in planthoppers, the tendon flares and becomes more flexible close to its insertion on the medial wall of the trochanter. M133d is an even smaller bundle of longer fibres that originates in the ventral thorax just lateral and posterior to the metathoracic ganglion and inserts on the tendon within the coxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Three dimensional reconstruction of images of the skeletal structures, the muscles and their tendons that generate the rapid propulsive movements of the hind legs, have revealed three features that meet the extraordinary mechanical demands of jumping. <bold>First</bold>, the substantially enlarged pleural arches act as energy stores for jumping and provide the necessary rigidity to withstand the forces that are generated. <bold>Second</bold>, large volumes of resilin are intimately bonded in complex ways with regions of the pleural arches that apparently contain no resilin. These composite structures store and release energy to power repeated jumping. <bold>Third</bold>, large, paired trochanteral depressor muscles occupy most of the internal volume of the metathorax. The changing lever arms of these muscles suggest a possible mechanism for the release of the stored energy to power a jump. By contrast, the other two pairs of legs which do not contribute propulsion for jumping have smaller pleural arches without resilin and smaller trochanteral depressor muscles.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Structure of energy stores</title><p>In nymphal planthoppers and adult planthoppers and froghoppers, the metathoracic pleural arches are curved bow-like structures with folds and grooves that apparently give increased strength. When the large trochanteral depressor muscles contract slowly before a jump, the pleural arches are bent like archery bows and store elastic energy, but the legs do not move. Sudden release of this stored energy powers the rapid movements of the hind legs in a catapult-like action and drives the insect to a high take-off velocity.</p><p>The metathoracic pleural arches of all six families of planthoppers analysed had similar common features. A region was identified in the middle of a pleural arch close to where a small laterally placed muscle tendon attaches and two small curved plates also occur. At this point these plates are likely to be subject to the greatest bending forces and might therefore act as additional springs. In planthoppers longitudinal holes are present in the pleural arches and in froghoppers an invagination of the external cuticle forms an air-filled tunnel that extends for some 40% of their length of each arch alongside the cuticular wrapped regions of resilin. These spaces may be a consequence of developmental processes, but functionally they should reduce the mass of the arches and their juxtaposition to the resilin suggests that they may allow easier bending and room for local bulging during energy storage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Resilin and energy stores</title><p>The protein resilin has previously been detected by its characteristic blue fluorescence under specific wavelengths of UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen and Weis-Fogh, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malencik et al., 1996</xref>), the dependence of the fluorescence on pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neff et al., 2000</xref>), its staining with very dilute solutions of Methylene Blue or Toluidine Blue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weis-Fogh, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Young and Bennet-Clark, 1995</xref>) and immunostaining with an anti-Rec1 resilin polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elvin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burrows et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lyons et al., 2011</xref>). We find here that resilin also stains with acridine orange and has a distribution which matches that revealed by all the preceding methods including wide field microscopy with DAPI filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In planthoppers and froghoppers the resilin forms an elongated region in each pleural arch sandwiched between two plates of cuticle with folds and grooves for increased strength. In froghoppers there is a second region of resilin and where it overlaps with the first, a pleural arch in sections appears like a double-decker sandwich. The two fillings of resilin are separated from each other by a middle layer and bounded by two outside layers of cuticle. Relative to body mass, the volume of resilin in froghoppers is 50% higher than in planthoppers. The large regions of resilin are of comparable volume in the two groups so that the increase in volume in froghoppers is explained by the presence of the second region. In its best jumps an adult male planthopper, <italic>Issus coleoptratus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burrows, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2009</xref>), that is 22% heavier than a froghopper, <italic>Lepyronia quadrangularis</italic>, expends 55% more energy and requires a power output that is 213% larger to achieve a take-off velocity that is 20% higher. Why then do froghoppers have more resilin when their energy requirements for jumping are less? The answer may lie in the fact that the composite material from which the energy stores are made endows the jumping mechanism with three key features. First, the pleural arches do not fracture when bent by the considerable force generated by the powerful muscle contractions. Second, the elasticity of the resilin enables the original body shape to be restored rapidly after each jump, so that subsequent jumps can performed quickly. Third, the same muscle contractions will produce the same distortion of the energy stores and hence enable predictable jumping performances. The different volume and distribution of resilin in the two groups may thus reflect possible differences in the distribution of bending forces within their complex pleural arches.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Muscles, tendons and the storage and release of energy</title><p>The three dimensional images of the depressor tendon of planthoppers reveal dramatic changes in its mechanical advantage relative to the joint between the trochanter and the coxa as it moves from its most levated position before a jump to its most depressed position after propelling the jump. As the joint is depressed, the depressor lever arm becomes larger thus increasing its mechanical advantage over the smaller levator muscle. Likewise, as the joint is levated the lever arm of the depressor becomes smaller but does not change sign. Thus when fully levated and cocked in advance of a jump the action of the depressor muscle would still be to cause depression. The same conclusion based on physiological experiments has been drawn for the actions of the depressor muscle in froghoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burrows, 2006b</xref>). These observations thus do not support the model that has been proposed for jumping in froghoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorb, 2004a2004</xref>). In Gorb’s model the initial action of the depressor muscle is proposed to levate the trochanter into its fully cocked position before the jump. The sign of the lever arm is then changed by a trigger muscle called M5 (possibly the same as small depressor muscle M133a described here) so that the action of the main depressor is now to depress the hind leg in its movements that propel a jump. In other words the tendon is initially on one side of the axis of rotation of the joint so that it causes levation and the contraction of the trigger muscle then pulls it to the other side so that it now causes depression and propulsion of the jump. Similar kinds of triggering mechanisms have been proposed for jumping in fleas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennet-Clark and Lucey, 1967</xref>), the strike of mantis shrimps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cox et al., 2014a2014</xref>) and the snapping movements of alpheid shrimps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ritzmann, 1974a1974</xref>), but no definitive evidence has been provided for lever arms changing in sign. Were such a trigger mechanism to exist in planthoppers and froghoppers it would require close neural synchronisation between the muscles of both hind legs to ensure that an uncontrolled spin of the body does not result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sutton and Burrows, 2010a</xref>). Evidence from both adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burrows, 2010</xref>) and larval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burrows and Sutton, 2013</xref>) planthoppers suggests the accuracy of the synchrony that would be required can only be achieved mechanically, but no evidence for such a mechanism has been revealed here that could trigger the release of the two hind legs.</p><p>Our results suggest a different mechanism. In preparation for a jump the hind legs are levated by the contractions of the levator muscles, an action confirmed by recordings from these muscles in both planthoppers and froghoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burrows, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burrows and Bräunig, 2010</xref>). At the fully levated or cocked position of the joint, the small levator muscle has a big mechanical advantage and could thus restrain the large depressor which now has its smallest mechanical advantage. When the levator muscle starts to relax, the joint will begin to depress and with further movement the mechanical advantage of the levator will decrease while that of the depressor increases. The changes in mechanical advantages will quickly reach a point where the energy stored by the depressor will result in a rapid depression of the leg to propel a jump. This suggests that in natural jumps by planthoppers there is no need to invoke the action of a trigger muscle. This indicates that the functional role of the small part (M133a) of the depressor muscle is not to effect a change in the sign of the lever arms, but possibly to stabilise the tendon while it delivers the enormous force for jumping.</p><p>Support for the release of stored energy in this way also comes from experiments on other insects and from modelling studies. In locusts, jumping is propelled by a large power producing extensor muscle that operates with a smaller flexor muscle and with energy stored in distortions of specialised cuticular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennet-Clark, 1975a1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heitler, 1974</xref>) also made of composites of resilin and hard cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burrows and Sutton, 2012</xref>). When flexed in preparation for a jump, the contraction of the small flexor can restrain the joint from moving while both it and the larger extensor co-contract to store energy. When the flexor relaxes the tibia starts to extend and the increasing mechanical advantage of the extensor is expressed in rapid movements of the tibia. Theoretical modelling has also suggested a similar mechanism for jumping in bullfrogs that also involves elastic elements and increasing mechanical advantage during the muscle contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roberts and Marsh, 2003</xref>), and more generally for muscular systems with these features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galantis and Woledge, 2003a2003</xref>).</p><p>Insights into the functional mechanisms underlying jumping have been gained by revealing the three dimensional structure of the energy storage devices, muscles, and tendons. These emphasise the important interplay between brain and body in producing an adaptive movement. The storage of energy for jumping is only possible because of the mechanics of the changing lever arms of the controlling muscles, the composite materials of the skeletal energy stores and the actions of the muscles that are controlled by the nervous system. These powerful insights suggest that the same methods may be of wider application in the study of complex yet miniaturised mechanisms in small animals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insects</title><p>The Hemipteran insects, suborder Auchenorrhyncha, studied in this paper were collected from similar habitats containing a variety of grasses, wild flowers and shrubs around Ashburn, Virginia, USA and Cambridge, UK in 2014- 2016.

The froghopper species used here were from the Cercopidae, <italic>Lepyronia quadrangularis</italic> (Say 1825) and Clastopteridae, <italic>Clastoptera obtusa</italic> (Say 1825). Both are adept jumpers with similar thoracic anatomies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>For the imaging of cuticle, an insect was anaesthetized on ice and its thorax was isolated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The muscles were then digested away with a mixture of hyaluronidase/trypsin at 0.5 mg/ml for 5 hr at 37°C. Resilin of planthoppers and froghoppers was resistant to trypsin, but not to protease K or collagenase. To speed digestion and produce clean cuticle an ultrasonic bath was used towards the end of the process. To render thick samples transparent for imaging it was necessary to match the refractive index of the tissue with that of the mounting medium. The specimens were washed with ethanol and mounted in methyl salicylate (Sigma-Aldrich, M6752). Energy stores prepared in this way were also embedded in 8% agarose and sectioned on Leica Vibratome (VT1000s) at 0.3 mm using the slowest settings for progression of the blade. The sections were mounted in Tris-buffered (50 mM, pH 8.4) 50% glycerol.</p><p>To image cuticle and muscles, the thorax was fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 24–48 hr at room temperature. After washing in PBS containing 1% triton X-100, samples were treated with 0.5 mg/ml hyaluronidase for 2–3 hr at 37°C and briefly sonicated in an ultrasound bath to remove other tissue – mostly fat bodies – in the body cavity. This tissue caused much light scattering so that its removal was essential to obtain clear images of muscles and cuticle. The samples were then stained with Texas Red-X Phalloidin (1:50, Life Technologies #T7471) in PBS with 1% triton X-100, 0.5% DMSO and Escin (0.05 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, E1378) at room temperature with agitation for 4–5 days. Long incubation times and the presence of surfactants assured better penetration of phalloidin into the large muscles. In preparations where the 405 nm laser-induced autofuorescence of exoskeletal elements, such as fine tendons in nymphs, was not strong, a chitin-binding dye Calcofluor White (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, F3543-1G) was included in the staining procedure. Acridine orange and Calcofluor White were never used in the same preparation. The samples were then washed in PBS/1% triton and fixed for 4 hr in 2% paraformaldehyde to reduce leaching of bound phalloidin from muscles during the subsequent ethanol dehydration step. To avoid artefacts caused by osmotic shrinkage of soft tissue, samples were gradually dehydrated in glycerol (2–80%) and then ethanol (20% to 100%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ott, 2008</xref>) and mounted in methyl salicylate for imaging.</p><p>We attempted to apply the imaging regime/method for visualization of resilin in the exoskeleton of insects as described by Michels and Gorb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Michels and Gorb, 2012</xref>) but failed to obtain satisfactory separation of the resilin and chitin autofluorescence in adult plant- and froghopper energy stores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). The lack of satisfactory contrast necessitated the use of staining. To reveal the distribution of the elastic protein resilin, samples were stained overnight with Acridine Orange (0.01 mg/ml, Sigma, A-6014) in PBS with 1% triton X-100. The distribution of this staining was then compared with the characteristic blue fluorescence of resilin seen under an Olympus MVX10 Microscope equipped with DP70 color camera and DAPI filter set (excitation: 352–402 nm, emission: 414–477 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burrows et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2008</xref>). The distribution of resilin revealed by both methods were the same.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Imaging and rendering</title><p>Serial optical sections were obtained at 2 µm intervals on a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 10x/0.45 NA objective, or at 1 µm with a LD-LCI 25x/0.8 NA objective For the imaging of Acridine Orange-stained cuticle, laser lines of 405 and 488 nm were used. Autofluorescence of chitin was recorded in the 410–465 nm range whereas fluorescence of Acridine Orange was recorded in the 520–580 nm range. The dye exhibits a more red-shifted fluorescence compared to chitin so that collecting emitted light in the 520–580 nm range reduced the chitin autofluorescence component in the registered images. To reduce further the contribution of chitin autofluorescence, we adjusted the offset during recording. Calcofluor White and Texas Red phalloidin-treated samples were imaged using a 405 and 594 nm lasers, respectively. Using these wavelengths for visualization of Calcofluor white-stained exoskeleton and Acridine Orange (AO) -stained resilin creates the possibility of crosstalk. The autofluorescence of resilin would have been included in the visualization; we avoided that by applying Calcofluor White staining only to the nymphs that lack resilin in their energy stores. The settings used to image AO-resilin are appropriate for visualization of exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Michels and Gorb, 2012</xref>). The intensity of AO fluorescence is much stronger than autofluorescence of chitin, however, so that any crosstalk did not play an important role in our analysis of the distribution of resilin and did not impact the results.</p><p>We did not notice substantial differences in the distribution of blue, green and red autofluorescence in cuticular samples. Red autofluorescence was preferentially used for visualization of chitinous elements of the energy stores alone (i.e. when muscles and resilin were not simultaneously imaged), as longer wavelengths are less affected by cuticle pigmentation and thickness, yielding more uniform signal throughout the sample. Autofluorescence of cuticle was excited with a 561 nm laser line and recorded in the 568–683 nm range. The stains and excitation and emission wavelengths used for imaging specimens are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. For the 10x air objective, the Z-spacing was corrected for the refractive index of the mounting medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ott, 2008</xref>). Images were processed in Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/">http://fiji.sc/</ext-link>), Icy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/">http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/</ext-link>) and Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.). Red/cyan anaglyphs (three dimensional representations) of the confocal stacks were created using the stereo pair plug-in of ImageJ. The 3-D images should be viewed with glasses in which the left eye has a red filter and the right eye a cyan filter. Images which should be viewed in this way are indicated in the Figures by the symbol of a pair of coloured glasses. 2-D versions of these Figures are also given. In the renderings of confocal images we use blue to indicate resilin (reflecting its characteristic blue fluorescence in UV light), yellow for muscles (it is the only colour showing good contrast in red-cyan anaglyphs) and shades of grey for cuticle.</p><p>The metathoracic muscles involved in jumping are given the same names and numbers (e.g. trochanteral depressor muscle M133 a-d, indicating four different parts of the same muscle) as those used for locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Snodgrass, 1929</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Snodgrass, 1935</xref>), because of the strong similarities found between these insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bräunig and Burrows, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Sequential images of jumping movements of <italic>Issus coleoptratus</italic> were captured by a Photron Fastcam SA3 high speed camera (Photron (Europe), Marlow, Buckinghamshire, UK) at rates of 30 000 frames s<sup>–1</sup> and with an exposure time of 0.03 ms. The camera was mounted on a Zeiss Stemi SV6 stereo microscope.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Greg Sutton for help in calculating the volumes of resilin and advice on lever arms, and Cambridge and Janelia colleagues for many helpful suggestions during the experimental work and for their constructive comments on drafts of the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study on planthoppers and froghoppers presents a new functional understanding of jumping that is mechanically insightful, and new, highly detailed anatomy with fantastically rendered images. Using confocal microscopy, physical manipulation, and staining, the authors provide a mechanistic understanding of the interaction of muscle, tendon, and exoskeletal elements, which together conspire to produce synchronous actuation in one of nature's fastest movements.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are a few key concerns that require revision to the manuscript, summarized below.</p><p>1) The manuscript suffers a bit by focusing on both new methods (emphasized in the Abstract) and scientific results. The only new method is the staining of resilin with acridine orange, suggesting that the manuscript would benefit most from a stronger focus on the research results. Reviewer #1 has some nice suggestions on how to accomplish such a re-focusing.</p><p>2) Further details are required to understand the effectiveness of the use of acridine orange for identifying resilin and to justify why this was required compared to autofluorescence (see reviewer #2).</p><p>3) The more familiar language of levers and mechanical advantage when discussing the findings (see reviewer #3).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper provides an interesting and necessary contribution to current work on the jumping of insects, specifically those who use gears. The image quality, detail, and presentation is stunning.</p><p>I did find the results difficult to read because the Introduction does not prepare the reader for the topics investigated. Specifically, in the Introduction there are three rough hypotheses which are too vague to actually test. I suggest making predictions here instead. Then use these specific predictions to organize your Results and Discussion. For instance, in the first point you mention the thorax, where power generating muscles are located, must be strong enough to withstand high forces. This suggests you will measure strength, perhaps of the exoskeleton? Instead, a prediction related to the anatomical structure of the thorax would be more appropriate based on your results.</p><p>It also needs to be clearer why you looked at adults and nymphs and what their differences are. Furthermore, what are the expected differences between planthoppers and froghoppers? Why use multiple species within each? Where are the images of these other species? Are there ecological/behavioral differences that make these comparisons interesting/important?</p><p>Related to the first two points, certain definitions and details are left out of the Introduction, like resilin, or the ecology of froghoppers, and are included in later sections. Likewise, information on jumping from Burrows would have been useful in the Introduction and would perhaps help formulate predictions (i.e., planthoppers are heavier than froghoppers, expend more energy, etc.).</p><p>In the Abstract you mention 3D printing of the components, but don't mention this in the manuscript. You are correct that your work could be used for this, but it is not clear how. This paper reads a bit like a methods paper (i.e., lacks clear biological predictions), but it has too much detail with regards to the subject (e.g., insect anatomy and structure/function relationships) to be a clear methods paper. Given the data collected, I would prefer this work be focused on structure/function relationships focused around clear predictions.</p><p>Finally, although the 3D image rendering is impressive, not every reader has the ability to view these with 3D glasses. Can you make 2D images available, perhaps in the supporting information files?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript describes the structures involved in the energy storage for jumping of planthoppers and froghoppers in great detail. The 3D reconstructions based on confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analyses are impressive and provide in fact, as stated by the authors, 'unprecedented detail'. The manuscript is well written and clearly comprehensible, and it adds significant information to the already existing knowledge of the respective structures published in earlier work of Professor Burrows. However, the following aspects and comments have to be considered in the review process:</p><p>1) The authors stained the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin using the fluorescence dye Acridine Orange. This dye is well-known and typically applied to stain nucleic acids. The finding that Acridine Orange also stains the protein resilin is surprising and very interesting. Unfortunately, the authors only state that 'The distribution of this staining was then confirmed to be the same as that revealed by the characteristic blue fluorescence of resilin when examined with a sharp-edged (1% transmission limits) excitation band of ultraviolet (UV) light.…' but they do not show this. It is absolutely essential that they clearly demonstrate that resilin can be specifically stained with Acridine Orange. For this purpose, the authors definitely have to show the results of precise analyses revealing that the typical resilin autofluorescence and the fluorescence of Acridine Orange are absolutely colocalised in test samples.</p><p>2) The authors have to convincingly explain why they decided to fluorescently stain resilin with Acridine Orange. This seems to be not very appropriate because the excitation and emission peaks of the Acridine Orange fluorescence are in the ranges of those of an autofluorescence that is typically exhibited by arthropod exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin. Accordingly, it is very likely that because of crosstalk the exclusive visualization of the Acridine Orange fluorescence and thereby the specific visualization of the structures with large proportions of resilin within exoskeleton samples (which is necessary if exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin and exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin have to be visualized and 3D reconstructed separately as described in the manuscript) are only possible when a precise emission fingerprinting with detailed λ scans and linear unmixing is performed. Why did the authors not use the resilin autofluorescence? In a relatively large number of earlier studies this autofluorescence has been efficiently used to visualize exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin, and it was even demonstrated that a combination of CLSM and an excitation wavelength of 405 nm can be successfully applied to reliably visualize exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin (Michels and Gorb, 2012).</p><p>3) The crosstalk problem mentioned above is also present (and even particularly pronounced) in the case of Fluorescent Brightener 28 (synonym: Calcofluor White M2R) that was applied by the authors to stain chitin in the exoskeleton and to separately visualize the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin. The excitation and emission properties of the fluorescence of Fluorescent Brightener 28 are comparable to those of the autofluorescence of resilin. Accordingly, it is not easy to separate the different fluorescence signals obtained from Fluorescent Brightener 28 and resilin from each other. Such a separation requires a very precise spectral detection system and a rather precise emission fingerprinting with very detailed λ scans and linear unmixing. In case the particular ZEISS LSM 710 applied by the authors for their study is equipped with a 34-channel QUASAR detection unit, the authors had the opportunity to perform such an emission fingerprinting. Unfortunately, in the manuscript they do not explain at all how the fluorescences were detected. (Which emission wavelength ranges were detected?) Why did the authors decide to apply Fluorescent Brightener 28? They could have used an autofluorescence to visualize the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin. For example, many of such exoskeleton structures exhibit a relatively intense autofluorescence when they are exposed to the light of a 561 nm laser. (Many ZEISS LSM 710 systems are equipped with such a laser.) In this context, another question arises: in the Materials and methods section, the authors mention 'Autofluorescence of cuticle was excited with a 562 nm laser line.' (This must be a mistake because such a laser line is definitely not offered by Carl Zeiss Microscopy. I assume that the authors used a 561 nm laser.), however, this autofluorescence is not mentioned anywhere else in the manuscript. What has happened to the results of this autofluorescence visualization?</p><p>In conclusion, the authors have to convincingly explain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1</xref>) why they did not perform their study using the autofluorescence of resilin and either an autofluorescence of the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin or a fluorescence dye staining chitin and featuring excitation and emission properties that are clearly different from those of the autofluorescence of resilin and, therefore, enable to absolutely reliably visualize exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin and exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin separately and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2</xref>) how they coped with the crosstalk problem.</p><p>4) In the Discussion section of the manuscript, the authors should clearly highlight which advances their 'new methodological approach' made possible. For this purpose, they should properly discuss the new insights into the energy storage structures important for jumping of planthoppers and froghoppers with respect to the knowledge of the respective structures obtained in earlier studies of Professor Burrows.</p><p>5) In my opinion, the end of the Discussion section of the manuscript is too abrupt. The authors should add a paragraph with concluding remarks.</p><p>6) In the Abstract, the authors write 'This new methodological approach can illuminate how miniaturized components interact and function in complex movements of small animals with the potential for 3-D printing of relevant structures.' The potential for 3D printing is not mentioned anywhere else in the manuscript. This topic should be included in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Michels J, Gorb SN (2012) Detailed three-dimensional visualization of resilin in the exoskeleton of arthropods using confocal laser scanning microscopy.

This work is stunningly beautiful. The level of anatomical detail is indeed unprecedented and set a new standard for future work aiming to derive functional mechanisms from a structural framework. I believe the methods developed here will be of interest to broad audience and likely represents an important contribution to the field. The one potential shortcoming of the paper is that the work is presented in a descriptive way rather than developed hypotheses. In addition, given that the methodology used and developed here is an important aspect of the contribution it may be worth providing the readers with an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the approach in the Discussion section. I have also made some stylistic suggestions as well as highlighted a few places where the language could be more precise.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Three dimensional reconstruction of energy stores for jumping in planthoppers and froghoppers from confocal laser scanning microscopy&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

As you can see, the manuscript has been greatly improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. For reviewer #1's comments, please try to condense the Discussion further if possible, but more importantly, it would be nice to see a brief conclusion to wrap up the paper. Reviewer #2's comments are more technical in nature and require careful consideration. Reviewer #3 is fully satisfied.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript has greatly improved. I appreciate the level of detail the authors used to incorporate reviewer suggestions. In particular, the Introduction now prepares the readers for work discussed in the following sections. I feel the Discussion section is still a bit long and abruptly ends, however I recommend this manuscript for publication. One small note, in subsection “Distribution of resilin in the energy stored of adult planthoppers”, family names are used, rather than the common names used prior to these sentences. It would be helpful to add the common names here so readers not versed in insect taxonomy can follow.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors clearly improved the manuscript. However, there are still a few inconsistencies in the context of the confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) visualizations. These are described below.</p><p>1) In the first version of the manuscript, the authors wrote “For the imaging of Calcofluor white and Acridine Orange- stained cuticle, laser lines of 405 and 488 nm were used, respectively.” Based on this description, I assumed that the exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin had in all cases been visualized by using Calcofluor White M2R and that the exoskeleton parts with large proportions of resilin had in all cases been visualized by using Acridine Orange. And I was already wondering for which visualization the authors had used the autofluorescence that was mentioned in the sentence (but mentioned nowhere else). In the current version of the manuscript, the description is different. The authors now write “For the imaging of Acridine Orange- stained cuticle, laser lines of 405 and 488 nm were used. Autofluorescence of chitin was recorded in the 410-465 nm range;.…” And Calcofluor White M2R is now mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1</xref>) in the context of the visualization of muscles and exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin (subsection “Imaging and rendering) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2</xref>) in the lines where the authors write 'In preparations where the 405 nm laser-induced autofuorescence of exoskeletal elements, such as fine tendons in nymphs, was not strong, a chitin-binding dye Calcofluor White (0.1 mg/ml, Σ-Aldrich, F3543-1G) was included in the staining procedure.' These descriptions make the reader think that the exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin were visualized mainly by using autofluorescence and only in the case of too low autofluorescence intensities by using Calcofluor White M2R. Which version is correct? In this context, I have the following questions:</p><p>a) Why did the authors use an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and why did they detect fluorescence light with wavelengths of 410-465 nm to visualize exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin? The application of quite similar settings (405 nm and 420-480 nm) had been demonstrated to result in the visualization of exoskeleton parts with large proportions of resilin (see Michels and Gorb 2012) but not in the visualization of exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin. (In a comparable way, the authors used excitation wavelengths of 352-402 nm and detected fluorescence light with wavelengths of 417-477 nm for their wide-field fluorescence microscopy visualization of the resilin autofluorescence (Subsection “Sample preparation”).) Accordingly, with these settings, the authors did very likely not visualize exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin.</p><p>b) In subsection “Imaging and rendering”, the authors write 'Autofluorescence of cuticle was excited with a 561 nm laser line.' This autofluorescence is also mentioned in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. However, it is mentioned nowhere else, and the authors do not describe for which visualization this autofluorescence was used.</p><p>2) The authors did not really be responsive to my concerns about the large probability of crosstalk having occurred during the CLSM visualizations. They included information about the detected fluorescence wavelengths in the manuscript, and it is now obvious that the applied detection settings had very likely resulted in the occurrence of crosstalk during the CLSM analyses. For example, the Acridine Orange fluorescence, which was used to visualize the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin, was visualized by applying an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and by detecting fluorescence light with wavelengths of 520-580 nm. However, these settings are very appropriate to also visualize an autofluorescence that is typically excited by weakly or non-sclerotised exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin (see Michels and Gorb 2012). Accordingly, the authors cannot be sure that they only visualized structures with large proportions of resilin. In the case of the Calcofluor White M2R fluorescence, which was used to visualize the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin, a similar problem exists: this fluorescence was visualized by applying an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and by detecting fluorescence light with wavelengths of 410-570 nm. With these settings, the autofluorescence of resilin was included in the visualization (see above), and the authors cannot be sure that they only visualized structures with large proportions of chitin.</p><p>It is now of course not possible to get rid of this 'crosstalk problem' anymore. The fluorescences of fluorescence dyes are often much more intense than autofluorescences. In such situations, the proportions of autofluorescences within the fluorescence signal can be minor, and it can happen that the autofluorescences do not negatively affect the analyses. In my opinion, it seems that this was the case in the present study. The results are convincing, and it seems that crosstalk did not play an important role and have a negative effect. However, the authors should mention crosstalk. They should include a statement saying that with the CLSM settings that they applied crosstalk might have occurred but, because of the relatively high intensities of the dye fluorescences compared to those of the autofluorescences, very likely did not negatively influence the results.</p><p>3) The authors should remove the sub-figures Aiii and Biii from the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> because of the inconsistencies regarding the correct visualization of the resilin autofluorescence (see above). Based on the appearance of these sub-figures, I cannot imagine that the respective results are correct.</p><p>4) In the subsection “Imaging and rendering”, the authors should not use the term 'contamination'.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Michels J, Gorb SN (2012) Detailed three-dimensional visualization of resilin in the exoskeleton of arthropods using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Journal of Microscopy 245, 1-16</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The main shortcoming of the original submission was that the text was rather dry and written in a mostly descriptive context based on the visualized morphology. It is worth noting the morphology is some of the most visually stunning, cutting edge, high-resolution imaging I've seen at this scale and therefore is a substantial contribution on its own. However, the paper is now much improved. In particular the new sections in the Discussion elevate the paper beyond descriptive morphology and begin to contextualized the anatomical features in a more mechanical and functional framework. The authors have addressed all of my concerns. I am confident that this paper is a substantial and important contribution.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Three dimensional reconstruction of energy stores for jumping in planthoppers and froghoppers from confocal laser scanning microscopy&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Although it is true that 3D glasses are cheap and readily available online, the reality is that some (likely many) readers will not have them on hand, and perhaps won't take the time to order them for a single usage. Thus, providing the images will increase the accessibility of the article.

For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> includes both 3D and 2D versions, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> does not. So, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref> should be provided as two-dimensional versions in the Appendix. Please amend the figure legends accordingly, to indicate that 2D versions can be found in the Appendix.

The only new method is the staining of resilin with acridine orange, suggesting that the manuscript would benefit most from a stronger focus on the research results. Reviewer #1 has some nice suggestions on how to accomplish such a re-focusing.</italic></p><p>We have revised the paper so that it is now focused on the scientific results concerning how energy is stored for jumping and have followed the very helpful comments of reviewer 1. We have removed all comments about new techniques. The Introduction now poses three questions about how the storage devices for jumping store and release energy that are then followed through in the same order in Results and the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Further details are required to understand the effectiveness of the use of acridine orange for identifying resilin and to justify why this was required compared to autofluorescence (see reviewer #2).</italic></p><p>We have included a supplementary figure that directly addresses this issue. It shows a lack of sufficient dominance of blue fluorescence from resilin over chitin autofluorescence in planthopper and froghopper pleural arches when using the imaging regime suggested by the reviewer and described in Michels and Gorb, 2012. The absence of contrast between those structural elements necessitated the use of staining. The figure also shows side-by-side comparison of wide-field fluorescence micrograph of the resilin autofluorescence in planthopper and froghopper energy stores and the results of Acridine Orange staining imaged with CLSM. We hope the figure convincingly demonstrates colocalization of the characteristic autofluorescence signal and Acridine Orange staining.</p><p><italic>3) The more familiar language of levers and mechanical advantage when discussing the findings (see reviewer #3).</italic></p><p>We have changed the language we have used in describing lever arms and mechanical advantages to that suggested by reviewer 3 throughout the paper. We have consulted a mechanical engineer to ensure that our descriptions are correct, and have checked carefully for consistency.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>This paper provides an interesting and necessary contribution to current work on the jumping of insects, specifically those who use gears. The image quality, detail, and presentation is stunning.</italic></p><p><italic>I did find the results difficult to read because the Introduction does not prepare the reader for the topics investigated. Specifically, in the Introduction there are three rough hypotheses which are too vague to actually test. I suggest making predictions here instead. Then use these specific predictions to organize your Results and Discussion. For instance, in the first point you mention the thorax, where power generating muscles are located, must be strong enough to withstand high forces. This suggests you will measure strength, perhaps of the exoskeleton? Instead, a prediction related to the anatomical structure of the thorax would be more appropriate based on your results.</italic></p><p><italic>It also needs to be clearer why you looked at adults and nymphs and what their differences are. Furthermore, what are the expected differences between planthoppers and froghoppers? Why use multiple species within each? Where are the images of these other species? Are there ecological/behavioral differences that make these comparisons interesting/important?</italic></p><p>The biology that we have added to the Introduction now explains that nymphal planthoppers but not nymphal froghoppers are adept at jumping like the adults. We have used different species from different families to demonstrate the generalities of the structures and mechanisms within the two groups. The species illustrated are named in each of the figures. The insects analysed were found in similar habitats (but we can’t assume that this is true for the many species that belong to these two groups) and show broadly similar behaviour – particularly as far as jumping – but detailed knowledge is not available in the literature.</p><p><italic>Related to the first two points, certain definitions and details are left out of the Introduction, like resilin, or the ecology of froghoppers, and are included in later sections. Likewise, information on jumping from Burrows would have been useful in the Introduction and would perhaps help formulate predictions (i.e., planthoppers are heavier than froghoppers, expend more energy, etc.).</italic></p><p>We have moved all these points to the Introduction and have expanded some to give the reader a broader background to this study.</p><p><italic>In the Abstract you mention 3D printing of the components, but don't mention this in the manuscript. You are correct that your work could be used for this, but it is not clear how.</italic></p><p>We have deleted this superfluous mention of 3D printing.</p><p><italic>This paper reads a bit like a methods paper (i.e., lacks clear biological predictions), but it has too much detail with regards to the subject (e.g., insect anatomy and structure/function relationships) to be a clear methods paper. Given the data collected, I would prefer this work be focused on structure/function relationships focused around clear predictions.</italic></p><p>We have refocused the paper so that we hope it no longer reads a bit like a methods paper. It was always our intention that the focus was on answering specific questions of how the energy for jumping was stored. We would hope that readers will be encouraged by the power of the methodology we have used when applied to functional analyses of movement.</p><p><italic>Finally, although the 3D image rendering is impressive, not every reader has the ability to view these with 3D glasses. Can you make 2D images available, perhaps in the supporting information files?</italic></p><p>We have agonized over this problem (although the glasses cost only a few pennies from Amazon) but did not know how to resolve it. Your suggestion is very helpful and if the journal would allow us to do this, we would be happy to duplicate the 3D figures in 2D for the supplementary material. But there would of course be a loss of some information that only the glasses could bring out.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>This manuscript describes the structures involved in the energy storage for jumping of planthoppers and froghoppers in great detail. The 3D reconstructions based on confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analyses are impressive and provide in fact, as stated by the authors, 'unprecedented detail'. The manuscript is well written and clearly comprehensible, and it adds significant information to the already existing knowledge of the respective structures published in earlier work of Professor Burrows. However, the following aspects and comments have to be considered in the review process:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors stained the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin using the fluorescence dye Acridine Orange. This dye is well-known and typically applied to stain nucleic acids. The finding that Acridine Orange also stains the protein resilin is surprising and very interesting. Unfortunately, the authors only state that 'The distribution of this staining was then confirmed to be the same as that revealed by the characteristic blue fluorescence of resilin when examined with a sharp-edged (1% transmission limits) excitation band of ultraviolet (UV) light.…' but they do not show this. It is absolutely essential that they clearly demonstrate that resilin can be specifically stained with Acridine Orange. For this purpose, the authors definitely have to show the results of precise analyses revealing that the typical resilin autofluorescence and the fluorescence of Acridine Orange are absolutely colocalised in test samples.</italic></p><p>We have included a supplementary figure showing side-by-side comparison of wide-field fluorescence micrograph of the resilin autofluorescence in planthopper and froghopper pleural arches and the results of Acridine Orange staining imaged with CLSM. In this comparison the natural fluorescence of the resilin matches exactly with the staining with AO. Please note that the differences in the distribution of resilin in planthoppers and froghoppers is also visible in both the autofluorescence images and the AO staining. We hope the figure convincingly demonstrate colocalization of the characteristic autofluorescence signal and Acridine Orange staining.</p><p><italic>2) The authors have to convincingly explain why they decided to fluorescently stain resilin with Acridine Orange. This seems to be not very appropriate because the excitation and emission peaks of the Acridine Orange fluorescence are in the ranges of those of an autofluorescence that is typically exhibited by arthropod exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin. Accordingly, it is very likely that because of crosstalk the exclusive visualization of the Acridine Orange fluorescence and thereby the specific visualization of the structures with large proportions of resilin within exoskeleton samples (which is necessary if exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin and exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin have to be visualized and 3D reconstructed separately as described in the manuscript) are only possible when a precise emission fingerprinting with detailed λ scans and linear unmixing is performed. Why did the authors not use the resilin autofluorescence? In a relatively large number of earlier studies this autofluorescence has been efficiently used to visualize exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin, and it was even demonstrated that a combination of CLSM and an excitation wavelength of 405 nm can be successfully applied to reliably visualize exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin (Michels and Gorb, 2012).</italic></p><p>We have indeed tried to use the imaging procedure described by Michels and Gorb in their beautiful 2012 work, but we were unable to observe a pronounced dominance of blue fluorescence from resilin. We therefore did not obtain satisfactory contrast between highly sclerotized cuticle and resilin in these energy stores. We included the examples of our attempts in the supplementary figure (panel ii). Instead we found out that resilin stains very strongly with relatively dilute solution of Acridine Orange and the emitted fluorescence is overwhelmingly stronger than that of the surrounding chitinous structures. We now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in the supplementary material (see above response to point 1) a very strong correspondence between the distribution of resilin as revealed by its autofluorescence and its staining with AO. It is also advantageous that AO exhibits a more red-shifted fluorescence compared to chitin; collecting emitted light in the 520-580 nm range reduced the chitin autofluorescence component in the registered images. To further reduce the contamination of AO-resilin signal from chitin autofluorescence we adjusted the offset during recording. We have added this further information to the Methods section.</p><p><italic>3) The crosstalk problem mentioned above is also present (and even particularly pronounced) in the case of Fluorescent Brightener 28 (synonym: Calcofluor White M2R) that was applied by the authors to stain chitin in the exoskeleton and to separately visualize the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin. The excitation and emission properties of the fluorescence of Fluorescent Brightener 28 are comparable to those of the autofluorescence of resilin. Accordingly, it is not easy to separate the different fluorescence signals obtained from Fluorescent Brightener 28 and resilin from each other. Such a separation requires a very precise spectral detection system and a rather precise emission fingerprinting with very detailed λ scans and linear unmixing. In case the particular ZEISS LSM 710 applied by the authors for their study is equipped with a 34-channel QUASAR detection unit, the authors had the opportunity to perform such an emission fingerprinting. Unfortunately, in the manuscript they do not explain at all how the fluorescences were detected. (Which emission wavelength ranges were detected?) Why did the authors decide to apply Fluorescent Brightener 28? They could have used an autofluorescence to visualize the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin. For example, many of such exoskeleton structures exhibit a relatively intense autofluorescence when they are exposed to the light of a 561 nm laser. (Many ZEISS LSM 710 systems are equipped with such a laser.) In this context, another question arises: in the Materials and methods section, the authors mention 'Autofluorescence of cuticle was excited with a 562 nm laser line.' (This must be a mistake because such a laser line is definitely not offered by Carl Zeiss Microscopy. I assume that the authors used a 561 nm laser.), however, this autofluorescence is not mentioned anywhere else in the manuscript. What has happened to the results of this autofluorescence visualization?</italic></p><p><italic>In conclusion, the authors have to convincingly explain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1</xref>) why they did not perform their study using the autofluorescence of resilin and either an autofluorescence of the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin or a fluorescence dye staining chitin and featuring excitation and emission properties that are clearly different from those of the autofluorescence of resilin and, therefore, enable to absolutely reliably visualize exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin and exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin separately and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2</xref>) how they coped with the crosstalk problem.</italic></p><p>We were not able to obtain satisfactory separation of the resilin and chitin autofluorescence in adult plant- and froghopper energy stores. The autofluorescence of their highly sclerotised exoskeleton of the adults was intense enough when either excitatory light of 405, 488 or 561 nm was used; when imaging chitinous elements of the pleural arches alone we did use 561 nm laser line (we have corrected our mislabeling of this wavelength). In contrast to the adults, 405 nm laser-induced autofuorescence of exoskeletal elements such as fine tendons in nymphs was not strong enough and we decided to augment it with Calcofluor. The blue-green fluorescence of Clacofluor does not bleed into Texas Red Phalloidin channel and we successfully used this combination of dyes for simultaneous 3-D imaging of exoskeleton and muscles. We did not combine Acridine Orange and Calcofluor, opting instead for 405 nm- excited autofluorescence of chitin (see above). To make our methodology clear we have added a table in the Materials and methods section, listing the stains and wavelengths used to image different tissues.</p><p><italic>4) In the Discussion section of the manuscript, the authors should clearly highlight which advances their 'new methodological approach' made possible. For this purpose, they should properly discuss the new insights into the energy storage structures important for jumping of planthoppers and froghoppers with respect to the knowledge of the respective structures obtained in earlier studies of Professor Burrows.</italic></p><p>We have now deleted all suggestions that this is a new methodological approach and instead focus on the answers that we pose in the Introduction and how these relate to the problems of jumping with such speed and power.</p><p><italic>5) In my opinion, the end of the Discussion section of the manuscript is too abrupt. The authors should add a paragraph with concluding remarks.</italic></p><p>We have rewritten the last section of the Discussion to avoid this abrupt ending. Please see our response to reviewer 2 comment.</p><p><italic>6) In the Abstract, the authors write 'This new methodological approach can illuminate how miniaturized components interact and function in complex movements of small animals with the potential for 3-D printing of relevant structures.' The potential for 3D printing is not mentioned anywhere else in the manuscript. This topic should be included in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We have deleted the mention of 3D printing.</p><p><italic>Reference</italic></p><p><italic>Michels J, Gorb SN (2012) Detailed three-dimensional visualization of resilin in the exoskeleton of arthropods using confocal laser scanning microscopy.

I appreciate the level of detail the authors used to incorporate reviewer suggestions. In particular, the Introduction now prepares the readers for work discussed in the following sections. I feel the Discussion section is still a bit long and abruptly ends, however I recommend this manuscript for publication. One small note, in subsection “Distribution of resilin in the energy stored of adult planthoppers”, family names are used, rather than the common names used prior to these sentences. It would be helpful to add the common names here so readers not versed in insect taxonomy can follow.</italic> </p><p>Our problem is that there are no common names for these two families or their members. A compromise that we have adopted is to call them Derbid planthoppers and Acanaloniid planthoppers which thus includes the family name and the general group name of planthoppers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors clearly improved the manuscript. However, there are still a few inconsistencies in the context of the confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) visualizations. These are described below.</italic></p><p><italic>1) In the first version of the manuscript, the authors wrote “For the imaging of Calcofluor white and Acridine Orange- stained cuticle, laser lines of 405 and 488 nm were used, respectively.” Based on this description, I assumed that the exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin had in all cases been visualized by using Calcofluor White M2R and that the exoskeleton parts with large proportions of resilin had in all cases been visualized by using Acridine Orange. And I was already wondering for which visualization the authors had used the autofluorescence that was mentioned in the sentence (but mentioned nowhere else). In the current version of the manuscript, the description is different. The authors now write “For the imaging of Acridine Orange- stained cuticle, laser lines of 405 and 488 nm were used. Autofluorescence of chitin was recorded in the 410-465 nm range;.…” And Calcofluor White M2R is now mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1</xref>) in the context of the visualization of muscles and exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin (subsection “Imaging and rendering) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2</xref>) in the lines where the authors write 'In preparations where the 405 nm laser-induced autofuorescence of exoskeletal elements, such as fine tendons in nymphs, was not strong, a chitin-binding dye Calcofluor White (0.1 mg/ml, Σ-Aldrich, F3543-1G) was included in the staining procedure.' These descriptions make the reader think that the exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin were visualized mainly by using autofluorescence and only in the case of too low autofluorescence intensities by using Calcofluor White M2R. Which version is correct? In this context, I have the following questions:</italic></p><p>We agree that the first version of our manuscript lacked precision about the imaging procedure of Acridine Orange-stained samples and a different set of samples stained with phalloidin and Calcofluor White. We amended that in the second version, explaining that Acridine Orange and Calcofluor white were never used simultaneously. To make this even clearer we have done three things:</p><p>1) We have reformatted <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> to make clearer the distinction between the staining methods.</p><p>2) We say “In preparations where the 405 nm laser-induced autofuorescence of exoskeletal elements, such as fine tendons in nymphs, was not strong, a chitin-binding dye Calcofluor White (0.1 mg/ml, Σ-Aldrich, F3543-1G) was included in the staining procedure. Acridine orange and Calcofluor White were never used in the same preparation.”</p><p>3) We say “Autofluorescence of chitin was recorded in the 410-465 nm range whereas fluorescence of Acridine Orange was recorded in the 520-580 nm range.”</p><p> <italic>a) Why did the authors use an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and why did they detect fluorescence light with wavelengths of 410-465 nm to visualize exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin? The application of quite similar settings (405 nm and 420-480 nm) had been demonstrated to result in the visualization of exoskeleton parts with large proportions of resilin (see Michels and Gorb 2012) but not in the visualization of exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin. (In a comparable way, the authors used excitation wavelengths of 352-402 nm and detected fluorescence light with wavelengths of 417-477 nm for their wide-field fluorescence microscopy visualization of the resilin autofluorescence (Subsection “Sample preparation”).) Accordingly, with these settings, the authors did very likely not visualize exoskeleton parts with large proportions of chitin.</italic></p><p>We did not notice substantial differences in the distribution of blue, green and red autofluorescence in cuticular samples. Similarly, the boundaries of the detected wavelengths did not have a marked effect on visualization of the energy stores.</p><p>We now say: “We did not notice substantial differences in the distribution of blue, green and red autofluorescence in cuticular samples.”</p><p> <italic>b) In subsection “Imaging and rendering”, the authors write 'Autofluorescence of cuticle was excited with a 561 nm laser line.' This autofluorescence is also mentioned in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. However, it is mentioned nowhere else, and the authors do not describe for which visualization this autofluorescence was used.</italic></p><p>We added a sentence clarifying that red autofluorescence was used for visualization of chitinous elements of energy stores alone (i.e. when muscles and resilin were not simultaneously imaged).</p><p>“Red autoflorescence was preferentially used for visualization of chitinous elements of the energy stores alone (i.e. when muscles and resilin were not simultaneously imaged), as longer wavelengths are less affected by cuticle pigmentation and thickness, yielding a more uniform signal throughout the sample. Autofluorescence of cuticle was excited with a 561 nm laser line and recorded in the 568-683 nm range.”</p><p>We also included the information about using red autofluorescence in relevant figure legends.</p><p><italic>2) The authors did not really be responsive to my concerns about the large probability of crosstalk having occurred during the CLSM visualizations. They included information about the detected fluorescence wavelengths in the manuscript, and it is now obvious that the applied detection settings had very likely resulted in the occurrence of crosstalk during the CLSM analyses. For example, the Acridine Orange fluorescence, which was used to visualize the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of resilin, was visualized by applying an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and by detecting fluorescence light with wavelengths of 520-580 nm. However, these settings are very appropriate to also visualize an autofluorescence that is typically excited by weakly or non-sclerotised exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin (see Michels and Gorb 2012). Accordingly, the authors cannot be sure that they only visualized structures with large proportions of resilin. In the case of the Calcofluor White M2R fluorescence, which was used to visualize the exoskeleton structures with large proportions of chitin, a similar problem exists: this fluorescence was visualized by applying an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and by detecting fluorescence light with wavelengths of 410-570 nm. With these settings, the autofluorescence of resilin was included in the visualization (see above), and the authors cannot be sure that they only visualized structures with large proportions of chitin.</italic></p><p><italic>It is now of course not possible to get rid of this 'crosstalk problem' anymore. The fluorescences of fluorescence dyes are often much more intense than autofluorescences. In such situations, the proportions of autofluorescences within the fluorescence signal can be minor, and it can happen that the autofluorescences do not negatively affect the analyses. In my opinion, it seems that this was the case in the present study. The results are convincing, and it seems that crosstalk did not play an important role and have a negative effect. However, the authors should mention crosstalk. They should include a statement saying that with the CLSM settings that they applied crosstalk might have occurred but, because of the relatively high intensities of the dye fluorescences compared to those of the autofluorescences, very likely did not negatively influence the results.</italic></p><p>We agree that some crosstalk may occur in visualizing the cuticular elements of the energy stores. We already described our approach to reducing the chitin autofluorescence component during visualization of Acridine Orange-stained resilin. We now added the following text for further clarification:</p><p>“Using these wavelengths for visualization of calcofluor white-stained exoskeleton and Acridine Orange (AO) -stained resilin creates the possibility of crosstalk. […]The intensity of AO fluorescence is much stronger than autofluorescence of chitin, however, so that the crosstalk did not play an important role in our analysis of the distribution of resilin and did not impact the results.”</p><p>Our conclusion is thus in agreement with that of the reviewer “because of the relatively high intensities of the dye fluorescences compared to those of the autofluorescences, very likely did not negatively influence the results.”</p><p><italic>3) The authors should remove the sub-figures Aiii and Biii from the '<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>' because of the inconsistencies regarding the correct visualization of the resilin autofluorescence (see above). Based on the appearance of these sub-figures, I cannot imagine that the respective results are correct.</italic></p><p>We have removed panels Aiii and Biii from the supplementary figure and all references to them in the text.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “Imaging and rendering”, the authors should not use the term 'contamination'.</italic></p><p>We replaced “contamination” with “contribution”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
