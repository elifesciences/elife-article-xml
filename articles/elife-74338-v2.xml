c-Jun, and Notch). Fbw7 is a tumor suppressor and tumors often contain mutations in <italic>FBXW7</italic>, the gene that encodes Fbw7. The complexity of its substrate network has obscured the mechanisms of Fbw7-associated tumorigenesis, yet this understanding is needed for developing therapies. We used an integrated approach employing RNA-Seq and high-resolution mapping (cleavage under target and release using nuclease) of histone modifications and TF occupancy (c-Jun and c-Myc) to examine the combinatorial effects of misregulated Fbw7 substrates in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with engineered tumor-associated <italic>FBXW7</italic> null or missense mutations. Both Fbw7 mutations caused widespread transcriptional changes associated with active chromatin and altered TF occupancy: some were common to both Fbw7 mutant cell lines, whereas others were mutation specific. We identified loci where both Jun and Myc were coregulated by Fbw7, suggesting that substrates may have synergistic effects. One coregulated gene was <italic>CIITA</italic>, the master regulator of MHC Class II gene expression. Fbw7 loss increased MHC Class II expression and Fbw7 mutations were correlated with increased CIITA expression in TCGA colorectal tumors and cell lines, which may have immunotherapeutic implications for Fbw7-associated cancers. Analogous studies in neural stem cells in which <italic>FBXW7</italic> had been acutely deleted closely mirrored the results in CRC cells. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed Fbw7-associated pathways that were conserved across both cell types that may reflect fundamental Fbw7 functions. These analyses provide a framework for understanding normal and neoplastic context-specific Fbw7 functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>Fbw7</kwd><kwd>Myc</kwd><kwd>Jun</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA080416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thirmanne</surname><given-names>H Nayanga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA215647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clurman</surname><given-names>Bruce E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA015704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clurman</surname><given-names>Bruce E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HG010492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henikoff</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS119650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paddison</surname><given-names>Patrick J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA190957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paddison</surname><given-names>Patrick J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005895</institution-id><institution>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clurman</surname><given-names>Bruce E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide analyses reveal how tumor-associated mutations of the Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase impact oncogenic transcription factors and gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SCFs (Skp1-Cul1-F-box proteins) are multi-subunit ubiquitin ligases that target proteins for degradation through the conjugation of polyubiquitin chains that signal their destruction by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Diehl, 2014</xref>). F-box proteins are SCF substrate receptors and often target proteins for ubiquitylation in response to substrate modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yumimoto and Nakayama, 2020</xref>). The Fbw7 F-box protein binds to substrates after they become phosphorylated within conserved phosphodegron motifs that mediate high-affinity interactions with the Fbw7 Î²-propeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nash et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Orlicky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yumimoto and Nakayama, 2020</xref>). Like its yeast orthologues, Fbw7 functions as a dimer, which influences substrate ubiquitylation and substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kominami et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Welcker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Welcker and Clurman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang and Koepp, 2006</xref>). The Fbw7 F-box binds to Skp1, which allows Fbw7 to bring phosphorylated substrates into proximity with the remainder of the SCF complex. Phosphodegrons vary in their affinity for Fbw7, and this influences substrate binding. High-affinity degrons are sufficient to enable productive binding to monomeric Fbw7, whereas lower affinity substrates bind through the concerted interaction of two degrons, each with one protomer of an Fbw7 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Welcker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Welcker et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Approximately 30 Fbw7 substrates are known. Most are broadly acting transcription factors (TFs) that control processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism, and these include c-Myc, Notch, c-Jun, PGC-1Î±, SREBP1/2, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cremona et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Welcker and Clurman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yumimoto and Nakayama, 2020</xref>). Fbw7 also targets other proteins, most notably cyclin E and MCL-1. Fbw7 exerts its cellular functions through the combined regulation of its many substrates, and different cell types express subsets of substrates that are targeted for degradation by Fbw7 only after they acquire specific phosphorylation. Some substrates (cyclin E and SREBP) are highly Fbw7 dependent, whereas others (e.g., Myc, Jun, and Notch) have multiple turnover pathways and are only regulated by Fbw7 in specific contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrieri and Dale, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lopez-Bergami et al., 2010</xref>). In most cases, glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK-3Î²) is one of the degron kinases, which may allow Fbw7 to coordinately couple its substrate network to mitogenic signals. Some TFs are phosphorylated when they are bound to their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fryer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Punga et al., 2006</xref>), providing another control over their susceptibility to Fbw7-mediated degradation. This complexity has made it difficult to fully ascertain Fbw7 functions, which is compounded by the fact that most substrates are TFs that regulate gene networks themselves.</p><p>Several Fbw7 substrates are oncoproteins, such as c-Myc, cyclin E, c-Jun, and Notch1. Fbw7 loss deregulates these oncoproteins and <italic>FBXW7</italic> is a commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shimizu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yumimoto and Nakayama, 2020</xref>). The most frequent mutations are heterozygous missense mutations, hereafter termed Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup>, that target one of the three arginine residues that form Fbw7âs substrate-binding pocket. Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> weaken substrate binding and are thought to act as dominant negatives by forming impaired Fbw7<sup>R</sup>/Fbw7<sup>WT</sup> heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Welcker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Welcker and Clurman, 2007</xref>). While Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> mutations are common, Fbw7<sup>+/â</sup> mutations are not, suggesting that Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> mutations are not simple loss-of-function mutations, and this is supported by Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> mouse models, which develop tumors to a greater extent than Fbw7<sup>+/â</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2014</xref>). Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> may preferentially disrupt the aspects of Fbw7 function that depend upon fully functional Fbw7 dimers. The âjust enoughâ model posits that Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> reduces activity sufficiently to impair tumor suppressor functions while preserving beneficial Fbw7 activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis and Tomlinson, 2012</xref>). In addition to Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup>, canonical biallelic loss-of-function Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> mutations (e.g., nonsense, truncations, frame shifts, and deletions) also occur in tumors. Different cancers have different mutational spectra; T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemias (T-ALLs) have almost exclusively Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> whereas colorectal cancers (CRCs) have both Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> and Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> mutations. In all cases, tumorigenesis associated with Fbw7 mutations likely involves the concerted activities of multiple oncogenic substrates.</p><p>We assessed the global transcriptional consequences of oncogenic Fbw7 mutations by using RNA-Seq and high-resolution mapping of histone modifications and oncogenic TF (c-Jun and c-Myc, here onwards Jun and Myc) occupancy in isogenic Hct116 CRC cells with engineered Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> and Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> mutations. Both mutations caused widespread, yet highly context-specific transcriptional changes associated with active chromatin and altered TF occupancy. Many deregulated genes and loci were shared between the two mutant cell lines, and the consequences of Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> were generally greater than Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup>. While both mutations impacted small subsets of mapped Jun and Myc loci, there was substantial overlap, and Jun and Myc were coregulated by Fbw7 at these shared binding sites. One coregulated gene was <italic>CIITA</italic> (Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator), the master regulator of MHC Class II gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Masternak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reith et al., 2005</xref>). Jun and Myc occupancy upstream of <italic>CIITA</italic> were increased in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> cells, leading to inappropriate MHC Class II RNA and protein expression. Analyses of TCGA CRC and cell lines further correlated Fbw7 mutations with MHC Class II gene expression, which may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications for Fbw7-associated CRCs. Because Fbw7 regulates neural stem cells (NSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoeck et al., 2010</xref>) and Fbw7 expression is repressed in glioblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hagedorn et al., 2007</xref>), we studied NSCs in which Fbw7 was acutely deleted as an orthogonal system. The consequences of Fbw7 loss in NSCs closely mirrored the Hct116 results in the extent and patterns of transcriptional deregulation. Gene set enrichment analyses of Fbw7-dependent genes revealed extensive conservation between NSCs and Hct116 with respect to biologic processes, which included epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and MHC Class II complex. Overall, these data establish a framework for understanding the mechanisms of Fbw7 function and tumor suppression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fbw7 null and missense mutations lead to distinct gene expression profiles</title><p>We previously engineered a panel of isogenic Hct116 cells by mutating the endogenous wild-type (WT) <italic>FBXW7</italic> locus to either a heterozygous Fbw7<sup>R505C/+</sup> (Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup>) or a homozygous null (Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup>) mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grim et al., 2008</xref>). We performed RNA sequencing to identify the global transcriptome changes arising in both cell lines.

Most nondifferential H3K27ac sites (those unaffected by Fbw7 status) were promoter-proximal, while loci with differential H3K27ac in either Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> or Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> cells fell mostly within introns or intergenic regions (p&lt;0.0001, Fisher test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). To determine whether these differential loci result from the altered binding of known Fbw7 substrates, we performed motif discovery analysis on the central 100-bp sequence of each peak. Strikingly, the AP-1 motif, which is bound by the Jun family, was found in 32% (p&lt;1.8eâ5) of the H3K27ac sites upregulated in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A</xref>).

Differential binding analyses of the Jun and Myc peaks demonstrated that 5.3% and 3.8% of the Jun sites and 2.2% and 3.3% of the Myc sites exhibited differential occupancy in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> and Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>).

Approximately 39% of genes with increased promoter-proximal Jun occupancy and 46% of genes with decreased promoter-proximal Jun occupancy in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> cells exhibited corresponding increases or decreases in RNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Of note, many of the genes with promoter-proximal Jun or Myc sites were either not captured by RNA-Seq or had expression changes that were not statistically significant.

Surprisingly, many of these pathways were the same as those identified in the Hct116 cells, which included EMT- and ECM-related gene sets, the p53 pathway, and MHC Class II genes. Gene sets associated with KLF-binding sites were also highly enriched in upregulated transcripts in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> NSCs, but not in the downregulated transcripts. While the significance of these broadly defined gene sets common to both NSC and Hct116 cells will require both validation and further study, their conservation between these disparate cell types raises the possibility that they represent core normal and neoplastic Fbw7 functions (see Discussion). The most significant enriched genet set in downregulated differential genes was nervous system development, consistent with Fbw7âs role in regulating NSC differentiation. We also compared the specific Fbw7-dependent differential genes in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> NSCs with those in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> Hct116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6âfigure supplement 6</xref>). The gene clusters exhibiting the greatest Fbw7-dependence in each heat map were relatively devoid of genes that were expressed in both cell types, suggesting that the most highly Fbw7 dependent genes were those with cell-type specific expression.</p><p>Jun occupancy in WT and Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> NSCs closely mirrored that seen in the Hct116 cell panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>) in that: (1) only a subset of the Jun binding sites displayed differential occupancy after Fbw7 deletion (8.3% increased and 4.1% decreased) sites, and (2) most of the differentially regulated Jun sites occurred in introns and intergenic regions (p&lt;0.0001, Fisher test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, while most of the specific loci impacted by Fbw7 loss in the Hct116 cells NSCs differed, the scope of Fbw7âs impact on Jun was quite similar. Upregulation of CIITA and MHC Class II expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) after Fbw7 loss was also seen in both Hct116 cells and NSCs. Jun and Myc were bound at regulatory regions upstream of CIITA in NSCs, but only Myc occupancy was increased in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Unlike Hct116 cells, NSC cells express a basal level of CIITA, perhaps consistent with constitutive Jun occupancy upstream of CIITA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4</xref>). RNA-Seq and RT-PCR revealed the increased MHC Class II gene expression after Fbw7 deletion, which also increased MHC Class II protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6âfigure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our overarching goal was to understand the global transcriptional consequences of oncogenic Fbw7 mutations. Overall, Fbw7 loss affected ~10% of expressed genes, which could result from Fbw7 substrates that are sequence-specific TFs or global transcriptional regulators, such as the Mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2013</xref>). However, only relatively small subsets of the mapped H3K27ac and Jun/Myc binding sites were affected by Fbw7 status. What might account for this specificity? Genomic location appears to be one factor, since most differential sites fell within distal regulatory elements. By targeting an enhancer rather than individual promoters, Fbw7 might cooperatively regulate multiple genes via a single regulatory region. However, we do not presently understand why these loci are particularly dependent on Fbw7 function. One possibility is that TF phosphorylation may be restricted to just the differential sites, thereby limiting where Fbw7 functions. If so, we might expect to find Fbw7 bound to these sites, as supported by our data implicating Fbw7 recruitment to chromatin by TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, we have not yet successfully mapped endogenous Fbw7 to specific chromatin sites.</p><p>Only a minority of Jun and Myc binding sites were differentially regulated by Fbw7, but there was substantial overlap and uniform coregulation of the two TFs. That is, in every case where they overlapped, both Jun and Myc occupancy were coordinately increased or decreased by Fbw7 loss. We speculate that Fbw7 regulates transcription at sites such as CIITA through the concerted targeting of both Jun and Myc. The expected outcome of Fbw7 loss is substrate accumulation, and most differential sites had increased occupancy in Fbw7 mutant cells. However, we also found differential sites with decreased Jun or Myc occupancy and correspondingly less mRNA expression in Fbw7 mutant cells. The mechanisms through which Fbw7 loss decreases TF occupancy remain to be elucidated and could involve the many TFs and associated proteins that are targeted by Fbw7. While Myc ubiquitylation impacts transcriptional elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaenicke et al., 2016</xref>), our data do not presently provide insights into how this may contribute to the observed genomic distribution of Fbw7-dependent loci. We examined differential Myc binding sites for specific Myc cellular functions that might be targeted by Fbw7, such as protein synthesis and metabolism. We did not find any evidence for this regulation, but the low number of differential Myc-binding sites that we could link to genes may have limited this analysis.</p><p>Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> mutations may stabilize those substrates that require a fully functional Fbw7 dimer and the subset of transcripts impacted by Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> could thus result from dimer-dependent Fbw7 functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Welcker et al., 2013</xref>). If so, the reduced transcriptional consequences seen in Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells (compared with Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup>) may reflect the regulation of just those substrates impacted by heterozygous Fbw7 missense mutations. Moreover, the many genes and loci with intermediate levels of deregulation in Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells could be consistent with the âjust-enoughâ model of Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> function. We did not find enriched gene sets that were unique to Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells. Instead, most of the enriched gene sets in Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> were also found in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> cells. While the biologic significance of these enriched gene sets requires experimental validation, they suggest that regulation of cancer-associated processes, like EMT, ECM, and cell migration, may be critical and shared consequences of Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> and Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> mutations. The Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> and Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> cells not only shared enriched pathways, but also specific genes assigned to these pathways. For example, 10/17 of the Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> genes assigned to the MSigDB EMT pathway were also found in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> cells, as well as 11/15 Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> genes in the MSigDb p53 pathways set.</p><p>Despite the many differences between our studies in Hct116 cells and NSCs (e.g., cell type, acute versus chronic Fbw7 loss, transformed versus non-transformed cells, and clonal versus non-clonal), the remarkably similar consequences of Fbw7 loss in both cases suggests that these features are fundamental properties of Fbw7âs normal function and its mechanisms of tumor suppression. For example, the extent of Fbw7-dependent changes in transcription, H3K27ac marks, and Jun binding sites was highly conserved between the two cell types, as was the genomic distribution of the Fbw7-regulated differential sites. There was also extensive overlap between the enriched biological processes found in differential transcripts in Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> NSCs and Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup> Hct116 cells. Pathways related to EMT and ECM were the most highly enriched pathways in NSCs, and they were found in both Fbw7 mutant Hct116 cell lines. Pathways related to EMT (e.g., ECM and cell migration) may thus represent core Fbw7 targets in cancer and development that are conserved across disparate cell types. Future studies will focus on identifying the Fbw7 substrate(s) responsible for these findings, which seem likely to reveal new insights into Fbw7 function. Another enriched pathway associated with Fbw7 loss in both NSCs and Hct116 cells involved genes with binding sites for the KLF proteins, a family of TFs with diverse roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. Several KLF proteins are Fbw7 substrates (KLF2/4/5/10/11); these proteins all share the same binding site consensus and function as either repressors and/or activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McConnell and Yang, 2010</xref>). These data implicate KLFs as potential mediators of Fbw7-dependent transcription, and the absence of the KLF motif in downregulated genes may further implicate KLF proteins that are transcriptional activators. Finally, another shared consequence of Fbw7 loss in Hct116 cells and NSCs is slower proliferation, which is likely due to both homeostatic responses (e.g., p53) and intrinsic activities of Fbw7 substrates (e.g., cyclin E). It will thus be important to ascertain how proliferation may relate to the enriched gene sets associated with Fbw7 mutations.</p><p>Constitutive CIITA expression is normally confined to antigen-presenting cells and it was thus striking to find CIITA and MHC Class II genes expressed in Fbw7 mutated colon cancer cells and NSCs. Abnormal CIITA and MHC Class II expression occur in tumors, including CRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Axelrod et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sconocchia et al., 2014</xref>). Aberrant CIITA expression in melanomas results from the activation of both IFNÎ³-inducible and constitutive CIITA promoters, and deletion of the same AP-1 site that we found differentially occupied by Jun in Fbw7 mutant Hct116 cells compromised CIITA expression in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van der Stoep et al., 2007</xref>). The data support a model in which Fbw7 loss augments CIITA expression through increased Jun and Myc occupancy at these regulatory regions.</p><p>What are the implications of Fbw7-dependent CIITA expression in CRCs? Tumor cell-specific MHC Class II expression is generally associated with favorable prognosis, which may be due to increased tumor immunogenicity conferred by MHC Class II expression. Intriguingly, Fbw7 mutations and distant metastasis do not frequently co-occur in CRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muzny et al., 2012</xref>). Fbw7 loss may thus confer better prognosis in CRCs, perhaps due to Fbw7-dependent MHC Class II upregulation. Accordingly, we found increased CIITA expression in TCGA colorectal tumors and CCLE CRC cell lines with Fbw7 mutations. We previously used machine learning to develop gene expression signatures that predicted Fbw7 mutations in TCGA tumors. While we focused on a metabolic gene signature in that study, we also found that a signature comprised of MHC Class II and other genes associated with immune cells was highly predictive of Fbw7 mutations in CRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2018</xref> Supplemental Data set S02). While these analyses were correlative, considering our current finding that Fbw7 loss induces CIITA expression in Hct116 cells and NSCs, we speculate that Fbw7 mutations in CRCs lead to increased CIITA expression, increased immunogenicity, and better prognosis.</p><p>Other associations between Fbw7 and immune responses have also been reported. A recent study found that an Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> mutation conferred resistance to PD-1 blockade through impaired dsRNA sensing and IFNÎ³ signaling in a metastatic melanoma and a murine melanoma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gstalder et al., 2020</xref>). In this case, Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> decreased MHC Class I but not MHC Class II expression and caused a more aggressive phenotype associated with decreased immunogenicity. These discrepancies with our study, which show upregulation of MHC Class II and no impact on MHC Class I, may relate to the different tumor types and/or model systems. In mice, Fbw7 also regulates the tumor microenvironment through a non-tumor-cell-autonomous manner involving the expression of the CCL2 chemokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yumimoto et al., 2015</xref>). Further studies are thus needed to fully appreciate the pathologic and therapeutic implications of Fbw7-related tumor immunogenicity.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note the potential impact of clonal variation on our studies, which involved Hct116 cell clones. Several factors increase our confidence that our findings we describe are directly attributable to Fbw7 status, rather than clonal evolution. First, we found that a large proportion of differential loci and transcripts were shared between the two Fbw7 mutant Hct116 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>), and many of these exhibited a gradient of deregulation that tracked with the severity of the mutations (Fbw7<sup>â/â</sup>&gt;Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup>). Because these cells were independently derived, it is unlikely that these shared features arose stochastically through clonal evolution in each line. Next, we acutely deleted Fbw7 in the orthogonal and non-clonal NSCs to mitigate against this possibility, and the shared consequences of Fbw7 loss (proportion of differential sites and transcripts, intergenic location of differential sites, and shared biological processes) in these two disparate cell systems support the conclusion that these observations reflect shared and direct consequences of Fbw7 loss. Finally, we studied biological replicates of non-clonal NSCs in which Fbw7 was independently inactivated by high-efficiency nucleofection-based CRISPR/Cas9 editing, and the consistent results across these replicates indicate that the differential loci are unlikely to result from âdriftâ phenomena. In future studies, we plan to adopt the strategy of using high-efficiency gene targeting to acutely delete Fbw7 in primary cells, to study other tissues and stem cells. These studies will also allow us to again assess any contributions of clonality.</p><p>In summary, these data establish a framework for understanding the global and context-specific effects of Fbw7 mutations across cell types and cancers, and how Fbw7 substrates may act synergistically to control gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Three replicates per cell type were included for each replicate. Three replicates per cell condition were included in the experiments. Hct116 triplicates were obtained from the same genetically engineered clone; however, they were harvested from separately cultured plates. NSC replicates were generated with two independent CRISPR/Cas9 nucleofections and cultured separately for the three independent samples. RNA quality and integrity were determined (A260/280 1.8â2.1, A260/230&gt;1.7, RINâ¥9). Libraries were prepared by the Fred Hutch Genomics Center using the TruSeq RNA Samples Prep Kit v2 (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 50-bp paired-end reads (PE50). RNA-Seq for U5-NSCs was an exception. Knockouts were generated separately on 2 different days and cells from separate nucleofection reactions were used as the three replicates, hence biological replicates.

affects transcription at the global level is largely unknown. The authors employ RNA-Seq, CUT&amp;RUN on H3K27ac/H3K27me3, and a detailed analysis of the loci affected to provide a global analysis of the effect of Fbw7 mutation on transcription in HCT116 cells as well as neural stem cells. The results reveal complex, but intriguing, results suggesting that Fbw7 mutation affects primarily Jun and Myc functions in distal regulatory regions rather than target gene promoters. Although HCT116 cells employed (WT, Fbw7-/-, and Fbw7R/+) are clonal, there is significant overlap in the two mutant lines, which suggests that a substantial fraction of the effects reflect loss of Fbw7 activity. Analogous patterns related to Jun and Myc levels at distal regulatory regions are seen in the neural stem cells, where there is a pool of depleted cells rather than clonal cells derived from targeted mutagenesis. Intriguingly, gene sets related to epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) were enriched in the upregulated transcripts in both Fbw7-/- and R/+ mutant cells consistent with the idea that Fbw7 targets EMT regulatory proteins for degradation. Additional experiments and analyses performed during revision substantially strengthened this paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74338.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>Wade</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.19.464955">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.19.464955v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Required Experiments</p><p>The reviewer's agreed that the following issues need to be addressed:</p><p>1. All three reviewers noted the issue of the cell lines employed, and it is recognized that the second large-scale experiment in the NSC line provides an alternative validation approach that goes some distance to addressing the limitations to the -/- and R/+ cell lines. Can the authors address: (1) cite data on the abundance for Myc, Jun or other substrates in these cells (point 1-reviewer 1), (2) discuss genes that are differentially regulated in R/+ versus -/- cells (Reviewer 2-point 1), (3) comment on the relationship between Myc target genes involved in protein synthesis (this might be an interesting place to add a new figure panel showing overlap of these classes or proteins), (4) address the extent to which differences in cell type may underlie the precise gene expression features for HCT116 versus NSC cells, (5) given the potential for cell line drift, the authors should add a paragraph/new section in the discussion concerning the limitations of the study and the potential for cell line drift, (6) provide greater experimental detail concerning how the study was performed, especially in regards to the heat maps and data presentation (Point 1-reviewer 3), (7) Could the authors check the abundance of FBXW7 target genes (Point 2-reviewer 3).</p><p>2. Might want to think about modifying or de-emphasizing the &quot;just enough&quot; model, given the comments of reviewers 2 and 3.</p><p>3. The authors show asssess HLA gene expression to validate the changes observed, due to the very low FPKMs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper examines the effect of mutation of FBXW7 on the transcriptional program in HCT116 cells. FBXW7 is a substrate specific adaptor of an SCF ubiquitin ligase, and is known to control the abundance of several transcriptional regulators including Jun and Myc. FBXW7 is also a tumor suppressor and one mutation â (R505C) â blocks substrate blocks substrate binding through a dimerization-dependent dominant negative mechanism.</p><p>Initial RNA Seq experiments demonstrated altered expression of numerous genes in FBXW7 KO or R/+ cells, including changes in expression of MHC class II protein complex genes, among others. Overall, ~10% of all expressed genes displayed changes in expression when Fbw7 was mutated. Genome wide, H3K27ac levels (by CUT&amp;RUN) correlated with gene expression while H3K27me3 was anti-correlated. Many of the regulated genes had motifs that would be consistent with regulation by Jun/AP-1, which fits with the specificity of FBXW7 targeting. This regulation appears to reflect, at least in part, the ability of FBXW7 to interact with candidate substrates on chromatin, as the R/R homozygous point mutant that blocks substrate association failed to associate with chromatin. There was also alterations in the occupancy of Myc and Jun at specific loci but this reflected a small proportion of potential loci, indicating that the effects are specific as opposed to global. These sites were primarily localized near distal regulatory regions. The occupancy for Jun, and to a lesser extent Myc, correlated with expression for a substantial portion of the genes.</p><p>The authors drill down a bit on the MHC class II genes. The CHIP analysis of Jun and Myc are consistent with more protein being present at these promoters.</p><p>The authors propose a couple of mechanisms that could explain the complex regulation â cooperative regulation of multiple genes via a single regulatory region, or transcription factor phosphorylation only occurring at specific gene regulatory loci, which would allow only selected pools of protein to be degraded (an interesting hypothesis). Also, the coordinate effects on Jun and Myc seem very strong, and are consistent with a common regulatory mechanism.</p><p>One potential limitation of the study is that the authors employed single clones of Fbw7-/- and R/+ mutant cells. However, they also performed a completely orthogonal analysis of neural stem cells, which are known to exhibit Fbw7-dependent Jun regulation. These cells were subjected to CRISPR to inactivate Fbw7 in a pooled population. Overall there were similar effects on transcriptional impact and some of the same GO terms were altered as with Fbw7-/- cells. There was also effects on genomic loci for Jun binding that mirrored the situation with HCT116 cells in terms of being in regulatory regions outside the loci. However, the genes affected were distinct. This potentially reflects the extremely different types of cells being used. In addition, through analysis of the R/+ mutant, the authors found a substantial (35-48%) overlap in regulated Jun sites, although the magnitude of the effects was generally smaller than with the knock-out. This could potentially reflect small amounts of activity of the R/+ heterodimer or possibly low levels of WT homodimer present in these cells. It seems likely that the sites affected in both the KO and the R/+ mutants reflect the major target genes for Fbw7-mediated control. Finally, the concordance between the behavior of Myc and Jun was striking.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have no major criticisms of the manuscript data or conclusions but offer a few thoughts for consideration:</p><p>1. I am not convinced the data makes a clear case for the &quot;just enough&quot; model because a +/- control was not included. This isn't a major issue for the study overall but without this control it is hard to say if the differences between the R/+ and -/- are due to dosage or dominant negative effects. Is there any published (or unpublished) data the authors can cite on the actual abundance effects of the R/+ mutation versus the -/+ and -/-mutations on MYC, JUN or other substrates?</p><p>2. It is noted on p16 that some genes more impacted in R/+ compared to -/- cells but there is very little discussion of these genes or their characteristics. Given the focus on the R/+ mutation, some further discussion is warranted.</p><p>3. In Figure 3, were the MYC sites enriched for protein synthetic genes, given that this is a major target class for MYC?</p><p>4. To augment the GO term analysis, it would be helpful to list example top regulated genes for main classes, e.g., for cholesterol biosynthesis. Also there appears to be no comment on the strongest differentially affected genes, e.g., Figure 1B. A brief description would give a better sense of the complexity of the signatures. Are there any obvious cancer correlations for these genes?</p><p>5. The comparison between HCT116 and the NSC line is a strong point of the manuscript and while the general scale of gene expression changes is similar, it is notable that there is little overlap between the signatures except for MHC class II genes. The authors should comment on whether this is due to intrinsic cell type effects on gene expression and TF binding (i.e., are the genes expressed and do the TFs bind in the wild type cells) or is it actually due to differential regulation of occupied sites upon mutational perturbation of FBXW7?</p><p>6. A brief mention of cell line adaptation to the respective mutations is warranted as a caveat since it is possible the profiles may have been altered as cells adapted. Is there a differential growth defect between wild type, R/+ and -/-? If so, this should be mentioned and documented. On a related note, was there any sign of an apoptotic signature? Excess MYC and JUN might have been expected to trigger an apoptotic response.</p><p>7. There is little discussion or analysis of the somewhat surprising apparent loss of TF binding and gene repression at a large number of loci. Can the authors comment on this in a bit more detail, e.g., elaborate on the Ub modification in MYC-mediated transactivation? Similarly, it isn't clear why proximal promoter binding sites for MYC and JUN seem not to be affected whereas intronic and intergenic regions are.</p><p>8. The nomenclature (Fbw7 for protein FBXW7 for gene) is a bit confusing and should be explained at the first instance. Why not use consistent names for the gene and protein?</p><p>9. FBXW7 could be described as a super-hub of sorts since it controls many hub transcription factors including JUN and MYC. This regulatory hierarchy is in part what makes the study so interesting.</p><p>10. The authors could also mention E3 redundancy as a mechanism that might temper FBXW7 loss of function profiles.</p><p>11. Dimerization of FBWX7 in the introduction should be cited both for the authors' own work in human cells and preceding work in yeast. It is important to note that not all substrates require dimerization for recognition and this help could account for differences between the -/- and R/+ mutants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1C: The details of the experimental design are not clearly described, which hinders understanding and evaluation of this study. The heatmap appears to show three samples for each genotype (WT, R/+, -/-). Does this mean three independent cell lines were used for each genotype (i.e. biological replicate)? Or does it mean three independent sequencing of one cell line for each genotype (i.e. technical replicates)? If the latter, the authors need to be very careful in interpreting the results. This is because although recent advances in the CRISPR-Cas9 system have facilitated genome editing in cell lines, it has become increasingly clear that even in cell lines, clonal variation is significant and cannot be ignored. In this case, the differences in the transcriptional landscape may reflect mere clonal variation rather than the state of Fbw7. The same problem is also present in Figure 3F and 6A.</p><p>2. In each clone of Fbw7(R/+) and Fbw7(-/-) HCT116 cells, determine the extent to which endogenous Myc, Jun, and SREBP are increased compared to WT cells. Also, check for accumulation of NICD, KLF5, and TGIF1, which are transcription factors that are known to be affected in the intestine by loss or mutation of Fbw7. If they could also include data from Fbw7(+/-) cells, it might reinforce their claims of the &quot;just enough&quot; model.</p><p>3. It is questionable whether MHC class II is functional in Fbw7(-/-) HCT116 cells, given that the FPKM value of CIITA does not reach 1. The FPKM value is also very low (below 1) for half of the genes detected as MHC class II protein complex genes by GO analysis (HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DOA, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DPA1). The authors need to prove that the gene cluster of MHC class II enriched in Fbw7(-/-) HCT116 cells is indeed expressed at the protein level and is functional.</p><p>4. The most dramatic change in this paper is the enrichment of extracellular matrix organization in Figure 6B, which the authors barely mention in the text. The authors should examine and discuss which substrate is responsible for this change and how it is affected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74338.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Required Experiments</p><p>The reviewer's agreed that the following issues need to be addressed:</p><p>1.

Can the authors address: (1) cite data on the abundance for Myc, Jun or other substrates in these cells (point 1-reviewer 1),</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively studied substrates in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> and Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> Hct116 cells and apologize that these citations were not clear (Grim et al., <italic>J Cell Biol</italic>, 2008; Welcker et al., <italic>Genes Dev</italic>, 2013; Davis et al., <italic>PNAS</italic>, 2018; Welcker et al., <italic>Sci Adv</italic>, 2022). Myc is stabilized in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> Hct116 cells but exhibits only small changes in steady-state abundance because it represses its own transcription. Myc is partially stabilized in Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells, which likely reflects the role of Fbw7 dimers and the concerted binding of two Myc degrons with dimeric Fbw7 (Welcker et al., <italic>Sci Adv</italic>, 2022). Others have found that Fbw7-dependent Jun turnover in Hct116 cells is regulated by Rack, BLM, and Usp28, but we find minimal impact of Fbw7 loss on Jun abundance (Davis et al., <italic>PNAS</italic>, 2018) and now cite this result. We studied Jun here because its binding site was enriched in active chromatin in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> cells. In response to this question, we re-examined Jun turnover using <sup>35</sup>S-methionine metabolic pulse chases, the most rigorous approach. We again found modest Jun stabilization in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> cells, but this has proven challenging to quantitate: the turnover is bi-phasic and the signal-to-noise quickly deteriorates despite using copious amounts of radiolabel. Jun also turns over in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> cells through other pathways. We suspect that Jun turnover by Fbw7 is highly context-specific, which agrees with our conclusions in this paper. We do not have enough confidence in these data to include them in the paper and will not pursue this approach further.</p><p>Reviewer 3 asks about other substrates implicated in intestinal neoplasia (Notch, SREBP, TGIF, KLF5). These (and other) substrates certainly contribute to Fbw7-associated tumorigenesis, but we have not studied them here because they were not implicated in our results. Notch is minimally elevated in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> Hct116 cells (Davis et al., <italic>PNAS</italic>, 2018) and cytoplasmically regulated in Fbw7Î²<sup>-/-</sup> Hct116 cells (Sancho et al., <italic>PLoS Biol</italic>, 2013). TGIF abundance is increased in both Hct116 Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> and Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells (Davis et al., <italic>PNAS</italic>, 2018). We agree with the Reviewer that TGIF is likely very important in Fbw7-associated colorectal cancer. SREBP is stabilized in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> Hct116 cells and is dimer-dependent (Welcker et al., <italic>Genes Dev</italic>, 2013). We have not studied KLF5, but others found it stabilized in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> Hct116 cells (Liu et al., <italic>JBC</italic>, 2010) and in Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> mice (Davis et al., <italic>J Path</italic>, 2011). We will study the role of these substrates in the phenotypes we describe but this is beyond the paperâs scope.</p><p>We addressed this point by clarifying the requested citations (lines 231-242).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Discuss genes that are differentially regulated in R/+ versus -/- cells (Reviewer 2-point 1),</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this (and related) comments, we re-evaluated differential gene expression in Fbw7 mutant Hct116 cells (and NSCs, see below). These analyses have proven illuminating and provocative, and we thank the reviewers and editor for these suggestions. We revised the analyses to: (1) study more stringently selected differential genes, and (2) identify and compare enriched gene sets in these differential genes more comprehensively. The heat map in Figure 1C depicts gene clusters that are either uniquely differential in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> or Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells, or common to both mutants. While we initially used Enrichr to analyze these unsupervised hierarchically clustered gene sets, we have now manually retrieved the statistically significant differential genes from the source data to run on Enrichr. We also separately analyzed the up- or downregulated genes in each mutant, examined classifications in addition to Gene Ontology (e.g., MSigDB, JASPAR), and included all gene sets with adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05. Finally, because these gene set classifications are broad and overlapping, we eliminated those with &gt;40% overlapping genes. These new analyses are summarized in new Figures 1D and 6B, and the full list of enriched sets and their specific genes are found in new Figure 1 â source data 3 and Figure 6 â source data 3.</p><p>We now appreciate that most of the enriched biological processes are common to both Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> and Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells. There is also surprising conservation with NSCs (see below). Furthermore, many of the same specific genes are assigned to shared gene sets in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> and Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells. In contrast, the MHC Class II gene set is specific to the Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> cells. The most enriched gene sets in the upregulated genes include the p53 pathway (see Reviewer 2-point 6) and processes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While we initially reported the latter as extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated genes (based on GO), we now interpret it as reflecting EMT, which may also include related gene sets (e.g., ECM, cell mobility). Fbw7 targets several EMT regulators (e.g., Zeb 1/2, Snail, LSD1) and given the conservation across Hct116 and NSC systems, EMT may be a more important aspect of Fbw7 function and its loss in cancer than we had previously realized. There are fewer enriched gene sets in the downregulated differential transcripts in Fbw7 mutant cells, which include TNF/NF-ÎºB (perhaps associated with regulation of p100 NF-ÎºB2 by Fbw7), signaling pathways (e.g., estrogen), and inflammation, which may be related to the IFN/dsRNA inhibition reported by Gstalder et al., (<italic>Can Disc</italic>, 2020).</p><p>As suggested by Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3, we also looked for Fbw7 TF substrates that might underlie these pathways. The motif for KLF TFs was highly enriched in the upregulated genes, but not in downregulated genes (new Figure 1D and 6B). Several KLF proteins are Fbw7 substrates (KLF2/5/10/13); these proteins share a consensus binding site and function as repressors or activators. These data may further implicate the KLF family as an important mediator of Fbw7 function, and the motifâs absence in the downregulated genes may implicate KLF transcriptional activators. Despite the Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup>-specific differential transcripts (clusters 5 and 6, Figure 1C), we did not find gene sets enriched in only Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells. Keeping in mind the many caveats inherent in these types of analyses, the enriched gene sets shared between Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> and Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells may reflect common consequences of the two types of Fbw7 mutations. We considered the 50 most highly differential genes in Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells as suggested but did not find any obvious insights.</p><p>We responded to this point by: (1) performing new and extended Enrichr analyses (Figures 1C and 6B, Figure 1 â source data 3, Figure 6 â source data 3), and (2) multiple text revisions (lines 135-162, 391-405, 477-500).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Comment on the relationship between Myc target genes involved in protein synthesis (this might be an interesting place to add a new figure panel showing overlap of these classes or proteins),</p></disp-quote><p>We specifically examined expression and Myc occupancy of Myc target genes with roles in protein synthesis (Table 1, Ruggero, <italic>Cancer Res</italic>, 2009), but they were unaffected by Fbw7 status. Given the small proportion of Myc binding sites impacted by Fbw7 loss (and even fewer that could be linked with genes), this may not be surprising. Of note, we previously described the metabolic consequences of Fbw7 loss in Hct116 cells (Davis et al., <italic>PNAS</italic>, 2018). In contrast to Myc-associated Warburg metabolism, Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> and Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells exhibited increased oxidative phosphorylation without activation of Myc metabolic target genes, consistent with the current conclusion that Myc function is not globally augmented by Fbw7 loss (in these cells).</p><p>We responded to this point with new text in the Discussion (lines 457-461).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Address the extent to which differences in cell type may underlie the precise gene expression features for HCT116 versus NSC cells,</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this point in two ways. First, as described above, we compared the enriched gene sets in Fbw7 mutant NSCs and Hct116 cells. Despite the differences between the two cell systems (e.g., stable versus acute Fbw7 deletion, cell type, transformed versus primary, clonal versus non-clonal), they shared many enriched pathways, suggesting substantial conservation of Fbw7-dependent processes (new Figure 6B, Figure 6 â source data 3). This concept is perhaps the most significant change in our revision and may open new and important directions. Second, we used hierarchical clustering to compare the differentially expressed genes in NSCs and Hct116 cells (new Figure 6 âfigure supplement 6A, 6B). This analysis showed that: (1) some differential genes in one cell type are not expressed/captured in the other cell type, and (2) cell-type specific differential genes were the most differential genes within that cell type (e.g., differential genes specific to Hct116 cells had the highest log<sub>2</sub>FC compared to differential genes expressed in both Hct116 and NSCs (Wilcoxon test: p-value = 5.33e-16)).</p><p>We responded to this point by: (1) performing new gene set enrichment analyses and comparisons with the Hct116 cells (Figure 1C and Figure 6B), (2) comparing the differential genes in Hct116 and NSCs (Figure 6 âfigure supplement 6), and (3) with new text (lines 135-162, 391-405, 477-500).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given the potential for cell line drift, the authors should add a paragraph/new section in the discussion concerning the limitations of the study and the potential for cell line drift,</p></disp-quote><p>This issue was important to all three Reviewers. We share this concern and had tried to mitigate it in several ways. As requested, we added the following paragraph to the revised Discussion:</p><p>âFinally, it is important to note the potential impact of clonal variation on our studies that involved Hct116 cell clones. Several factors increase our confidence that our findings we describe are directly attributable to Fbw7 status, rather than clonal evolution. First, we found that a large proportion of differential loci and transcripts were shared between the two Fbw7 mutant Hct116 cell lines (Figure 1C and 4A), and many of these exhibited a gradient of deregulation that tracked with the severity of the mutations (Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> &gt; Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup>). Because these cells were independently derived, it is unlikely that these shared features arose stochastically through clonal evolution in each line. Next, we acutely deleted Fbw7 in the orthogonal and non-clonal NSCs to mitigate against this possibility, and the shared consequences of Fbw7 loss (proportion of differential sites and transcripts, intergenic location of differential sites, shared biological processes) in these two disparate cell systems support the conclusion that these observations reflect shared and direct consequences of Fbw7 loss. Finally, we studied biological replicates of non-clonal NSCs in which Fbw7 was independently inactivated by high efficiency nucleofection-based CRISPR/Cas9 editing, and the consistent results across these replicates indicates that the differential loci are unlikely to result from âdriftâ phenomena. In future studies, we plan to adapt the strategy of using high-efficiency gene targeting to acutely delete Fbw7 in primary cells, to study other tissues and stem cells. These studies will also allow us to again assess any contributions of clonalityâ.</p><p>We responded to this point with new text in the Discussion (lines 536-553).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Provide greater experimental detail concerning how the study was performed, especially in regards to the heat maps and data presentation (Point 1-reviewer 3),</p></disp-quote><p>For Hct116 cells, the RNA-Seq and CUT&amp;RUN experiments included three independent replicates of one clone for each genotype (Figure 1C and 3F). Each sample was harvested from a separately cultured plate and independently processed throughout an experiment. The NSCs are primary cells. Fbw7-deleted NSC replicates were generated with two independent high efficiency CRISPR/Cas9 nucleofections that did not involve selection or cloning. NSCs were cultured for less than 2 weeks prior to use for the experiments.</p><p>We responded to this point with new text Methods (lines 561-565, 592-595) and legends in Figures 1, 3 and 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Could the authors check the abundance of FBXW7 target genes (Point 2-reviewer 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified with the Reviewing Editor that this question refers to the substrates that we have discussed in point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Might want to think about modifying or de-emphasizing the &quot;just enough&quot; model, given the comments of reviewers 2 and 3.</p></disp-quote><p>In hindsight, we inadvertently emphasized the âjust enoughâ model in this paper. We did not perform this study to address this model. Rather, the differential transcripts and loci in both mutant genotypes that were intermediately impacted in the missense cells reminded us of the âjust-enough modelâ. That is, they seemed to be molecular examples of the reduced severity of the missense mutation, which is the crux of âjust enoughâ. We qualified the revised text and deleted the statement supporting âjust enoughâ from the introduction (original lines 106-108).</p><p>We responded to this point with text edits to de-emphasize this point (deleted intro text, new text lines 464-468).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors show asssess HLA gene expression to validate the changes observed, due to the very low FPKMs.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this in several ways. First, we performed the requested qPCR in both cell types, which closely matches and validates the HLA class II gene expression seen in the RNA-Seq data (new Figure 5C and new Figure 6F). We also used flow cytometry to detect Class II HLA proteins on the surface of Hct116 cells, which revealed increased, but heterogeneous, expression (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2, Figure 6 âfigure supplement 5). This heterogeneity could reflect either assay sensitivity or variable expression, and it is also seen in NSCs. We do not yet understand the reason for the heterogeneous expression. We recently performed a single cell RNA-Seq experiment in NSCs, which suggested that CIITA expression is heterogeneous. We will pursue these studies, but they are outside the scope of our current paper. Finally, immunoblotting revealed increased HLA Class II protein expression after Fbw7 deletion in both cases (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2, Figure 6 âfigure supplement 5).</p><p>We responded to this point with: (1) new quantitative RT-PCR data (Figure 5C and 6F) (2) new flow cytometry and immunoblotting data (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2, Figure 6 âfigure supplement 5), and (3) new text (lines 343-353, 417-418).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper examines the effect of mutation of FBXW7 on the transcriptional program in HCT116 cells. FBXW7 is a substrate specific adaptor of an SCF ubiquitin ligase, and is known to control the abundance of several transcriptional regulators including Jun and Myc. FBXW7 is also a tumor suppressor and one mutation â (R505C) â blocks substrate blocks substrate binding through a dimerization-dependent dominant negative mechanism.</p><p>Initial RNA Seq experiments demonstrated altered expression of numerous genes in FBXW7 KO or R/+ cells, including changes in expression of MHC class II protein complex genes, among others. Overall, ~10% of all expressed genes displayed changes in expression when Fbw7 was mutated. Genome wide, H3K27ac levels (by CUT&amp;RUN) correlated with gene expression while H3K27me3 was anti-correlated. Many of the regulated genes had motifs that would be consistent with regulation by Jun/AP-1, which fits with the specificity of FBXW7 targeting. This regulation appears to reflect, at least in part, the ability of FBXW7 to interact with candidate substrates on chromatin, as the R/R homozygous point mutant that blocks substrate association failed to associate with chromatin. There was also alterations in the occupancy of Myc and Jun at specific loci but this reflected a small proportion of potential loci, indicating that the effects are specific as opposed to global. These sites were primarily localized near distal regulatory regions. The occupancy for Jun, and to a lesser extent Myc, correlated with expression for a substantial portion of the genes.</p><p>The authors drill down a bit on the MHC class II genes. The CHIP analysis of Jun and Myc are consistent with more protein being present at these promoters.</p><p>The authors propose a couple of mechanisms that could explain the complex regulation â cooperative regulation of multiple genes via a single regulatory region, or transcription factor phosphorylation only occurring at specific gene regulatory loci, which would allow only selected pools of protein to be degraded (an interesting hypothesis). Also, the coordinate effects on Jun and Myc seem very strong, and are consistent with a common regulatory mechanism.</p><p>One potential limitation of the study is that the authors employed single clones of Fbw7-/- and R/+ mutant cells. However, they also performed a completely orthogonal analysis of neural stem cells, which are known to exhibit Fbw7-dependent Jun regulation. These cells were subjected to CRISPR to inactivate Fbw7 in a pooled population. Overall there were similar effects on transcriptional impact and some of the same GO terms were altered as with Fbw7-/- cells. There was also effects on genomic loci for Jun binding that mirrored the situation with HCT116 cells in terms of being in regulatory regions outside the loci. However, the genes affected were distinct. This potentially reflects the extremely different types of cells being used. In addition, through analysis of the R/+ mutant, the authors found a substantial (35-48%) overlap in regulated Jun sites, although the magnitude of the effects was generally smaller than with the knock-out. This could potentially reflect small amounts of activity of the R/+ heterodimer or possibly low levels of WT homodimer present in these cells. It seems likely that the sites affected in both the KO and the R/+ mutants reflect the major target genes for Fbw7-mediated control. Finally, the concordance between the behavior of Myc and Jun was striking.</p></disp-quote><p>We are also interested in the function of Fbw7Î² and even made Fbw7Î²<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which have no phenotype (yet). We searched the genes in the ER term for shared TF substrates but didnât find any. We also expect that a TF substrate would be targeted in the nucleus by Fbw7Î±.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>4. To augment the GO term analysis, it would be helpful to list example top regulated genes for main classes, e.g., for cholesterol biosynthesis. Also there appears to be no comment on the strongest differentially affected genes, e.g., Figure 1B. A brief description would give a better sense of the complexity of the signatures. Are there any obvious cancer correlations for these genes?</p></disp-quote><p>All of the specific genes in the gene sets are shown in Figure 1 â source data 3 and Figure 6 â source data 3. Looking at the very top differential genes, however, did not prove very informative. There is some overlap in the top 50 up (11/50) and down (8/50) deregulated transcripts in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> and Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup> cells, but no obvious shared function or regulation. As discussed above, some enriched pathways are likely to be very important for cancer, such as EMT. The sterol synthesis signature is composed of genes that are modestly decreased in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> Hct116 cells (we had initially combined the up- and downregulated transcripts).</p><p>We responded to this point with new analyses and text (lines 468-476)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. A brief mention of cell line adaptation to the respective mutations is warranted as a caveat since it is possible the profiles may have been altered as cells adapted. Is there a differential growth defect between wild type, R/+ and -/-? If so, this should be mentioned and documented. On a related note, was there any sign of an apoptotic signature? Excess MYC and JUN might have been expected to trigger an apoptotic response.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially made these cells to study the cell cycle and should have discussed this point. We donât see apoptotic responses in either the Hct116 or NSCs, probably because Myc and Jun are not grossly overexpressed. p53-p21 induction is the major homeostatic response to Fbw7 loss. It is strongest in primary fibroblasts (Minella et al., <italic>Oncogene</italic> 2008; Minella et al., <italic>Current Biology</italic>, 2002) and occurs in tumors (Li et al., <italic>Oncogene</italic>, 2015). Cyclin E-CDK2 hyperactivity may be the primary signal to p53 through replication stress. Excess cyclin E activity also inhibits S-phase progression in Fbw7 null cells through its impact on replication dynamics.</p><p>New Figure 1 âfigure supplement 2 shows that Fbw7 mutations in Hct116 cells increase doubling time by 20-25% and modestly increase S-phase fraction (Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> &gt; Fbw7<sup>R/+</sup>). We also see ~two-fold increase in p21 mRNA in both Fbw7 mutant Hct116 cell lines in the RNA Seq data. Figure 6 âfigure supplement 2 shows that Fbw7 deletion in NSCs similarly increases doubling time but with a small decrease in S-phase fraction. We do see enriched gene sets associated with p53 in the Fbw7 mutant cells but not any reflective of significant cell cycle disruption, DNA damage, or apoptosis. It seems unlikely that the cell cycle changes inherent to Fbw7 loss account for any of the transcriptional signatures, except for perhaps the p53 pathway (although many of the nominally âp53 pathwayâ genes are only loosely associated with p53, <italic>per se)</italic>. However, we cannot exclude this possibility, which we now discuss.</p><p>We responded to this point with new analyses of proliferation in Hct116 cells and NSCs (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 2, Figure 6 âfigure supplement 2 and new text lines 146-147, 387-388, 496-500).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. There is little discussion or analysis of the somewhat surprising apparent loss of TF binding and gene repression at a large number of loci. Can the authors comment on this in a bit more detail, e.g., elaborate on the Ub modification in MYC-mediated transactivation? Similarly, it isn't clear why proximal promoter binding sites for MYC and JUN seem not to be affected whereas intronic and intergenic regions are.</p></disp-quote><p>These are important questions that we just donât know the answers to yet. In the case of decreased TF occupancy in Fbw7<sup>-/-</sup> cells, our best guess is that binding partners or other proteins that regulate TF binding (e.g., the CDK8 Mediator subunit) are also affected by Fbw7 mutations, but we donât have any experimental evidence for this idea. Nor do we understand why the promoter proximal sites are relatively insensitive to Fbw7 status. We also suspect that the answer for Myc may lie somewhere in the relationship between Myc ubiquitylation and transcriptional processivity, but these ideas are too nascent to discuss at present.</p><p>We responded to this point with new text in the Discussion (lines 452-457).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The nomenclature (Fbw7 for protein FBXW7 for gene) is a bit confusing and should be explained at the first instance. Why not use consistent names for the gene and protein?</p></disp-quote><p>The gene name is FBXW7, and the protein is correctly called either Fbxw7 or Fbw7. Because we used âFbw7â in other papers, we kept this practice for consistency, and explain the nomenclature in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors could also mention E3 redundancy as a mechanism that might temper FBXW7 loss of function profiles.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed- E3 redundancy is an important factor that we now mentioned in the revision, as suggested (lines 67-69).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Dimerization of FBWX7 in the introduction should be cited both for the authors' own work in human cells and preceding work in yeast. It is important to note that not all substrates require dimerization for recognition and this help could account for differences between the -/- and R/+ mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. As noted, Fbw7 dimerization is a major focus of our work, including a recent paper describing two Myc degrons that bind cooperatively to dimeric Fbw7 (Welcker et al., Sci Advances, 2022). As noted, dimerization is important for other CRLs in mammals (e.g., Î²-TrCP, SPOP, Keap1) and for Fbw7 orthologues (e.g., pop1/2). We expanded our discussion of dimerization, substrate specificity, and R/+ mutations, including with respect to Fbw7 orthologues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>4. The most dramatic change in this paper is the enrichment of extracellular matrix organization in Figure 6B, which the authors barely mention in the text. The authors should examine and discuss which substrate is responsible for this change and how it is affected.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment; it prompted us to re-examine the gene set enrichment analyses. We had not appreciated the possible significance of the ECM gene set enrichment and its conservation across Hct116 and NSCs. As discussed above, we now believe this gene set to be related to EMT, which includes the deposition of ECM proteins and affects other properties such as migration and adherence. We have not found evidence for which TF(s) may be responsible for the expression of the EMT genes. There are several Fbw7 substrates that regulate EMT, including Zeb 1/2. Snail, and LSD1. We have not studied these substrates ourselves but plan to do so. Another possibility involves the PRC2 complex, a major EMT regulator, since EZH2PRC2 is regulated by cyclin E-CDK2. We can assure Reviewer 3 that this has risen high on our priority list and may turn out to be the most significant finding of our study.</p><p>We responded to this point with new text in the Discussion (lines 147-155, 391-399, 477-500).</p></body></sub-article></article>
