stress (ELS) affects males and females differently. However, a growing body of work has shown that sex moderates responses to stress and injury, with important insights into sex-specific mechanisms provided by work in rodents. Unfortunately, most of the ELS studies in rodents were conducted only in males, a bias that is particularly notable in translational work that has used human imaging. Here we examine the effects of unpredictable postnatal stress (UPS), a mouse model of complex ELS, using high resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. We show that UPS induces several neuroanatomical alterations that were seen in both sexes and resemble those reported in humans. In contrast, exposure to UPS induced fronto-limbic hyper-connectivity in males, but either no change or hypoconnectivity in females. Moderated-mediation analysis found that these sex-specific changes are likely to alter contextual freezing behavior in males but not in females.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>early life stress</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd><kwd>sex</kwd><kwd>diffusion MRI</kwd><kwd>tractography</kwd><kwd>voxel-based morphometric analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH119164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jiangyang</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaffman</surname><given-names>Arie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH118332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jiangyang</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaffman</surname><given-names>Arie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TL1 TR001864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Jordon D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS102904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jiangyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mice exposed to complex early adversity show similar diffusion MRI changes to those reported in humans and sex-specific changes in connectivity that differentially affect contextual deficits in males and females.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Childhood maltreatment (CM) is a broad term used to define a heterogenous group of early adversities that range from severe bullying to physical, emotional, and/or sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">White and Kaffman, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Teicher and Samson, 2016</xref>). Exposure to CM increases the risk for the development of multiple psychopathologies and medical conditions over the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nemeroff, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Teicher and Samson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kaffman and Meaney, 2007</xref>), with an estimated annual economic burden of $2 trillion in the United States alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). While CM is recognized as a significant risk factor for abnormal brain development in industrialized countries, a thorough understanding of how CM impacts neurodevelopment and psychopathology in males and females is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bath, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bale and Epperson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cameron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gobinath et al., 2014</xref>). Given that 30–40% of the adult population have experienced some form of CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agorastos et al., 2019</xref>), clarifying these issues is necessary in order to effectively diagnose and treat the enormous clinical and economic burden associated with CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">White and Kaffman, 2019a</xref>).</p><p>The study of CM-associated outcomes is generally framed from a cumulative risk perspective, where the risk of negative outcomes raises linearly with the number of maltreatment exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kessler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans et al., 2013</xref>). Newer models have expanded this framework to highlight that different forms of CM fall along multiple dimensions, and this in turn more directly impacts later outcomes than number of CM instances per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McLaughlin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McLaughlin and Sheridan, 2016</xref>). However, neither of these models has addressed the potential role that sex plays in moderating CM-associated outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bath, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>). Further, much of the focus in the field to date has been on the role that sex plays in influencing the rate of psychopathology with little consensus and/or replication of findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cameron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bale and Epperson, 2015</xref>). Briefly, some studies report similar outcomes in males and females, some found females to be more sensitive to CM, while others see effects only in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>). A more nuanced approach suggests that sex-specific effects may depend on genetic vulnerability, the circuit involved, and the developmental stage when the stress occurred, or outcomes were assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bath, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Demaestri et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, similar clinical presentation may be driven by different underlying mechanisms in males and females as reported for depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Labonté et al., 2017</xref>) and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sorge et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that sex-specific interventions might be needed to more effectively treat psychiatric and medical consequences of CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bath, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>). Promising progress on this issue comes from advanced imaging techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lerch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Le Bihan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biswal, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moldrich et al., 2010</xref>). The most reproducible findings are from structural MRI studies which show reduced hippocampal and corpus callosum volume in those exposed to CM, with a hint that these effects are larger in males compared to age-matched females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Teicher and Samson, 2016</xref>). A recent multi-center study using a large cohort of 3036 individuals did not find any significant changes in hippocampal size but noted reduced caudate size in females that was not seen in males exposed to CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frodl et al., 2017</xref>). Few studies have had sufficient power to directly test for CM by sex interactions on task mediated fMRI activation and connectivity using resting state fMRI (rsfMRI), or diffusion MRI (dMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>). Even within these studies, there is no agreement with regard to a specific pattern of task-mediated neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Crozier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Colich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dannlowski et al., 2012</xref>) or connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Herringa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ohashi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>This ambiguity highlights the difficulty of studying long-term consequences of complex adversity in human populations where the nature and severity of the CM may be different between and within studies and findings may be confounded with other psychological or medical co-morbidities; for a thorough review on this topic, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Herringa, 2017</xref>. Preclinical studies in rodents can bypass many obstacles faced in clinical research by precisely controlling the genetic composition of the animals, and the severity, duration, and complexity of the stress. Human imaging techniques, such as high-resolution MRI, dMRI, and rsfMRI, can be used in rodent models to characterize structural and functional outcomes that can be more directly compared to humans. Further, the contribution of structural and functional changes, measured via imaging, to behavioral alterations can be rigorously tested using optogenetics and chemogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kaffman et al., 2019</xref>). Although rodents and non-human primates exposed to early life stress (ELS) show similar behavioral and physiological outcomes reported in human studies, the vast majority of work has been done only in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bath, 2020</xref>). Specifically, the few studies that used imaging to characterize outcomes in rodent models of ELS were done exclusively in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bolton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Molet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlyle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guadagno et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sarabdjitsingh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>), with only one imaging study examining outcomes in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Honeycutt et al., 2020</xref>). The need to extend these findings to females is highlighted by a report of considerable neuroanatomical sex differences in the postnatal mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>) and a recent study showing that maternal separation leads to sex-specific effects in amygdala (AMY) connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in adolescent rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Honeycutt et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our lab has modified and built upon the widely used limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm developed by Tallie Baram’s lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Walker et al., 2017</xref>) by extending the time frame dam and pups are exposed to LBN (from PND2-9 to PND0-25) and adding brief, 1 hr, bouts of maternal separation on an unpredictable schedule, that is, PND 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, and 25, followed by nest disruption. This ELS paradigm is termed unpredictable postnatal stress (UPS) and was designed to represent both a cumulative and multidimensional subtype of CM that allows us to test how complex adversity can alter neurodevelopment and behavioral outcomes in both male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>). Balb/cByj mice were used due to their high sensitivity to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caldji et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zaharia et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Francis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carola et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tractenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McWhirt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Malki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Flint and Tinkle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Delpech et al., 2016</xref>) and the ability of Balb/cByj dams to reliably maintain their litters in the complete absence of nesting material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wei et al., 2010</xref>). Further, we have previously shown that UPS produces an elevated anxiety phenotype in both adolescent and adult Balb/cByj offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). Using rsfMRI we found increased fronto-limbic connectivity in UPS male mice that included increased AMY–PFC and AMY–hippocampus connectivity, the strength of which was highly correlated with anxiety-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, females did not show an elevated anxiety phenotype, suggesting that UPS may affect males and females differently. This original study did not include females in rs-fMRI analysis and is thus unable to speak to potential ELS by sex interactions on fronto-limbic connectivity patterns.</p><p>The current study aimed to replicate and extend our understanding of UPS-induced behavioral phenotypes and brain connectivity patterns in adult male and female mice. Our first objective was to replicate our previous findings that UPS increases anxiety-like behavior in male, but not female mice and to examine the effects of UPS, sex and their interaction on other exploratory behaviors (i.e. novel object) and contextual and cued fear conditioning. The second goal was to assess the effects of UPS and sex on local volumetric changes, microstructural alterations in white matter tracts, and structural connectivity using high resolution dMRI. Finally, we sought to replicate our fronto-limbic hyper connectivity rsfMRI findings in UPS male mice using dMRI tractography and to test whether similar changes would also be seen in female mice exposed to UPS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of UPS on body weight and baseline stress levels</title><p>A main effect of rearing on body weight was consistently found at P14 (F (1, 106)=36.66, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.257 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and P26 (F (1, 104)=61.22, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.303, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) showing that UPS animals were significantly smaller than control (CTL) animals.

The role that sex plays in CM-associated outcomes is a growing area of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bath, 2020</xref>), and it is becoming increasingly clear that the influence of sex may only be seen in certain behaviors, neurodevelopmental processes, and/or specific circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White and Kaffman, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bath, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Demaestri et al., 2020</xref>). This is in line with the findings reported here. For example, here we report similar impact of UPS on body weight, object exploration, contextual conditioning, and global connectivity in males and females. Male and female UPS mice also showed similar changes in local volumetric and FA, but our sample size for these measures (n = 6) was not sufficiently powered to detect significant sex by rearing interactions after correcting for multiple testing. Nevertheless, this sample size revealed robust moderating effects of sex on UPS-induced outcomes in fronto-limbic connectivity and AMY nodal efficiency, findings that were further confirmed using a larger cohort of mice.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to utilize high resolution dMRI to assess the effects of ELS on brain structure in both males and females. Using these methods, we demonstrated that males and females exposed to UPS showed several changes that are consistent with those previously reported in human and animal literature. Specifically, UPS leads to reduced global network efficiency and increased small-worldness that resemble those seen in a large cohort of individuals exposed to CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ohashi et al., 2019</xref>). Global efficiency, the ability of a network to propagate parallel information, increases during brain development and is associated with improved cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bassett and Bullmore, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farahani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). The reduced global efficiency seen in UPS mice suggests abnormal maturation of this feature and is consistent with the cognitive deficits seen in the same animals. Small-worldness, a highly conserved network pattern across species, decreases during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bassett and Bullmore, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lupfer et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the increased small-worldness seen in UPS animals is further support of a premature network.</p><p>In terms of volumetric changes, UPS mice showed several outcomes that were also reported in humans (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These include reduced volumes in the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carrion et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">De Bellis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heim et al., 2013</xref>), reduced corpus callosum volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Teicher and Samson, 2016</xref>), increased anterior cingulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>), and increased AMY volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pechtel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mehta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tottenham et al., 2010</xref>). It is important to note, however, that increased anterior cingulate and AMY volumes have not been consistently reported in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Teicher and Samson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frodl et al., 2017</xref>), but increased AMY volumes are seen in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Coplan et al., 2014</xref>) and juvenile rats exposed to LBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guadagno et al., 2018b</xref>). With regard to FA changes, UPS mice showed reduced FA in the corpus callosum which is one of the most robust findings in the human literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Teicher and Samson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCarthy-Jones et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the increased vHC volume seen in UPS mice is diametrically opposite to a large body of work showing reduced hippocampal volume in individuals exposed to CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Teicher and Samson, 2016</xref>). However, a recent analysis using over 3000 subjects found no statistical differences in hippocampal volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frodl et al., 2017</xref>), underscoring the challenges involved in conducting this work in humans. Inconsistent outcomes have also been reported in rats exposed to LBN, with one report indicating increased volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guadagno et al., 2018a</xref>) and a second publication noting reduced hippocampal volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Molet et al., 2016</xref>). Additional work is therefore needed to replicate our findings, clarify mechanisms, and the contribution of this expansion in vHC to connectivity and behavioral outcomes.</p><p>Our sample size was not sufficiently powered to identify sexually dimorphic changes after rigorous correction for multiple comparisons, and the relatively lower resolution of dMRI compared to T1/T2-weighted MRI and differences in tissue contrasts may have also limited our ability to capture these differences. Nevertheless, we have identified several of the previously known sexually dimorphic brain regions including the BNST and medial preoptic area in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, OB, striatum, and the sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings are consistent with a previous study in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gillies and McArthur, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ruigrok et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Goldstein et al., 2001</xref>), underscoring the conserved nature of these sexual dimorphic alterations.</p><p>Our dMRI tractography shows good agreement with anterograde viral tracing reported by the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the tractography data shown here represents true anatomical projections. Using this approach we found a robust increase in fronto-limbic connectivity in males exposed to UPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).These structural changes are consistent with our previous resting-state fMRI findings in UPS males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>) and those reported in male rats exposed to LBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bolton et al., 2018</xref>). Similar patterns were seen in both the left and the right hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and were further confirmed using a larger cohort of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The observation that the hyper connectivity is unique to males and is not seen in females reveals a novel sex-dependent effect of UPS on this specific circuit. Sex-specific alterations in connectivity have been reported in adolescents and young adults exposed to ELS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Crozier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Herringa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Colich et al., 2017</xref>) but not in adult subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ohashi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dannlowski et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, increased AMY connectivity was associated with higher levels of symptomatology including anxiety and depression in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ohashi et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that findings in UPS males may have translational utility for some types of ELS in humans. Exposure to maternal separation also induced sex-specific changes in the connectivity between the basolateral AMY and the PFC in juvenile rats; however, these changes appear to be more prominent in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Honeycutt et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these findings highlight intriguing sex-dependent effects of varying ELS paradigms on fronto-limbic connectivity in rodents.</p><p>Despite clear differences in UPS-induced fronto-limbic connectivity between males and females, their behavioral profiles were remarkably similar and raise the possibility that alterations in connectivity may lead to different behavioral outcomes in males and females. To address this issue, we conducted a moderated-mediation analysis to test whether sex was moderating the relationships between UPS-induced changes in connectivity between the AMY and the vHC and their resulting influence on freezing behavior. We focused on these connections for several reasons, that is, UPS induced opposing outcomes in males and females (increased in males and reduction in females, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), there were clear volumetric changes in both areas, and these areas play an important role in fear learning. Our analysis suggests that alterations in connectivity in males, but not females, is in part responsible for the reduced freezing behavior seen in UPS mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Future work should use optogenetic or chemogenetic approaches to further test the conclusions drawn from this moderated-mediation model, but the findings reported here are consistent with other examples showing that similar behavioral outcomes can be driven by different mechanisms in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Labonté et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sorge et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has shown that ELS alters brain laterality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Denenberg et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sherman et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guadagno et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sullivan and Gratton, 2002</xref>), but the exact mechanisms responsible for these changes are yet to be elucidated. Most of our findings were seen on both the left and the right hemispheres. Nevertheless, we report three interesting findings, all of which are related to laterality within the AMY–vHC connections. First, there was a significant increase in connectivity on the left compared to the right regardless of sex. Second, there was a significant effect of sex on the right hemisphere with females showing reduced connections compared to males. Third, moderated-mediation analysis found higher number of projections between the AMY and vHC on the left, but not the right, predicting male freezing behavior in the contextual fear conditioning.</p><p>It is important to note that we were unable to replicate our UPS-induced anxiety-like behavior in the open field or the EPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). One possible explanation for this failure to replicate may be due to differences in the implementation of the paradigm. For instance, the current studies were conducted in a room that was roughly 10 times quieter than the room utilized in previous work (see Animals heading within the Materials and methods section) and the work was conducted by different individuals. These outcomes also highlight the sensitivity of the OF and the EPM tests to multiple variables such as sex of the experimenter, phase of the light/dark cycle, degree of illumination in the arena, noise, smells, and order of behavioral testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tractenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Murthy and Gould, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lehmann and Feldon, 2000</xref>). Our inability to replicate behavioral outcomes in the EPM in the first and second cohorts underscores the challenges of using this test even under practically identical conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and highlights the need to develop more robust behavioral tests of anxiety; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Oberrauch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meyer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Prevot et al., 2019</xref> for some encouraging examples. Reduced baseline corticosterone levels were seen in males, but not female UPS mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This outcome is consistent with a recent meta-analysis showing an overall blunted corticosterone levels in individuals exposed to early adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bunea et al., 2017</xref>) and might be due to sex-specific changes in connectivity between the AMY and the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><p>Additional work is also needed to characterize maternal care in UPS and its potential for inducing sex-specific changes; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bath, 2020</xref> for a comprehensive review on this topic. Consistent with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>) we found that UPS caused a robust reduction in weight across different ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, male and female UPS mice spent less time exploring novel objects and showed reduced contextual freezing, findings that were replicated in two independent cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and in additional studies conducted in the lab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using high resolution dMRI we show that UPS induces several neuroanatomical changes in the adult rodent brain that mimics those seen in individuals exposed to CM. Some of the most important examples include alterations in global network connectivity, reduced volume and FA in the corpus collosum, frontal cortex atrophy, and increased AMY size, findings that were seen in both males and females. In contrast, exposure to UPS induced sex-specific changes in fronto-limbic connectivity, raising the possibility that these connections may mediate different behavioral outcomes in males and females. This possibility is consistent with findings from a moderated-mediation analysis indicating that UPS-induced alterations in connectivity between the AMY and the vHC is responsible for reduced contextual freezing behavior in males but not in females. These findings reinforce the continued need for additional research into the moderating effects of sex on CM-induced outcomes in both humans and animals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus)</italic></td><td valign="top">Balb/cByj</td><td valign="top">Jax: 001026</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5654246">MGI:5654246</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">ELISA <break/>Corticosterone <break/>Kit</td><td valign="top">Arbor Assays, Ann Arbor, MI</td><td valign="top">Cat. # K014-H1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">DTIStudio</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mristudio.org">http://www.mristudio.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Version 3.0.3</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MRtrix</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrtrix.org">http://www.mrtrix.org</ext-link> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26499812">26499812</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Version 3.0.2</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GRETNA software</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gretna/">GRETNA</ext-link> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26175682">26175682</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Version 2.0</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">SPSS</td><td valign="top">SPSS, IBM Corp.

Once the animal had achieved sedation (unresponsive to toe-pinch), it was transported to a separate room within the animal facility where a cardiac puncture was performed to collect roughly 100 µl of blood in tubes containing heparin. These were then spun down (5000 × g for 5 min) to collect serum and assess corticosterone levels. Mice were then transcardially perfused using cold PBS/heparin (50 units/ml) solution followed by 10% formalin (polyScience). Adrenal glands were then dissected and weighed. After perfusion, mice were decapitated, and intact skulls were post-fixed for 24 hr at 4°C in 10% formalin, then transferred to sterile 1× PBS (pH 7.4), and left at 4°C until transfer to the imaging facility at NYU for ex vivo dMRI studies (n = 6 mice per condition and sex).

Images were acquired using a modified 3D GRASE sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wu et al., 2013</xref>) with the following parameters: echo time (TE)/repetition time (TR) = 33/400 ms, 100 µm isotropic resolution, two non-diffusion weighted images (b<sub>0</sub>s) and 60 diffusion weighted images (DWIs) with a diffusion weighting (b) of 5,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, and a total imaging time of 12 hr. DTIStudio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mristudio.org">http://www.mristudio.org</ext-link>) was used to align all DWIs to the average of b<sub>0</sub>s to remove small sample displacements due to vibrations during the long scan and compute average DWI (aDWI) and FA maps using the diffusion tensor model. The aDWI and FA maps were normalized to an MRI-based atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chuang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arefin et al., 2019</xref>) using the dual-channel (aDWI+FA) large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ceritoglu et al., 2009</xref>). To assess global and regional AMY connectivity, we transferred 28 structural labels (i.e. 14 nodes and 182 connectomes in each hemisphere) to the subject images using the inverse mapping from LDDMM. The 14 brain regions (aka nodes) chosen for the analysis include the AMY, CB, dHP, dorsal striatum (STRd), lateral hypothalamic zone (LZ), medial hypothalamic zone (MEZ), MO, OB, periventricular zone (PVZ), PFC, somatosensory cortex (SS), thalamus (TH), vHP, and ventral striatum (STRv). These nodes were selected because they show UPS-mediated volumetric and FA alterations using unbiased voxel analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), are highly connected based on the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oh et al., 2014</xref>), and comply with principles for node selection outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kaiser, 2011</xref>. These specify that nodes should be (1) non-overlapping, (2) have unique set of connections to other nodes, and (3) be well delineated using standard parcellation scheme that is comparable across species, with later point made possible by the registration of our MRI-based atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chuang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arefin et al., 2019</xref>). The transferred structural labels were visually examined and showed good agreement with the corresponding structures in the subject images. For each pair of ipsilateral structures, random seeds were first assigned to a structure (e.g. the AMY). Next, the number of seeds proportional to the volume of the structure and streamlines from the seeds passing through the target structure (e.g. hippocampus) were reconstructed using a probabilistic tractography method implemented in MRtrix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrtrix.org">http://www.mrtrix.org</ext-link>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wu and Zhang, 2016</xref>). The numbers of streamlines between regions were used as a measure of the connection strength. GRETNA software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) was used to quantify global and regional properties of the structural connectome using principles of graph theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). Global features included measurement of global efficiency (Geff) and the small-worldness (SW) and were normalized with respect to 1000 simulated random networks with equal distribution of edge weight and node strength as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rubinov and Sporns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schlemm et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, local graph parameters, such as nodal clustering coefficient (NCp), nodal efficiency (Neff), and degree centrality (Dcent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>), were calculated to capture alterations in the vicinity of the left and right AMY.

For this analysis, rearing condition (dummy-coded; 0 = CTL reared; 1 = UPS reared) was entered into the model as the independent variable (X variable), the number of AMY–vHC streamlines (continuous, mean-centered) was entered into the model as the mediator (M variable), sex (dummy-coded; 0 = male, 1 = female) was specified as the moderator (W variable), and percent freezing was included as the outcome variable (Y variable; log-transformed to correct positive skew, per convention for regression analyses).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were done using SPSS (IBM Corp. Released 2016. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY; IBM Corp.) and visualized with GraphPad Prism version 8.1.0 for MacOS (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA). Animals that were &gt;2 s.d. above or below the mean were eliminated from behavioral analysis. Data were examined using a two-way ANOVA with rearing condition (CTL or UPS) and sex as fixed factors. Behavioral testing was limited to a priori defined and well-accepted endpoints and used p&lt;0.05 (two tails) to identify significant outcomes. A 2 × 2 ANOVA, written in Matlab, was used to assess the effects of UPS, sex, and their interaction on maps of local volumetric changes and FA using voxel-based analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashburner and Friston, 2000</xref>). The minimum number of voxels used to define a volumetric cluster and levels for false-base discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons differ depending on whether main effects of rearing, sex, or interaction where tested, and these are specified in the results section. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the effect of laterality as a within-subject variable and sex and rearing as between-subject variables on the following four projections: (1) AMY–PFC, (2) AMY–vHC, (3) AMY–dHC, and (4) vHC–PFC. Significant interactions were followed by post-hoc comparisons using Tukey’s HSD or Sidak’s test. These same procedures were used to analyze laterality in both global and AMY connectivity. To account for the hierarchical nature of the data, additional linear mixed-effects models were conducted on the key-dependent measures from this experiment to ensure that outcomes were driven by condition or sex and not maternal care or litter per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by: NIMH R01MH119164 (AK and JZ), NIMH R01MH118332 (AK and JZ), NCATS TL1 TR001864 (JDW), and R01NS102904 (JZ).

Importantly, these models provided a second test of key behavioral endpoints while controlling for the hierarchical structure of the data as animals were nested within litters. Results again revealed a main effect of rearing condition on contextual fear conditioning with reduced freezing found in UPS- compared to CTL-reared animals, b = −17.78, SE = 6.22, t = −2.86, p=0.02. Similarly, time spent exploring novel objects was reduced in UPS compared to CTL animals, b = −4.81, SE = 2.13, t = −2.25, p=0.053. There was also a main effect of sex in NOR, with females demonstrating greater exploration than males, b = 3.87, SE = 1.51, t = 2.57, p=0.01. The results of the tractography linear mixed-effects model were also consistent with the reported ANOVA, revealing a significant interaction between sex and rearing condition on streamlines between the amygdala and ventral hippocampus in the left hemisphere, b = −3851.21, SE = 901.54, t = −4.27, p=0.0004. Together, the results of these follow-up models support those reported in the main text and suggest that litter (or maternal behavior) had minimal effect on the key dependent measures.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript uses behavioural testing and diffusion MRI to assess the effects of early life stress on brain and behaviour. The authors employed a modified version of the limited bedding and nesting protocol developed by Baram, which included maternal separation and nest disruption (ranging from P0-P25)- which the authors term unpredictable postnatal stress (UPS). In the current studies, the authors tested control and UPS mice on the elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF), novel object approach, as measures of anxiety-like behavior. Interestingly, the authors failed to replicate their initial findings of elevations in anxiety-like behavior in male mice. The authors instead found no main effect of treatment or interaction with sex for OF. The authors found an anxiolytic effects of UPS on the EPM test, with UPS mice spending more time in the open arms, with no effect of sex or interaction. Finally, the authors found an anxiogenic effect of UPS rearing on novel object approach, with a significant effects of sex that did not replicate in an internal replication study. The authors observe very interesting effects of their manipulation on regional brain volume (increase in some regions, with reductions in others, that appear to be sex specific). The authors also note significant effects of UPS rearing on regional connectivity by DTI, with significant effects on connectivity between limbic, hippocampal, and prefrontal structures. The authors try to relate individual differences in strength of connections (based upon tractography) with levels of freezing behavior. Curiously, for this measure, the author observed significant effects of sex and rearing condition on amygdala-hippocampal streamlines that appear to be predictive of levels of freezing behavior in males but not females.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a timely paper addressing an interesting topic. The experiments are well designed, employ a number of approaches, along with technical rigor. However, a number of questions arise related to failure to replicate prior effects from the lab, as well as the ability to replicate main effects between studies within this report.</p><p>The authors use their previously published UPS model, which is an adaptation of the more commonly used limited bedding model. Using their UPS model, the authors were not able to replicate their previous findings of UPS effects on anxiety-like behavioral phenotypes, which evokes the question of how robust this model is compared to more commonly used models of ELS. The authors discuss the possible impact of increased noise in the room during testing for anxiety-like behavior tasks and the potential sensitivity of these assays to environment and experimenter which may have driven the failure to replicate. However, the authors also appeared to have difficulty in replicating some of the more robust assays (some measures of fear learning), possibly indicating that the variability may be at the level of efficacy of stress induction and not necessarily and solely variability at the time of phenotypic testing. Perhaps the authors could comment on how replicable the neural connectivity findings in the current study are expected to be in future attempts to replicate this work. Ideally, an additional replication cohort or more robust comparison of existing literature data would provide stronger evidence about which effects of UPS and/or ELS in general are robust.</p><p>The n=6 per group for MRI is too low; most power analyses indicate that around 10-12 mice per group are more appropriate (i.e. that's where you hit the point of diminishing returns for adding more mice), and should be even higher if interactions are tested. Please expand the sample to more reasonable numbers. The fact that the authors did not find many of the robust sexually dimorphic brain regions (i.e. BNST was found at q&lt;0.3, but MeA and MPOA, etc., appear to be missing in Figure 3—figure supplement 1) further adds to the doubt that the MRI study as is was adequately powered.</p><p>Please explain why were Balb/c mice used. They tend to have very poor maternal care compared to, for example, Bl6 or CD1, and most literature on ELS has been on Bl6 mice.</p><p>How were multiple comparisons corrected or accounted for in the analysis of the behaviour data? If not at all, as it seems, this needs to be remedied or extensively justified.</p><p>How accurate was the tract tracing? The streamlines shown in Figure 5 do not look all that much like the tract tracing from the Allen institute's connectivity atlas – can the authors overlay those maps or find an alternate way to measure their tracing accuracy? It is hard to interpret different streamlines by group or sex when it is not clear whether diffusion based tracing truly reflects underlying wiring.</p><p>The Introduction needs to be expanded. For example, the authors highlight recent reviews that speculate about the potential importance of the type of stressor and impact of different forms of early life stress on neurodevelopmental outcomes (CM falling along multiple dimensions), along with sex as a moderating factor (Mclaughlin and Sheridan). I would like to point the authors to Demaestri et al., 2020 and Bath, 2020, further bolster these points and supplement the excellent work done by this group in their 2018 Translational Psychiatry paper. Furthermore, while the authors do acknowledge some previous work on sex effects and childhood maltreatment in the Introduction and Discussion of their manuscript, the only paper that is cited is the authors own review by White and Kaffman. The background literature on sex effects should be discussed with reference to a broader body of appropriate literature.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Early life stress causes sex-specific changes in adult fronto-limbic connectivity that differentially drive learning&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

First, in both cohorts from this paper (and others tested since) there are no clear indications of an anxiety phenotype in OF or EPM, as non-significant condition effects were replicated in both OF cohorts, and only 1 cohort found significant condition effects in the open arm of the EPM (an effect that hinted at an anxiolytic effect of UPS, Figure 2C). The EPM finding is important as it highlights the difficulties of replicating outcomes with this test even under identical conditions. We believe that environmental differences that were present between the animal facility utilized in Johnson et al., 2018 and the room in current use likely interacted with the stress paradigm in an unforeseen way to intensify the nature and severity of the original ELS-paradigm. Second, the anxiogenic effect of rearing in the novel object exploration task was replicated across the two cohorts and in additional cohorts. Third, the behavioral summary did not mention that UPS reduced freezing behavior in the contextual fear conditioning (Figure 2F), an effect that was also replicated across the two cohorts and in additional animals tested. To further demonstrate the robustness of outcomes in the novel object exploration and CFC, we included data from additional groups of animals that replicated these outcomes. This information is available in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and was added to the revised Results section by noting that: “To further demonstrate the robustness of the rearing effect on outcomes in the novel exploration test (Figure 2E) and contextual fear condition (Figure 2F) we replicated these findings in additional cohorts of mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) and in the Discussion:” Our inability to replicate behavioral outcomes in the EPM in the first and second cohorts underscores the challenges of using this test even under practically identical conditions (Supplementary file 1) and highlights the need to develop more robust behavioral tests of anxiety, see (Oberrauch et al., 2019, Meyer et al., 2019, Prevot et al., 2019) for some encouraging examples. Finally, we note that: “Consistent with our previous work (Johnson et al., 2018) we found that UPS caused a robust reduction in weight across different ages (Figure 1). Moreover, male and female UPS mice spent less time exploring novel objects and showed reduced contextual freezing, findings that were replicated in 2 independent cohorts (Figure 2 and Supplementary file 1) and in additional studies conducted in the lab (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors observe very interesting effects of their manipulation on regional brain volume (increase in some regions, with reductions in others, that appear to be sex specific). The authors also note significant effects of UPS rearing on regional connectivity by DTI, with significant effects on connectivity between limbic, hippocampal, and prefrontal structures. The authors try to relate individual differences in strength of connections (based upon tractography) with levels of freezing behavior. Curiously, for this measure, the author observed significant effects of sex and rearing condition on amygdala-hippocampal streamlines that appear to be predictive of levels of freezing behavior in males but not females.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that we also found significant effects of rearing on volumetric changes (Figure 3), alterations in FA (Figure 4), and global connectivity (Figure 8). These outcomes were similarly affected in males and females and replicated some of the most robust imaging findings in humans. In contrast, males and females showed very different patterns, with a significant interaction, when fronto-limbic connectivity was assessed. This is an important finding that highlights the need to consider both global and specific circuits when addressing the question of how sex moderates the outcomes of early adversity. This point has not received much attention in the literature to date and is nicely highlighted in the paper. We emphasized the significance of this novel finding in the Results section by writing: ”Together, these findings highlight the exquisite specificity by which UPS alters structural connectivity in male and female mice” and noted in the revised Discussion that: “The role that sex plays in CM-associated outcomes is a growing area of interest (White and Kaffman, 2019, Bath, 2020), and it is becoming increasingly clear that the influence of sex may only be seen in certain behaviors, neurodevelopmental processes, and/or specific circuits (White and Kaffman, 2019, Bath, 2020, Demaestri et al., 2020). This is in line with findings reported here. For example, here we report similar impact of UPS on body weight, object exploration, contextual conditioning, global connectivity and local volumetric and FA changes in males and females. In contrast, there are robust moderating effects of sex on UPS-induced outcomes in baseline corticosterone levels, fronto-limbic connectivity, and amygdala nodal efficiency.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a timely paper addressing an interesting topic.

However, a number of questions arise related to failure to replicate prior effects from the lab, as well as the ability to replicate main effects between studies within this report.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the kind words and have made a significant effort to address all the comments below. We disagree however with the assertion that main effects were not replicated within the current study (see also response to statement 1 above). For example, significant main effects of condition were replicated in the 2<sup>nd</sup> cohort in the novel object exploration task and the contextual conditioning tasks, and a non-significant main effect of rearing were replicated in the both OF measures, exploration of the closed arm of the EPM, baseline freezing behavior, freezing behavior over the course of the cued-training paradigm, and freezing during cue-induced recall. Overall, there is only 1 instance (out of 9 possible) when a main effect of rearing is not replicated with the second cohort. Further, a significant main effect of sex is replicated in freezing during cue-induced recall, and non-significant main effects of sex are replicated for OF and EPM measures, baseline freezing behavior, freezing behavior over the course of the cued-training paradigm, and contextual freezing. We feel that this internal replication conveys the robustness of the behavioral phenotype described in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use their previously published UPS model, which is an adaptation of the more commonly used limited bedding model.

This is not surprising given the large number of variables that affect ELS outcome (e.g. differences in travel conditions and composition of animals delivered from Jackson labs, housing conditions, maternal behavior, details related to restricting bedding, separation procedure and nest disruption) and the additional variables related to administering the OF and EPM (e.g. light, noise, smell, sex of the researcher). It is difficult to know what factors drive the difficulties of replicating anxiolytic findings in rodents, but this is an important issue that needs to be reported and addressed. To address this issue, we utilized internal replication cohorts and then focused on the behavioral outcomes that were consistent across those cohorts. In our case, reduced freezing in response to the training context and reduced exploration of novel objects were robust (Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplementary 2, Supplementary file 1). In addition, the use of long-term automated behavioral assessment in the home cage appear to be a promising approach for identifying robust behavioral phenotypes, as demonstrated by (Goodwill et al., 2018), and (Prevot et al., 2019). Finally, learning paradigms of ambiguous cues will likely provide more robust outcomes (Oberrauch et al., 2019, Meyer et al., 2019) when compared to brief measurements of innate defensive behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps the authors could comment on how replicable the neural connectivity findings in the current study are expected to be in future attempts to replicate this work. Ideally, an additional replication cohort or more robust comparison of existing literature data would provide stronger evidence about which effects of UPS and/or ELS in general are robust.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this important point in several ways. First, we confirmed the generalizability of our sex-specific tractography findings by increasing the number of mice scanned to 12-13 per rearing and sex condition for a total of 50 mice (Figures 10-12). Second, we note that our dMRI connectivity data have replicated our previous rsfMRI findings of increased connectivity between the 1) amygdala and the ventral hippocampus, 2) amygdala and dorsal hippocampus, and 3) amygdala and the prefrontal cortex in adult UPS male mice (Johnson et al., 2018). Third, we found the exact same pattern when assessing the left and right hemispheres using both rsfMRI and dMRI (Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and 3 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). This is especially important for the dMRI findings reported here because the analysis of left hemisphere was done about two months after conducting the tractography for the right hemisphere. Fourth, similar increase in connectivity between the amygdala and the PFC was reported in rats exposed to LBN (Bolton et al., 2018). To address this issue, we added a new section at the end of the Results section titled: Generalizability of the sex-specific tractography findings, which demonstrates the robustness of these findings in a large group of animals.</p><p>We revisit this concern in the Discussion by stating: ”Our dMRI tractography shows good agreement with anterograde viral tracing reported by the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), suggesting that the tractography data shown here represents true anatomical projections. Using this approach we found a robust increase in fronto-limbic connectivity in males exposed to UPS (Figures 5-6).These structural changes are consistent with our previous resting-state fMRI findings in UPS males (Johnson et al., 2018) and those reported in male rats exposed to LBN (Bolton et al., 2018). Similar patterns were seen in both the left and the right hemispheres (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and 2, and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and were further confirmed using a larger cohort of mice (Figure 10).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The n=6 per group for MRI is too low; most power analyses indicate that around 10-12 mice per group are more appropriate (i.e. that's where you hit the point of diminishing returns for adding more mice), and should be even higher if interactions are tested. Please expand the sample to more reasonable numbers. The fact that the authors did not find many of the robust sexually dimorphic brain regions (i.e. BNST was found at q&lt;0.3, but MeA and MPOA, etc., appear to be missing in Figure 3—figure supplement 1) further adds to the doubt that the MRI study as is was adequately powered.</p></disp-quote><p>The primary goal of this work was to replicate our previous rsfMRI findings of increased fronto-limbic connectivity in male UPS mice. Our previously reported effect size of Cohn’s d = 2.0 was therefore used for sample size calculations. Using this sample size, we were able to replicate our previous functional connectivity data, and to identify multiple changes in volumetric (Figure 3) and FA measurements that were affected by rearing at a FDR &lt; 0.1 (Figure 4). Importantly, many of these changes are consistent with robust changes seen in humans. We consider these to be key findings and emphasized these points in the revised discussion. We agree that this sample size is not likely to have sufficient power to adequately identify sexually dimorphic changes and interactions after rigorous correction for multiple testing. The relatively lower resolution of diffusion MRI compared to T1/T2-weighted MRI and differences in tissue contrasts may also limited our ability to identify additional structures. We have acknowledged these limitations in the Discussion: “Our sample size was not sufficiently powered to identify sexually dimorphic changes after rigorous correction for multiple comparisons, and the relatively lower resolution of dMRI compared to T1/T2-weighted MRI and differences in tissue contrasts may have also limited our ability to capture these differences. Nevertheless, we have identified several of the previously known sexually dimorphic brain regions including, the BNST and medial preoptic area in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, olfactory bulb, striatum, and the sensory cortex (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). These findings are consistent with a previous study in C57BL/6 mice (Qiu et al., 2018) and in humans (Gillies and McArthur, 2010, Ruigrok et al., 2014, Goldstein et al., 2001), underscoring the conserved nature of these sexual dimorphic alterations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please explain why were Balb/c mice used. They tend to have very poor maternal care compared to, for example, Bl6 or CD1, and most literature on ELS has been on Bl6 mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Balb/cByj mice were used in this study in order to build upon the extensive studies from the lab using this strain (Wei et al., 2010, Wei et al., 2012, Wei et al., 2014, Wei et al., 2015, Delpech et al., 2016) and to specifically replicate and extend findings in this strain (Johnson et al., 2018). We have previously characterized maternal behavior in Balb/cByj and Bl6 dams under the parameters used in the present experiments (Wei et al., 2010). For example, in the absence of nesting material on P0, B6 dams failed to care for their pups leading to high levels of pup mortality that was not seen in Balb/cByj (Wei et al., 2010). Further, Balb/cByj mice are more sensitive than C57 to the effects of stress including ELS making them an excellent strain to study this issue. Finally, exposure to UPS in this strain replicates multiple imaging findings reported in humans, further supporting the use of this strain as a rodent model of ELS. We addressed these issues in the revised manuscript in the Introduction: “Balb/cByj mice were used due to their high sensitivity to stress, including ELS (Caldji et al., 2004, Zaharia et al., 1996, Francis et al., 2003, Carola et al., 2004, Tractenberg et al., 2016, Wei et al., 2010, Wei et al., 2012, McWhirt et al., 2019, Malki et al., 2015, Flint and Tinkle, 2001, Wei et al., 2014, Wei et al., 2015, Delpech et al., 2016) and because Balb/cByj dams reliably maintain their litters in the complete absence of nesting material (Wei et al., 2010). Further, we have previously shown that UPS produces an elevated anxiety phenotype in both adolescent and adult Balb/cByj offspring (Johnson et al., 2018). Using rsfMRI we found increased fronto-limbic connectivity in UPS male mice that included increased amygdala-prefrontal cortex and amygdala-hippocampus connectivity, the strength of which was highly correlated with anxiety-like behaviors (Johnson et al., 2018). Interestingly, females did not show an elevated anxiety phenotype, suggesting that UPS may affect males and females differently. This original study did not include females in rs-fMRI analysis and is thus unable to speak to potential ELS by sex interactions on fronto-limbic connectivity patterns”. We review the agreement with the human literature in the discussion and in the conclusion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How were multiple comparisons corrected or accounted for in the analysis of the behaviour data? If not at all, as it seems, this needs to be remedied or extensively justified.</p></disp-quote><p>Correction for multiple testing is not commonly done in behavioral work. In fact, we are not aware of a single ELS manuscript that has corrected for multiple testing, including several high-profile manuscripts (Goodwill et al., 2018, Bolton et al., 2018, Pena et al., 2017, Honeycutt et al., 2020). The reasons for this are that the effect sizes of many behavioral tests are moderate, at best, and would require extremely large cohorts of animals to accommodate for multiple testing. Moreover, given the correlated nature of many behavioral endpoints (especially those related to anxiety), multiple testing corrections would be too conservative. We feel that it is both more practical and useful to replicate the effects in independent cohorts in order to show the robustness of the phenotype, a tactic that we utilized in the present manuscript (see also responses to summary statement #1 and comment 2). Further, behavioral testing was limited to a priori defined and well accepted endpoints, with p&lt; 0.05 (two tails) used to identify significant outcomes. Finally, all post-hoc comparisons following significant interaction were corrected for multiple comparisons using Tukey’s HSD or Sidak’s tests. We have clarified this in the Materials and methods section by stating that: “To Identify robust behavioral outcomes in lieu of corrections for multiple behavioral testing, we repeated the behavioral work using a second cohort consisting of n = 9-19 mice per group from 4-6 litters. Behavioral data for cohort 1, and cohort 2 are summarized in Supplementary file 1. Reproducible outcomes in the novel object exploration and contextual fear conditioning were further confirmed using additional cohorts of animals (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).” We note that: ”Behavioral testing was limited to a priori defined and well accepted endpoints and used p&lt; 0.05 (two tails) to identify significant outcomes”, “The minimum number of voxels used to define a volumetric cluster and levels for false-base discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons differ depending on whether main effects of rearing, sex or interaction where tested, and these are specified in the Results section”, “Significant interactions were followed by post-hoc comparisons using Tukey’s HSD or Sidak’s test.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How accurate was the tract tracing? The streamlines shown in Figure 5 do not look all that much like the tract tracing from the Allen institute's connectivity atlas – can the authors overlay those maps or find an alternate way to measure their tracing accuracy? It is hard to interpret different streamlines by group or sex when it is not clear whether diffusion based tracing truly reflects underlying wiring.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for this suggestion, as we agree it would increase the reader’s confidence in the findings discussed in the current document. Several observations indicate that our tractography data are highly accurate and represent true anatomical differences, most of which have been detailed in response #3 above. Moreover. In Figure 5—figure supplement 1 we now show that there is a good agreement between our streamline projection and the expected anterograde connectivity available at the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (AMBCA). We discuss this in the revised Results section by writing that: “To address this issue, we first confirmed that there is a good agreement between our dMRI projections and the expected anterograde connectivity available from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).” In Figure 5—figure supplement 1 legend we note that full agreement is not expected because dMRI examines tracks that are bi-directional vs. anterograde tracing seen with AAV-GFP (Maier-Hein et al., 2017, Pallast et al., 2020). In addition, the AMBCA tracing was done with AAV1 (Oh et al., 2014) which has some retrograde transport component (Murlidharan et al., 2014), further complicating the comparison with dMRI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Introduction needs to be expanded. For example, the authors highlight recent reviews that speculate about the potential importance of the type of stressor and impact of different forms of early life stress on neurodevelopmental outcomes (CM falling along multiple dimensions), along with sex as a moderating factor (Mclaughlin and Sheridan). I would like to point the authors to Demaestri et al., 2020 and Bath, 2020, further bolster these points and supplement the excellent work done by this group in their 2018 Translational Psychiatry paper. Furthermore, while the authors do acknowledge some previous work on sex effects and childhood maltreatment in the Introduction and Discussion of their manuscript, the only paper that is cited is the authors own review by White and Kaffman. The background literature on sex effects should be discussed with reference to a broader body of appropriate literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for this comment and have incorporated these additional references in the Introduction and Discussion lines.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We believe that this revision has addressed the great majority of the concerns raised in the first round. The only remaining concern relates to our disappointment that the authors opted not to increase the sample size from the too-small n=6 for the imaging study. The authors did add a disclaimer in their discussion about their limited power. We ask that they move the disclaimer to earlier in the discussion, make explicit in the Discussion that the n=6 was designed to replicate an initial hypothesis, and that they were underpowered for the types of brain wide sex by condition interactions that were carried out.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the statement that “the authors opted not to increase the sample size from the too-small n=6 for the imaging study” and note that we doubled the sample size for all the tractography work (Figures 10, 11, 12) and that this larger cohort further replicated our initial findings. We agree that our initial sample may not have been sufficiently powered to detect rearing by sex interactions for whole brain volumetric and FA voxel analyses and clarified this early in the Discussion by stating that: “This is in line with findings reported here. For example, here we report similar impact of UPS on body weight, object exploration, contextual conditioning, and global connectivity in males and females. Male and female UPS mice also showed similar changes in local volumetric and FA, but our sample size for these measures (n=6) was not sufficiently powered to detect significant sex by rearing interactions after correcting for multiple testing. Nevertheless, this sample size revealed robust moderating effects of sex on UPS-induced outcomes in fronto-limbic connectivity and amygdala nodal efficiency, findings that were further confirmed using a larger cohort of mice.” It is worth pointing out that this sample size (n=6 per group or a total sample of 24 mice) was sufficient to detect several rearing effects that replicated work in humans. Finally, we left the Discussion regarding sample size and power for detecting sex differences unchanged.</p></body></sub-article></article>
