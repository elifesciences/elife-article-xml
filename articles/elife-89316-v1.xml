The underlying mechanisms of alternative splicing (AS) in mouse SSCs are still largely unclear. We demonstrated that SRSF1 is essential for gene expression and splicing in mouse SSCs. Crosslinking immunoprecipitation and sequencing data revealed that spermatogonia-related genes (e.g. <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Id4</italic>, <italic>Setdb1, Stra8</italic>, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic>, <italic>Bcas2</italic>, <italic>Ddx5</italic>, <italic>Srsf10</italic>, <italic>Uhrf1</italic>, and <italic>Bud31</italic>) were bound by SRSF1 in the mouse testes. Specific deletion of <italic>Srsf1</italic> in mouse germ cells impairs homing of precursor SSCs leading to male infertility. Whole-mount staining data showed the absence of germ cells in the testes of adult conditional knockout (cKO) mice, which indicates Sertoli cell-only syndrome in cKO mice. The expression of spermatogonia-related genes (e.g. <italic>Gfra1</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Dnd1</italic>, <italic>Stra8</italic>, and <italic>Taf4b</italic>) was significantly reduced in the testes of cKO mice. Moreover, multiomics analysis suggests that SRSF1 may affect survival of spermatogonia by directly binding and regulating <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> expression through AS. In addition, immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation data showed that SRSF1 interacts with RNA splicing-related proteins (e.g. SART1, RBM15, and SRSF10). Collectively, our data reveal the critical role of SRSF1 in spermatogonia survival, which may provide a framework to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the posttranscriptional network underlying homing of precursor SSCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SRSF1</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>Sertoli cell-only syndrome</kwd><kwd>infertility</kwd><kwd>precursor spermatogonial stem cells</kwd><kwd>homing of precursor SSCs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32171111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jiali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004826</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5222015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jiali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SRSF1 plays a critical role in posttranscriptional regulation to implement homing of precursor spermatogonial stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS), also known as del Castillo syndrome or germ cell aplasia, is one of the most common causes of severe non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). SCOS is the presence of only Sertoli cells in the testicular tubules of the testes, with no germ cells present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Juul et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). It is well known that abnormal self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) lead to SCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">La and Hobbs, 2019</xref>). In mice, gonocytes begin homing at 0–3 days postpartum (dpp) and then develop into SSCs at 4–6 dpp for continuous self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee and Shinohara, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McLean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tan and Wilkinson, 2020</xref>). The mechanisms regulating homing of precursor SSCs are hence crucial for forming SSC pools and establishing niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>). Spermatogonia migrate to form two distinct subtypes in mice. The first subtype develops into precursor SSCs that provide an SSC population for adult spermatogenesis, whereas the second subtype transitions directly to differentiated spermatogonia that contribute to the first round of spermatogenesis but do not self-renew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kluin and de Rooij, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Law et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, homing of precursor SSCs to establish niches is essential for SSC self-renewal and differentiation.</p><p>Many transcription factors (e.g. FOXO1, PLZF, POU5F1, TAF4B, CHD4, BCL6B, BRACHYURY, ETV5, ID4, LHX1, POU3F1, DMRT1, NGN3, SOHLH1, SOHLH2, SOX3, and STAT3) promote SSC self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cafe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Song and Wilkinson, 2014</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of the posttranscriptional network underlying homing of precursor SSCs are not sufficiently clear. Previous studies have identified the key RNA-binding proteins DND1 and DDX5 in SSCs with a unique and dominant role in posttranscriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Legrand et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamaji et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, recent studies have found that the RNA-binding proteins SRSF10, UHRF1, BUD31, and BCAS2 regulate alternative splicing (AS) in mouse spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). It is well known that testes are rich in AS events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mazin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Venables, 2002</xref>). Thus, understanding the mechanisms of AS in human reproduction can provide new insights into clinical diagnosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of how AS functions in homing of precursor SSCs are still largely unclear.</p><p>Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1, previously SF2/ASF) is a widely studied and important splicing factor involved in cancer progression, heart development, and thymus development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Du et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Katsuyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Katsuyama and Moulton, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lv et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Our previous work has shown that SRSF1 deficiency impairs primordial follicle formation during meiotic prophase I and leads to primary ovarian insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun et al., 2023b</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms by which SRSF1 regulates pre-mRNA splicing in mouse SSCs remain unknown. A mouse model with <italic>Srsf1</italic> conditional deletion can effectively address this uncertainty. This study showed that specific deletion of <italic>Srsf1</italic> in mouse germ cells leads to NOA by impairing homing of mouse precursor SSCs. We further verified that SRSF1 directly binds and regulates <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> expression via AS, which may be critical for homing of mouse precursor SSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SRSF1 may have a vital role in posttranscriptional regulation in the testes</title><p>To investigate the role of SRSF1 in spermatogenesis, the dynamic localisation of SRSF1 in the testis was evaluated. Fascinatingly, the results of SRSF1 and γH2AX co-staining revealed that SRSF1 was expressed during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). RT-qPCR and western blotting results showed that the expression of SRSF1 fluctuated during the developmental stages of the testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Concurrently, the results of SRSF1 and PLZF co-staining revealed that SRSF1 was highly expressed in the nuclei of spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To further explore the function of SRSF1 in regulating SSC self-renewal and differentiation, crosslinking immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq) was performed in adult mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2023a</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of the SRSF1 peak-containing genes revealed that spermatogenesis-related genes were regulated by SRSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In combination with previous studies, we found that spermatogonia-related genes (e.g. <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Id4</italic>, <italic>Setdb1, Stra8</italic>, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic>, <italic>Bcas2</italic>, <italic>Ddx5</italic>, <italic>Srsf10</italic>, <italic>Uhrf1</italic>, and <italic>Bud31</italic>) were bound by SRSF1. To provide in-depth insight into the binding of spermatogonia-associated genes, the SRSF1-binding peaks of the gene transcripts were shown by using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The co-staining results showed localisation and expression of the spermatogonia-related proteins in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these results suggested that SRSF1 may have a vital role in posttranscriptional regulation in the testes, particularly during spermatogonial development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression and localisation of SRSF1 in the testis of mice at different developmental stages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dynamic localisation of SRSF1 during spermatogenesis.

By crossing <italic>Srsf1</italic><sup>Fl</sup> and <italic>Vasa</italic>-Cre mice, we obtained <italic>Vasa</italic>-Cre <italic>Srsf1</italic><sup>Fl/del</sup> mice with <italic>Srsf1</italic> deletion in germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We verified the absence of the SRSF1 protein in germ cells by co-immunofluorescence analyses with SRSF1 and PLZF antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Subsequently, the breeding experiment indicated that conditional knockout (cKO) mice had a standard mating capacity but that the absence of <italic>Srsf1</italic> led to complete infertility in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Histological examination of cKO epididymides revealed that sperm could not be found in the cauda epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Considering the limitations of sectioning, the cauda epididymal sperm count further validated this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). It was clear that spermatogenesis in the testes was severely impaired. Therefore, we focused our attention on the testes. The adult cKO mice were normal in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). However, the sizes of cKO mouse testes were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Histological examination of cKO testis sections showed that no germ cells could be visualised, and only a large number of Sertoli cells were observed in the testes of cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Together, these results demonstrated that SRSF1 is critical for spermatogenesis and that its absence leads to SCOS.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SRSF1 plays critical roles in spermatogenesis and male fertility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Vasa</italic>-Cre mice were crossed with <italic>Srsf1</italic><sup>Fl/Fl</sup> mice to generate <italic>Srsf1</italic> conditional knockout (cKO) mice.

The results of VASA and TRA98 co-staining further confirmed this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Considering the limitations of sectioning, we used whole-mount immunostaining to perform a comprehensive analysis and found that germ cells were indeed absent in the testes of adult cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To dynamically analyse the loss of germ cells, we collected testes from 5 dpp, 7 dpp, and 14 dpp mice. Morphological results showed that the testes of 7 dpp and 14 dpp cKO mice were much smaller than those of Ctrl mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To determine the presence of germ cells in cKO testes, VASA staining was performed in 5 dpp, 7 dpp, and 14 dpp Ctrl and cKO testes.

In addition, TUNEL results showed that apoptosis significantly increased in cKO testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Considering that the CLIP-seq data were obtained from adult mouse testis, the set of genes bound by CLIP-seq was restricted to those expressed only in the 5 dpp mouse testis RNA-seq data. we found that 3543 of the 4824 genes bound by SRSF1 were expressed in testes at 5 dpp. Venn diagram data revealed that 9 out of 715 downregulated genes were bound by SRSF1 and underwent abnormal AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). And 1 out of 258 upregulated genes was bound by SRSF1 and underwent abnormal AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that 39 unchanged genes were bound by SRSF1 and underwent abnormal AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The AS genes were subsequently investigated in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes using transcriptomic analyses. RNA-seq analyses showed that 162 AS events were significantly affected (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt;0.05) in cKO mouse testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Most of the 133 affected AS events (162) were classified as skipped exons (SEs), with 10 AS events categorised as retained introns (RIs), 13 as mutually exclusive exons (MXEs), 4 as alternative 5' splice sites (A5SSs), and 2 as alternative 3' splice sites (A3SSs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Additionally, the overall analysis of aberrant AS events showed that SRSF1 effectively inhibits the occurrence of SE and MXE events and promotes the occurrence of RI events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Then, GO enrichment analyses of AS genes revealed that four genes concerning germ cell development were altered in AS forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

Mouse models are still of great significance and reference for human SCOS studies, and they will provide a better understanding of how SCOS occurs and develops over time. Interestingly, our mouse model had SCOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The absence of germ cells represents classical SCOS in adult mouse testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, we found abnormal expression of spermatogonia-related genes (e.g. <italic>Gfra1</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Dnd1</italic>, <italic>Stra8</italic>, and <italic>Taf4b</italic>) in cKO mouse testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–H</xref>). These differentially expressed genes regulate SSC self-renewal and differentiation in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">La and Hobbs, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tan and Wilkinson, 2020</xref>). Thus, this provided an opportunity for us to better study the underlying molecular mechanisms. These data indicate that SRSF1 deficiency impairs spermatogonia survival, leading to SCOS in male mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The formation of SSC pools and the establishment of niches are essential for spermatogenesis</title><p>The earliest event in the development of the SSC population is the migration of prospermatogonia from the centre of seminiferous cords where they have resided since sex determination of the embryonic gonad to the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>). In mice, this process is also known as homing of precursor SSCs, which occurs in the initial 3 dpp and then develops into SSCs at 4–6 dpp for continuous self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee and Shinohara, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McLean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tan and Wilkinson, 2020</xref>). Therefore, homing analysis of precursor SSCs was performed in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes. Interestingly, the VASA and SOX9 co-staining results demonstrated that partial germ cells could not complete homing in 5 dpp cKO testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Further, immunohistochemical staining for FOXO1 and statistical results indicated that germ cells in which FOXO1 is expressed in the nucleus similarly undergo abnormal homing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Germ cells that do not migrate to the basement membrane are unable to form SSC pools and establish niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McLean et al., 2003</xref>). These SSCs that lose their ecological niche will cease to exist. In our data, TUNEL results showed that apoptosis significantly increased in 7 dpp cKO mouse testes. At once, the quantifications of germ cells per tubule showed a significant reduction in 7 dpp and 14 dpp cKO testes, especially 14 dpp cKO testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In conclusion, SRSF1 is crucial for the formation of SSC pools and the establishment of niches through homing of precursor SSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Abnormal AS impaired the survival of spermatogonia</title><p>AS is commonly found in mammals, especially in the brain and testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mazin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). AS plays essential roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression during many developmental processes, such as SSC self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Song et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, BUD31-mediated AS of <italic>Cdk2</italic> was shown to be required for SSC self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qin et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>Srsf10</italic> depletion disturbed the AS of genes, including <italic>Nasp</italic>, <italic>Bclaf1</italic>, <italic>Rif1</italic>, <italic>Dazl</italic>, <italic>Kit</italic>, <italic>Ret</italic>, and <italic>Sycp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). UHRF1 interacts with snRNAs and regulates AS of <italic>Tle3</italic> in mouse SSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Mettl3-mediated m6A regulates AS of <italic>Sohlh1</italic> and <italic>Dazl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). We found that SRSF1 acts as an alternative RNA splicing regulator and directly interacts with <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> transcripts to regulate splicing events in spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–G</xref>). Additionally, expression levels of TIAL1/TIAR isoform X2 were significantly suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> transcript levels were not inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H and I</xref>). These results suggested that SRSF1 explicitly regulates the expression of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> via AS. Studies have reported that TIAL1/TIAR is essential for primordial germ cell development in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beck et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>Tial1/Tiar</italic> deletion impairs germ cell survival leading to SCOS, consistent with our phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E–I</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beck et al., 1998</xref>). Taken together, SRSF1 may affect germ cell survival by directly binding and regulating <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> expression through AS.</p><p>We found that SRSF1 could interact with AS-related proteins (e.g. SRSF10, SART1, RBM15, SRRM2, SF3B6, and SF3A2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). A recent study reported that SRSF10 deficiency impaired spermatogonia differentiation but did not affect homing of precursor SSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). However, our data showed that SRSF1 is essential for homing of mouse precursor SSCs. Therefore, this suggests that SRSF1 has a specific function in the homing of precursor SSCs independent of SRSF10.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>SRSF1-mediated posttranscriptional regulation during homing of precursor SSCs provides new insights into the treatment of human reproductive diseases</title><p>Aberrant homing of precursor SSCs often lead to gametogenic failure, resulting in subfertility or infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">La and Hobbs, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Song and Wilkinson, 2014</xref>).

The authors first revealed that spermatogonia-related genes (e.g., Plzf, Id4, Setdb1, Stra8, Tial1/Tiar, Bcas2, Ddx5, Srsf10, Uhrf1, and Bud31) were bound by SRSF1 in the mouse testes by CLIP-seq. The authors convincingly demonstrated that specific deletion of SRSF1 in mouse gem cells with vasa-cre lead to NOA by impairing homing and failure survival of spermatogonia. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of SRSF1 in spermatogonia, further multiomics analysis including CLIP-seq, IP-MS, and RNA-seq were conducted. The results showed that SRSF1 coordinated with other RNA splicing-related proteins to directly bind and regulate the expression of nine spermatogonia-related genes especially Tial1/Tiar via alternative splicing. The authors revealed the critical role of SRSF1-mediated AS in precursor SSCs homing and survival, which may provide a framework to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the posttranscriptional network underlying the formation of SSC pools and the establishment of niches. This work will be of interest to stem cell and reproductive biologists. The experiments are well-designed and conducted, and the overall methods and results are convincing except for the claim that altered splicing of the Tial1 transcript mediates the effect of SRSF1 loss.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89316.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary</p><p>The authors seek to characterize the role of splicing factor SRSF1 during spermatogenesis. Using a conditional deletion of Srsf1 in germ cells, they find that SRSF1 is required for male fertility. Via immunostaining and RNA-seq analysis of the Srsf1 conditional knockout (cKO) testes, combined with SRSF1 CLIP-seq and IP-MS data from the testis, they ultimately conclude that Srsf1 is required for homing of precursor spermatogonial stem cells (SCCs) due to alternative splicing.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The overall methods and results are robust. The histological analysis of the Srsf1 cKO traces the origins of the fertility defect to the postnatal testis, and the authors have generated interesting datasets characterizing SRSF1's RNA targets and interacting proteins specifically in the testis.</p><p>Ultimately, the authors have shown that SRSF1's effects on alternative splicing are required to establish spermatogenesis. In the absence of Srsf1, the postnatal gonocytes do not properly mature into spermatogonia and consequently never initiate spermatogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89316.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, Sun et al examine the role of the splicing factor SRSF1 in spermatogenesis in mice. Alternative splicing is important for spermatogenic development, but its regulation and major developmental roles during spermatogenesis are not well understood. The authors set out to better define both SRSF1 function in testes and the contribution of alternative splicing. They generate several large 'omics datasets to define SRSF1 targets in testis, including RNA interactions by CLIP-seq in whole testis, protein interactions by IP-mass spec in whole testis, and RNA sequencing to detect expression levels and splice variants. They also examine the phenotype of germline conditional knockouts (cKO) for Srsf1, using the early-acting Vasa-Cre, and find a severe depletion of germ cells starting at 7 days post partum (dpp) and culminating with a lack of germ cells (Sertoli Cell Only Syndrome) by adulthood. They detect differences in gene expression as well as differences in splicing between control and knockout, including 9 genes that are downregulated, experience alternative splicing, and whose transcripts are also bound by SRSF1, and identify the Tial1/Tiar transcript as one of these targets. They conclude that SRSF1 is required for homing and self-renewal of precursor spermatogonial stem cells, and suggest that this role may be mediated in part though its regulation of Tial1/Tiar splicing.</p><p>Strengths of the paper include detailed phenotyping of the Srsf1 cKO, which convincingly supports the Sertoli Cell Only phenotype, establishes the timing of the first appearance of the spermatogonial defect, and provides new insight into the role of splicing factors and SRSF1 specifically in spermatogenesis. Another strength is the generation of CLIP-seq, IP-MS, and RNA-seq datasets which will be a useful resource for the field of germ cell development. Overall, the results support the claims made. While the study does not provide a full mechanistic understanding of how alternative splicing mediated by SRSF1 affects SSC precursors, the contributions are novel and useful, and will be of interest to the fields of alternative splicing and male reproductive biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89316.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Longjie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lv</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xuexue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Biophysics</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Shuang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chaofan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Xiaomei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Xiaohong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shao</surname><given-names>Yujing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Sheng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Yangzhou University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Yangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jiali</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Fig. 2B: In their previous comment #6, I assume that Reviewer #2 was asking about peaks that were called as statistically significant above background, not just &quot;higher&quot; as assessed by eye. The authors have now marked peaks that are &quot;higher&quot; but still do not indicate that they were called as statistically significant by any software. I agree that they need to indicate in the figure which peaks were discovered by formal analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the professional suggestions. We used the Piranha (version 1.2.1) software to call peaks from CLIP-seq data, in which the P-value threshold for peaks (i.e., the -p parameter) was set as 0.05. And then any region above the IgG peak could be a binding region, and of course, the higher the peak, the more pre-mRNA SRSF1 binds in that region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Similar to the above comment, in Fig. 7G &quot;visual analysis&quot; of IGV tracks is not an assay. It is fine to show the tracks as an example of the differential expression called using DESeq2, but this should be described for what it is.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the professional comments.

There appears to be a mistake in line 285-287, which reads: &quot;the overall analysis of aberrant AS events showed that SRSF1 effectively promotes the occurrence of SE and MXE events and inhibits the occurrence of RI events.&quot; The data in Fig 8C appears to show the opposite, with more SE and MXE, and fewer RI events, in the SRSF1 KO. This would imply that SRSF1 normally inhibits SE/MXE and promotes RI.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you very much for the professional comments. Following this advice, we have corrected the text in this revised version (Page 14, Line 286-288).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Fig. 8E, an upper band is depleted in SRSF1 KO, but in Figure 8J, a much lower band is depleted. How is this explained?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the professional suggestions. Since exon 7 of Tial1 is in the non-coding region, the lower band in Figure 8E does not correspond to the lower band in Figure 8J. For better understanding, we show the detailed information of Tial1 in the attached Figure S3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.
