Assembly of TopBP1, a multifunctional scaffolding protein, into condensates is required to amplify ATR kinase activity to the levels needed to coordinate the DNA damage response and manage DNA replication stress. Many ATR inhibitors are tested for cancer treatment in clinical trials, but their overall effectiveness is often compromised by the emergence of resistance and toxicities. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose to disrupt the ATR pathway by targeting TopBP1 condensation. First, we screened a molecule-based library using a previously developed optogenetic approach and identified several TopBP1 condensation inhibitors. Among them, AZD2858 disrupted TopBP1 assembly induced by the clinically relevant topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38, thereby inhibiting the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway. We found that AZD2858 exerted its effects by disrupting TopBP1 self-interaction and binding to ATR in mammalian cells, and by increasing its chromatin recruitment in cell-free <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts. Moreover, AZD2858 prevented S-phase checkpoint induction by SN-38, leading to increased DNA damage and apoptosis in a colorectal cancer cell line. Lastly, AZD2858 showed a synergistic effect in combination with the FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen in a spheroid model of colorectal cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biomolecul condensate</kwd><kwd>targeted therapy</kwd><kwd>TopBP1/ATR pathway</kwd><kwd>replication stress response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03m8vkq32</institution-id><institution>Institut National du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PLBIO2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gongora</surname><given-names>Céline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00rbzpz17</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AAPG2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constantinou</surname><given-names>Angelos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00rbzpz17</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bordignon</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation MSD Avenir</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constantinou</surname><given-names>Angelos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pharmacological disruption of TopBP1 condensation impairs ATR signaling, promotes DNA damage and apoptosis, and enhances the efficacy of FOLFIRI chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In every cell, thousands of DNA lesions are induced by endogenous and environmental agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindahl and Barnes, 2000</xref>). To overcome their deleterious effects, cells have evolved an intricate network of DNA damage response pathways that detect, signal, and repair DNA lesions. These pathways work in coordination with key physiological processes, such as cell cycle progression, chromatin remodeling, and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>). Cancer cells typically exhibit higher levels of genotoxic stress than non-transformed cells due to their altered metabolism and high proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jackson and Helleday, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015</xref>). As a complement to radiotherapy and chemotherapy that overload cancer cells with DNA lesions, the aim of novel anticancer strategies is to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to genotoxic stress by targeting DNA damage signaling and DNA repair mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jackson and Helleday, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>For example, ATR signaling activates cell cycle checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Baltimore, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eykelenboom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Klein et al., 2000</xref>), promotes DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tercero and Diffley, 2001</xref>), regulates the firing of replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toledo et al., 2013</xref>), and the cellular pool of deoxyribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">D’Angiolella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lopez-Contreras et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). The ATR signaling pathway is also essential for the proliferation of cancer cells that display intrinsically higher levels of genotoxic stress. Therefore, several clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of ATR inhibitors in patients with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lecona and Fernandez-Capetillo, 2018</xref>), particularly cancers in which the oncogene CDC25A is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruiz et al., 2016</xref>). However, as kinase inhibitors often exert a strong selective pressure for the acquisition of drug resistance through kinase mutations, alternative therapeutic options must be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhullar et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Unlike classical approaches that target the activity of a specific protein with small molecule inhibitors, recent cell biology advances suggest that targeting biomolecular condensates may provide conceptually novel approaches to drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mitrea et al., 2022</xref>). Biomolecular condensates are subcellular compartments that selectively concentrate hundreds of proteins and nucleic acids, without a surrounding membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>). These structures underlie the spatiotemporal organization of multiple biological processes. Moreover, the aberrant properties of condensates have been implicated in many diseases, including neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy, cancer, and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mitrea et al., 2022</xref>). Condensate formation is typically driven by multivalent scaffold proteins that function as central nodes in molecular networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>). Therefore, one potential approach to disturb the condensate properties and functions is to interfere with their essential protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions.</p><p>In humans, the main ATR activator in S-phase is Topoisomerase IIβ binding protein 1 (TopBP1), a scaffold protein that includes nine BRCA1 carboxyl terminal (BRCT) protein-protein interaction motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumagai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wardlaw et al., 2014</xref>) and an intrinsically disordered ATR activation domain located between BRCT6 and BRCT7-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumagai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies indicate that TopBP1 activates the ATR signaling pathway via the formation of biomolecular condensates, which appear as nuclear foci by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frattini et al., 2021</xref>). The available evidence suggests that ATR activation is a multistep process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koundrioukoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egger et al., 2024</xref>). TopBP1 is recruited to ATR-activating DNA structures by MRE11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duursma et al., 2013</xref>) and binds to RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo et al., 2016</xref>), ATRIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mordes et al., 2008</xref>), and the 9-1-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delacroix et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2007</xref>) to form a stable ATR-activating complex. Then, TopBP1 is phosphorylated by the basal kinase activity of ATR, triggering the assembly of TopBP1 condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frattini et al., 2021</xref>). We found that TopBP1 condensation functions as a molecular switch that amplifies ATR activity up to the level required for signal transduction by the checkpoint effector kinase Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frattini et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we explored the feasibility of targeting TopBP1 condensates as a novel strategy to interfere with ATR signaling and sensitize colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. We present a high-throughput optogenetic screening approach to identify small-molecule modulators of TopBP1 condensation. Using this approach, we identified AZD2858, a known glycogen synthase 3β (GSK-3β) inhibitor, as a potential modulator of TopBP1 condensation. We demonstrated in a CRC cell line that AZD2858 (at very low doses) inhibits the assembly of endogenous TopBP1 and suppresses the activation of the ATR/Chk1 pathway induced by the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Furthermore, the combination of AZD2858 with FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil+SN-38) displayed a synergistic effect in CRC cell spheroid cultures, including in spheroids from CRC cells resistant to SN-38. Incubation with AZD2858 for 6–12 hr improved the induction of apoptosis by SN-38 and FOLFIRI by dampening the S checkpoint. Our observations suggest that the cytotoxic effects observed with the AZD2858 and SN-38 combination are mainly explained by disruption of TopBP1 assembly, rather than by the direct involvement of the GSK-3β pathway. These data support the feasibility of targeting condensates formed in response to DNA damage to improve chemotherapy-based cancer treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identifying modulators of TopBP1 condensation with an optogenetic approach</title><p>Resistance to conventional chemotherapies is the major cause of therapy failure in patients with cancer. In CRC, irinotecan resistance is often caused by overexpression of efflux pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). However, additional pathways may also contribute, particularly the DNA damage response pathways that are frequently activated in various cancer types to cope with increased DNA replication stress. TopBP1 has been implicated in oxaliplatin resistance in gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fang et al., 2022</xref>) and is overexpressed in several cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Forma et al., 2013</xref>). We first examined the number of TopBP1 condensates in the CRC cell lines HCT116 and HCT116-SN50 (50-fold more resistant to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, than the parental HCT116 cell line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Candeil et al., 2004</xref>) and observed a significantly higher number of TopBP1 foci in HCT116-SN50 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, our previous findings suggest that TopBP1 condensation is required to amplify ATR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frattini et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, targeting TopBP1 assembly could be a promising strategy for cancer treatment. To this end, we developed an optogenetic system for screening molecules that modulate the formation of TopBP1 condensates. We used the stable Flp-In 293 T-Rex cell line in which expression of TopBP1 fused to the photoreceptor Cry2 and mCherry (optoTopBP1) is induced by doxycycline. Cry2 forms tetramers when exposed to 488 nm light and thereby nucleates the assembly of TopBP1 condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frattini et al., 2021</xref>). The advantage of this optogenetic approach is that TopBP1 condensates are formed on demand, within minutes, in the absence of DNA damaging agents that can induce confounding effects after prolonged treatment. After a 2 hr incubation step of optoTopBP1-expressing Flp-In 293 T-Rex cells with 10 µM of each molecule from the TargetMol library of preclinical and clinical compounds, we exposed cells to an array of blue light-emitting diodes for 5 min of light-dark cycles (4 s light followed by 10 s dark) to induce optoTopBP1 condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After quantification of the number of TopBP1 foci per nucleus, we assigned a z-score to each candidate molecule based on this count. We considered molecules with a z-score lower than –2 as potential TopBP1 condensation inhibitors (red dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We identified &gt;300 molecules that could be potential TopBP1 condensation inhibitors among the 4730 compounds. Then, we selected 131 compounds (based on the best z-scores) and assessed their effect on the ATR pathway activation in HCT116 cells using two complementary approaches. First, we evaluated these compounds at two low concentrations (1 and 10 µM) using a quantitative immunofluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vezzio-Vié et al., 2022</xref>) in flat-bottomed 384-well plates to monitor phosphorylation at S315 of the kinase effector Chk1 following incubation with SN-38 alone or with each of the 131 preselected compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This allowed us to select the 10 most effective drugs (MCB-613, OTSSP167, AZD2858, P005091, tubercidin, dactolisib, physalin F, PFK158, PF562271, torkinib) based on their ability to inhibit Chk1 phosphorylation. For the second approach, we incubated HCT116 cells with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and SN-38 (FOLFIRI thereafter) to mimic in vitro the first-line chemotherapy regimen for patients with metastatic CRC (i.e. FOLFIRI: folic acid or leucovorin, 5-FU, and irinotecan) and each of the 10 drugs and detected their interactions using a full-range dose matrix approach and SRB cytotoxicity assays. We quantified cell survival and the additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects. We observed the strongest synergistic interactions between FOLFIRI and AZD2858 (a known GSK-3β inhibitor). Consequently, we focused our study on AZD2858, which was efficient already at 1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of TopBP1 condensation inhibitors by high-throughput screening.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic description of the high-throughput screening system.

We incubated SW620 cells in which endogenous GSK-3β was depleted or not by shRNA with SN-38 and/or AZD2858 (0.1 and 1 µM) for 2 hr. SN-38-induced Chk1 phosphorylation at S345 was comparable in GSK3-β-depleted cells (shGSK3) and control cells (shLuc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, the SN-38 and AZD2858 combination inhibited Chk1 phosphorylation in shGSK3 and shLuc cells, indicating that GSK-3β is not involved in Chk1 phosphorylation inhibition by AZD2858. The combination did not increase significantly the level of GSK-3β phosphorylated at S9, a marker of kinase inhibition, unlike what was observed with insulin, a well-known regulator of GSK-3β activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cross et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In addition, among the molecules tested from the TargetMol library, other more effective and specific GSK-3β inhibitors, compared with AZD2858, did not show any effect on light-induced optoTopBP1 condensation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These findings suggest that although AZD2858 is a GSK-3β inhibitor, its modulation of the ATR/Chk1 pathway is not due to this function. To identify the underlying mechanisms, we used a biotin proximity-labeling approach to assess TopBP1 interaction with cellular partners in the presence of AZD2858 and/or SN-38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alghoul et al., 2021</xref>). For this, we used our optoTopBP1 construct tagged at its N-terminus with TurboID, an optimized biotin ligase that allows protein biotinylation within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). We incubated Flp-In 293 T-Rex cells that stably express TurboID-tagged optoTopBP1 with AZD2858 and/or SN-38 for 2 hr and added biotin for the last 30 min. Isolation of biotinylated proteins using streptavidin-coated beads highlighted a drastic reduction in TopBP1 proximity with recombinant and endogenous TopBP1 and also with ATR upon incubation with AZD2858 alone or with SN-38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These findings suggest that AZD2858 disrupts TopBP1 self-association and its interaction with its primary activator ATR. This may contribute to the observed decrease in SN-38-induced TopBP1 foci following AZD2858 administration. Next, we determined whether TopBP1 recruitment to chromatin was altered by AZD2858 using the well-established cell-free DNA replication system derived from <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts in which replication of demembranated sperm nuclei occurs synchronously, independently of transcription or protein synthesis. In the presence of the topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT, replication fork progression was challenged, leading to a reduction in polymerase (Pol) ε levels and an accumulation of DNA-bound TopBP1 and RPA to activate the checkpoint response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). When AZD2858 was added to the extract alone or with CPT, TopBP1 recruitment to chromatin was not inhibited. Our data demonstrate that combining CPT and AZD2858 earlier enhances the accumulation of replication-related factors (RPA, TopBP1, and Pol ε) on chromatin compared to CPT treatment alone, particularly visible at the 60 min after starting replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This may be due to increased origin activation, as normally seen when the S-phase checkpoint is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marheineke and Hyrien, 2004</xref>).

We observe a heterogeneous population in the combination treatment, with some CldU tracts remaining short, similar to those in SN-38-treated cells, while others were longer, resembling those observed in untreated cells. This heterogeneity contributes to an overall increase in the mean length of CldU tracts in cells treated with the combination of AZD2858 and SN-38.</p><p>Moreover, the impact of the combination treatment becomes more pronounced over time. Indeed, there was a tendency for the SN-38-induced S-phase checkpoint to be weakened after 6 and 12 hr of co-treatment with AZD2858 and SN-38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).

Cells were pulse-labeled with BrdU for 15 min, washed, and then incubated with SN-38 and/or AZD2858 for 6 and 12 hr. In the combination treatment, at 12 hr, we observed an increase in the proportion of cells transitioning into S-phase, which were initially in G1 (BrdU-negative) and progressed to a mid-S DNA content state (between 2N and 4N) (green squares) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

While this trend was consistently observed across all experiments, the increase was modest and did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This suggests that the combination of SN-38 and AZD2858 attenuates the S-phase checkpoint, thereby activating a compensatory post-replicative cell cycle checkpoint that arrests the cell cycle before mitosis.</p><p>Abrogation of the replication checkpoint allows cells to enter and progress into the S-phase with unrepaired DNA damage. We evaluated the level of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) using PFGE and monitored γH2AX and cleaved PARP1 expression by western blotting in cells exposed to SN-38 and AZD2838 at various time points. DSBs remained elevated after the combined treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, γH2AX and cleaved PARP1 levels increased at later time points of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Altogether, these findings indicate that the AZD2858 and SN-38 combination disrupts TopBP1 assembly, most likely by inhibiting ATR kinase activity amplification, a critical process for inducing the S-phase checkpoint and regulating DNA damage repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>AZD2858 treatment synergizes with conventional chemotherapy drugs</title><p>In the absence of an effective S-phase checkpoint, DNA damage can lead to apoptosis and cell death.

The three drugs displayed mainly cytostatic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as indicated by the absence of cell death (lower panels) even at doses that decreased cell proliferation (upper panels). Next, we stained with PI/Hoechst and performed SRB assays in HCT116 cells, CT-26 cells (murine CRC cell line), and CCD 841 CoN (untransformed colorectal cells) incubated with increasing concentrations of AZD2858 and FOLFIRI (matrix analysis).

We exploited our ability to control TopBP1 condensation and ATR activation using an optogenetic approach to develop a high-throughput screening procedure for identifying modulators of TopBP1 condensation. As proof of concept, we screened a TargetMol library of 4730 preclinical and clinical compounds. Through this approach, we found that AZD2858, a known GSK3-β inhibitor, is also a potential inhibitor of TopBP1 condensation. Using a complementary approach based on the irinotecan active metabolite SN-38 to induce DNA damage in CRC cells, we confirmed that AZD2858 disrupts endogenous TopBP1 condensates, thus affecting the ATR signaling pathway.</p><p>AZD2858 inhibits GSK-3β activity and activates the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, AZD2858 has cytotoxic effects in glioma cell lines through disruption of centrosome function and mitotic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brüning-Richardson et al., 2021</xref>), and affects glioma proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings show that AZD2858, at nanomolar concentrations, alters TopBP1 condensation without influencing GSK-3β activity and does not require the presence of GSK-3β to prevent Chk1 activation by SN-38. These observations clearly rule out the involvement of the GSK-3β pathway in TopBP1 condensate formation inhibition by AZD2858.</p><p>TopBP1 is overexpressed in several cancer types, including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Forma et al., 2012</xref>) and advanced-stage CRC, as well as radiotherapy-resistant lung cancer cells and oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fang et al., 2022</xref>). This overexpression is associated with high-grade tumors and poor prognosis. Notably, inhibition of TopBP1 expression increases the radiosensitivity of lung cancer and brain metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2014</xref>) and also DNA damage in oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fang et al., 2022</xref>). To date, no study assessed or visualized TopBP1 condensate levels in tumors, or investigated whether their presence is linked to poor prognosis. Here, we found that TopBP1 condensates are increased in SN-38-resistant CRC cells. Many attempts have been made to target TopBP1 activity. Weei-Chin Lin’s team was the first to perform two large-scale molecular docking screens targeting the BRCT7/8 domains of TopBP1. They identified calcein AM and 5D4 as compounds that block TopBP1 oligomerization and demonstrated their anticancer activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, 5D4 also disrupts TopBP1 interaction with E2F1, mutant p53, CIP2A, and MIZ1, leading to E2F1-mediated apoptosis, suppression of mutant p53, and repression of MYC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated that AZD2858 disrupts the interaction between TopBP1 and its canonical partner ATR and also its self-interaction. Additionally, in cell-free <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts, AZD2858, alone or in combination with the topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT, enhanced the DNA binding occupancy of both TopBP1 and RPA32. These findings, combined with the cell cycle and DNA fiber results, suggest that AZD2858 abrogates the intra-S-phase and DNA elongation checkpoints induced by SN-38, leading to unscheduled DNA synthesis. In addition, incubation with SN-38+AZD2858 enhanced DNA damage and apoptosis, as indicated by (i) the increased γH2AX levels, (ii) the persistence of DSBs (PFGE assay), (iii) the expression of cleaved PARP1 and caspase-3 (apoptotic markers), and (iv) the accumulation of sub-G1 cells. Incubation with the AZD2858+SN-38 combination mimicked the effects observed with ATR inhibitors when combined with topoisomerase I inhibitors, such as CPT, topotecan, and SN-38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Egger et al., 2022</xref>). For instance, the ATR inhibitors VE-821 and VE-822 sensitize cancer cells to CPT derivatives by alleviating the intra-S-phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Egger et al., 2022</xref>) and induce apoptosis mediated by caspase-3 when combined with SN-38 because cells experience extensive DNA damage due to failure of the replication checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Egger et al., 2022</xref>). Importantly, the efficacy of several ATR inhibitors is currently being investigated in preclinical studies or in phase I/II clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy-induced replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>). We also showed a synergistic effect of the AZD2858+FOLFIRI combination, including in SN-38-resistant HCT116 cell lines, due to the increased apoptosis and accumulation of DNA damage. Given the similarity of mechanism between AZD2858 and ATR inhibitors, when combined with chemotherapy (SN-38 or CPT), we hypothesize that AZD2858 could prevent the development of resistance because its mechanism of action is not to inhibit the ATR kinase but to prevent the interaction of TopBP1 with ATR. FOLFIRI is used as a first-line chemotherapy regimen for patients with metastatic CRC and gastric/gastroesophageal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Van Cutsem et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the last decade, a major advance has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of various cytoplasmic and nuclear membrane-less organelles within cells, revolutionizing the field of cell biology. Recent studies highlighted the importance of compartmentalizing cellular components into mesoscale structures, known as biomolecular condensates, implicated in new physiological functions and in triggering the activation of specific signaling pathways. Many research projects have incorporated condensates into the understanding of cancer pathogenesis, leading to the development of new therapeutic strategies to target cancer-associated condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suzuki and Onimaru, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boija et al., 2021</xref>).

Targeting TopBP1 assembly, rather than its degradation, offers an interesting strategy to selectively inhibit its role in the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway activation, while preserving its other essential functions in replication and transcription that do not rely on its assembly.</p><p>Overall, this study brought the first insights into the rationale of targeting the condensation of TopBP1, a multifunctional protein that forms biomolecular condensates in response to DNA damage to inhibit the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway and to potentiate conventional therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Flp-In 293 T-REx cells were obtained from Thermo Fisher and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)-GlutaMAX medium (Merck-Sigma-Aldrich, #D5796) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS).

TopBP1 plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response, and specifically the activation of ATR. They found that the GSK-3b inhibitor AZD2858 reduced the formation of TopBP1 condensates and activation of ATR and its downstream target CHK1 in colorectal cancer cell lines treated with the clinically relevant irinotecan active metabolite SN-38. This inhibition of TopBP1 condensates by AZD2858 was independent from its effect on GSK-3b enzymatic activity. Mechanistically, they show that AZD2858 thus can interfere with intra-S-phase checkpoint signaling, resulting in enhanced cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of SN-38 (or SN-38+Fluoracil aka FOLFIRI) in vitro in colorectal carcinoma cell lines.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The requested plots are in figure S7 of the latest manuscript version, and look convincing.

A key tool that made these studies possible was the use of a chimeric Topbp1 protein bearing a cryptochrome domain, Cry2, which triggered condensation of the chimeric Topbp1 protein, and thus activation of ATR and Chk1, in response to irradiation with blue light without the myriad complications associated with actually exposing cells to DNA damage.</p><p>In this current report Morano and co-workers utilise the same optogenetic Topbp1 system to investigate a different question, namely whether Topbp1 phase-condensation can be inhibited pharmacologically to manipulate downstream ATR-Chk1 signalling. This is of interest, as the therapeutic potential of the ATR-Chk1 pathway is an area of active investigation, albeit generally using more conventional kinase inhibitor approaches.</p><p>The starting point is a high throughput screen of 4730 existing or candidate small molecule anti-cancer drugs for compounds capable of inhibiting the condensation of the Topbp1-Cry2-mCherry reporter molecule in vivo. A surprisingly large number of putative hits (&gt;300) were recorded, from which 131 of the most potent were selected for secondary screening using activation of Chk1 in response to DNA damage induced by SN-38, a topoisomerase inhibitor, as a surrogate marker for Topbp1 condensation. From this the 10 most potent compounds were tested for interactions with a clinically used combination of SN-38 and 5-FU (FOLFIRI) in terms of cytotoxicity in HCT116 cells. The compound that synergised most potently with FOLFIRI, the GSK3-beta inhibitor drug AZD2858, was selected for all subsequent experiments.</p><p>AZD2858 is shown to suppress the formation of Topbp1 (endogenous) condensates in cells exposed to SN-38, and to inhibit activation of Chk1 without interfering with activation of ATM or other endpoints of damage signalling such as formation of gamma-H2AX or activation of Chk2 (generally considered to be downstream of ATM). AZD2858 therefore seems to selectively inhibit the Topbp1-ATR-Chk1 pathway without interfering with parallel branches of the DNA damage signalling system, consistent with Topbp1 condensation being the primary target. Importantly, neither siRNA depletion of GSK3-beta, or other GSK3-beta inhibitors were able to recapitulate this effect, suggesting it was a specific non-canonical effect of AZD2858 and not a consequence of GSK3-beta inhibition per se.</p><p>To understand the basis for synergism between AZD2858 and SN-38 in terms of cell killing, the effect of AZD2858 on the replication checkpoint was assessed. This is a response, mediated via ATR-Chk1, that modulates replication origin firing and fork progression in S-phase cell under conditions of DNA damage or when replication is impeded. SN-38 treatment of HCT116 cells markedly suppresses DNA replication, however this was partially reversed by co-treatment with AZD2858, consistent with the failure to activate ATR-Chk1 conferring a defect in replication checkpoint function.</p><p>Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that AZD2858 can markedly enhance the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of SN-38 and FOLFIRI through a combination of increased apoptosis and growth arrest according to dosage and treatment conditions. Figure 6 extends this analysis to cells cultured as spheroids, sometimes considered to better represent tumor responses compared to single cell cultures.</p><p>Significance:</p><p>Liquid phase separation of protein complexes is increasingly recognised as a fundamental mechanism in signal transduction and other cellular processes. One recent and important example was that of Topbp1, whose condensation in response to DNA damage is required for efficient activation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway. The current study asks a related but distinct question; can protein condensation be targeted by drugs to manipulate signalling pathways which in the main rely on protein kinase cascades?</p><p>Here, the authors identify an inhibitor of GSK3-beta as a novel inhibitor of DNA damage-induced Topbp1 condensation and thus of ATR-Chk1 signalling.</p><p>This work will be of interest to researchers in the fields of DNA damage signalling, biophysics of protein condensation, and cancer chemotherapy.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>Having read the revised manuscript and rebuttal I am satisfied that the authors have resolved my various original concerns through a combination of clarification/ explanation and textual changes necessary to make the description of certain data precise. My impression is that they have also largely or completely satisfied the concerns of the other reviewers, with the possible exception of reviewer 1's point about the relative toxicity of AZD and FOLFIRI in colorectal cancer cell lines versus the untransformed CCD841 cell line. This is of course an important point with respect to the possible practical application of this combination for cancer therapy, however this seems somewhat subsidiary to the main novelty and significance of the findings, which are that protein liquid phase separation/ condensation can be manipulated pharmacologically to modify signal transduction processes and that existing drugs can be re-purposed to this end.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106196.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have extended their previous research to develop TOPBP1 as a potential drug target for colorectal cancer by inhibiting its condensation.

manuscript and read the rebuttal. The authors have carefully addressed my concerns. There is however one point that needs further work:</p><p>This follows up on my major point #1 in my initial review. I had I asked the authors to demonstrate that FOLFIRI + AZD are less toxic to untransformed colorectal cells than colorectal cancer cell lines. It is good to see that the authors took my advice and show effects of the drug treatments on the untransformed colorectal cell line CCD841. It seems to be less sensitive to AZD and FOLFIRI in the figure in the rebuttal. What surprises me is that I cannot find these new figures anywhere in the revised manuscript. Also, the data seem preliminary, because I do not see any standard errors in the graphs, and I cannot find a description of the time of drug incubation. I ask the authors to make sure that the CCD841 data are reproducible, and make sure they incorporate the data in the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. In the initial revised version of the manuscript, we did not include results from the untransformed colorectal cell line CCD841, as those experiments had only been performed once and were considered preliminary. However, we fully agree with the reviewer on the importance of including these data.</p><p>To address this, we have repeated the experiments in CCD841 cells to ensure reproducibility. We now report the results from three independent experiments testing the combination of AZD2858 and FOLFIRI on healthy epithelial colon cells. These results are shown in Supplementary Figure S7, where blue matrices represent cell viability and black matrices reflect the level of synergy between AZD2858 and FOLFIRI.</p><p>Our results confirm that, individually, each drug has little to no effect on healthy cells, and no consistent synergistic interaction was observed, except in Experiment 1, which could not be reproduced. Importantly, the drug concentrations used were identical to those applied in the cancer cell experiments, allowing for direct comparison between normal and malignant cell responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>Morano et al. have revised their manuscript in response to the points raised by reviewer #3 as follows.</p><p>(1) Fig. 2E: Correcting the previously erroneous labelling of this Fig. makes it match the textual description.</p><p>(2) Figs 3A and B: The revised textual description of the flow cytometry BrdU incorporation is now precise.</p><p>(3) Fig. 3E: Removing the suspect WB images is a pragmatic decision that does not significantly affect the overall conclusions of the paper.</p><p>(4) Fig. 3D: Despite its puzzling appearance this data is now described accurately in the text as &quot;DSBs remained elevated after the combined treatment&quot; rather than &quot;increased after the combined treatment. A more convincing increase in the presumed damaged DNA band is evident in Fig. 4D when AZD2858 is combined with a much lower concentration of SN38 (1.5nM) which could mean that the concentration used in Fig. 3D (300nM) induced maximal damage that could not be further enhanced.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comments and constructive feedback, which have helped us improve the clarity and rigor of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The authors have addressed most of the concerns that I raised in the first round of revision and I have no further questions.
