Patterns of splicing complexity differ between species, but it is unclear how these differences arise. We used inter-species association mapping with Saccharomycotina species to correlate splicing signal phenotypes with the presence or absence of splicing factors. Here, we show that variation in 5’ splice site sequence preferences correlate with the presence of the U6 snRNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase METTL16 and the splicing factor SNRNP27K. The greatest variation in 5’ splice site sequence occurred at the +4 position and involved a preference switch between adenosine and uridine. Loss of METTL16 and SNRNP27K orthologs, or a single SNRNP27K methionine residue, was associated with a preference for +4 U. These findings are consistent with splicing analyses of mutants defective in either METTL16 or SNRNP27K orthologs and models derived from spliceosome structures, demonstrating that inter-species association mapping is a powerful orthogonal approach to molecular studies. We identified variation between species in the occurrence of two major classes of 5’ splice sites, defined by distinct interaction potentials with U5 and U6 snRNAs, that correlates with intron number. We conclude that variation in concerted processes of 5’ splice site selection by U6 snRNA is associated with evolutionary changes in splicing signal phenotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>phylogenetics</kwd><kwd>RNA modification</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>m6A</kwd><kwd>interspecies association mapping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/V010662/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>Gordon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/W007673/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Geoffrey J</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>Gordon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>220212/Z/20/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fica</surname><given-names>Sebastian M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The excision of introns and the splicing together of flanking exon sequences from RNA Polymerase II-transcribed RNAs is mediated by dynamic assemblies of proteins and small nuclear RNAs (UsnRNAs) called spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>). The number of introns and the complexity of splicing patterns vary widely between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irimia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sales-Lee et al., 2021</xref>). For example, human gene expression is characterised by a relatively large number of introns and spliceosomal proteins, degenerate splicing cis-elements, and complex patterns of alternative splicing choices on transcripts from the same gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Rio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nilsen and Graveley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sales-Lee et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, most genes in the experimental model <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> lack introns; splicing cis-elements are almost invariant and alternative splicing is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neuvéglise et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Plaschka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sales-Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Alternative splicing correlates with developmental complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bénitìere et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bush et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wright et al., 2022</xref>). Yet some developmentally simple fungal species, including <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans,</italic> have many introns, degenerate splicing signals, and a near complete repertoire of human spliceosomal protein orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Csuros et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitrovich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sales-Lee et al., 2021</xref>). The simplification of splicing detected in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> must therefore have occurred through the evolutionary loss of some introns and splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Csuros et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irimia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitrovich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rogozin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schwartz et al., 2008</xref>). It is unclear what drives global splicing patterns to become either more or less complex or how these changes in complexity are achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bénitìere et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bush et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wright et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Splicing proceeds through two sequential transesterification reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>). The first reaction, branching, occurs via nucleophilic attack of the 5’ splice site (5’SS) by the 2’ hydroxyl of the intron branch point adenosine. The second reaction, exon ligation, occurs via nucleophilic attack of the 3’ hydroxyl of the 5’ exon on the 3’ splice site (3’SS). Spliceosomes undergo sequential conformational and compositional changes as they process introns. During initial assembly, potential 5’SSs are typically recognised by U1 snRNA, and the branch point adenosine and 3’SS are recognised cooperatively by binding of the SF1 and U2AF proteins, and U2 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fica, 2020</xref>). 5’SSs are subsequently transferred to U5 and U6 snRNA. In humans, 5’SS transfer is decoupled from active site formation, potentially enabling plasticity in 5’SS selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charenton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fica, 2020</xref>). U5 snRNA loop 1 binds to the exon upstream of the 5’SS. The conserved ACAGA sequence of U6 snRNA pairs with the intron sequence adjacent to the 5’SS. The central adenosine of human U6 snRNA AC<bold>A</bold>GA is methylated at the N6 position (m<sup>6</sup>A) by METTL16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoyama et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Warda et al., 2017</xref>). Cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures show that human U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A<sub>43</sub> faces the +4 position of the 5’SS (which is generally A in humans) in a trans Hoogsteen sugar edge interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2022</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A-modification of the U6 snRNA AC<bold>A</bold>GA sequence is found in diverse eukaryotes. For example, the corresponding U6 snRNA nucleotide is m<sup>6</sup>A-modified in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> by METTL16 orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishigami et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mendel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, cryo-EM structures of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> spliceosomal complexes reveal major differences with humans in these early stages of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charenton et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> the transfer of 5’ SSs from U1 to U5 and U6 snRNA is directly coupled to active site formation. U5 snRNA loop 1 pairs with degenerate upstream exon sequences while the ACAGA box of U6 snRNA pairs with almost invariant intron sequences. There is no METTL16 ortholog in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the ACAGA sequence is not m<sup>6</sup>A-modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morais et al., 2021</xref>). The central adenosine of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> U6 snRNA ACAGA does not face a 5’SS +4 A but instead makes a Watson-Crick base pair with the almost invariant +4 U of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 5’SSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neuvéglise et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, these early steps in 5’SS selection exemplify distinctions between species that differ not only in terms of developmental complexity but also patterns of splicing complexity.</p><p>The direct impact of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification on splicing in humans remains uncharacterised. However, recent analyses of mutants lacking METTL16 orthologs in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<italic>mtl16</italic>Δ) and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>fio1</italic>) have revealed that U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification has profound effects on the accuracy and efficiency of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishigami et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2022</xref>). Global splicing analyses of <italic>S. pombe mtl16Δ</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis fio1</italic> mutants show that 5’SSs with +4 A are most sensitive to the loss of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification. In contrast, splicing became more efficient at 5’SSs with +4 U in <italic>S. pombe mtl16Δ</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis fio1</italic> mutants. Relatively strong interactions with U5 snRNA can compensate for weakened U6 snRNA interactions caused by the loss of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishigami et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2022</xref>). A negative correlation between U5 and U6 snRNA interaction potentials reveals that there are two major classes of 5’SSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2022</xref>). Since in some species, pairs of alternative 5’SSs tend to be of opposite classes, this genomic feature may influence alternative splicing.</p><p>Given the similarity of the 5’SS +4 consensus preferred in <italic>Arabidopsis fio1</italic> mutants to that observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> we speculated that the loss of a METTL16 ortholog in some species could contribute to an evolutionary change in 5’SS sequence preference. To address this possibility, we took a phylogenetics approach by examining how 5’SS sequence preference changed in different species. We applied inter-species association mapping as an unbiased approach to identify factors correlated with 5’SS sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiefer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). This approach is conceptually related to a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which genomic variation is correlated with phenotype. However, rather than consider variation within a species, inter-species association mapping correlates a phenotype with genotypic variation between species, usually at the level of gene presence or absence, whilst correcting for the relatedness of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiefer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). We surveyed the genomes of more than 200 species from the Saccharomycotina clade of fungi and found multiple independent switches in sequence preference at the 5’SS +4 position. We found that the identity of the nucleotide at the 5’SS +4 position is most strongly correlated with the presence or absence of METTL16. In addition, we detected a conserved methionine in the spliceosomal protein SNRNP27K that also correlates with 5’SS +4 sequence preference. We conclude that variation in factors that act in concert to influence U6 snRNA interactions with 5’SSs are associated with evolutionary change in splicing signal phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>METTL16 is widely conserved in eukaryotes</title><p>Patterns of presence/absence variation of human spliceosomal protein orthologs in some fungal species have recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sales-Lee et al., 2021</xref>). However, because m<sup>6</sup>A-modified U6 snRNA is a component of spliceosomes but METTL16 is not, variation in METTL16 or UsnRNA modification was not assessed in this context. To understand the variation in METTL16 across eukaryotes, we used the software tool phmmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eddy and Pearson, 2011</xref>) to search Uniprot databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>) for proteins containing similarity to the METTL16 methyltransferase domain (MTD) in 33 diverse eukaryotic species from Metazoa, Fungi, Archaeplastida, Chromista, and Excavata.

Structural studies indicate that human METTL16 is comprised of two globular domains: the N-terminal MTD and a C-terminal domain called the ‘vertebrate conserved region’ (VCR). Both domains contribute to METTL16 U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A-modification specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoyama et al., 2020</xref>). Since primary sequence alignments fail to identify the METTL16 VCR in more distantly related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoyama et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ju et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>), we developed a revised approach to this search by incorporating protein structure predictions. Human METTL16 VCR has structural and functional equivalence to the KA-1 domain of the U6 3’ uridyltransferase TUT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoyama et al., 2020</xref>). The METTL16 VCR and TUT1 KA-1 domains bind the conserved internal stem-loop of U6 snRNA to enhance substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoyama et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamashita et al., 2017</xref>). Given the low sequence similarity between METTL16 VCR and TUT1 KA-1, we asked whether METTL16 orthologs contain topologically similar C-terminal domains that are poorly conserved at the sequence level. To address this question, we used Alphafold2 predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>) of the 29 orthologous METTL16 proteins identified in the 33 species from across Eukaryota. We used the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) and predicted alignment error (PAE) values provided for each model to segment the proteins into globular domains, excluding regions predicted to be flexible or disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oeffner et al., 2022</xref>). Using this method, all the METTL16 orthologs were found to have either one or two globular domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then superimposed all pairs of domains and calculated the template modelling score (TM-score), which is a measure of the similarity of two or more protein folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang and Skolnick, 2005</xref>). As positive controls, we included structures of the human METTL16 MTD and VCR domains, and TUT1 KA-1 domain, determined by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoyama et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ruszkowska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamashita et al., 2017</xref>). All predicted METTL16 ortholog domains were classified as either MTD-like, VCR/KA-1-like, or MTD +VCR/KA-1-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), with all MTD-like and VCR-like domains superimposing onto the experimentally determined human METTL16 MTD or VCR/KA-1 structures, respectively, with TM-scores that indicate structural analogy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The MTD +VCR/KA-1-like class is specific to the fungal species examined here and is explained by the close packing of MTD and KA-1 domains which prevents segmentation by PAE. This results in ‘superdomains’ that have structural analogy to both the MTD and KA-1 domains of human METTL16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The VCR/KA-1-like domain was absent from METTL16 orthologs in some species but could be identified in orthologs from across the eukaryotic tree of life, including <italic>C. elegans, S. pombe, Arabidopsis,</italic> and <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used the software tool US-align (Universal Structure alignment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) to perform multiple structure alignments of all 11 VCR/KA-1-like domains predicted by Alphafold2, resulting in an overall TM-score of 0.53, which indicates that all the domains are structurally analogous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang and Skolnick, 2005</xref>). For example, the predicted C-terminal domain of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FIO1 could be superimposed onto the crystal structure of the human METTL16 VCR domain with a TM-score of 0.82, and an RMSD of 0.86 Ångstroms at 59 structurally equivalent alpha carbon atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). All five beta strands and the two larger alpha helices of the METTL16 VCR domain are predicted by Alphafold2 to be conserved in FIO1.</p><p>The MTD +VCR/KA-1-like cluster of ‘superdomains’ from fungal species, for which the MTD and VCR/KA-1-like subdomains could not be segmented, superimposed well onto each other with an overall TM-score of 0.83 for 7 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This indicates that the predicted relative positions of the MTD and VCR/KA-1-like subdomains within these superdomains is consistent across orthologs. Arginine 258 of <italic>S. pombe</italic> MTL16, which is located between the MTD-like and VCR/KA-1-like subdomains, is predicted to form hydrogen bonds with backbone carbonyl oxygens and a serine sidechain that binds the two subdomains together, helping to form the superdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In agreement with this, Arg258 is strongly conserved in the 7 orthologs which have an MTD +VCR/KA-1-like superdomain but absent from <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> METTL16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which is segmentable into two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The position of the VCR/KA-1-like subdomain relative to the known ACAGA binding site of the MTD in these orthologs may help to improve our understanding of how the VCR/KA-1-like domain contributes to the specificity of METTL16 for U6 snRNA.</p><p>In summary, by incorporating protein structure predictions we could revise the understanding of the conserved domain structure of METTL16, detecting evidence for the VCR/KA-1 domain in species where it had previously been reported to be absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mendel et al., 2021</xref>). These results agree with recent structural studies of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> METTL16 ortholog METT10 which confirmed the presence of a KA-1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ju et al., 2023</xref>). Overall, our analysis suggests that the last eukaryotic common ancestor may not only have had a METTL16 ortholog but one that contained a KA-1-like domain too. Consequently, METTL16 with a domain that enhances substrate specificity for U6 snRNA is a feature of early eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Variation in the identity of the 5’SS +4 position evolved independently on multiple occasions</title><p>To understand evolutionary changes in splicing complexity, we focused on splicing signal phenotypes in the Saccharomycotina clade of ascomycetous yeasts. The Saccharomycotina clade was chosen for three reasons. First, simplification of spliceosome composition, intron content and cis-element splicing signals has already been established in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neuvéglise et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sales-Lee et al., 2021</xref>).

Finally, the availability of many sequenced Saccharomycotina genomes has the potential to provide statistical power for inter-species association mapping.</p><p>We devised a new bioinformatics pipeline to identify groups of orthologous splicing factor genes (orthogroups) and splicing sequence phenotypes from genomic sequences deposited in NCBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used the software tool Funannotate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Palmer and Stajich, 2020</xref>) to annotate the genomes of 227 publicly available Sacchromycotina genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dujon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Riley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, we incorporated an outgroup comprised of 13 well-annotated eukaryote genomes, including the human genome and 3 reference Saccharomycotina genomes (<italic>S. cerevisiae, Candida albicans,</italic> and <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dujon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Muzzey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nurk et al., 2022</xref>). The outgroup helps root the phylogenetic tree and annotate the orthogroups predictions. Protein sequences from these annotations were clustered into orthogroups using the software tool Orthofinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emms and Kelly, 2019</xref>), which also generates a species tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emms and Kelly, 2018</xref>). The initial de novo annotations of some species contained many incorrectly annotated introns. Consequently, we used multiple sequence alignments of proteins from each orthogroup to filter introns, keeping only those introns that were conserved in the same multiple alignment column and frame in at least two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rogozin et al., 2003</xref>). Overall, the pipeline yielded sequence information on introns and identified orthologous groupings of protein-coding genes.</p><p>We used the conserved annotated introns to estimate the 5’SS sequence preference of each species and mapped these onto the species tree whilst also estimating ancestral 5’SS sequence preferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paradis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schwartz et al., 2008</xref>). This analysis identified limited variation in the frequency of the preferred nucleotides at the –1,+3, and +5 positions of the 5’SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). In contrast, there have been multiple independent changes of sequence preference at the 5’SS +4 position in the Saccharomycetaceae, Debaryomycetaceae (CUG-Ser1) and Pichiaceae families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These preference changes almost exclusively comprise switches between +4 A and +4 U since there was much less variation in the ratio of W (A or U) to S (G or C) nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). For example, the Saccharomycetaceae (which includes <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) and their sister taxa Saccharomycodaceae all have a similarly strong 5’SS preference for +4 U, suggesting that an overall preference for +4 U is ancestral to this group. However, the estimated next closest family to the Saccharomycetaceae, the Phaffomycetaceae, have an overall preference for +4 A, indicating that the invariant 5’SS +4 U phenotype of Saccharomycetaceae may have evolved since the divergence of the two families. Although the confidence of the relative arrangement of Phaffomycetaceae, Saccharomycetaceae and CUG-Ser1 clades on the species tree is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the placement of Phaffomycetaceae matches previous approaches that used genome-scale data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the preference for 5’SS +4 A in families basal to the CUG-Ser1 clade, such as Cephaloascaceae (e.g. <italic>Cephaloascus fragrans</italic>), corroborates the finding that the switch to +4 U seen in many genera of the Debaryomycetaceae family of the CUG-Ser1 clade (e.g. in <italic>C. albicans</italic>) is independent of Saccharomycetaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates that the invariant 5’SS +4 U preferences seen in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> are the result of convergent evolution, which contrasts with a previous interpretation made when fewer genomes were available for comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schwartz et al., 2008</xref>).

However, relatively few species of Saccharomycotina have lost SNRNP27K but retained a METTL16 ortholog, hinting that the role of SNRNP27K might be necessary when U6 snRNA is m<sup>6</sup>A-modified.

Additional cryo-EM snapshots of intermediate spliceosome states are required to determine the conformational and compositional changes that occur between the pre-B and B complexes.

In contrast, 5’SSs with a +4 U preference appear to have evolved later and on multiple independent occasions in saccharomycetous yeasts, a group of species that have simplified developmental complexity and spend most or all of their life cycles in a unicellular form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagy et al., 2014</xref>). A series of changes are associated with species that have reduced multicellularity, including reductions in intron density and the evolution of more invariant 5’SS sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irimia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sales-Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schwartz et al., 2008</xref>). We demonstrate that a switch to 5’SS +4 U is a feature of these changes in Saccharomycotina.</p><p>A key question arising from evolutionary differences in 5’SS sequence preferences is why a switch between 5’SS +4 A/U is found. We previously reported that there are two major classes of 5’SS in many eukaryotes, defined by their anti-correlated interaction potential with U5 and U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kenny et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2022</xref>). This variation in 5’SS composition may provide regulatory potential in alternative splice site selection because pairs of alternative 5’SSs tend to be from the two opposing classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2022</xref>). Our analysis demonstrates that the anti-correlation of U5 and U6 snRNA interaction potentials is weaker, and even becomes positive, in species that have a reduced number of conserved introns. This may be due to the reduced importance of alternative splicing as a regulatory mechanism of gene expression in these species. Furthermore, we show that major switches in 5’SS +4 preference have occurred almost exclusively in Saccharomycotina species that lack a strong anti-correlation between U5 and U6 snRNA interaction potentials. We hypothesise that U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification might provide plasticity to 5’SS selection, either through the modulation of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A levels directly, or through protein chaperones such as SNRNP27K. This plasticity could be harnessed either within individuals by means of regulatory networks, or in populations due to natural variation in the relevant splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Price et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>). In species that have lost splicing complexity, U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification may have become detrimental, since plasticity intrinsically means weaker signals that are more prone to cryptic or mis-splicing. Similar reasoning has previously been suggested to explain the link between reduced intron density and more invariant 5’SS sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irimia et al., 2007</xref>). Switches in 5’SS +4 preference from A to U may therefore represent one of the final stages of splicing simplification.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>What is the order of events directing evolutionary change in splicing signal phenotypes?</title><p>Inter-species association mapping reveals genotypes that correlate with a phenotype but cannot necessarily prove causation. Consequently, it is not possible to reconstruct the order of evolutionary changes we detect. However, different scenarios that might explain these findings can be considered. For example, sudden loss of METTL16 might cause an urgent necessity to change 5’SS sequence preferences. This possibility seems unlikely as such rapid change without widespread corresponding 5’SS changes would likely impose a high fitness cost. Alternatively, change in 5’SS sequence from +4 A to +4 U preference could occur first, driven by some other selective pressure such as widespread intron loss, until there is no longer a benefit to retaining the METTL16 gene. This scenario is consistent with the fact that we could detect the METTL16 gene in <italic>Zygosaccharomyces</italic> and <italic>Eremothecium</italic> species that have altered their 5’SS +4 preference to a U. However, biophysical data of m<sup>6</sup>A:U interactions and global splicing analyses of METTL16 ortholog mutants indicate that the co-occurrence of METTL16 and +4 U are generally incompatible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishigami et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kierzek and Kierzek, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roost et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, it is possible that gradual changes in the expression or catalytic efficiency of METTL16 could reduce the stoichiometry of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A-modification, permitting a gradual change in 5’SS +4 sequence preference, until complete loss of the METTL16 gene no longer imposes a major fitness cost.

The 5’SS +4 preference phenotype studied here appears to be an example of a relatively simple trait that is predominantly associated with the presence or absence of a small number of genes, i.e., METTL16 and SNRNP27K.

Orthofinder also produces a species tree using the STAG method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emms and Kelly, 2018</xref>). We found that many species initially had spurious ortholog absences due to gene prediction failure. To address this for the 158 splicing factors being examined, we used the human orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sales-Lee et al., 2021</xref>) to identify relevant orthogroups and use the sequences from these to build profile hidden Markov models (pHMM) using MAFFT and hmmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eddy and Pearson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>). Score thresholds for each pHMM were determined by aligning the input sequences to the pHMM and selecting the 2.5% percentile (i.e. the score threshold that would recover 97.5% of the input sequences). These were then used to search six-frame translations generated from genome sequences to recover missing orthologs. Finally, the recovered sequences were re-clustered using Orthofinder to generate refined splicing factor orthogroups which were annotated using the human orthologs present within them.</p><p>We found that initial intron predictions generated by the Funannotate pipeline contained many false positive introns that negatively affected the estimation of splicing signal motifs. We reasoned that since most genuine introns are conserved across multiple species, and incorrectly annotated introns are unlikely to be in the same position in multiple species by chance, then identifying conserved introns would be a suitable method to reduce the false positive rate. To do this, we took the protein sequences for the initial orthogroups (generated from gene predictions rather than six-frame translations of splicing factors) and generated multiple sequence alignments using MAFFT. Very large orthogroups (with an average of more than 2 orthologs per species) were skipped as a time-saving heuristic. Once multiple sequence alignments were generated, we filtered for introns that were conserved in the same alignment column and frame in at least two species. This significantly improved the information content of splicing motifs at the 5’ and 3’SSs of introns, meaning that 5’SS +4 preference phenotypes could be estimated. Since the number of conserved introns per species varied by several orders of magnitude, we also used bootstrapped resampling of introns to estimate the 95% confidence intervals on the 5’SS +4 preference phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Phylogenetic generalised least squares analysis</title><p>After a genotype (in the form of orthogroups), phenotype (5’SS +4 preference) and phylogenetic relationships (species tree) had been collected, we were able to proceed with PGLS analysis. Phylogenetic dependence was estimated from the species tree by generating a variance-covariance matrix. Variances were set as the distance from the root to species leaf, and covariances were set as the distance from the root to the last common ancestor of the two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Villemereuil et al., 2012</xref>). For each orthogroup, the data were binarized to give the presence/absence of an ortholog for each species. Orthogroups were filtered using Dollo parsimony to retain those predicted to have undergone at least two independent loss events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farris, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rogozin et al., 2003</xref>). PGLS analysis was then conducted for each orthogroup using the GLS method from statsmodels, controlled with the covariance matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>). To account for uncertainty in the 5’SS +4 phenotype, bootstrapped 5’SS +4 A to U ratios estimated using resampling of conserved introns were used to perform 100 independent PGLS tests per orthogroup, which were then combined to give a unified model coefficient (with 95% confidence intervals) and <italic>p</italic> value using the GLS pooling method from the statsmodels implementation of MICE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>). p Values for each orthogroup were then corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p><p>For the individual amino acid PGLS analyses of the SNRNP27K C-terminus, genotypes used for testing were prepared as follows: the curated pHMM of the SNRNP27K C-terminus was downloaded from Pfam (PF08648).

The consensus sequence of the pHMM model was collected using hmmemit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eddy and Pearson, 2011</xref>). For each ortholog sequence, at each position in the model, a score was assigned by looking up the pairwise similarity scores of the aligned ortholog amino acid and the consensus amino acid in the BLOSUM62 matrix. Scores for each column were standardised by subtracting the mean score and dividing by the standard deviation.

This question underlies the evolution of complex organisms and the genome adaptation of simple organisms to their specific environments, so is an important question to answer. This manuscript now provides the underlying molecular mechanisms of how 5' splice site sequence preference may have evolved which is both an interesting and exciting advance for the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these kind comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments</p><p>This manuscript builds on the previous work from this group where they identified the role of adenosine N6 methylation (m6A) of the U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) of the spliceosome by METTL16 as being important for 5' splice site selection. This work led to the speculation that loss of a METTL16 ortholog, or potentially other splicing factors, in some species could contribute to an evolutionary change in 5' splice site sequence preference. Here the authors now use the power of phylogenetics, interspecies association mapping and the available spliceosome structures to provide convincing conclusions that 5' splice site sequence preferences in the extensive number of organisms examined correlate with the presence of the U6 snRNA methyltransferase METTL16 and the splicing factor SNRNP27K.</p><p>An analysis of METTL16 conservation was first carried out by comparing the METTL16 methyltransferase domain (MTD) in 29 diverse eukaryotic species. All the METTL16 orthologs were found to have either one or two globular domains. Three domain types were identified and compared in detail. What was not clear from this analysis was the functional significance of orthologs having either one or two domains.</p></disp-quote><p>We identified several species, including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, whose METTL16 orthologs do not contain a VCR domain. However, in this study we do not draw specific conclusions about the functional significance of orthologs having different domain topologies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, while this analysis provides important new information on the domain structure of METTL16 orthologs, especially where these domains had not been identified previously, the link between this section of the results and the following sections is not that apparent.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is a significant difference in approach between the first section of the Results and the following sections. However, we are keen to keep this part of the manuscript because it provides an orthogonal line of evidence suggesting that the ancestral role of METTL16 in eukaryotes is specifically the methylation of U6 snRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next novel bioinformatics pipelines were developed to compare both introns and orthologous groupings of protein coding genes between 227 Sacchromycotina genomes as well as 13 well-annotated eukaryote genomes. First, the 5' splice site sequence preference was compared and clearly indicates that the +4 position has the greatest variation in preferences within the Sacchromycotina. The ability to now compare a large number of genomes has provided novel information on the evolution of the 5' splice site sequence and the conclusion that there is more complexity to the 5' splice site in fungi that previously recognized. While it is apparent why only the 5' splice site signal was investigated here, with its relationship to the U6 snRNA and METTL16, it seems a shame the other splice site sequences were not analyzed using this novel pipeline. In any case, the complexity of the 5' splice site +4 position now allows, for the first time, interesting interspecies association studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the variance plots for 3’SS motifs (analogous to the 5’SS variance plots shown in Figure 2B) as Figure 2 supplementary figure 4A, and a traitgram for 3’SS -3C to U ratio as Figure 2 supplementary figure 4B. We have included a short section of text in the Results section to describe these additional findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With the 5' splice site +4 variation identified, the next step was to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms that dictate the evolution of the various sequence preferences. Some obvious players here are the U1 and U6 snRNAs which directly interact with the 5' splice site during splicing. However, no association was found between these snRNAs and the 5' splice site +4 sequence.</p><p>The powerful interspecies association mapping was then used to determine whether the presence or absence of METTL16 ortholog or a splicing factor correlated with the 5' splice site +4 sequence variation. Interestingly, a clear association was found between METTL16 and the 5' splice site +4 position; METTL16 presence was associated with +4A at the 5' splice site and METTL16 absence was associated with +4U at the 5' splice site. This is an exciting and significant finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments on the importance of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interestingly, the next most significant association with the 5' splice site +4 position was with SNRNP27K. This result makes sense as in the cryo-EM structure of the pre-B spliceosome complex the C-terminal domain of SNRNP27K is found near the region of the U6 snRNA that will interact with the 5' splices site. Absence of SNRNP27K was associated with an increased preference for +4U at the 5' splice site. Now the real power of the interspecies association mapping was demonstrated by investigating whether any association could be determined specifically within the C-terminus of SNRNP27K. Significantly, the methionine 141 position in SNRNP27K was found to be associated with the +4 position of the 5' splice site. This finding fits nicely with previous studies where mutation of M141 caused a shift in 5' splice site selection away from +4A 5' splice sites, to 5' splice sites without +4A. What is not clear is whether M141 is conserved or invariant between all the species that were compared?</p></disp-quote><p>M141 is not completely conserved across the species that were compared for the SNRNP27K C-terminus analysis. We did not test positions with very strong sequence conservation, because without variation in both the genotype and phenotype it is not possible to test for an association. We have rephrased the relevant Results and Methods sections to make this point clearer. In addition, we have incorporated a sequence logo to illustrate the degree of conservation of each position in the SNRNP27K C-terminal domain as Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A. Finally, we have included an additional box-plot to illustrate the finding that species which have lost SNRNP27K or have only lost the Methionine equivalent to human SNRNP27K position 141, show a similar preference for +4U at 5’ SSs. This is now included as Figure 5 —figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this result reveals the power of the interspecies association approach and provides interesting and exciting information on the molecular determinants of 5' splice site evolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for these comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The final analysis was to investigate the interaction potentials of the U5 and U6 snRNAs with the 5' splice site in the Sacchromycotina genomes and try to relate this to species with fewer introns and less alternative splicing. Species with low intron numbers and low splicing complexity were revealed to have weaker U5 and U6 anti-correlation potentials and favor +4U at the 5' splice site. On the other hand, species with high intron number and presumably higher splicing complexity featured anti-correlated U5 and U6 snRNA interaction potentials and favored +4A 5' splice sites. This extensive analysis provides novel information on the interactions and splice site properties of species with simple and complex splicing. Again, I see why there is emphasis on the 5' splice site here but a similar analysis with the U2 snRNA and the branch site could also be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree that inter-species association mapping could be applied to other splicing signal phenotypes including 3’ splice sites and intron branchpoints. Accordingly, we raise this subject in the final section of the Discussion. However, branchpoint sequences are challenging to predict with genomic data. Because preliminary analyses suggest independent variation in these other splicing signal phenotypes, we feel a separate focused study is required to properly explain (and substantiate) even the analytical approaches involved. We hope the reviewer would agree that incorporating U2 snRNA and branchpoint variation analyses into this manuscript as well, could detract from the clarity of the conceptual advances that we make here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>Should the Title include SNRNP27K?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included SNRNP27K into the revised title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Should the title specify that it is the evolution of only the 5’ splice site sequence preference being studied here?</p></disp-quote><p>Because apostrophes in titles can compromise some scholarly online search engines (https://insights.uksg.org/ar5cles/10.1629/uksg.534), we would prefer not to include 5’ in the title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Include information on intron number and 5’ splice site interaction potential of U5 and U6 snRNA in the Summary?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

What is the next point below SNRNP27K? Is it U2A’?</p></disp-quote><p>The other points on Figure 3B represent Orthofinder orthogroups which contain human orthologs that are known components of the spliceosome. The list of spliceosomal components was taken from Sales-Lee et al. 2021. The third most significant point is indeed the orthogroup containing the human ortholog of U2A’. As we state in the text, however, the correlation of U2A’ with the 5’SS+4 A to U ratio phenotype is no longer significant once METTL16 presence/absence is controlled for, indicating that the correlation of U2A’ with the +4A phenotype is likely explained by similarity in the patterns of gene loss of U2A’ and METTL16.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second paragraph of the Discussion is vague and lacks a reference. “we could also identify an association with a methionine residue in the conserved C-terminal domain of SNRNP27K orthologs.” There are a few methionines in the C-terminus, which one?

In our response to reviewer 3, and in a new Discussion section, we have detailed some of the scenarios that could explain these correlations. We also cannot rule out whether there are changes in the presence/absence (or domain/sequence-level changes) of other, untested proteins that correlate with the 5’SS +4 phenotype and we allude to this in the final section of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One splicing factor that immediately comes to mind is Prp8 where there is extensive evidence for involvement in splice site selection and is clearly in the right location throughout splicing to be involved. This question should at least be discussed but Prp8 would also be a very interesting candidate for the interspecies association mapping.</p></disp-quote><p>Prp8 is a core component of spliceosomes and is conserved throughout the Saccharomycotina. For this reason, we were unable to associate splicing phenotypes with Prp8 presence or absence variation at the level of orthogroups. However, we revisited this question posed by the reviewer. Our experience with inter-species association mapping, so far, indicates it works well with orthogroup presence/absence or when straightforward amino acid substitutions can be detected in conserved and hence alignable protein sequence domains. We analysed the conserved U6 snRNA-interacting region of the Prp8 linker domain, which maps close to the 5’ splice site in cryo-EM models, using the profile HMM PF10596 available from Pfam. We found that the majority of this domain was extremely highly conserved with variation in only a few species and positions. The strongest correlation with the +4A to U ratio phenotype was at position 58, which is conserved as a Glycine in all but 8 species (6 Dipodascaceae, 2 CUG-Ser1), that also tend to have a stronger preference for +4A. However, examination of the species contributing to this result (and to similar results at other positions) indicated that in the 6 Dipodascaceae species, this change is part of a larger deletion or replacement that makes the whole linker region align poorly to the model. Hence, the G58 position itself may not be specifically important for the +4 phenotype. Although the wholesale loss or replacement of the U6 snRNA-interacting region in these species is potentially interesting, these larger scale structural changes in a small number of species are difficult to interpret. Therefore, to maintain the focus of the manuscript and the clear links to METTL16 and SNRNP27K that have orthogonal support, we have decided not to add these results to the manuscript but present them here.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the U6-interacting region of the PRPF8 linker domain using pHMMPGLS analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stem plot showing the association of individual conserved positions in the U6 snRNA interacting domain of PRPF8 with the 5’SS+4 A to U ratio phenotype in 239 species retaining a detectable PRPF8 ortholog.

As the authors acknowledge, a key issue that cannot be fully resolved in this study is causality between the different events investigated. Overall, the authors are careful about this, but there are some exceptions that should be corrected. Probably the most important is in the abstract, where they write: “We conclude that variation in concerted processes of 5’ splice site selection by U6 snRNA is crucial to evolutionary change in splicing complexity”. I suggest they write something more open (and correct), such as: “We conclude that variation in concerted processes of 5’ splice site selection by U6 snRNA is associated with evolutionary changes in splicing complexity”. Similarly, other plausible scenarios should be discussed in the corresponding Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is not possible to infer the causal relationship between METTL16 absence and 5’SS+4 preference change from the current data. We, therefore, apologise for failing to be more careful in the Summary and Introduction. We have reworded these statements to better reflect what we can currently say about the evolutionary relationship between METTL16 and 5’SS sequence preference.</p><p>The correlation between METTL16 absence and 5'SS+4 sequence preference change could most likely be explained by one of several scenarios: (a) sudden loss of METTL16 causes a rapid necessity to change 5'SS sequence preferences. This is unlikely as such rapid change without widespread corresponding 5'SS changes would likely impose a high fitness cost. (b) Changes in 5'SS sequence preference occur first, driven by some other selective pressure, until there is no longer a benefit to retaining the METTL16 gene. (c) Gradual changes in the expression or catalytic efficiency of METTL16 reduce the stoichiometry of U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification, which permits gradual change in 5'SS+4 sequence preference until complete loss of the METTL16 no longer imposes a major fitness cost. As we suggest in the Discussion, future work could examine this question by determining whether the METTL16 orthologs found in <italic>Zygosaccharomyces</italic> and <italic>Eremothecium</italic> species, which have altered their 5'SS+4 preference to a U, are expressed and functional. We have updated the Discussion to include a new section that addresses these scenarios.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I do not agree with the statement that &quot;The extent of alternative splicing is the best genomic predictor of developmental complexity&quot;. To start with, there are many ways to quantify &quot;extent of alternative splicing&quot; and there are also different types of alternative splicing that might have different prevalence and biological impact. Then, this claim is usually related with exon skipping, which is tightly linked with intron length, and that is likely a better prediction of complexity (yet clearly not causative). My concern is: to what extent has this claim been formally and properly assessed by comparing splicing prevalence with other genomic features, such as intergenic region length, intron length, or average distance between enhancer-promoter interactions (arguably the most relevant predictor, in light of many other studies)? Moreover, I found it a bit misleading to frame the work presented in this study as directly related with developmental (or even splicing) complexity. The work is very interesting on its own, and I doubt their findings on +4 position preference in Saccharomycotina has anything to do with developmental complexity (as the Abstract and Introduction seem to imply).</p></disp-quote><p>On reflection, we agree with the reviewer. Some of our framing of the text isn’t balanced with other studies on the scaling of alternative splicing with developmental complexity. We have edited the Summary and Introduction sections accordingly and cited other references that broaden the consideration of this subject. We are grateful to the reviewer for this suggestion because the changes we make improve the focus of the manuscript since our findings relate more to splicing simplification than to an understanding of increased developmental complexity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I found Figure 2 and its associated supplementary figure very difficult to follow. I suggest the authors try to improve it and make it clearer. Also, other trees summarizing the results might be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the complexity of these figures. We opted to show phylogenetic trees with phenotypes plotted on the y axis, rather than simply trait histograms or box-plots, because the underlying structure of the tree is important for demonstrating that multiple independent changes in the 5’SS phenotype have occurred in the Saccharomycotina. We have tried to improve the comprehensibility of the figures in the following ways: (a) We have added 5’SS sequence motifs to the x-axis of figure 2B to make what the plot represents clearer, (b) as suggested by the reviewer, we have created a pruned tree showing the 5’SS motifs of a selection of Saccharomycotina species, which demonstrates that the changes in 5’SS+4 position preferences seen in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> are likely to be a result of convergent evolution. We have added this tree as Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I also found the Results section corresponding to Figure 5B a bit confusing. I would argue (as I think the authors do) that there are two main patterns here: below 500 introns, there is no association, while above 500 introns there is an increasingly negative association (correlation). I think it would help to more explicitly distinguishing these two patterns. Then, for the intron-poor species: is the correlation (or lack of) for species with a T or an A in position +4 different?</p></disp-quote><p>We do indeed think that there are two patterns here, as indicated by the reviewer. In the previous version of the manuscript, we separated species into those having an overall preference for A at the +4 position, and those having +4U. By showing regression lines for these two classes, rather than for the general relationship between intron number and U5/6rho, we somewhat imply that the switch in +4 base preference might be causing the loss of correlation between U5/6rho and intron number. However, since essentially all species with a 5'SS +4U preference are intron poor, it seems more likely that these trends are the result of a loss of the negative correlation between intron number and U5/6rho in intron poor species, as suggested by the reviewer. To address this issue, we have replaced the regression lines on Figure 6B with a single loess (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) regression line for all species and updated the text to make it clearer that we think loss of U5/6rho and +4A preference are separate traits of intron poor species. Although this is not exactly what the reviewer requested, we hope that it satisfies their issue with the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>This is a very interesting study that sheds light on an intriguing evolutionary pattern: the change in consensus sequence at position +4 of the 5' splice site.
