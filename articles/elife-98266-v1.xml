peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes. Herein, we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. As a proof-of-concept, five <underline>p</underline>eptidoglycan <underline>h</underline>ydrolases from the <italic><underline>A</underline>cinetobacter <underline>b</underline>aumannii</italic> proteome (PHAb7-PHAb11) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. Among them, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, while the other three were thermosensitive. We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. In conclusion, our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria are increasingly becoming resistant to antibiotics, leading to a rise in cases of dangerous diseases around the world. Innovative treatments are urgently needed, prompting researchers to turn to alternative approaches.</p><p>One strategy is to focus on finding new ways to target the bacterial cell wall, a shield-like structure that wraps around the cell and protects it against the environment. Certain hydrolase enzymes can weaken this wall by breaking down its primary component, a type of molecules known as peptidoglycans. Lysins, for example, are produced by phage viruses (which prey on bacteria) and have gathered momentum as antimicrobial agents.</p><p>However, clinical studies so far have largely focused on using peptidoglycan hydrolases against Gram-positive bacteria, in which peptidoglycans are directly exposed to the environment. In Gram-negative species, on the other hand, the cell wall includes an outer membrane that makes it harder for the enzymes to access their targets. Finding better phage-derived lysins that work against Gram-negative bacteria has been challenging so far, partly because this would require scanning the genomes of various phage species for candidates – an information that is difficult to access.</p><p>Instead, Zhang et al. turned to peptidoglycan hydrolases produced by bacteria themselves, for example to eliminate competitors. To find these enzymes, the team used a specific structure in a phage-derived lysin as a template; known as P307, this short sequence (or peptide) allows the viral enzyme to cross the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and reach the peptidoglycans below.</p><p>Using a range of computational method, P307 was screened against the pool of proteins produced by the bacterium <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>. This revealed five bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases, two of which had the potent ability to kill harmful species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria both in vitro and in mice. They retained this ability even after having been exposed to high temperatures, with further experiments pointing to unique structural properties underlying this stability. Taken together, these findings highlight an effective method to identify new bacterial-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases that could serve as antimicrobial agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phage lysin</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan hydrolase</kwd><kwd>bacterial proteome</kwd><kwd>hyper-thermostability</kwd><kwd><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>A. baumannii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070187</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32161133003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81802001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Fen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Open Research Fund Program of National Bio-Safety Laboratory, Wuhan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021SPCAS001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Hang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100018583</institution-id><institution>Wuhan Science and Technology Major Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023020302020708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new peptidoglycan hydrolase mined from <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> proteome by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening strategy undergoes a unique switch between dimer and monomer after heat treatment and protects mice from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite decades of concerted action from all over the world, antimicrobial resistance remains a growing global threat today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nathan, 2020</xref>). The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials leads to their accumulation in the environment, eventually increasing the chances of bacterial pathogens to acquire resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Boeckel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rawson et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the concept of ‘One Health’ has been proposed to address the alarming levels of antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McEwen and Collignon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hernando-Amado et al., 2019</xref>). In recent decades, the number of bacteria resistant to first-line drugs, as well as second- and third-line drugs, has been increasing. Some of these bacteria have even been identified as multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, or pan-drug-resistant isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Talaat et al., 2022</xref>). For example, methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, vancomycin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>, vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, carbapenem-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and multidrug-resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> pose a serious threat and are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in human infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brink, 2019</xref>). In addition, the global medical need for new antimicrobials has not yet been fully addressed.</p><p>Considerable evidence shows that bacterial peptidoglycan is a promising target for the development of antimicrobial agents with a low risk of resistance development. A well-documented example in this regard are the peptidoglycan hydrolases, also known as lysins, derived from phages. In recent years, lysins have been shown to be efficient alternatives to traditional antibiotics for infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria in various animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Maesschalck et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmelcher and Loessner, 2021</xref>). Encouragingly, several lysins targeting <italic>S. aureus</italic> have been evaluated in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Theuretzbacher and Piddock, 2019</xref>). However, the development of lysins targeting Gram-negative bacteria is relatively recent, mainly because the bacterial outer membrane prevents lysins from accessing their peptidoglycan substrates. In the last decade, several strategies have been developed to enable lysin to overcome the outer membrane barrier and directly target Gram-negative bacteria. For instance, Artilysins are constructed by fusion of cationic nonapeptides to effectively eradicate resistant and persistent <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Defraine et al., 2016</xref>); Innolysins are engineered by fusion of receptor-binding proteins to display bactericidal activity against <italic>E. coli</italic> that was resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zampara et al., 2020</xref>); bioengineered lysin-bacteriocin fusion molecule, i.e., Lysocins, are able to deliver lysin across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and show selective anti-Pseudomonal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heselpoth et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the establishment of high-throughput mining or engineering strategies has accelerated the discovery of active lysins against Gram-negative pathogens, e.g., the VersaTile-driven platform, which can rapidly screen engineered lysins active against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> from tens of thousands of combinations by integrating new DNA assembly methods and iterative screening procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gerstmans et al., 2020</xref>). However, compared with the current progress in the clinical translation of lysins against Gram-positive bacteria, the discovery of lysins against Gram-negative bacteria that meet the needs described in the WHO priority pathogen list is still urgently needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briers and Lavigne, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, the discovery of phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases has also been hampered by limited sources of published phage genome data. Although not yet tested extensively, recent progress in lysins targeting Gram-negative bacteria have demonstrated a clue linking antibacterial activity to their internal antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vázquez et al., 2021</xref>), by which lysins cross the bacterial outer membrane and contact its underlying peptidoglycan substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lood et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thandar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2021</xref>). These observations prompted us to consider whether antibacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases or their homologs could be mined from bacterial proteomes using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide as template. As a proof-of-concept, we here used the antimicrobial peptide P307 derived from PlyF307 lysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lood et al., 2015</xref>) as a template to search for <underline>p</underline>eptidoglycan <underline>h</underline>ydrolases from the <italic><underline>A</underline>. <underline>b</underline>aumannii</italic> proteome database (PHAbs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two of them (PHAb10 and PHAb11) were found to be hyperthermally stable even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, which is mediated by a unique monomer-dimer swapping. Furthermore, both were active against a wide variety of clinically relevant bacteria in vitro and in mouse infection models. This observation supports our hypothesis that antimicrobial peptide-primed mining strategy is feasible for discovering new peptidoglycan hydrolases with high bactericidal activity and desirable physicochemical properties from bacterial proteomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening of putative peptidoglycan hydrolases from the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> proteome based on a lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed mining strategy</title><p>Since a variety of lysins active against Gram-negative bacteria are shown to harbor an N- or C-terminal antimicrobial peptide, this led us to speculate that antimicrobial peptide could be used as template to mine new peptidoglycan hydrolases.

Our results showed that all tested strains, whether antibiotic-resistant or not, were sensitive to PHAb10 and PHAb11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref>).

Similar to other previously reported lysins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larpin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), PHAb10 and PHAb11 were sensitive to NaCl and urea in a dose-dependent inhibitory manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

Indeed, after 1 hr treatment at 100°C, the bactericidal activity was improved slightly for both enzymes. In contrast, PHAb7, PHAb8, and PHAb9 completely lost their activity after treatment at 70°C for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>).

However, for most of these lysins, their activity are almost exclusively restricted to Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Khan et al., 2021</xref>), raising questions about the mechanisms of action of PHAb10 and PHAb11 in killing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Structural prediction analysis showed that PHAb10 contains a putative lysozyme catalytic domain (amino acids 1–110, P10-Lys) and a C-terminal cationic peptide (amino acids 111–149, P10-CP), whereas PHAb11 contains an N-terminal cationic peptide with unknown function (amino acids 1–36, P11-NP), followed by a putative lysozyme catalytic domain (amino acids 37–145, P11-Lys, with 68.5% sequence similarity with P10-Lys) and a C-terminal cationic peptide (amino acids 146–184, P11-CP, which shows 94.9% sequence similarity with P10-CP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Studies have shown that the cationic region of phage lysins can facilitate their penetration into the outer membrane, thereby fulfilling their bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lood et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larpin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2021</xref>). To examine whether it is the reason for the killing ability of PHAb10 and PHAb11 against Gram-negative bacteria, we further analyzed in silico the physicochemical properties of these putative cationic peptides harbored by these two enzymes and found that all three peptides, i.e., P10-CP, P11-CP, and P11-NP might act as antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Therefore, we synthesized these peptides and examined their antibacterial activity by log-killing assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, we observed bactericidal activity in P10-CP and P11-CP against <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in both the exponential and stationary phases. However, rare lytic activity was observed in P11-NP, suggesting that its function remains to be established. Notably, P11-CP was more robust than P10-CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), which might be due to the presence of an additional positively charged amino acid (i.e. lysine) in P11-CP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). More importantly, the putative lysozyme catalytic domains of two enzymes, P10-Lys, P11-Lys, and P11-N showed rare bactericidal activity against all Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>), which indicated that the antimicrobial peptides, namely P10-CP and P11-CP, were essential for the bactericidal activity of both enzymes. Curiously, for unknown reasons, P11-C showed higher bactericidal activity than the holoenzyme PHAb11 against all bacteria tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Considering the different targets of antimicrobial peptides and peptidoglycan hydrolases, we further questioned the killing mechanism of PHAb10 and PHAb11 against susceptible bacteria. To this end, we evaluated the effects of different truncations of PHAb10 and PHAb11 on different bacteria by halo assay to test their peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. Results showed that lysozyme-containing truncations from both enzymes showed hydrolytic activity only toward peptidoglycan from Gram-negative bacteria but not from Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), suggesting that the killing of Gram-positive bacteria by PHAb10 and PHAb11 is probably mediated mainly by their internal antimicrobial peptides, i.e., P10-CP and P11-CP. Supporting to this assumption, rare peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity was observed in P10-CP and P11-CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Altogether, these results suggested that the killing of Gram-negative bacteria by PHAb10 and PHAb11 might be a combination of lysozyme-mediated peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity and antimicrobial peptide-mediated outer membrane-disruption activity. However, their bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria was primed solely by their internal antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of action of PHAb10 and PHAb11 on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of PHAb10 and PHAb11 domains.

Specifically, the two asymmetric units of PHAb10 formed an antiparallel dimer with a rotation angle of 177.2° along the rotation axis and a distance of 10.5 Å between them. Further, PHAb10 dimer adopted a circularly permuted architecture, in which the N-terminus of one chain and the C-terminus of another chain formed a cavity, which might be the binding site of the peptidoglycan substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The two subunits of PHAb11 formed a tail-to-tail dimer with a rotation angle of –179.4° along the rotation axis and a distance of 37.1 Å between them. Each PHAb11 monomer contained an independent substrate-binding cavity around its catalytic triad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Notably, the N-terminal 36 amino acids, P11-NP, were missing in our PHAb11 dimer. We speculated that it may be destroyed during crystal formation.

Results showed that for all strains tested, the holoenzyme and its antimicrobial peptide domain P10-CP retained high bactericidal activity, but its lysozyme catalytic domain P10-Lys did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Except for the N-terminal peptide P11-NP, other truncated PHAb11 still maintained substantial bactericidal activity after heating at 100°C for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). These observations raised the question of whether PHAb10 and PHAb11 dimers are hyper-thermostable. To test this, we determined the temperature-dependent denaturation of these enzymes by nano-differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF). Our results showed that PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 were denatured with transition temperatures of 41.4°C, 53.7°C, and 59.9°C, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Interestingly, signs of aggregation were only observed in PHAb8 but not in PHAb10 and PHAb11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1j</xref>), indicating that PHAb10 and PHAb11 underwent structural refolding without precipitation during heat treatment. Consistent with these observations, the corresponding circular dichroism (CD) curves of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 at 90°C were significantly different from their corresponding curves at temperature close to their transition temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h–j</xref>), suggesting that, similar to PHAb8, PHAb10 and PHAb11 lost their native conformation at high temperature such as 90°C. To further understand the thermodynamics of PHAb10 and PHAb11, we examined the structure of PHAb10 before and after heat treatment at 100°C for 1 hr by CD. Intriguingly, only minor differences were observed before and after heat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>), indicating that PHAb10 almost refolded to its native conformation during cooling after heat treatment. The C-terminal antimicrobial peptide P10-CP of PHAb10 could withstand heat treatment, but P10-Lys was deformed after being treated at 100°C for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>). Similar to the folding-refolding phenomenon of PHAb10, PHAb11 and its N-terminal peptide-deleted variant P11-C could restore to their native conformation after 1 hr treatment at 100°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m and n</xref>), while its C-terminal peptide-deleted variant P11-N could not refold to its native conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4o</xref>), indicating that C-terminal peptide was essential for its hyper-thermostability. Altogether, these observations suggested that dimerized PHAb10 and PHAb11 possessed unique folding-refolding thermodynamic mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Folding-refolding thermodynamic of PHAb10 dimer is governed by intermolecular interactions</title><p>Since PHAb10 dimer and PHAb11 dimer exhibit a similar folding-refolding thermodynamic profiles, we wondered whether it was achieved through dimer-monomer switching. Therefore, we used PHAb10 as an example to test this hypothesis. We carefully examined the topology of the PHAb10 dimer and found that it was supported by seven pairs of intermolecular H-bonds, with three pairs supporting the head, each two pairs in midbody and tail of the PHAb10 dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Specifically, in the top view of chain A, Arg20 and Gly27 were involved in intermolecular H-bond interactions, supporting the head region, Gly128 and Gly129-mediated interaction contributed to the stability of midbody, while Lys133 and Arg137 were involved in intermolecular H-bond forces anchoring the tails of the PHAb10 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Next, we constructed several PHAb10 variants involving depletion of intermolecular force at the head, midbody, tail, or entire entity of the PHAb10 dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). Since PHAb10 was a verified dimer after chemical cross-linking in SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), we further examined the polymerization of these PHAb10 variants by Native-PAGE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, wildtype PHAb10 showed two bands corresponding to its monomeric and dimeric forms. While the variants R20IG27D, which has mutations in the head-supporting site, and G27DR137I, which has mutations in both the head and tail supporting sites, lost dimerization ability. As a result, both variants lost most of their bactericidal activity after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), which could be further explained by the failure to recover their native forms after heat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>). In support of these observations, the variant PHAb10-mut containing mutations in all seven pairs of dimer-supporting sites showed aborted bactericidal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) and failed to recover its native conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>) after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr. In contrast, the variants G128D/G129D with mutations in the midbody-supporting sites still showed a mixture of monomers and dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), indicating that depletion of the midbody-supporting force hardly affected the dimerization of PHAb10. Consistent with this observation, the variant G128D/G129D still remained intact bactericidal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) and could refold to its native form after heat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>). Moreover, the variant K133A/R137I with mutations in the tail-supporting site also showed aborted bactericidal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) and an irreversible conformation change after heat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>), although it maintained a weak dimerization ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). This suggested that intermolecular forces at the tail of the PHAb10 dimer had only a small impact on its thermodynamics properties. Taken all these observations together, we proposed a model by which the PHAb10 dimer executed its folding-refolding thermodynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). At temperatures above its transition point (i.e. &gt;53.7°C), dimerized PHAb10 dissociated into monomers without precipitation. During the cooling process, monomeric PHAb10 refolded to a stable dimer via the intermolecular interactions between the two monomers, i.e., three pairs of intermolecular bonds at the head, two in the midbody, and two at the tail of the PHAb10 dimer. The folding and refolding dynamics of PHAb10 after heat treatment were somewhat similar to the opening and closing of zippers, where the intermolecular bonds act as inducers.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Folding-refolding thermodynamics of PHAb10.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Intermolecular interactions of PHAb10 dimer.

Bacteriophage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases (i.e. lysins) have been investigated as promising alternatives to combat resistant bacteria due to their unique mechanism of action, potent bactericidal activity, low risk of drug resistance development. However, for Gram-negative bacteria, the effects of phage-derived lysins were often hampered by their outer membranes, which requires more strategies to overcome this additional barrier. Although some engineered lysins (especially Artilysins, Innolysins, and Lysocins) have shown promising performance, clinically promising lysins capable of destroying Gram-negative bacteria remain inadequately addressed. Considering the fact that lysins from Gram-negative bacteria usually contain antimicrobial peptide-like regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vázquez et al., 2021</xref>), in the present work, we report a new strategy to mine active bactericidal peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes through lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-priming screening. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully discovered the two peptidoglycan hydrolases PHAb10 and PHAb11 from the proteome of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> using the PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template, highlighting the utility of this strategy in mining antimicrobial agents from bacterial database.</p><p>Notably, PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited high bactericidal activity against a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbes. Unlike other Gram-negative lysins that act in an outer membrane permeabilizer-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walmagh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Plotka et al., 2019</xref>), PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited intrinsic activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens via different mechanisms of action. Due to their C-terminal antimicrobial peptides P10-CP and P11-CP, PHAb10 and PHAb11 can penetrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria in a self-primed manner, allowing them to enter and cleave peptidoglycan bonds, ultimately leading to osmotic lysis of Gram-negative pathogens, while Gram-positive bacteria are killed mainly through the action of the intrinsic antimicrobial peptides.</p><p>Structure-based homology analysis revealed that PHAb10 and PHAb11 probably belonged to the T4 lysozyme family and possessed the conserved Glu-Asp-Thr catalytic triad shared by traditional phage lysins and bacterial autolysins, namely Glu17, Asp26, and Thr32 of PHAb10, and Glu52, Asp61, and Thr67 of PHAb11. It is known that T4 lysozyme (T4L) from T4 phage completely loses its enzymatical activity after treatment at 75°C for 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsugita and Inouye, 1968</xref>), but somehow, heat-denatured T4L retains its bactericidal activity because of the amphipathic α-helix region at the C-terminus of the enzyme which contains membrane disturbing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Düring et al., 1999</xref>). Unlike T4L, whose monomer crystals have been exhaustively studied, PHAb10 or PHAb11 is a homodimer that retain almost 100% of their bactericidal activity after heat treatment through a unique dimer-monomer transition. Interestingly, several T4L mutants have been reported to be homodimers crystallographically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banatao et al., 2006</xref>), although naturally occurring dimeric T4L-like enzymes are still rarely reported. Notably, heat treatment converts HEWL to a partially unfolded, enzymatically inactive and more hydrophobic dimeric form, which exhibits an enhanced bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ibrahim et al., 1996</xref>). The excellent thermostability capacity of PHAb10 and PHAb11 distinguishes them from most other enzymes reported to date. For example, gp36C lysin from bacteriophage ϕKMV, a known highly thermostable lysozyme, retains only ∼50% residual activity after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavigne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briers et al., 2006</xref>). Heat-resistant lysin has potential applications in animal feed premixes (pelletizing temperature 75–98°C) and medical devices requiring autoclaving.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, few proteins have been demonstrated to have reversible folding-refolding thermodynamics at high temperature, but their mechanisms are unclear, such as HPL118, HPL511, and HPLP35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmelcher et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we found that PHAb10 had unique temperature-dependent folding-refolding thermodynamic, and structural and biochemical analyses further suggested that PHAb10 undergoes a unique dimer-monomer transition mediated by seven pairs of intermolecular interactions to survive thermal treatment.</p><p>Bacteriophages are known to be the most abundant biological entities on earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knowles et al., 2016</xref>). Over billions of years of coevolution, more than 80% of bacterial genomes have become populated with at least one prophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keen and Dantas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller-Ensminger et al., 2018</xref>), also known as molecular imprints, and which can serve as an untapped arsenal for the discovery of phage-related antimicrobial agents. Notably, prophage identification lags greatly behind genome or metagenome sequencing. Therefore, there is reason to believe that advances in bacterial culturomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lagier et al., 2018</xref>), ‘rebooting’ phage genomes in more tractable hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kilcher et al., 2018</xref>), and computational biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arndt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Song et al., 2019</xref>), may help discover otherwise inaccessible prophages from bacterial genome big data. In turn, this will increase the added value of bacterial genomes as a new source of unearthed therapeutically promising antimicrobial drugs.

Authors also observe that heat denatured PHAb10 and PHAb11 have bactericidal activity but no enzymatic activity.

Furthermore, there are some key concepts that are missing and are important for the reader to have an overview of the current state-of-the-art regarding endolysins that target gram-negatives. Specifically, the concepts of 'Artilysins', 'Innolysins', and 'Lysocins' are not introduced. Besides this, the authors do not mention other high-throughput mining or engineering strategies for endolysins, such as e.g. the VersaTile platform, which was initially developed by Hans Gerstmans et al. for one of the targeted pathogens in this manuscript (i.e., Acinetobacter baumannii). Recent works by Niels Vander Elst et al. have demonstrated that this VersaTile platform can be used to high-throughput screen and hit-to-lead select endolysins in the magnitude tens of thousands. Lastly, Roberto Vázquez et al. have recently demonstrated with bio-informatic analyses that approximately 30% of Gram-negative endolysin entries have AMP-like regions (hydrophobic short sequences), and that these entries are interesting candidates for further wet lab testing due to their outer membrane penetrating capacities. Therefore, I fully disagree with the statement being made in the introduction that endolysin strategies to target Gram-negatives are 'in its infancy' and I urge the authors to provide a new introduction that properly gives an overview of the Gram-negative endolysin field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestions. A new paragraph has been added to the revised manuscript to reflect the concepts and strategies for lysin engineering and discovery against Gram-negative bacteria (pages 3-4, lines 82-101).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>It should be mentioned that the halo assay is a qualitative assay for activity testing. I personally do not like that the size of the halos is used to discriminate in endolysin activity. In this reviewer's opinion, the size of the halo is highly dependent on (i) the molecular size of the endolysin as smaller proteins can diffuse further in the agar, and (ii) the affinity of the CBD subdomain of the endolysin for the bacterial peptidoglycan. It should also be said that in the halo assay, there is a long contact time between the endolysin and the bacteria that are statically embedded in the agar, which can result in false positive results. How did the authors mitigate this?</p></disp-quote><p>We quite agree with the reviewer that the halo assay is only a qualitative method for activity testing and may be perturbed by multiple parameters (DOI: 10.3390/antibiotics9090621). In our study, the halo assay was used only as a preliminary method to rapidly distinguish the activities of multiple candidates, and then the candidates with high antibacterial activities were further characterized through a series of in vitro and in vivo assays in this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Testing should have been done at equimolar concentrations. If the authors decided to e.g. test 50 µg/mL for each protein, how was this then compensated for differences in molecular weight? For example, if PHAb10 and PHAb11 have smaller molecular sizes than PHAb7, 8, and 9, there is more protein present in 50 µg/mL for the first two compared to the others, and this would explain the higher decrease in bacterial killing (and possibly the larger halos).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his valuable suggestions and concerns. We agree with the reviewer that when we need to know exactly how much times more active an enzyme is than the another, we should directly compare the performance of the two enzymes at equimolar concentrations. In our previous work, we followed this rule to distinguish novel chimeric lysins from their parental lysins or their variants (DOI: 10.1128/AAC.00311-20; DOI: 10.1128/AAC.01610-19; DOI: 10.1128/AAC.02043-18). In the present work, our initial goal of testing was to reflect the robustness and efficiency of screening strategy initiated by lysinderived antimicrobial peptides. With this in mind, we therefore did not spend more effort to compare the activities of these candidates in detail but continued to clarify their host range and thermo-tolerance mechanisms, and then continued to examine their performance in infection models. Nonetheless, in future work, we will definitely follow your suggestions when it is necessary to quantify the differences between these candidates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review)</bold>:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study explores a new strategy of lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening to find peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes.

Authors also observe that heat-denatured PHAb10 and PHAb11 have bactericidal activity but no enzymatic activity. These findings should be corroborated by studying the effect of these holoenzymes/ truncated peptides on bacterial cell membranes. Also, a quantitative peptidoglycan cleavage assay should be performed in addition to the halo assay. Including these details would make the work more comprehensive.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his valuable suggestions and concerns. We agree with the reviewer that employing more methods and techniques such as SEM, TEM, live/dead imaging, and GC-MS will provide a deeper understanding of how these peptidoglycan hydrolases interact with the bacterial envelopes and peptidoglycan bones, which will definitely make our study more comprehensive. The principal idea of this study is, however, to test the robustness and effectiveness of the screening strategy triggered by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide in discovering new peptidoglycan hydrolases. Therefore, we did not put more efforts in charactering the interactions of these peptidoglycan hydrolases with the bacterial envelopes/membranes in multiple assays; instead, we continued to elucidate their host range and thermo-tolerance mechanisms and then continued to examine their performance in infection models.</p><p>We are also very grateful to the reviewers for their suggestions to correlate our results to published findings on lysozymes. Based on these suggestions, we have included an extensive discussion in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (page 22, lines 502-514).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Abstract and title.</p><p>In my opinion, the current title does not fully cover the work that is presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>According to your valuable comment, we have revised the title to “Dimer-monomer transition defines a hyper-thermostable peptidoglycan hydrolase mined from bacterial proteome by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please remove the word 'novel' from the title, as well as elsewhere in the manuscript.
