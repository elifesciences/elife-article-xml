Enhancers are transcriptional regulatory elements that are key to our understanding of how this rewiring of gene expression is achieved in cancer cells. Here, we have harnessed the power of RNA-seq data from hundreds of patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) or its precursor state Barrett’s oesophagus coupled with open chromatin maps to identify potential enhancer RNAs and their associated enhancer regions in this cancer. We identify ~1000 OAC-specific enhancers and use these data to uncover new cellular pathways that are operational in OAC. Among these are enhancers for <italic>JUP</italic>, <italic>MYBL2</italic>, and <italic>CCNE1</italic>, and we show that their activity is required for cancer cell viability. We also demonstrate the clinical utility of our dataset for identifying disease stage and patient prognosis. Our data therefore identify an important set of regulatory elements that enhance our molecular understanding of OAC and point to potential new therapeutic directions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oesophageal adenocarcinoma</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>eRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/V010263/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Shen-Hsi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102171/B/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>Ibrahim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Active enhancers are characterised by the presence of histone marks such as H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>). However, it has been shown that enhancers can be the site of production for small transcripts termed enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Santa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Whilst the functionality of eRNAs is still under debate, there is a large body of evidence associating the production of eRNAs with enhancer activity, and subsequent target gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). This association with gene expression has allowed eRNA-defined enhancer activity to serve as a specific marker for developmental stage and tissue type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, eRNAs provide molecular markers for disease, often with more sensitivity than the gene expression pattern itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>During tumourigenesis, there are widespread changes to gene expression patterns that are associated with rewiring of the regulatory landscape in an enhancer-driven manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>). This can be accompanied by eRNA production. For example, production of an eRNA from the <italic>PSA</italic> gene enhancer is associated with increased <italic>PSA</italic> expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). This potentially makes the production of eRNAs a biomarker for cancer, but this is widely underappreciated. Indeed, a recent pan cancer study demonstrated that eRNAs can serve as prognostic markers across various cancer types and provide novel insights into cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), leading to the identification of therapeutic opportunities.</p><p>Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) has an overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 15%, making it a leading global cause of cancer-associated deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>). OAC is believed to arise in a stepwise fashion from the pre-cancerous lesion Barrett’s oesophagus (BO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peters et al., 2019</xref>). A number of large-scale DNA sequencing studies have been performed into the pathogenesis of OAC from Barrett’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frankell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ross-Innes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stachler et al., 2015</xref>), however there is still uncertainty concerning the precise molecular mechanisms. In an effort to understand potential epigenetic contributors to OAC, we have previously demonstrated that changes in chromatin accessibility play a role in the transition to OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogerson et al., 2020</xref>). These chromatin changes are often associated with non-coding regions of the genome that may represent regulatory elements such as enhancers.</p><p>Here, we build on our previous work identifying chromatin changes during the BO to OAC transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogerson et al., 2020</xref>). By integrating total RNA-seq data from BO and OAC patients generated by the Oesophageal Cancer Clinical and Molecular Stratification (OCCAMS) consortium dataset, with previously generated chromatin accessibility data on these tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogerson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corces et al., 2018</xref>), we identify, and validate, pervasive eRNA production at regions of accessible chromatin, indicative of enhancer activity. Subsequent interrogation of genes associated with these enhancers identified deregulated pathways of importance and demonstrated the potential clinical utility of eRNA profiling in OAC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of potential intergenic eRNA transcripts in OAC patients</title><p>eRNAs are generally unstable and lowly abundant, making them hard to detect in RNA-seq datasets. We therefore harnessed the sequencing power derived from combining hundreds of patient samples to discover potential eRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify eRNAs that are relevant to OAC we interrogated RNA-seq data generated from 210 OAC patients and also from 108 Barrett’s patients to identify differentially upregulated eRNAs in OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jammula et al., 2020</xref>). After mapping sequencing reads to the genome, we excluded all regions corresponding to gene bodies as well as sequences 2 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site (TSS) and 500 bp downstream from the annotated transcriptional termination site (TTS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to avoid interference from promoter sequences and read through transcription, respectively. Next, we identified all of the accessible regions of chromatin in OAC and Barrett’s samples within this truncated genome by creating a union peak set from ATAC-seq performed on 14 OAC and 4 Barrett’s samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogerson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corces et al., 2018</xref>) (resulting in 150,265 peaks). To focus on potential enhancer regions, we then took the RNA-seq data from both classes of patients and assessed raw reads within these accessible chromatin regions. This identified 61,349 intergenic regions that contain RNA transcripts and represent potential eRNA regions. We then filtered these based on a read count ≥3 and fragments per million (FPM) value ≥1.5, which resulted in a final high-confidence set of 4600 potential eRNA containing enhancer regions in OAC and Barrett’s patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of enhancer transcription in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) and Barrett’s patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Enhancer RNA (eRNA) identification strategy.

The remaining putative eRNAs exhibited low directionality score distributions consistent with the bidirectional transcription associated with eRNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To probe the clinical utility of eRNA region profiling, we analysed the expression levels found in the 4600 eRNA regions across all of the OAC and Barrett’s samples. Hierarchical clustering showed a clear separation of Barrett’s and OAC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While clustering based on whole RNA-seq data gave broadly similar separation of OAC and Barrett’s samples, several more were misclassified compared to eRNA-based profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; 37 vs. 8 samples). Clustering of the expression of the same eRNA regions in a different RNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maag et al., 2017</xref>) also provided a good separation of the OAC and Barrett’s samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), further demonstrating the relevance of this dataset. In summary therefore, we have identified a panel of potential eRNA generating regions that can be used for discriminating OAC samples from the pre-cancerous Barrett’s state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>eRNA-associated regions show enhancer-like characteristics</title><p>Having identified a group of accessible chromatin regions expressing potential eRNAs, we next sought further evidence to associate these with enhancer-like activity. First, we examined chromatin accessibility in OAC patients and found higher levels at eRNA expressing loci compared to a random set of open chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; left). Furthermore, these regions also exhibited higher levels of the H3K27ac chromatin mark in OE19 OAC-derived cells that is usually associated with active enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; right). This was not just a function of increased accessibility as a control group of more highly accessible regions did not exhibit increased levels of H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, chromatin accessibility levels are a weak indicator of eRNA transcription levels across patient samples, as even regions of greater accessibility contained much lower transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, eRNA regions are more accessible but the reciprocal is not true, as more accessible regions do not necessarily show higher levels of eRNA transcription.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Putative enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are associated with enhancer-like genomic regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Metaplots of patient tissue chromatin accessibility (left) and OE19 cell H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal (right) at all 4600 eRNA regions compared to 4600 random regions of accessible chromatin.

There is clear co-association with a range of enhancer-associated marks and proteins, including RNA polymerase II, BRD4, and the MED1 subunit of mediator. This is also evident when visualising the data as heatmaps compared to random regions of accessible chromatin, where there are higher levels of the chromatin-associated marks/proteins that categorise enhancers in the eRNA regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Conversely, there is a clear depletion of the promoter-associated mark H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Neither mark is enriched in the eRNA containing regions compared to random accessible regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, there is a clear enrichment of H3K4me1 and depletion of H3K4me3 in eRNA containing regions compared to promoters, consistent with their designation as potential enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Re-evaluation of the eRNA expressing regions showed that 33% were associated with regions designated as enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; compared to 4% genome-wide), with very few regions designated as quiescent or repressed (17% compared to 69% in randomly selected chromatin regions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>).</p><p>The co-association of eRNA expressing regions with genomic elements associated with active chromatin marks is strongly suggestive of enhancer-like activity. However, to provide further evidence for active ongoing transcription at these loci we performed KAS-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) in OE19 cells to identify areas of DNA strand opening as observed in the transcription bubble. The three replicates showed good congruency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and we merged all three to call peaks of DNA strand opening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These peaks show a highly significant overlap with the eRNA regions we identified from patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and higher levels of KAS-seq signal are associated with eRNA regions compared to random regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This is exemplified by eRNAs associated with a putative enhancer region located upstream from <italic>JUP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), <italic>CCNE1</italic> and <italic>MYBL2</italic> gene loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Furthermore, when we combined eRNA regions with regions showing KAS-seq peaks, higher levels of H3K27ac were observed compared to those lacking concomitant KAS-seq signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>), indicative of higher activity.</p><p>Finally, we focussed on potential super enhancers as these have been shown to play important roles in cancer-specific gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>) including gastroesophageal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ooi et al., 2016</xref>). We identified potential super enhancers in OE19 cells using HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>) from peak sets generated from H3K27ac ChIP-seq (for histone activation marks) and ATAC-seq (for open chromatin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). We then overlapped these peak sets to generate a dataset with both indicators of super enhancer activity, excluding promoter regions from our analysis. This resulted in 221 high-confidence super enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Next, the constituent enhancers within these super enhancers were overlapped with the eRNA regions we identified from OAC patients, producing a final list of 73 super enhancers showing evidence of eRNA activity, with a total of 216 eRNA regions residing in these super enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Multiple eRNA regions identified in patient samples are therefore associated with super enhancers as exemplified by the <italic>ELF3</italic> super enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The genes associated with these super enhancers are enriched in several biological processes with direct relevance to OAC, such as MAPK signalling and cadherin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these data strongly indicate that the eRNA-associated regions we discovered in patient samples represent areas of enhancer activity due to the presence of enhanced accessibility, enhancer-associated chromatin marks/proteins, and evidence for actively transcribing RNA polymerase in OAC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Association of eRNA regions to target genes and regulatory transcription factors</title><p>Next, we asked whether we could identify upstream transcription factors that might control eRNA levels and provide insights into the regulatory landscape of OAC. First, we identified binding motifs for transcription factors that are over-represented in OAC or Barrett’s-specific eRNA producing regions. This revealed enrichment for transcription factors previously identified as relevant for OAC including AP1, KLF5, and HNF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogerson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) as well as CTCF, a factor implicated in enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6A</xref>). However, the frequency of motif occurrence differed between eRNA- and open chromatin-defined enhancers in OAC patients; HNF1 motifs were significantly more enriched in eRNA-defined enhancers whereas AP1 and KLF5 motifs were more enriched in enhancers defined by increased accessibility alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A similar set of transcription factor motifs were observed when we omitted regions commonly found in patient samples and OE19 cells and instead focussed on eRNA-defined enhancers inferred only from OAC patient-specific ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). AP1 motifs were again identified in Barrett’s-specific regions as well as a different set of motifs including p53-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6B</xref>). Similarly, calculating differential binding scores revealed higher binding activity of AP1 and HNF1 in OAC-specific regions and conversely higher p53-binding activity in Barrett’s-specific regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Thus, eRNA-defined enhancers reveal the activity of disease stage-specific transcriptional regulators. To further explore this point, we sought evidence for enhancer occupancy by transcription factors in OAC cells and found substantially more binding signal of KLF5 derived from ChIP-seq in OE19 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogerson et al., 2020</xref> for eRNA-defined regions with KLF5 motifs compared to regions lacking the motif, or control genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, evidence for KLF5-mediated regulation was obtained by the significant overlap between the genes associated with the same eRNA regions (ie containing KLF5 motifs) and those genes downregulated upon KLF5 depletion in OE19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We also examined the effect of AP1 inhibition by expressing a dominant-negative FOS derivative (dnFOS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olive et al., 1997</xref>) in OE19 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ogden et al., 2023</xref>) and compared the downregulated gene profile with the eRNA-associated genes containing AP1 motifs that we have identified. Again, we observed a significant overlap between the genes associated with eRNA regions containing AP1 motifs in OAC samples and those genes downregulated upon AP1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To provide functional links between transcription factor occupancy at enhancers, enhancer activation and target gene transcription, we focussed on KLF5. ChIP-seq data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogerson et al., 2020</xref> demonstrate that KLF5 strongly binds to the <italic>JUP</italic> and <italic>CCNE1</italic> enhancers but low levels are observed at the <italic>MYBL2</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). KLF5 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>) caused reduced expression of all three target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). However only <italic>JUP</italic> and <italic>CCNE1</italic> enhancer activities were diminished following KLF5 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), consistent with the higher occupancy of KLF5 at these enhancers compared to <italic>MYBL2.

Our data are therefore consistent with KLF5 regulating <italic>JUP</italic> and <italic>CCNE1</italic> expression through the enhancers we have identified. Thus, both motif discovery and functional dissection demonstrate that KLF5 and AP1 are likely major players in eRNA-defined enhancer activation in OAC patients.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Association of enhancer RNA (eRNA) regions with transcriptional regulators.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transcription factor de novo motif enrichment using HOMER, at eRNAs differentially expressed in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) (top; <italic>n</italic> = 959) and Barrett’s (bottom; <italic>n</italic> = 670) (p values are shown).

Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified several terms relevant to the OAC phenotype such as ‘Cell migration’ and ‘MAPK signalling’ whereas Barrett’s-specific regions identified genes associated with various metabolic processes and ‘epithelial differentiation’ that would be expected for this intestinal metaplastic tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A similar set of GO terms were identified when we omitted regions commonly found in patient samples and OE19 cells and instead focussed on eRNA-defined enhancers inferred only from OAC patient-specific ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). One difference was ‘cell adhesion’ which was more enriched in the patient-specific dataset which might reflect the differing adhesive properties on 2D cultured cells and cells growing in a 3D in vivo environment. We also performed differential gene expression analysis on the whole RNA-seq datasets to identify genes preferentially expressed in OAC or Barrett’s and performed GO-term analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). Similar GO terms were identified with ‘MAPK signalling’ and ‘Hallmark EMT/ECM organisation’ (terms associated with cell migration) resembling those identified through association with eRNA regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, eRNA-associated genes revealed processes not among the top GO terms generated from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) such as ‘embryonic development’ and ‘histone methylation’. Similarly, Barrett’s-specific genes returned GO terms such as ‘epithelial cell differentiation’, as identified from eRNA regions further emphasising the similarity in biological processes identified by eRNA-associated genes and total RNAs. A range of different metabolic processes were also identified in both cases, illustrating the distinct information that is derived from eRNA-associated genes.

We then determined the net eRNA expression change when comparing Barrett’s to OAC samples and created nine bins reflecting the magnitude of differential expression. We then calculated the associated gene expression changes within these genomic bins when comparing Barrett’s to OAC. There was a clear correlation between the directionality of eRNA expression with mRNA expression which changed in an analogous manner, with high eRNA levels in OAC associated with higher gene expression in OAC and vice versa in Barrett’s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>In summary therefore, eRNA expression profiling can reveal specific upstream regulatory transcription factors and the eRNA generating regions can be used to uncover a set of biological processes and constituent genes that are relevant to specific disease states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Target genes of eRNA-defined enhancers are co-expressed in OAC</title><p>We identified potential target genes of eRNA-defined enhancers by implementing the nearest gene model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We extended this analysis across all eRNAs and asked whether we could find significantly correlated mRNA expression of genes located in their vicinity (±100 kb)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Generally, highly correlated genes could be identified (see diagonal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly when we clustered the data according to the expression of the genes associated with each eRNA, then there was generally a good segregation of OAC- and BO-specific eRNAs further emphasising the relevance of the correlations we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, when we split the RNA-seq data into tissue types, there was a significantly higher correlation of BO-specific eRNA with nearby gene expression in BO datasets, compared to analysing the shared eRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, left). Similarly, the same trend was observed for OAC-specific eRNAs which were more highly correlated with nearby gene expression in OAC datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, right).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Enhancer RNA (eRNA) regions identify <italic>JUP</italic> as a candidate target gene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome browser view of Barrett’s oesophagus (BO) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) patient tissue ATAC- and total RNA-seq data, and H3K27ac ChIP-seq in OE19 cells, at the <italic>JUP</italic> locus with the <italic>JUPe</italic> eRNA highlighted.

This is reflective of ongoing transcription. Furthermore, all three eRNAs and their associated target genes exhibit higher expression in OE19 cells compared to the Barrett’s CP-A cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To directly establish enhancer activity, we cloned the regions encompassing the eRNAs into two different enhancer reporter systems with either RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) or luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) readouts. For all three regions, both assays demonstrated significant enhancer activity in OE19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, we used an inducible dCas9-KRAB synthetic repressor protein to silence the activities of each enhancer in their natural chromatin context in OE19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In all cases, introduction of the relevant sgRNA to target the dCas9-KRAB repressor to the putative enhancer, resulted in reduced eRNA transcription and reduced expression of the associated target gene, albeit to a lesser degree in the case of the target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The latter observation is not unexpected as a combination of several proximal and distal regulatory elements rather than a single enhancer likely contributes to their expression. Importantly, no significant changes in expression were observed for any of the genes immediately flanking the target genes, demonstrating the fidelity of our enhancer–gene linkages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, to establish whether any additional longer range enhancer–gene linkages could be found, we used Hi-C to generate a 3D chromatin map in OE19 cells. Replicate samples showed good reproducibility (stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient = 0.965). However, we were unable to identify any long range interactions emanating from the <italic>CCNE1</italic>e and <italic>MYBL2</italic>e enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).

This revealed a six-gene signature that was highly predictive of OAC patient survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Only three out of six genes comprising this signature were annotated to OAC DEEs. We therefore also explored whether we could derive a prognostic signature from OAC unique DEE-annotated genes, OAC unique DEGs or the intersect of OAC DEEs and DEGs (as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and identified differing prognostic signatures in all categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Both of these processes ultimately lead to alterations in the activity of gene regulatory elements, including transcriptional enhancers, that results in a change in cellular phenotype that defines the tumourigenic state. While profiling of histone marks and chromatin accessibility is useful in defining potential gene regulatory elements, this approach is limited for defining active enhancers. Here, we used eRNA profiling to identify regions harbouring potentially active enhancers in OAC patient samples. We integrated these with a range of epigenetic datasets and experimentally validated several regions as <italic>bona fide</italic> enhancers. Importantly, our enhancer repertoire identified new molecular events that are activated in OAC which were not apparent from either genome sequencing or mRNA profiling alone.</p><p>A previous pan-cancer analysis of RNA-seq datasets generated by the TCGA consortium to identify eRNAs defined a compendium of potential enhancers across human cancers and demonstrated how they could have clinical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). However, while the authors examined oesophageal cancers, they mixed two distinct disease sub-types, squamous and adenocarcinoma, which limited any discoveries specific to OAC. Here, we specifically interrogated OAC RNA-seq data (generated by the OCCAMs consortium) and to identify enhancers that are potentially relevant to OAC, we compared their associated eRNA levels to the pre-cancerous BO state. Using this approach, we were able to identify ~1000 high-confidence OAC-specific enhancers. These enhancer regions exhibited high accessibility in both patient samples and cell line models and using a variety of chromatin marks profiled in an OAC cell line model we provided further verification of the enhancer-like properties. The OAC-specific enhancers are associated with transcription factors which have been shown to be important for driving OAC-specific transcriptional events (e.g., KLF5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogerson et al., 2020</xref>; AP1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britton et al., 2017</xref>). Reciprocally we also identify ~700 Barrett’s-specific enhancers which are associated with a different transcription factor repertoire, including the potential involvement of members of the TP53/TP63/TP73 family. While we have identified a large number of intergenic enhancers, the approach we have taken will miss intragenic enhancers, and other approaches using function-based assays (e.g., STARR-seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>) or computational imputation will be needed to identify these.</p><p>Our newly derived eRNA-defined enhancer datasets also provide novel insights into pathways that are operational in OAC. This is apparent from the limited overlap in DEGs at the mRNA level versus the differential expression of genes associated with nearby enhancers defined by eRNA levels. Interestingly while the specific gene overlaps are limited, the broad processes defined by GO terms such as MAPK signalling and cell migration/EMT remain the same. Part of this discrepancy might be explained by the OAC-specific enhancers maintaining gene expression in the BO–OAC transition rather than de novo gene activation in OAC or alternatively that many genes may be primarily driven by changes in promoter rather than enhancer activity. However, expression change cut offs we use may also contribute to this, as can the heterogeneity of the OAC samples. Other potential reasons for the lack of congruency include technical issues such as the nearest gene model may not always provide the most appropriate linkage of eRNAs to target genes and that we are likely missing many eRNAs due to the datasets we used which are not optimally designed for eRNA identification. An enhancer associated with <italic>JUP</italic> was specifically revealed by eRNA profiling, alongside hundreds of other enhancers linked to genes involved in oncogenic processes such as cell migration, PI3K signalling, and metabolism. We validated this <italic>JUP</italic> enhancer, and enhancers linked to <italic>MYBL2</italic> and <italic>CCNE1</italic>, and their association with their proposed targets by CRISPRi. Furthermore, correlations between eRNA and mRNA expression across cancer samples suggest a causal link. Longer range regulatory interactions were detected between the <italic>JUP</italic> enhancer and <italic>GRB7</italic>, but HiC analysis did not reveal any additional potential connections for the other two enhancers. It remains possible that such long regulatory interactions may exist that escaped detection using HiC. Importantly both CCNE1 and MYBL2 play important roles in promoting cell proliferation, an important cancer cell trait. JUP (otherwise known as junction plakoglobin) had not previously been implicated in OAC but this was identified in a screen for gene dependencies in OAC cell lines (DepMap project: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behan et al., 2019</xref>) and we validated its importance for OAC cell growth. In this context, the co-amplification with ERBB2 is intriguing as both genes are on the same chromosome and are ~2 Mb apart and the intervening region is not usually co-amplified. Both can be found on the same ecDNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ng et al., 2022</xref>) allowing closer juxtapositioning of <italic>ERBB2</italic> and the <italic>JUPe</italic> enhancer, which we were able to validate using HiC in OE19 cells. Nevertheless, we were unable to detect <italic>JUPe</italic> enhancer-mediated ERBB2 regulation. This co-amplification may instead reflect a functional interdependency for these two oncogenic events. JUP has previously been implicated in multiple cancers although it is generally found to be a tumour suppressor protein, rather than the oncogenic properties it has in the context of OAC (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aktary et al., 2017</xref>). As JUP encodes a protein involved in cell–cell contacts, this might suggest a role for this process in OAC cancer cell survival and a potential route to therapy. Alternatively, JUP may be acting via the numerous other cellular processes in which it has been implicated, and further work is needed to understand the precise role it has in OAC cells.</p><p>In addition to pointing to potential actionable pathways, we also demonstrate that eRNA profiling is clinically relevant and is sufficient to differentiate between BO and OAC. A six-gene signature derived from our OAC-specific enhancer-associated genes is able to predict prognostic outcomes. Indeed, a large proportion of the eRNA-associated genes show prognostic significance when analysed on an individual basis. Furthermore, by focussing in on a few examples, we found that one of the novel OAC-associated genes, <italic>JUP</italic>, was upregulated in <italic>ERBB2</italic> overexpressing OAC samples which is reflected by their frequent co-amplification. Coupled with the observation that JUP is required for the survival of a range of OAC cell lines harbouring <italic>ERBB2</italic> amplifications, this further emphasises the potential utility of JUP as a therapeutic target in this subset of OAC patients. This would provide an alternative approach to the use of ERBB2 inhibitors which are routinely administered but have limited therapeutic benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bang et al., 2010</xref>). Further clinical insights are provided by other eRNA-defined enhancer regions, such as the enhancer associated with <italic>MYBL2</italic> where high <italic>MYBL2</italic> expression indicates a worse prognosis for patients and earlier disease onset.</p><p>In summary, we identify a cohort of OAC-specific enhancers, expanding our knowledge of the regulatory networks that are operational in OAC. This has led to novel insights into the pathways that are operational in this disease. The approach we have taken to identify cancer-specific enhancers should be broadly applicable to other tumour types or subtypes, where data are available for both the cancer and the originating normal or pre-cancerous tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>OE19 cells were purchased from ATCC and tested negative for mycoplasma.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Irwin Davidson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors discuss AP1, KLF5, and HNF1 in Figure 3. However, they have not demonstrated that eRNAs specific to OACs also relate to their ability to transcribe target genes. They should consider if these TFs regulate JUP based as a function of JUPe expression. As one example, upon CRISPRi of JUPe, they should determine that these factors have diminished regulatory activity of JUP transcripts through ChIP-qPCR coupled with the existing RT-PCR experiments.</p><p>2) Enhancers may regulate transcript of more than one gene. The authors should consolidate the relationship between eRNA expression of JUP, CCNE1, and MYBL2, based on structural interactions. A potential experiment is Hi-C sequencing.</p><p>3) From the text, it is not clear how the authors defined the 6-gene signature that was used to associate with OS in Figure 7E this should be better described (there is a description in the Methods section, but it could be made clearer). Also, can the authors demonstrate that a signature based on differentially expressed eRNA-associated genes has better clinical value than signatures based on differentially expressed genes? As mentioned above the data in Figure 4 shows only limited overlap. For example, do the 59 overlapping AOC genes in Figure 4B allow better association with the clinical outcome than signatures based on the most differentially expressed genes or the 340 most differentially expressed eRNA-associated genes? Is the 6-gene signature in Figure 7E present in this list?</p><p>4) Some of the data in Figure 5 is not very convincing. For example, the enhancer activity measured by the pGL3 vectors is very weak, whereas it is much more convincing with the STARR vectors. The pGL3 data could be removed. Also, can the authors express the data in 5D as fold change over the control vector rather than 'reporter expression'. Similarly, the changes in JUP, CCNE1, and MYBL2 in panel E are rather weak compared to the changes in the corresponding eRNAs. Given the extent of these changes, it is difficult to understand the strong effects on viability in Figure 7B. Can the authors comment?</p><p>5) There is a significant amount of new CUT&amp;TAG data, and it seems that this could have been more clearly presented. For example, although Figure 2C shows a correlation between different marks, this figure does not show how these marks correlate with eRNA regions compared to randomly accessible regions. Figure S2C shows this, but the comparison is not quantitative, and not all marks are included.</p><p>6) The authors should put the context of the percentages of eRNAs found at enhancers and other regions to make it clear which findings are significant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors discuss AP1, KLF5, and HNF1 in Figure 3. However, they have not demonstrated that eRNAs specific to OACs also relate to their ability to transcribe target genes.

Enhancers may regulate the transcript of more than one gene. The authors should consolidate the relationship between eRNA expression of JUP, CCNE1, and MYBL2, based on structural interactions. A potential experiment is Hi-C sequencing.</p><p>3. Based on the same concerns, in Figure 6E – the transcript expression suppressing effects of targeting the eRNA is small when examining JUP, CCNE1, and MYBL2, despite robust suppression of the eRNAs. However, this also corresponds to a significant viability effect in Figure 7B. The concern is that the eRNA represents a measure of regulatory activity on more than one target gene and that other targets also contribute to the viability regulating phenotypes. The authors should demonstrate the specificity of the experiments. As one example, related to JUPe, authors should examine other genes on 17q, such as ERBB2. A key demonstration would be that these 17q genes are not associated with JUPe in OAC samples, that JUPe suppression does not impact their expression in cells, and that suppression of these other 17q genes does not have viability effects in the same set of cell lines. Based on Hi-C experiments, they should also confirm there is no interaction with ERBB2 or other genes.</p><p>4. Outside of JUPe, the authors have not examined if JUP has general roles in OACs without ERBB2 amplifications. In Figure 7A, the cell line results from Depmap include 6 ERBB2 amplified models. In Figure S7C there are no OACs with JUP amplification outside of samples with ERBB2 amplification. This coincides with the lack of OS in Figure S9C.</p><p>5. A concern is that JUPe measurements are a surrogate for cell activity that is not specific to JUP expression. In Figure 5C, JUPe is not expressed in many samples that have clear JUP expression, which suggests JUPe is not essential for JUP expression. This figure panel is also hard to resolve since BO and OAC samples are in the same plot. The authors should consider splitting Figure 5C into two panels to demonstrate that JUP expression is tightly regulated by JUPe in OAC as compared to BO. This would agree with the hypothesis.</p><p>6. A discussion should be made of why of the analyses, only MYBL2 (Figure 7D) related to survival whereas JUP and CCNE did not (Figure S9C).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There is a significant amount of new CUT&amp;TAG data, and it seems that this could have been more clearly presented. For example, although Figure 2C shows a correlation between different marks, this figure does not show how these marks correlate with eRNA regions compared to randomly accessible regions. Figure S2C shows this, but comparison is not quantitative, and not all marks are included.</p><p>Comparisons of eRNA regions with promoters in S2D-G are not useful, and I would suggest they be omitted. It is a biased analysis, as promoters are intentionally excluded from the eRNA identification.</p><p>In the text discussing Figure 2D, the authors point out that 43% of eRNA are mapped to enhancer regions, but do not give the comparative context that 38% of random open regions map to enhancers, which makes the finding somewhat underwhelming. In contrast, the authors do not mention the largest enrichment in eRNA regions – Active TSS (18% versus 12%). This seems due to the presence of the active TSS that makes the eRNA, and is quite interesting.</p><p>The discussion states &quot;Importantly, our enhancer repertoire identified new pathways that are activated in OAC which were not apparent from either genome sequencing or mRNA profiling alone&quot;. This statement is not well supported by the data. It is not clear from the manuscript what these new pathways are.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors compare regions expressing eRNAs in AOC patient samples with epigenetic and transcription factor binding profiles in AOC-derived OE19 cells. They insist on the regions that converge from both analyses. While this is important to validate the approach, they seem to have excluded eRNA regions specific to patient samples. OE19 cells are obviously adapted to growth in culture, but it should be informative to focus also on eRNAs and associated genes that are found only in patient samples as this may provide further insights into genes that are important for in situ tumour growth as opposed to those involved in growth of OE19 cells in culture. In particular, the role of these regions would be strengthened if they were also associated with KLF5 of other TFs shown to be important in OAC.</p><p>2) It is not clear to this referee why the overlap between differentially expressed eRNAs and differentially expressed genes is so low as illustrated in Figure 4B. Is it correct to interpret these results to mean that there are multiple eRNAs that show differential expression, but no change in the associated genes, whereas the vast majority of differentially expressed genes showed no associated eRNAs. Also, most of the ontology terms identified by eRNA-associated genes and differentially expressed genes are in fact different, while the authors imply they are similar. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>3) Some of the data in Figure 5 is not very convincing. For example, the enhancer activity measured by the pGL3 vectors is very weak, whereas it is much more convincing with the STARR vectors. The pGL3 data could be removed. Also, can the authors express the data in 5D as fold change over the control vector rather than 'reporter expression'. Similarly, the changes in JUP, CCNE1 and MYBL2 in panel E are rather weak compared to the changes in the corresponding eRNAs. Given the extent of these changes, it is difficult to understand the strong effects on viability in Figure 7B. Can the authors comment?</p><p>4) From the text, it is not clear how the authors defined the 6-gene signature that was used to associate with OS in Figure 7E this should be better described (there is a description in the Methods section, but it could be made clearer).

We also performed the additional analyses requested by the reviewer (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1F). In all cases, we could derive prognostic signatures, although different genes/loci contributed to each case. This is illustrated by the fact that only 3 of the DEE associated signature genes in Figure 7E also represent DEGs. We therefore conclude that DEEs able to predict prognostic signatures on their own to an equivalent level as using DEGs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some of the data in Figure 5 is not very convincing.

We have therefore retained these but moved to the supplementary figures. As requested we now express the data from the STARR reporters in Figure 6C as expression relative to the negative control.</p><p>The reduced effect on target gene expression compared to enhancer transcription is not unexpected as the target genes are likely controlled by many elements including promoter proximal elements. We have commented on this in the text. Perhaps more surprisingly are the strong phenotypic effects we see and could be explained either by there being a particular dose-sensitive response to these genes or alternatively the surviving cells may have found ways to engage different regulatory elements to circumvent the detrimental effects of reduced expression. Furthermore, although our newly added HiC data do not uncover major linkages to other more distal genes (with the exception of <italic>JUP</italic>- see discussion of point 2 above) it remains possible that the enhancers control the activity of other genes needed for cell viability. We have added further discussion of these possibilities and potential limitations as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is a significant amount of new CUT&amp;TAG data, and it seems that this could have been more clearly presented.

Also, we used a different background dataset for comparison than the original accessible genome and used the whole genome as the aim was to illustrate that we were identifying enhancer regions rather than random pieces of chromatin.

For example, although Figure 2C shows a correlation between different marks, this figure does not show how these marks correlate with eRNA regions compared to randomly accessible regions. Figure S2C shows this, but comparison is not quantitative, and not all marks are included.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added all of the heatmaps to Figure 2—figure supplement 1C &amp;D as requested and also included Average tag density plots to demonstrate the increased signal associated with eRNA regions for a range of enhancer associated histone marks and a depletion of promoter associated marks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comparisons of eRNA regions with promoters in S2D-G are not useful, and I would suggest they be omitted. It is a biased analysis, as promoters are intentionally excluded from the eRNA identification.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a biased analysis but is deliberately so as we are trying to demonstrate that the eRNA regions resemble enhancer regions and not promoter regions as defined by chromatin marks (which are not gathered in a biased manner). As such, these represent control comparisons to validate the enhancer designations rather than a random association with all chromatin marks. This in part also validates our CUT&amp;TAG data and as such we believe is useful to retain in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the text discussing Figure 2D, the authors point out that 43% of eRNA are mapped to enhancer regions, but do not give the comparative context that 38% of random open regions map to enhancers, which makes the finding somewhat underwhelming. In contrast, the authors do not mention the largest enrichment in eRNA regions – Active TSS (18% versus 12%). This seems due to the presence of the active TSS that makes the eRNA, and is quite interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-evaluated this data and found an error in HMM assignments. Also, we used a different background dataset for comparison than the original accessible genome and used the whole genome as the aim was to illustrate that we were identifying enhancer regions rather than random pieces of chromatin. This new data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1J clearly indicates an enrichment of enhancer-like regions (33% vs 4%) rather than quiescent/repressed regions (18% vs 77%) in our eRNA-defined genomic regions. We agree that in the original paper the TSS enrichment is potentially interesting but might reflect regions with the potential to act as enhancers and promoters. However as observed in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D very few regions seem to exhibit strong promoter activity as defined by H3K4me3 levels, and the HMM designations would not provide such a granularity in promoter strength. This is an open question that needs more investigation and we have not discussed this further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion states &quot;Importantly, our enhancer repertoire identified new pathways that are activated in OAC which were not apparent from either genome sequencing or mRNA profiling alone&quot;. This statement is not well supported by the data. It is not clear from the manuscript what these new pathways are.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the wording to “&quot;Importantly, our enhancer repertoire identified new molecular events that have been activated in OAC…”. Further discussion of these events and the linked pathways is in paragraph 3 of the discussion where connections to the underlying data are provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors compare regions expressing eRNAs in AOC patient samples with epigenetic and transcription factor binding profiles in AOC-derived OE19 cells. They insist on the regions that converge from both analyses. While this is important to validate the approach, they seem to have excluded eRNA regions specific to patient samples. OE19 cells are obviously adapted to growth in culture, but it should be informative to focus also on eRNAs and associated genes that are found only in patient samples as this may provide further insights into genes that are important for in situ tumour growth as opposed to those involved in growth of OE19 cells in culture. In particular, the role of these regions would be strengthened if they were also associated with KLF5 of other TFs shown to be important in OAC.</p></disp-quote><p>We used epigenetic marks from OE19 cells to validate our findings. However, the eRNAs we take forwards in Figure 3 onwards represent all eRNAs, not just those mapping to OE19 accessible regions defined by ATAC-seq. Nevertheless, the referee makes a good point and we have analysed the eRNA-defined enhancer regions that are not in OE19 and are just found in patients (ie a subset of what we analysed previously). As observed for the total dataset, the top three transcription factor binding motifs are among the top motifs in the patient specific eRNA-defined enhancer regions (TEAD3, AP-1 and CTCF; compare Figure 3A with new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Very similar GO terms are also returned as significant in both cases (compare Figure 4A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1I). “Cell adhesion” is revealed as a category that appears only for the patient-specific eRNA-associated genes, which may reflect the differences between 2D culture and the in vivo environment. We added discussion of this new data to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear to this referee why the overlap between differentially expressed eRNAs and differentially expressed genes is so low as illustrated in Figure 4B. Is it correct to interpret these results to mean that there are multiple eRNAs that show differential expression, but no change in the associated genes, whereas the vast majority of differentially expressed genes showed no associated eRNAs. Also, most of the ontology terms identified by eRNA-associated genes and differentially expressed genes are in fact different, while the authors imply they are similar. Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>There are many possible reasons for the overall lack of overlap in differential expression of eRNAs and their associated gene expression. The first is that the nearest gene model may not always be the most appropriate linkage. Secondly, not all genes are necessarily driven by enhancers and/or a change in enhancer activity rather than promoter activity. Thirdly, the threshold cut-offs for calling differential expression may preclude associations. Fourth, we are also likely missing many eRNAs due to the datasets we used which are not designed for eRNA identification. Finally, it is possible that as one enhancer becomes activated, another becomes inactivated, so there is no net change in gene expression and yet enhancer activity changes significantly. The latter possibility was already discussed in the paper and we have now added further discussion for the lack of congruency. Nevertheless, the associations we do find between differentially expressed eRNAs and associated targets are significant.</p><p>The referee makes a good point about the GO terms and we have rephrased the text describing these. However, the majority are very similar in OAC ie KRAS signalling and MAPK signalling are the same pathway (and relate to MAPK signalling), ECM organisation and EMT are metastatic like properties (and relate to cell migration) and inflammatory signalling relates to cytokine production. We have however now pointed out that embryonic development and histone methylation are new terms revealed by eRNA signatures which further emphasises the new information this analysis has provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some of the data in Figure 5 is not very convincing. For example, the enhancer activity measured by the pGL3 vectors is very weak, whereas it is much more convincing with the STARR vectors. The pGL3 data could be removed. Also, can the authors express the data in 5D as fold change over the control vector rather than 'reporter expression'. Similarly, the changes in JUP, CCNE1 and MYBL2 in panel E are rather weak compared to the changes in the corresponding eRNAs. Given the extent of these changes, it is difficult to understand the strong effects on viability in Figure 7B. Can the authors comment?</p></disp-quote><p>Although the luciferase reporter assay results are less striking than the data from the STARR vector assays, they do provide important independent validation. We have therefore retained these but moved to the supplementary figures. As requested we now express the data from the STARR reporters in Figure 6C as expression relative to the negative control.</p><p>The reduced effect on target gene expression compared to enhancer transcription is not unexpected as the target genes are likely controlled by many elements including promoter proximal elements. We have commented on this in the text. Perhaps more surprisingly are the strong phenotypic effects we see and could be explained either by there being a particular dose-sensitive response to these genes or alternatively the surviving cells may have found ways to engage different regulatory elements to circumvent the detrimental effects of reduced expression. Furthermore, although our newly added HiC data do not uncover major linkages to other more distal genes (with the exception of <italic>JUP</italic>- see discussion of point 2 above) it remains possible that the enhancers control the activity of other genes needed for cell viability. We have added further discussion of these possibilities as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) From the text, it is not clear how the authors defined the 6-gene signature that was used to associate with OS in Figure 7E this should be better described (there is a description in the Methods section, but it could be made clearer). Also, can the authors demonstrate that a signature based on differentially expressed eRNA-associated genes has better clinical value than signatures based on differentially expressed genes. As mentioned above the data in Figure 4 shows only limited overlap. For example, do the 59 overlapping AOC genes in Figure 4B allow better association with clinical outcome than signatures based on the most differentially expressed genes or the 340 most differentially expressed eRNA-associated genes? Is the 6-gene signature in Figure 7E present in this list?</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the text in the Materials and methods. We also performed the additional analyses requested by the reviewer (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1F). In all cases, we could derive prognostic signatures, although different genes/loci contributed to each case. This is illustrated by the fact that only 3 of the DEE associated signature genes in Figure 7E also represent DEGs. We therefore conclude that DEEs able to predict prognostic signatures on their own to an equivalent level as using DEGs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
