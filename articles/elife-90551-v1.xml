polymerization in cell migration is well-established, much less is known about the role of transmembrane water flow in cell motility. Here, we investigate the role of water influx in a prototypical migrating cell, the neutrophil, which undergoes rapid, directed movement to sites of injury, and infection. Chemoattractant exposure both increases cell volume and potentiates migration, but the causal link between these processes are not known. We combine single-cell volume measurements and a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify the regulators of chemoattractant-induced neutrophil swelling, including NHE1, AE2, PI3K-gamma, and CA2. Through NHE1 inhibition in primary human neutrophils, we show that cell swelling is both necessary and sufficient for the potentiation of migration following chemoattractant stimulation. Our data demonstrate that chemoattractant-driven cell swelling complements cytoskeletal rearrangements to enhance migration speed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>cell size</kwd><kwd>cell volume</kwd><kwd>physical forces</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagy</surname><given-names>Tamas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagy</surname><given-names>Tamas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strickland</surname><given-names>Evelyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBSRC grant 2019598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Cellular Construction DBI-1548297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Geometrically Engineered Cellular Systems NNF17OC0028176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Actin-independent water influx complements actin-driven cytoskeletal forces to potentiate chemoattractant-induced migration in primary human neutrophils.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells extend their membranes during morphogenesis and movement. Membrane extension in plant and fungal cells are thought to require coordination between water influx and cell wall remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer and Silk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lew, 2011</xref>). In animal cells that lack cell walls, most research has focused on the role of cytoskeletal rearrangements during membrane extension and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Svitkina, 2018</xref>), though in some contexts water influx also appears to suffice for cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). It is likely that cytoskeletal rearrangements and water influx collaborate in a wider range of cell morphological and migratory contexts than are currently appreciated.</p><p>In contrast to the extensive work characterizing the actin regulators that underlie cell motility, we have a relatively poor understanding of the molecular regulators of water influx during cell migration. We address this question in neutrophils, which are innate immune cells that polarize their actin assembly and actomyosin contractility to move to sites of injury and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weiner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sengupta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>). Chemoattractant stimulation also initiates water influx and cell swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grinstein et al., 1986</xref>), but the molecular basis of this swelling and its relevance to motility are not known.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemoattractant stimulation elicits competing volume responses in primary human neutrophils</title><p>Neutrophils are a powerful system to study the biophysical demands of cell motility, as they acutely initiate rapid migration following stimulation with a chemoattractant. Normally, they exist in a quiescent non-motile state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metzemaekers et al., 2020</xref>). Upon exposure to chemoattractants, neutrophils respond with significant morphological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sengupta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Denk et al., 2017</xref>), water influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grinstein et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pember et al., 1983</xref>), and a dramatic increase in motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To probe the role of transmembrane water flow in chemoattractant-stimulated morphogenesis and movement, we adapted Fluorescence eXclusion Microscopy (FxM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cadart et al., 2017</xref>), a single-cell volume measurement technique, to primary human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). This assay enables us to accurately measure absolute cell volume in single primary human neutrophils during activation by chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). We used a UV-sensitive caged chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins et al., 2015</xref>) to acutely stimulate the cells in situ with a short (10 s) pulse of light enabling us to capture both the volume and motility response of cells before and after activation. Following chemoattractant-uncaging, the cells spread and transformed into a motile, amoeboid state with high persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By simultaneously measuring the single-cell volumes, we observed a biphasic volume response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Immediately following chemoattractant exposure, the cells lose 5–8% of their cell volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, inset), consistent with spreading-induced volume losses previously observed in several other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Venkova et al., 2022</xref>). Following this spreading-mediated initial volume loss, the cells swelled significantly, reaching a median volume 15% larger than their resting volumes after 20 minutes, agreeing with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grinstein et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pember et al., 1983</xref>). The chemoattractant-induced spreading can be seen by the increased cell footprint area post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This raises the question of whether the swelling is downstream of spreading and motility. To address this point, we used Latrunculin B to depolymerize the actin cytoskeleton and found that while chemoattractant-induced swelling is unaffected, motility was completely blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). These data suggest that while chemoattractant simultaneously drives the cell volume increase and the motility changes, these processes are separable from one another.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chemoattractant stimulation elicits competing volume responses in primary human neutrophils (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic detailing the neutrophil activation process.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Schematic detailing the Fluorescence Exclusion Microscopy (FxM) approach for measuring single-cell volumes, which relies on cells displacing an extracellular dye in a shallow microfluidic chamber.

Our approach relies on creating a population of cells with single gene knockouts and then enriching for the cells that fail to swell following stimulation. The quality of this enrichment is the most critical step for success of these screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagy and Kampmann, 2017</xref>). A key challenge in adapting pooled CRISPR screening to this context was the lack of highly scalable approaches for accurately separating the cells based on their volumes directly. Although volume is difficult to use as a separation approach, cells can be easily separated by buoyant density (mass over volume), which is related to volume over short timescales. Because neutrophil swelling in suspension results from the uptake of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grinstein et al., 1986</xref>), stimulated neutrophils exhibit a corresponding decrease in buoyant density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pember et al., 1983</xref>). Buoyant density has been successfully used in other genetic screens, including the identification of secretion-defective mutants in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Novick et al., 1980</xref>). Finally, buoyant density is a particularly homogenous parameter at the population-level, with 100-fold less variation than either mass or volume across multiple different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grover et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To verify the chemoattractant-induced shifts in neutrophil buoyant density in our own hands, we deposited linear Percoll gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) in centrifuge tubes and carefully layered nutridoma-differentiated HL-60s (dHL-60s) onto the gradients in the absence or presence of the chemoattractant fMLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Stimulating dHL-60s with fMLP and using an optimized centrifugation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) led to a robust, long-term decrease in buoyant density across millions of cells with a shift in population position clearly visible by eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The buoyant density change corresponded to a 15% increase in cell volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This effect depends on chemoattractant-based cell stimulation, as knockout of the fMLP receptor FPR1 completely inhibits fMLP-induced swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide screen identifies regulators of chemoattractant-induced cell swelling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic detailing the buoyant density assay.

We used next-generation sequencing to determine which CRISPR guides were over-represented in the high-density bin, i.e., which guides prevented swelling, leading to the cells remaining dense following stimulation with fMLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To verify CRISPR knockout efficacy, we confirmed the systematic depletion of essential genes from the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Computing median log2-fold enrichment of the guides targeting each gene in the dense bin and plotting this value against the false discovery rate revealed the regulators of chemoattractant-induced cell swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The top right corner is occupied by genes that are over-represented in the dense, i.e., non-swelling, bin. The top hit was FPR1, the high affinity GPCR that specifically binds to fMLP to initiate the chemoattractant signaling cascade, confirming the effectiveness of the screen.</p><p>Our screen revealed a potential transduction cascade from the chemoattractant receptor to the final effectors of cell swelling, including the sodium-proton antiporter NHE1 (SLC9A1), the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger 2 (AE2, i.e. SLC4A2), the gamma subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Kγ), and carbonic anhydrase II (CA2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These hits suggest that the cell swelling cascade begins with fMLP binding to the chemoattractant receptor FPR1, which activates PI3Kγ, which in turn activates NHE1 and AE2, the canonical regulatory volume increase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>). NHE1 and AE2 would, in this model, eject cytoplasmic protons and bicarbonate ions in exchange for extracellular sodium and chloride, respectively. CA2 catalyzes the production of protons and bicarbonate from CO2 and water and has previously been reported to bind the tail of NHE1, enhancing its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2006</xref>).

We, therefore, sought to replicate our knockout results through pharmacological inhibition of our screen hits in human primary neutrophils. We used BIX (iNHE1), a potent and selective inhibitor of NHE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2012</xref>), and Duvelisib (iPI3Kγ), a dual PI3Kδ/γ inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winkler et al., 2013</xref>).

This change could affect global biophysical parameters by decreasing cytoplasmic viscosity or increasing the diffusion of biochemical or cytoskeletal regulators of movement. Alternatively, local net water influx could collaborate with the actin polymerization machinery in facilitating the extension of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitchison et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">García-Arcos et al., 2022</xref>). The regulatory volume components identified here are ubiquitously expressed, so it is possible that they also facilitate chemoattractant-induced migration in other contexts. NHE1-dependent swelling has been observed in dendritic cells responding to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rotte et al., 2010</xref>), and NHE1 inhibition slows microglial chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). NHE1’s role in migration and metastasis is well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denker and Barber, 2002</xref>), but whether it plays an active role or merely passively maintains the cytoplasmic pH is still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayashi et al., 2008</xref>). Our experiments indicate that NHE1’s active role in the cell swelling program is critical to the potentiation of migration. The other constituents of our chemoattractant-induced cell swelling program have also been implicated in cell migration. AE2 plays a role in murine osteoclast spreading and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coury et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, carbonic anhydrases have been implicated in enhancing NHE1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2006</xref>) and facilitating migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Svastova et al., 2012</xref>), and PI3K isoforms have a well-appreciated role in migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferguson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Devreotes and Horwitz, 2015</xref>). Systematic investigation of this chemoattractant-induced cell swelling network could reveal a general role for water influx in potentiating animal cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Medias and inhibitors</title><p>For all imaging experiments, imaging media was made with Phenol Red-free Leibovitz’s L-15 media (Gibco #21083027) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and filtered with a 0.22 um Steriflip filter (MilliporeSigma #SCGP00525).

Briefly, 10:1 (w/w) PDMS elastomer base and crosslinker (Momentive #RTV615-1P) were thoroughly mixed, poured into the FxM mold, and degassed under a vacuum for 1 hr. The PDMS was then baked at 80 °C for 2 hr and removed from the mold. The day prior to experiments, the molded PDMS was cut with a scalpel to form three lane ‘chips’ and the inlet and outlet holes were created using a 0.5 mm punch. The chips and 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes (Willco Wells #HBST-3522) were then plasma cleaned for 30 s, and chips were gently pressed down onto the glass to form a watertight seal. A good seal was verified visually by the refractive index change upon glass/PDMS contact. The chips were then baked at 80 °C for 10 min to ensure thorough bonding. The chips were then quickly coated with 100 µg/mL human fibronectin (Sigma #SLCL0793) diluted in PBS and injected using a pipette tip. Coating was allowed to proceed for 30 min at RT before the chamber was flushed with imaging media. The chips were then submerged in PBS and allowed to incubate with L15 +0.2% BSA overnight at 4 °C.</p><p>On the day of the experiment, pre-prepared microfluidic chips were allowed to warm up at RT. Human primary neutrophils were gently pipetted up and down to resuspend if they had settled and spun down at 200 × g for 4 min. The cell pellet was very slowly resuspended in imaging media to achieve a cellular concentration of 60 million per mL. The cells were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at RT. This step helped reduce gas production by the cells that caused problematic laminar flows in our chips. The lanes of the chip were flushed with the corresponding final media. The cells were gently mixed with a 2 x solution such that the final concentrations were 0.5 mg/mL Alexa Fluor 647-tagged 10,000 MW dextran (Invitrogen #D22914), 200 nM caged fMLP (NEP), and 30 million per mL cells in imaging media.

The refractive index of both solutions was determined with a MA871 refractometer (Milwaukee Instruments) as 1.3419 and 1.3467, respectively. Given that the density is linearly related to the refractive index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) the solutions have densities of 1.045 g/mL and 1.074 g/mL, respectively. For the chemoattractant-condition, 20 nM fMLP (Sigma) was added. A linear gradient mixer was attached to an Auto Densi-Flow (Labconco) gradient fractionator and used to dispense gradients into 14 mL round bottom tubes (Falcon #352041).</p><p>For each gradient, approximately 5 million dHL-60s were spun down at 200 × g for 4 min and resuspended in 1 mL of 1 x mHBSS.

For mixed populations, the two cell types were spun down and labeled separately with either Calcein-AM or Calcein Red-Orange-AM and then mixed together. The cells were layered gently on top of the gradient and spun at 250 × g for 1 hr.

A 2 x volume of blank media was added to each well to reduce the density, and then the plates were spun in the centrifuge at 250 × g to assist in the settling of the cells on the glass.

Briefly, each well was coated with 20 µg/mL Retronectin stock solution diluted in DPBS for 2 hr and then blocked with 2% BSA (w/v) in PBS for 30 min and washed with PBS. 2 mL of 1 million/mL Cas9-BFP HL-60s were added to each well of four plates (48 million cells total) and 30 uL of concentrated Guide-it library lentivirus was added to each well. Using Lenti GoStix (Takara), we estimated that this corresponds to 8 × 10<sup>6</sup> IFUs per well. The plates were spun at 1000 × g for 30 mins, and then 1 mL of R10 was added gently. This was followed by another dilution with 2 mL of the same media after 24 hr. 48 hr post spinoculation, the cells were spun down at 200 × g and resuspended in R10. The cells were then sorted for mCherry-positive cells (cutoff set at 99.9th percentile of the untransduced cell population’s mCherry signal) using a FACSAria 3 cell sorter (BD). We observed 4% of cells with a mCherry positive signal, equivalent to a MOI of 0.04. This gives a minimum coverage of 6–24 x of the library at transduction; post-sequencing Monte Carlo simulations suggest a minimum coverage of 12 x.

The specificity and quality of amplification for each sample was validated using a TapeStation 4200 (Agilent), and the precise DNA concentration was determined using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers’ instructions.

The third bin was the most dense bin, so genes over-represented in this bin versus the other two were likely interfering with the swelling process.

The combined fold change for each gene was then computed by taking the MAGeCK ‘alphamedian’ log fold change (either positive or negative) that was most divergent.

The primary reason for FxM dataset exclusion was the occasional presence of strong laminar flows, preventing cell adhesion and migration, due to technical limitations with the design of the microfluidic chip.

I.e., actin is expected to play a role in regulating cell volume increase. Did the authors perform any experiments with LatA? What was seen there? Do cells still migrate with LatA, or is a different interplay seen? The role of PI3K is interesting, and maybe somewhat related to actin. But this may be a different line of inquiry for the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we could have done a better job explicitly investigating the role of actin dynamics in volume changes. Towards this end, by using Latrunculin B to depolymerize actin, we find that the volume increase in suspension is not affected (Figure 1 – supplemental figure 2A). In our FxM single cell volume measurements of adherent cells, we similarly observed unhindered swelling following latrunculin treatment. These data indicate that actin is dispensable for chemoattractant-induced cell swelling (Figure 1 – supplemental figure 2B) . There was a minor apparent reduction in the final volume reached with the Latrunculin-treated cells as measured by FxM, but this likely reflects minor uptake of the excluded dye following Latrunculin treatment rather than an actual change in final volume. This conclusion is reinforced by the change in 2D footprint area being well modeled by the 2D projection of an isotropically expanding sphere (Figure 1 – supplemental figure 2C) . Latrunculin treatment completely abolishes migration, as is expected for unconfined migration on fibronectin (Figure 1 – supplemental figure 2D-E) . The second Reviewer also wanted us to dig deeper on the role of PI3K-gamma, so we expanded our analysis of this hit (Figure 3 – supplemental figure 1B-D; Figure 4 – supplemental figure 1D-G) .</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Chemoattractant-induced swelling, but not motility, is independent of actin polymerization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Human primary neutrophils were incubated with DMSO or Latrunculin B, activated with 20 nM fMLP, and then volume responses were measured using electronic sizing via a Coulter counter.

To this end, we compared the volume response of human primary neutrophils to chemoattractant addition for Latrunculin B treated cells versus DMSO controls in suspension and show that there is no difference in swelling (Figure 1 – supplemental figure 2A) .

We have also included the requested footprint area changes in the Latrunculin treated cells as compared to controls (Figure 1 – supplemental figure 2C) .

We take advantage of the fact that we can inhibit cell swelling without inhibiting spreading to investigate the specific role of swelling on migration ( Figure 4) . Conversely, cell spreading on a substrate is not required for chemoattractant-induced cell swelling, as chemoattractant-induced swelling occurs in latrunculin-treated cells (Figure 1 – supplemental figure 2A-C) . However, these latrunculin-treated cells are not able to migrate, at least not in the context studied here (Figure 1 – supplemental figure 2 D-E) . Cell spreading and swelling are likely both critical contributors to neutrophil motility, but their relative importance is dependent on the migratory context. The single cell volume fluctuation analysis indicates that migration-associated spreading and shape changes have large impacts on cell volume ( Figure 1 F) . These fluctuations are asynchronous, obscuring their observation at the population level, but the single cell traces clearly demonstrate them and their correlation with movement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>( 5) Volume fluctuations associated with motility were impacted by NHE1 inhibition at the baselines, what about PI3K inhibitions?

(<bold>A</bold>) Control cells show a large increase in movement upon uncaging, (<bold>B</bold>) NHE1 inhibited cells also initiate movement but to a lesser degree, (<bold>C</bold>) hypo-osmotic shock rescues the NHE1 motility defect. (<bold>D</bold>) PI3Kγ leads to a large fraction of cells failing to initiate movement. (<bold>E</bold>) PI3Kγ inhibition showed near complete blockage of the chemoattractant-induced motility increase in primary human neutrophils. (<bold>F</bold>) Control neutrophils (blue) show an increased angular alignment upon stimulation as their motility becomes directional. NHE1-inhibition (gold, iNHE1) has very little effect on this process, while PI3Kγ inhibition (green) leads to a reduction in this alignment at the population level. (<bold>G</bold>) For the PI3Kγ inhibited cells that start migrating, the migration-induced volume fluctuations are comparable to iNHE1 and control cells. The top panel shows the track of a representative migrating PI3Kγ inhibited cell and the bottom panel, its corresponding volume normalized to the pre-stimulation volume. The scale bar is 50 microns.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90551-sa3-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
