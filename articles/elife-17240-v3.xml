mechanisms whereby chemical ligands impact on TRP channel gating are poorly understood. Here we show that AITC (allyl isothiocyanate; mustard oil) and menthol represent two distinct types of ligands at the mammalian cold sensor TRPM8. Kinetic analysis of channel gating revealed that AITC acts by destabilizing the closed channel, whereas menthol stabilizes the open channel, relative to the transition state. Based on these differences, we classify agonists as either type I (menthol-like) or type II (AITC-like), and provide a kinetic model that faithfully reproduces their differential effects. We further demonstrate that type I and type II agonists have a distinct impact on TRPM8 currents and TRPM8-mediated calcium signals in excitable cells. These findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding the differential actions of TRP channel ligands, with important ramifications for TRP channel structure-function analysis and pharmacology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17240.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17240.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17240.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sensory neurons in our skin detect cues from the environment – such as temperature and touch – and pass the information onto other cells in the nervous system. A protein called TRPM8 in sensory neurons is responsible for our ability to detect cool temperatures. TRPM8 sits in the membrane that surrounds the cell and forms a channel that can allow sodium and calcium ions to enter the cell. Cold temperatures activate TRPM8, which opens the channel and triggers electrical activity in the sensory neurons.</p><p>Chemicals that cause a cold sensation – such as menthol, the refreshing substance found in mint plants – can also open the TRPM8 channel. Janssens, Gees, Toth et al. investigated how menthol, and another natural compound called mustard oil, influence the opening of TRPM8. The experiments show that menthol and mustard oil both stimulate sensory neurons by opening the TRPM8 ion channel, but using different mechanisms. Mustard oil forces the channel to open faster than it normally would, whereas menthol prevents the channel from closing. Further experiments show that these mechanisms explain why some compounds stimulate sensory neurons more strongly than others.</p><p>The findings of Janssens, Gees, Toth et al. will help to understand how chemicals act on this class of ion channels, and how this affects the roles of the ion channels in cells. Altering the activity of TRPM8 and related ion channels may help to reduce pain in humans so a future challenge is to use these new insights to develop drugs that target these channels more efficiently.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17240.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17240.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>TRP channels</kwd><kwd>ligand-gated ion channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004497</institution-id><institution>Onderzoeksraad, KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PF-TRPLe</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vennekens</surname><given-names>Rudi</given-names></name><name><surname>Voets</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002749</institution-id><institution>Federaal Wetenschapsbeleid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IUAP P7/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vennekens</surname><given-names>Rudi</given-names></name><name><surname>Talavera</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name><name><surname>Voets</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0565.07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voets</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voets</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hercules Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AKUL-029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voets</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two natural cooling agents activate the cold-activated channel TRPM8 via two opposite mechanisms, evoking distinct electrical responses in cold-sensitive neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons of the somatosensory system act as individually tuned sensory cells that convert specific thermal, mechanical and/or chemical stimuli into electrical signals, which are then conveyed to the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vriens et al., 2014</xref>). Within the somatosensory system, several members of the TRP superfamily of cation channels act as polymodal molecular sensors of both temperature, and a variety of endogenous and exogenous chemicals, including a plethora of plant-derived compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clapham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tominaga et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Voets et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vriens et al., 2014</xref>). Chemical activation of TRP channels in nerve endings of trigeminal or dorsal root ganglion neurons is generally believed to underlie typical chemesthetic sensations evoked by such plant-derived substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bandell et al., 2007</xref>), such as the burning heat evoked by capsaicin (the pungent substance in hot peppers), which acts as a selective agonist of the heat-activated TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>), and the cool sensation evoked by menthol (the cooling compound in mint plants), due to activation of the cold sensor TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKemy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peier et al., 2002</xref>). Such TRP channel ligands are present in widely used foodstuffs and drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nilius and Appendino, 2013</xref>), and are extensively used as pharmacological tools to study somatosensation and/or TRP channel function in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Julius, 2013</xref>). Yet, very little is known about the molecular and biophysical mechanisms of action of the various TRP channel ligands.</p><p>We studied the agonist effects of AITC, also known as mustard oil, a pungent organosulphur compound derived from <italic>Brassica</italic> plants. AITC is responsible for the characteristic oral sensations that one experiences upon eating Dijon mustard or wasabi, which contain between 5–30 mM of AITC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Uematsu et al., 2002</xref>). Whereas earlier work has firmly established that AITC activates TRPA1 and TRPV1 in nociceptor neurons, approximately 10% of dorsal root ganglion neurons remained AITC-responsive after combined genetic deletion these two TRP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bautista et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everaerts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jordt et al., 2004</xref>). In this work we show that AITC excites this subset of somatosensory neurons via direct activation of TRPM8. Interestingly, a detailed biophysical analysis revealed that AITC activates TRPM8 by inducing a relative destabilization of the closed conformation relative to the transition state. This mode of action is fundamentally different from that of other known TRPM8 agonists such as menthol, which stabilize the open conformation relative to the transition state. Based on these results, we propose to classify TRPM8 agonists as either type I (menthol-like) or type II (AITC-like), and provide a kinetic model that accurately describes the differential actions of the two agonist types on channel gating kinetics. Finally, we illustrate that the two agonist types have a distinct impact on TRPM8-mediated currents and calcium signals in excitable cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRPM8-dependent responses to AITC in sensory neurons</title><p>To investigate the origin of TRPV1- and TRPA1-independent AITC responses, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons isolated from TRPV1/TRPA1 double knockout mice.

At room temperature, TRPM8 exhibits substantial activity, which can be recorded as an outwardly rectifying current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Application of AITC at concentrations ≥300 μM caused a rapid and reversible increase in TRPM8 current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The amplitude of the response increased with AITC concentration, with relatively stronger effects at negative voltages, but did not saturate at the highest concentration tested (10 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). At 3 and 10 mM AITC, activation was followed by a gradual decay of TRPM8 current, reducing current amplitude to levels below the basal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Following washout of 3 or 10 mM AITC after prolonged exposure, we observed a rapid initial decrease in current followed by a gradual restoration of the current to the basal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that the agonistic effect of AITC reverses more rapidly than the inhibitory effect. Rapid and reversible current responses to AITC were also observed in cell-free inside-out patches from human TRPM8-expressing HEK293 cells, indicating that the effect of AITC on TRPM8 is membrane-delimited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17240.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>AITC activates human TRPM8.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of whole-cell currents at +100 and −80 mV in HEK293 cells expressing human TRPM8, upon stimulation with the indicated concentrations of AITC.

To test whether AITC-induced activation of TRPM8 also involves rapid translocation of the channel towards the plasma membrane, we expressed human TRPM8 coupled with mCherry at its C terminus (TRPM8-mCherry), and performed total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to monitor potential AITC-induced transport of TRPM8 towards the plasma membrane. We have recently shown that TRPM8-mCherry is fully functional, and can be used to track cellular TRPM8 transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>, application of 3 mM AITC had no detectable effect on the TRPM8-mCherry fluorescence in the close vicinity of the plasma membrane. mCherry fluorescence amounted to 99 ± 1% and 102 ± 2% of the pre-AITC level after 5 and 50 s of AITC application, respectively. Since the onset of current activation by AITC was very rapid, with maximal current achieved within ~2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>), we can exclude a significant contribution of trafficking to the acute agonistic effect of AITC on TRPM8.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Distinct effects of AITC and menthol on gating kinetics</title><p>To investigate the mechanism of the agonistic effect of AITC in more detail, we recorded TRPM8 currents during voltage steps ranging from −140 to +220 mV, both in control conditions and immediately upon application of AITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Analysis of the steady-state conductances revealed that AITC has little or no effect on the maximal conductance at strongly depolarizing potentials, but shifts the voltage-dependent activation curves towards more negative voltages in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).

In line with earlier work, we found that in the absence of ligands the time courses at +120 and −80 mV were generally well fitted by a mono-exponential function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), yielding the time constants of current relaxation at both potentials (τ<sub>+120 mV</sub> and τ<sub>−80 mV</sub>). In the presence of 3 mM AITC, the time courses remained well fitted by a mono-exponential function, and the accelerated kinetics were reflected in a reduction of τ<sub>+120 mV</sub> compared to control, whereas τ<sub>−80 mV</sub> was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B,E</xref>). In contrast, the relaxation kinetics in the presence of 30 μM menthol were consistently slower than in control and were no longer mono-exponential: at least two exponential terms were required to accurately describe the current time course at +120 (τ<sub>+120 mV,fast</sub> and τ<sub>+120 mV,slow</sub>) and −80 mV (τ<sub>−80 mV,fast</sub> and τ<sub>−80 mV,slow</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B,F</xref>). These distinct effects of AITC and menthol on the current relaxation kinetics of TRPM8 were observed over a broad concentration range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). Other known TRPM8 agonists, including thymol, icilin, and linalool, act in a similar manner as menthol, slowing down the kinetics of activation and deactivation, albeit less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Defining Type I and Type II agonists</title><p>Based on these results, we propose that TRPM8 agonists be classified into two types based on their effect on the gating kinetics: Type I (menthol-like) agonists induce a slowing of the gating kinetics, which is most prominently observed as slowly deactivating tail currents following repolarization, whereas Type II (AITC-like) agonists cause an acceleration of the kinetics of channel activation upon depolarization, with little or no effect on the kinetics of deactivating tail currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The differential effects of the two ligand types on the gating kinetics suggest that they act on different conformational states of the channel during the gating process. In particular, the characteristic slowly decaying tail currents upon repolarization in the presence of menthol indicate that menthol impedes voltage-dependent channel deactivation, which points at a stabilization of the channel in an open conformation. Oppositely, the faster current relaxation upon depolarization in the presence of AITC indicates that AITC accelerates voltage-dependent channel activation, which points at a destabilization of the channel in a closed conformation.</p><p>To further pinpoint the mechanistic basis of different effects of Type I and Type II agonists on channel gating kinetics, we built on a previously described voltage-dependent Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model that was initially developed to describe the concerted actions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage on the gating of large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated potassium (BK) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox et al., 1997</xref>). We have shown earlier that this model can accurately describe the effect of menthol, voltage and temperature on steady-state TRPM8 currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssens and Voets, 2011</xref>). Moreover, based on analysis of channel chimeras with different combinations of wild type and mutated menthol binding sites, it was found that a single TRPM8 channel can bind up to four ligand molecules, each subunit having and ligand binding site with an affinity K<sub>d</sub> (in the closed state), and that every bound ligand shifts the equilibrium between the closed and open channel by a similar extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssens and Voets, 2011</xref>). The energetic effect of ligand binding can be quantified as ΔΔG<sub>ligand</sub>, which represents the change of the difference in Gibbs free energy between the closed and open state of the channel (ΔG) upon binding of one ligand molecule to one of the four subunits. In the case of an agonist, ΔΔG<sub>ligand</sub> &lt; 0, which implies that the open state becomes more stable relative to the closed state. As illustrated by the energy diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, a negative ΔΔG<sub>ligand</sub> can be the result of a ligand-induced relative stabilization of the open state, destabilization of the closed state, or a combination of both, taking the transition state as the reference. In the case of a relative stabilization of the open state, the energy barrier for the transition from open to closed will become higher, which would lead to slower closing rates, as seen with the Type I agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Oppositely, relative destabilization of the closed state will reduce the energy barrier for the transition from closed to open, which would be reflected in faster opening rates, as seen with the Type II agonist AITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17240.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Type I (menthol-like) versus Type II (AITC-like) TRPM8 agonists.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (<italic>left</italic>) Energy diagram for the transition between the closed and open channel conformation in a non-liganded channel.

Importantly, we obtained excellent fits to the experimental data when we set fixed that menthol binding acts exclusively by stabilization the open state, while AITC acts by destabilization of the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Model parameters obtained from the fits are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Gratifyingly, the model accurately predicts the concentration-dependent effects of AITC and menthol on TRPM8, including the mono-exponential time constants in the presence of different AITC concentrations, as well as the bi-exponential relaxation kinetics in the presence of menthol, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In line with the above, application of 50 μM menthol results in slower activation and deactivation kinetics, due to the stabilization of the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Addition of 3 mM AITC in the continued presence of menthol resulted in faster activation kinetics, without affecting the time course of deactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results are in line with the predictions of the MWC model, assuming that Type I and Type II agonists can act simultaneously and independently, resulting in both stabilization of the open and destabilization of the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Type I versus Type II agonists: effect during action potentials</title><p>In the context of a sensory neuron, activation of ion channels such as TRPM8 causes influx of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which depolarizes the membrane and, when the threshold is reached, causes action potential generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vriens et al., 2014</xref>). The differential effects of Type I and Type II agonists on the gating kinetics of TRPM8 suggest that they may have distinct effects on TRPM8-mediated currents and calcium signals during rapid neuronal action potentials. To investigate this possibility, we measured TRPM8 currents evoked by voltage waveforms mimicking action potentials in sensory neurons in the presence of AITC (3 mM) or menthol (30 µM). Note that, at a physiological holding potential of −60 mV, these concentrations resulted in comparable steady-state inward current amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In response to the action potential waveforms, the current in the presence of AITC mainly manifested during the upstroke phase, and rapidly deactivates upon action potential repolarization. In comparison, in the presence of menthol, the peak outward current is smaller but a more prominent inward TRPM8 current is observed during the repolarization phase of the action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). These differential effects of AITC and menthol on TRPM8 currents during an action potential are fully in line with the predictions of the MWC model for type I versus Type II agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Since our results indicated substantial differences in charge influx during action potentials between Type I and Type II agonists, we expected that menthol and AITC may show differential efficacy in evoking Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in excitable <italic>versus</italic> non-excitable cells. To test this, we compared the relative responses to menthol and AITC in TRPM8-expressing mouse sensory neurons <italic>versus</italic> (non-excitable) HEK293 cells heterologously expressing TRPM8. For these latter experiments, we used HEK293 cells transiently expressing the mouse TRPM8 orthologue, and first tested current responses to AITC. Like its human orthologue, mouse TRPM8 was rapidly activated by AITC, and the difference in gating kinetics in the presence of AITC <italic>versus</italic> menthol was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, interestingly, AITC-induced current inhibition was much less pronounced in mouse TRPM8 compared to the human orthologue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>): at the end of a 60-s application of 3 mM AITC, mouse TRPM8 current amounted to 88 ± 6% (n = 8) of the peak current, compared to 21 ± 5% in the case of human TRPM8 (n = 7; p=0.00004). A further analysis of this species difference in AITC-induced inhibition is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>To specifically analyze TRPM8-mediated responses to AITC and menthol in mouse sensory neurons, we used TRPA1/TRPV1 double knockout mice, only examined cells that showed robust responses to both agonists, and controlled that these responses were fully inhibited in the presence of AMTB, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In these cells, we found that the amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients evoked by a 60-s-long applications of 3 mM AITC were on average ~30% smaller than those evoked by 30 µM menthol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,D</xref>). Likewise, the peak rate of calcium rise, which represents a measure for the maximal inward calcium current, was consistently smaller in response to AITC than to menthol in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,D</xref>). Interestingly, we observed an opposite potency of the same concentrations of menthol and AITC in HEK cells expressing mouse TRPM8: AITC evoked larger calcium increases and with a higher peak rate of calcium rise than did menthol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,D</xref>). Moreover, if action potential firing in the TRPA1/TRPV1-deficient sensory neurons was blocked using tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 μM), we found a similar ratio of AITC <italic>versus</italic> menthol responses as in HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>), with AITC being slightly more potent than menthol. Taken together, these data provide further support for the notion that, compared to Type II agonists (e.g. AITC), Type I agonists (e.g. menthol) are more potent in evoking calcium influx in excitable cells, due to enhanced calcium influx during the prolonged inward tail currents following action potentials. In cells that do not fire action potentials, rapid changes in membrane potential are not expected, and hence the kinetic differences between the two types of agonists will not affect calcium signals.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17240.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Differential effectiveness of Type I and Type II agonists in excitable versus non-excitable cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fura-2-based intracellular calcium measurements in mouse trigeminal neurons from TRPV1/TRPA1 double knockout mice showing increases in intracellular calcium in response to AITC (3 mM) and menthol (30 µM).

Activation of TRPM8 by cooling or by known agonists such as the natural compounds menthol, thymol and linalool, and the synthetic agonists such as icilin and halothane, is associated with a slowing of the kinetics of voltage-dependent channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vanden Abeele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voets et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Voets et al., 2007</xref>). This slowing of the gating kinetics can be directly explained by a stabilization of the open channel relative to the transition state, as we illustrated in this work for menthol and elsewhere for cooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voets et al., 2004</xref>). In clear contrast, activation of TRPM8 by AITC resulted in an acceleration of the kinetics of voltage-dependent gating, and we show here that this can be fully explained by a mechanism where AITC leads to a relative destabilization of the closed conformation relative to the transition state. Based thereon, we propose that TRPM8 agonists can be classified as either Type I, causing a relative stabilization the open state, or Type II, causing a relative destabilization the closed state, and we provide a kinetic voltage-dependent Monod-Wyman-Changeux-type model that faithfully reproduces their differential agonist effects. Such classification may also be extended to activating ligands of other voltage- and ligand-sensitive TRP channels. For instance, published current traces suggest that activation of TRPV1 by capsaicin or low pH is associated with faster activation time courses upon depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aneiros et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voets et al., 2004</xref>), classifying them as Type II ligands, whereas the activating effects of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) or lysophosphatidic acid are associated with slower activation and longer deactivating tails upon repolarization, classifying them a Type I agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nieto-Posadas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ufret-Vincenty et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The classification of activating ligands as either Type I or Type II is useful for several purposes. First, this information can provide important insights into ligand-induced structural rearrangements during channel gating, and may help interpreting ligand-bound channel structures. Indeed, our results indicate that Type II ligands such as AITC reduce the difference Gibbs free energy between the closed state and the transition state (ΔG<sup>α†</sup>), without affecting the difference Gibbs free energy between the open state and the transition state (ΔG<sup>β†</sup>). This suggests that the AITC-induced conformational change at its binding site occurs early in the gating process, prior to the main close-open transition. Oppositely, Type I ligands such as menthol cause an increase in ΔG<sup>β†</sup>, without affecting ΔG<sup>α†</sup>. This indicates that the menthol-induced conformational change at its binding sites occurs later than the main close-open transition. This analysis and interpretation is reminiscent of the rate-equilibrium free-energy relationship (REFER) approach, which has used to evaluate the effects of perturbations (e.g. ligands or mutations) on the equilibrium of reactions, including the gating of ion channels such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grosman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sorum et al., 2015</xref>). In REFER, the effect of a family of perturbations on channel gating is quantified using the φ-value, which is the slope of a plot of the logarithm of the opening rate (log α) versus the log of the gating equilibrium constant (log K<sub>eq</sub>), where K<sub>eq</sub> is the ratio of the opening (α) and closing (β) rate (K<sub>eq</sub> = α/β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbach, 2007</xref>). In the case of type I ligands, ligand binding affects the equilibrium solely by decreasing β, yielding φ = 0. Following the REFER theorem, this indicates late movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbach, 2007</xref>). Type II ligands affect the equilibrium entirely by affecting α, yielding φ = 1, indicating early movement. We also found that the effects of simultaneously applied menthol and AITC on channel gating are well described assuming independent binding and additive effects on the gating equilibria, which further supports the notion that type I and type II ligands act at distant binding sites with different timing for conformational changes.</p><p>Second, based on our kinetic fits, we obtained estimates for the on rates for ligand binding to TRPM8. For example, for menthol binding we obtained a k<sub>on</sub> of 0.55 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, which is well below the diffusion-limited rate (&gt;100 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>), and also one order of magnitude or more lower than binding rates for ligands to synaptic ligand-gated channels, such as the ionotropic receptors for glutamate (k<sub>on</sub>≈ 5 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clements and Westbrook, 1991</xref>), ATP (k<sub>on</sub>≈ 12 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bean, 1990</xref>) or acetylcholine (k<sub>on</sub>≈ 60 μM<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sine et al., 1990</xref>). The relatively slow ligand equilibration kinetics for menthol are in line with the distinct structural properties of ligand binding sites in TRP channels compared to these classical ionotropic receptors. Indeed, whereas binding sites for glutamate, ATP and acetylcholine are located extracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hille, 2001</xref>), directly accessible from the aqueous phase, the binding site for menthol is located in a hydrophobic domain in between the transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Voets et al., 2007</xref>). The observation that current relaxation time courses of TRPM8 in the presence of menthol become multi-exponential is then a direct consequence of the slow equilibration rate of menthol with its binding site in comparison to the transition rates between closed and open channel conformations.</p><p>Finally, we showed that differential effect on voltage-dependent gating of Type I and II agonists is reflected in distinctive TRP channel-mediated currents during rapid changes in membrane voltage, for instance during an action potential in a sensory neuron. Indeed, as predicted by our model, the AITC-induced TRPM8 current during a typical action potential waveform mainly manifest during the upstroke phase, and rapidly deactivates upon action potential repolarization. In contrast, an equipotent concentration of menthol (i.e. a concentration of menthol provoking a similar steady-state current) results in a less outward current but more prominent activation of inward TRPM8 current during the repolarization phase following an action potential, and thus leads to more Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via TRPM8. In line herewith, we found that inhibiting action potential firing using TTX has a more profound effect on menthol-induced responses than on AITC-induced responses in sensory neurons. These findings illustrate the importance of evaluating the mode of action of ligands on voltage-dependent TRP channels, especially when extrapolating results from non-excitable heterologous expression systems to physiological effects in excitable cells such as neurons, cardiomyocytes or pancreatic beta cells.</p><p>Using the voltage-dependent Monod-Wyman-Changeux-type model, we assumed that for any number of bound ligands the transition between closed and open channel conformation is a one-step process, determined by forward and backward rates α<sub>i</sub> and β<sub>i</sub>. Whereas this assumption is in line with the mono-exponential kinetics we generally observed in our experiments in the absence of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voets et al., 2004</xref>), it is probably a simplification of the full gating intricacies of TRPM8, and models with one or more closed-closed transitions preceding channel opening have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Raddatz et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, even when using such more complex models, the ligands’ effects on TRPM8 gating kinetics can only be explained assuming that Type II ligands cause acceleration of the gating transition(s) towards the open state, whereas Type I ligands slow down the backward rate(s) from the open state.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that TRPM8 underlies the residual TRPA1- and TRPV1-independent responses to AITC in mouse sensory neurons. Under our experimental conditions, activation of TRPM8 by AITC only occurred in the high micromolar to millimolar concentration range. As such, TRPM8 is about two orders of magnitude less sensitive to AITC than TRPA1, for which concentrations for half-maximal activation of 5–50 µM have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everaerts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jordt et al., 2004</xref>), but comparable to TRPV1, for which a concentration for half-maximal activation of 3 mM was found at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everaerts et al., 2011</xref>). These findings are in line with in vitro experiments in sensory neurons, showing that AITC concentrations ≤100 µM evoke responses that are strictly TRPA1-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bautista et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everaerts et al., 2011</xref>), whereas higher concentrations can also evoke TRPA1-independent responses mediated by TRPV1 or TRPM8. AITC is extensively used in in vivo experiments to induce pain and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Julius, 2013</xref>). In such assays, experimental solutions that are injected or topically applied typically contain AITC at concentrations between 10 and 100 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bautista et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caterina et al., 2000</xref>). Whereas earlier studies have clearly shown that pain and inflammatory responses under such experimental conditions are largely mediated by TRPA1 and TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bautista et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everaerts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwan et al., 2006</xref>), our present results suggest that also TRPM8-positive sensory nerve endings may become activated at these AITC doses. Since activation of TRPM8-expressing neurons can cause analgesia in animal models of acute and chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Proudfoot et al., 2006</xref>), the effects of AITC on TRPM8 that we describe here need to be taken into account when using AITC as a proalgesic and/or proinflammatory agent. TRPM8 may contribute to the complex psychophysical effects that one experiences upon eating spices containing millimolar concentrations of AITC such as mustard or wasabi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nilius and Appendino, 2013</xref>). In line herewith, a transient increase in cold sensitivity was observed upon application of 100 mM AITC on the tongue of human volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 2008</xref>). Although speculative, this may correlate with the transient activation followed by channel inhibition that we observed in human TRPM8.</p><p>In voltage-gated ion Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, ligand modulators have since decades been classified based on their distinct state-dependent effects on channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hille, 2001</xref>), and this mechanistic insight has been key to understanding their physiological impact in for instance neurons and cardiac cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sack and Sum, 2015</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of two types of agonists with distinct state-dependent effects for a member of the TRP superfamily, the cold-sensitive TRPM8, and provide a paradigm for their differential effects in sensory neurons. We argue that establishing the state-dependent mode of action of (ant)agonists of this and other TRP channels will be essential to clarify their physiological actions as well as to understand their impact on conformational changes in the channel molecule.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and transfection</title><p>HEK293 were grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 4 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 100 U ml<sup>–1</sup> penicillin and 100 μg ml<sup>–1</sup> streptomycin at 37°C in a humidity controlled incubator with 10% CO<sub>2</sub>.

We further assumed that the rate of ligand binding to the open and closed state of the channel were identical, whereas the rate of ligand unbinding from the closed state was constrained by detailed balance. The <italic>integrateODE</italic> operation was used to model TRPM8 currents during voltage steps or action potential waveforms, using mean parameters obtained from the fits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data analysis was performed using Origin 9.0 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA). Group data are presented as mean ± SEM from <italic>n</italic> cells. Comparison between two groups was done using Student’s unpaired or paired test, as indicated. No explicit power analysis was performed prior to the experiments to determine sample size, since we had no means to reliably estimate the size and variability of the effects of the ligands on parameters of TRPM8 gating. For patch-clamp experiments on HEK cells, typically 5–10 cells were measured for each condition, thereby limiting the SEM to ≤20% of the mean value for the relevant parameters. For the calcium imaging experiments on mouse TG neurons, a maximal number of neurons from nine mice isolated on 5 independent days were analyzed. Since highly significant results were obtained from this set of experiments, no further animals were sacrificed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge all members of the Laboratory of Ion Channel Research for helpful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #1), Jorg Grandl (Reviewer #2) and László Csanády (Reviewer #3), and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This comprehensive study compares the effects of menthol and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) on gating of TRPM8 channels. The effects of the two agonists are compared using a broad range of experimental approaches, including kinetic analysis of current responses to voltage steps, analysis of charge flow during action potentials evoked by voltage clamp, and observation of time courses of intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in excitable and non-excitable cells. The key findings are that (i) AITC and menthol responses are strictly correlated in TRPV1/TRPA1-deficient neurons suggesting TRPM8 as a novel AITC target, (ii) AITC induces rapid activation followed by slow inactivation of heterologously overexpressed TRPM8, (iii) AITC-induced activation is rapidly, whereas inactivation is slowly reversible, (iv) menthol and AITC activate TRPM8 through distinct kinetic mechanisms, (v) these differential kinetic mechanisms of the two agonists result in differential rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, depending on the cell type (excitable vs. non-excitable).</p><p>The most important novel aspect of the study is the detailed analysis of the kinetic mechanisms of menthol and AITC, interpreted in the framework of a Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) type mechanism, which integrates voltage-, and agonist-dependence of the channel. Exposure to AITC is shown to accelerate current relaxations in response to depolarizing, but not repolarizing, voltage steps. In contrast, menthol exposure slows current relaxations in response to voltage steps in both directions. Moreover, whereas current relaxation time courses in the presence of AITC remain reasonably monoexponential, they become multiexponential in the presence of menthol. The differential effects on relaxation rates are fully explained by assuming that AITC destabilizes the closed state, whereas menthol stabilizes the open state, with respect to the transition state. On the other hand, the mono- vs. multiexponential nature of the relaxation time courses are fully explained by assuming that the rates for binding/unbinding are rapid for AITC, but slow for menthol. These kinetic features allow the authors to define two classes (class I and II) of TRPM8 agonists.</p><p>Overall this is a beautiful study that promotes our understanding of the mechanisms of TRPM8 agonists. The experiments are well performed, and the analysis mostly adequate. The following requests aim to improve the clarity of the presentation.</p><p>Requested revisions:</p><p>1) It is stated several times that &quot;AITC acts by destabilizing the closed channel, whereas menthol stabilizes the open channel&quot; (Abstract; subsection “Defining Type I and Type II agonists”, first and second paragraphs; Discussion, second paragraph). It would be important to emphasize that these effects are understood by taking the transition state as a reference. E.g.: &quot;AITC destabilizes the closed state, whereas menthol stabilizes the open state, relative to the transition state&quot;. This clarification is essential, because it is much more common to take the closed state as a reference, and both ligands act by stabilizing the open state relative to the closed state.</p><p>2) Along the same lines, we don't think the following argument is valid: &quot;Type I ligands reduce the Gibbs free energy of the open state, which may facilitate obtaining stable channel protein in the open state for crystallography […]” In contrast, Type II ligands, which provoke a destabilization of the closed state, may be less prone to induce the formation of stable open channel-ligand complexes.&quot; Both types of ligands stabilize the open state relative to the closed state, i.e., they both increase the fraction of time the protein spends in the open state and so should similarly affect crystallography studies.</p><p>3) The finding that AITC binding selectively affects opening, while menthol binding selectively affects closing rate is interesting, and could be interpreted in terms of different <italic>φ</italic> values for the two binding sites. The <italic>φ</italic> value of a protein position reflects the relative timing of its movement upon pore opening, with large values reflecting early, small values late movement (Auerbach, 2007, J. Gen. Physiol. 13:543-546). The fact that AITC affects ΔG(T-C) but not ΔG(T-O) suggests that the AITC binding site has already reached its open-like conformation in the transition state, i.e., this region moves early during the opening conformational change (<italic>φ</italic> is large). In contrast, the fact that menthol affects ΔG(T-O) but not ΔG(T-C) suggests that the menthol binding site is still in its closed-like conformation in the transition state, i.e., this region moves late during opening (<italic>φ</italic> is small). By the way, relatively distant binding sites are also supported by the finding that the effects of simultaneously applied AITC and menthol are well described assuming independent binding and energetically additive effects.</p><p>4) The presentation of the modeling/fitting could be improved.</p><p>4.1) Using the Eyring prefactor <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T/h</italic> to compute ΔG<sup>α†</sup> and ΔG<sup>β†</sup> from the rates α<sub>0</sub> and β<sub>0</sub> is not adequate: it is generally believed that the prefactor for protein conformational transitions is much smaller than <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T/h</italic> (Auerbach, 2005; PNAS 102:87-92). In fact, computing the absolute values of these barrier heights is also not necessary: ΔΔG<sup>α†</sup> and ΔΔG<sup>β†</sup> values would suffice.</p><p>4.2) Table I should provide the full set of kinetic parameters, not (or not only) thermodynamic parameters: ΔΔG values could be expressed as fold changes in K<sub>eq</sub>, and α<sub>0</sub> and β<sub>0</sub> should be given instead of ΔG<sup>α†</sup> and ΔG<sup>β†</sup>. This would make it easier for the reader to follow the discussion on the models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> (or maybe print the rates onto those models?). Also, please specify how the rates for binding/unbinding in the closed state were handled during fitting: was k<sub>on,c</sub> assumed identical to k<sub>on,o</sub> with k<sub>off,c</sub> constrained by detailed balance, or was the ratio k<sub>on,c</sub>/k<sub>off,c</sub> constrained but the absolute values for both left free? In the latter case, please provide the fitted values in Table I.</p><p>4.3) For the global fitting please provide a concise summary with (i) a listing of all the parameters in the fit, (ii) the numbers and identities of fixed vs. free parameters, and (iii) the typical number of current traces fitted simultaneously.</p><p>5) The meaning of the slow and fast time constants plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> are unclear to us. The symbols we expect represent fit parameters obtained by fitting a double-exponential function to the current time courses. But we don't understand the statement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend): &quot;Solid lines in (E) and (F) represent model predictions&quot;. The model predicts – for both types of ligand – 9 exponential components for each current relaxation. Which of those 9 time constants are plotted? The ones with the largest fractional amplitudes? But those fractional amplitudes will depend on ligand concentration, so different components will become dominant at different ligand concentrations. All in all, it might be better to plot a single empirical parameter here (as in E), instead of two arbitrary time constants. E.g., the time constant of the best monoexponential fit (even if that fit is bad)? Or the half-time of the relaxations?</p><p>6) The differential calcium entry in sensory neurons and HEK cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is framed as arising from the ability of sensory neurons to fire action potentials. It would be cool to actually show this by blocking Na<sub>v</sub> channels with TTx and showing that they then behave like HEK cells. We leave it to the discretion of the authors because it would require a new experiment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17240.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Requested revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It is stated several times that &quot;AITC acts by destabilizing the closed channel, whereas menthol stabilizes the open channel&quot; (Abstract; subsection “Defining Type I and Type II agonists”, first and second paragraphs; Discussion, second paragraph).

We now include the undetermined transmission coefficient (κ) to the equations to indicate this. Moreover, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> we now replaced the ΔG values by actual forward and backward rates of the unliganded channel at 0 mV. More details on the fitting, including the numbers and identities of the free and fixed parameters are now provided in the Methods and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The meaning of the slow and fast time constants plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> are unclear to us.

E.g., the time constant of the best monoexponential fit (even if that fit is bad)? Or the half-time of the relaxations?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for not better explaining this figure. What we found is that, in the presence of menthol, both the experimental data and the modelled currents were excellently fitted by two exponentials. That the modeled currents are “pseudo-bi-exponential”, despite the fact that the model theoretically predicts 9 exponentials, can be attributed to (1) fractional amplitudes of several time constants being negligibly small, and (2) clustering of time constants around two main values. Thus, to obtain the solid lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, current traces during voltage steps as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref> were modeled for different menthol concentrations using the mean parameters of <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, and then fitted with a double-exponential function to obtain the fast and slow time constants. Fitting mono-exponential functions to the modeled (and experimental data) in the presence of menthol provides indeed relatively “bad” fits, but nevertheless provides a good concurrence between experimental and model data. This plot is now provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, along with fits &amp; residuals of experimental and modeled data using mono- and bi-exponential functions.</p><p><italic>6) The differential calcium entry in sensory neurons and HEK cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is framed as arising from the ability of sensory neurons to fire action potentials. It would be cool to actually show this by blocking Na<sub>v</sub> channels with TTx and showing that they then behave like HEK cells. We leave it to the discretion of the authors because it would require a new experiment.</italic></p><p>We thank the referees for this excellent suggestion, and now included new data in the presence of TTX. We found that TTX indeed reduces the responses to menthol relative to AITC, similar to the behavior in HEK cells. This is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
