the process and of the functionality of the new <italic>Insulin</italic>-expressing cells. To overcome the weak regenerative capacity of mammals, we used regeneration-prone zebrafish to study β-cells arising following destruction. We show that most new <italic>in</italic>s<italic>ulin</italic> cells differ from the original β-cells as they coexpress Somatostatin and Insulin. These bihormonal cells are abundant, functional and able to normalize glycemia. Their formation in response to β-cell destruction is fast, efficient, and age-independent. Bihormonal cells are transcriptionally close to a subset of δ-cells that we identified in control islets and that are characterized by the expression of <italic>somatostatin 1.1</italic> (<italic>sst1.1</italic>) and by genes essential for glucose-induced Insulin secretion in β-cells such as <italic>pdx1</italic>, s<italic>lc2a2</italic> and <italic>gck</italic>. We observed in vivo the conversion of monohormonal <italic>sst1.1-</italic>expressing cells to <italic>sst1.1+ ins</italic> + bihormonal cells following β-cell destruction. Our findings support the conclusion that <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells possess a pro-β identity enabling them to contribute to the neogenesis of Insulin-producing cells during regeneration. This work unveils that abundant and functional bihormonal cells benefit to diabetes recovery in zebrafish.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreas</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>somatostatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chilean National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), Becas Chile</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carril Pardo</surname><given-names>Claudio Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRIA PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Massoz</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Bergemann</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavergne</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Belgian Funds for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EoS Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dupont</surname><given-names>Marie A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bourdouxhe</surname><given-names>Jordane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Biomed Hub Technology Support</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavergne</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Belgian Funds for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peers</surname><given-names>Bernard</given-names></name><name><surname>Manfroid</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name><name><surname>Voz</surname><given-names>Marianne M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>30826052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dupont</surname><given-names>Marie A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bourdouxhe</surname><given-names>Jordane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chilean National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), Becas Chile</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>72170660</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carril Pardo</surname><given-names>Claudio Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund (Biomed Hub Technology Support)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2.2.1/996</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavergne</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Most regenerated cells after β-cell damage in zebrafish are Insulin+ Somatostatin+ bihormonal cells that are functional and able to restore glucose control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insulin-producing β-cells reside in pancreatic islets where they are intermingled with other endocrine cells such as α-cells, secreting glucagon (Gcg), and δ-cells secreting somatostatin (Sst). Elevation of extracellular glucose concentration triggers glucose uptake by β-cells through the glucose transporter GLUT2 (<italic>Slc2a2</italic>). Glucose is then metabolized to generate ATP which will trigger the closure of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel formed by Kir6.2 (<italic>Kcnj11</italic>) and SUR1 (<italic>Abcc8</italic>), membrane depolarization, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and release through exocytosis of insulin secretory granules into the blood. In mature β-cells, this process is further amplified by other molecules such as amino acids, fatty acids, hormones (incretins GLP-1, GIP), and neural factors (dopamine, adrenaline…) via the cAMP messenger. Dysfunction of these processes leads to impaired insulin secretion, chronic hyperglycemia, and diabetes. In Type 2 diabetes, chronic glucolipotoxic stress ultimately provokes β-cell failure and death. In Type 1 diabetes, on the other hand, the destruction of β-cells is mediated by autoimmune attack.</p><p>Human adult β-cells are quiescent and barely possess the capacity to compensate their destruction through increased proliferation. Alternative mechanisms inferred from studies in mice revealed the striking plasticity of other pancreatic endocrine cell types towards the β-cell phenotype. For example, Ins+ Gcg + bihormonal cells form after acute β-cell destruction mediated by transgenic expression of the diphteria toxin receptor (DTR) in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thorel et al., 2010</xref>). These cells derive from a small fraction of α-cells that switch on the β-cell markers Pdx1, Nkx6.1 and Ins through direct conversion, leading to restoration of about 10% of the β-cell mass after 10 months. As this process is quite slow and inefficient, adult DTR mice do not survive without injection of insulin during the first months after ablation. In contrast, at juvenile stages, β-cell neogenesis occurs from transdifferentiation of δ-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chera et al., 2014</xref>). In this case, δ-cells dedifferentiate, lose <italic>Sst</italic> expression, replicate and redifferentiate into β-cells. About 23% of the initial β-cell mass has recovered 4 months after ablation emphasising faster and more efficient improvement of glycemia than in adult mice. Very recently, a rare population of pancreatic polypeptide (Ppy)-expressing γ-cells has also been shown to display plasticity and to activate <italic>Ins</italic> expression in response to β-cell injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Perez-Frances et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, various pancreatic islet cells possess a remarkable plasticity yet the regeneration potential is generally limited in adult mammals.</p><p>In contrast to the limited regeneration capacity of adult mammals, zebrafish are notorious for their potent, spontaneous and rapid regeneration of β-cells from larval to adult stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Curado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaspre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghaye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ninov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pisharath and Parsons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ye et al., 2015</xref>). In zebrafish, α-cells transdifferentiate into Ins-expressing cells after β-cell destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ye et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, unlike mouse models in which regeneration via progenitors or precursors is debated, β-cell neogenesis is well recognised in zebrafish to involve regenerative processes from progenitor-like cells present in the ducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaspre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghaye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ninov et al., 2013</xref>). β-cell destruction is accomplished in zebrafish using a chemo-genetic system based on the transgenic expression of the bacterial nitroreductase (NTR) under the control of the <italic>ins</italic> promoter where cell death is induced by a nitroaromatic prodrug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Curado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pisharath and Parsons, 2009</xref>). In adults, after a huge rise of glycemia within 3 days, the pancreas is replenished with new β-cells in 2–3 weeks which correlates to a return to normoglycemia.</p><p>De novo formation of β-cells in order to repair damaged islets constitutes a promising therapeutic perspective for diabetic patients. However, new β-cells could show differences in their number and identity impacting on their activity. For example, the presence in mice of Gcg+ Ins + cells, although apparently functional, should be considered cautiously as inappropriate differentiation of β-cells and impaired maturation or identity are common shortcoming in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moin and Butler, 2019</xref> for review).</p><p>Using the larval and adult zebrafish as regeneration models, we investigated the identity of regenerated β-cells and discovered that most new <italic>in</italic>s-expressing cells are Ins + Sst1.1+ bihormonal cells. We identified a specific δ-cell subpopulation distinct from the previously identified zebrafish <italic>sst2</italic> δ-cells that is characterized by the expression of <italic>sst1.1</italic> and of several important β-cell features. The transcriptomic profile of bihormonal cells is also very close to the <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells, making them resemble β/δ hybrids. By in vivo imaging of larvae, we observed the appearance of <italic>ins</italic>-expressing bihormonal cells from monohormonal <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells early after β-cell ablation. We also provide evidence that pancreatic ducts contribute to the pool of bihormonal cells. Furthermore, bihormonal cells are abundant in the regenerated pancreas and able to normalize glycemia after a glucose challenge. Our findings show the importance of bihormonal cells in the spontaneous recovery of diabetic zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Most regenerated β-cells in adult zebrafish coexpress Ins and Sst</title><p>To characterize the new β-cells after regeneration, we used 6- to 10-month-old <italic>Tg(ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergemann et al., 2018</xref>) adult fish to first ablate β-cells. Basal blood glucose was monitored to evaluate ablation (3 days post treatment, dpt) and regeneration (20 dpt). As expected, fasting basal blood glucose dramatically raised at three dpt compared to CTL fish which reflected efficient ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). After 20 days, glycemia was impressively improved though still slightly above control values. A preliminary RNAseq experiment on mCherry+ cells isolated from the main islet of <italic>Tg(ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry</italic>) adult fish 2 months after ablation revealed strong expression of the <italic>sst1.1</italic> gene in regenerated β-cells just below <italic>ins</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>), thereby suggesting that regenerated β-cells are bihormonal. As blood glucose is nearly normalized after 20 days, we characterized these cells at this time point. Immunofluorescence on regenerated 20 dpt islets showed many Ins + cells that also displayed Sst immunolabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, control islets showed robust staining of the endogenous Ins and Sst hormones without appreciable overlap, thus demarcating monohormonal β- and δ-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next created a <italic>Tg(sst1.1:eGFP</italic>) reporter line driving GFP in <italic>sst1.1</italic>-expressing cells. This transgene was not active in β-cells of control islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to what was observed with the endogenous Sst and Ins proteins, regenerated 20 dpt islets of <italic>Tg(sst1.1:eGFP); Tg(ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry</italic>) fish contained many cells coexpressing GFP with mCherry, while GFP and mCherry-labeled distinct cells in control islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

To corroborate the cell cycle signature, we examined Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in the main islet of <italic>Tg(ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry)</italic> adult fish. In CTL islets, PCNA immunodetection was almost absent. In contrast, it was widely observed in mCherry+ cells at 20 dpt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Ducts also contribute to β-cell regeneration in the adult zebrafish, providing new β-cells to the main and secondary islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaspre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghaye et al., 2015</xref>). The striking observation that the vast majority of new <italic>ins</italic>-expressing cells are bihormonal in the entire pancreas raises the hypothesis that duct-derived Ins + cells also express Sst1.1. To explore this possibility, we used larvae, a well-established model to study β-cell regeneration from the ducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ninov et al., 2013</xref>). In this model, destruction of β-cells not only induces their regeneration in the main islet but also activates duct-associated progenitors to produce more β-cells. We first determined the time course of duct-derived β and <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cell formation during normal development and established that they start to differentiate between 7 and 10 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we used the <italic>Tg(nkx6.1:eGFP); Tg(ins:NTR-P2A-mCherry)</italic> line, where <italic>nkx6.1</italic> is a marker of pancreatic ducts and of duct-associated progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghaye et al., 2015</xref>), to perform the ablation of β-cells at 3 dpf, that is before the normal differentiation of β and <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells in the tail. Thus, potential Ins + Sst1.1+ bihormonal cells appearing in the tail after ablation are expected to originate from the ducts and not from secondary β or <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells. At 17 dpf, mCherry and Sst immunodetection was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>).

Here, we show that, in zebrafish, a large and predominant population of Ins + Sst1.1+ bihormonal cells arise after β-cell destruction, confers glucose responsiveness and restores blood glucose homeostasis. Moreover, contrasting with the age-dependent and limited β-cell neogenesis of mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Perez-Frances et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thorel et al., 2010</xref>), bihormonal cell formation in zebrafish is fast and efficient and occurs all along life.</p><p>Our study provides an in-depth characterization of the zebrafish <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cell subpopulation. The existence of two distinct δ-cell subpopulations corroborates a recent report of two clusters of δ<italic>-</italic>cells detected by single cell RNAseq, one expressing <italic>sst2/sst1.2</italic> and the other <italic>sst1.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spanjaard et al., 2018</xref>). Although our β-cell lineage tracing experiment in larvae indicates that a subset of bihormonal cells derive from pre-existing β-cells, the majority have a non-β origin. Here, we present evidences that bihormonal cells originate from <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells and duct cells. In contrast to <italic>sst2</italic> δ-cells which have previously been excluded as a source of new Ins-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ye et al., 2015</xref>), our results strongly suggest that <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells rapidly adapt to the loss of β-cells and activate <italic>ins</italic> expression. First, pre-existing <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells already express many genes essential for β-cells such as <italic>pdx1, ucn3l</italic> and the glucose transporter <italic>slc2a2</italic> (Glut2). Second, <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells and bihormonal cells have a very close transcriptomic profile meaning that only minor changes in <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells would generate bihormonal cells. Third, <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells express the basic molecular machinery for glucose-sensing, glucose- and calcium-dependent stimulation of Insulin secretion and blood glucose control. Fourth, the appearance of bihormonal cells during regeneration concurs with a reduction of the <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cell mass. Finally, in vivo imaging revealed the activation of <italic>ins</italic> expression in <italic>sst1.1</italic> δcells early after ablation. All these observations support the conclusion that <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells constitute a distinct zebrafish δ-cell population expressing β-cell features enabling them to rapidly reprogram to bihormonal cells by activating <italic>ins</italic> expression and engender functional surrogate β-cells. Importantly, during the preparation of our manuscript, Singh et al. also identified <italic>sst1.1+ ins</italic> + δ/β hybrid cells in zebrafish by scRNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). They also proposed the <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells as possible cellular origin after β-cell ablation, thereby consolidating our findings. A difference between our two studies, however, is that they detected some hybrid Sst1.1+ Ins + cells in control islets while we could not clearly identify them, probably due to different technical approaches.</p><p>The fact that the bihormonal cell population is somewhat larger than the <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cell population (compare 979 GFP<sup>high</sup>/<italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells in CTL fish in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> with ~1400 bihormonal cells post-ablation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) suggests the implication of mechanisms complementary to direct conversion. Indeed, beside <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells as cellular origin of bihormonal cells, our findings also point to alternative sources, (i) a β-cell origin from pre-existing cells spared by the ablation and (ii) a ductal origin, at least in larvae. Our results show that a small but significant fraction of bihormonal cells arises from β-cells. We also show that bihormonal cells form in the pancreatic ducts. As ducts are present in the tail as well as in the head, these results suggest a ductal contribution to the global bihormonal cell mass, that is the main and secondary islets. Whether regenerating duct-derived bihormonal cells differentiate via a monohormonal <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cell transitional state remains to be determined. Moreover, the ducts could help repopulate the <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells after conversion. Besides neogenesis, our results suggest that proliferation contributes to the formation and/or maintenance of the pool of bihormonal cells and <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells. Notably, we observed evidences of proliferation at an early stage after β-cell ablation, 3 dpt, as illustrated by replicating EdU + bihormonal cells in larvae and broad PCNA expression in adults. Interestingly, the activation of p53 indicates a tight control on proliferation in bihormonal cells. At 20 dpt, the p53 pathway represents the second most enriched signature in bihormonal cells, while PCNA is still widely expressed. To understand this observation, it would be interesting to tackle the dynamics of cell cycle and to perform a detailed analysis of different markers of cell cycle progression and checkpoints in the different cell populations during regeneration.</p><p>The identification of bihormonal cells in zebrafish brings the question of the molecular mechanisms underlying this β/δ hybrid identity. In mammals, <italic>Pdx1</italic> is essential for β-cell function notably through activation of <italic>Ins</italic> and of the glucose-sensing machinery genes <italic>Slc2a2</italic> and <italic>Gck</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahlgren et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Waeber et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Watada et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>Pdx1</italic> is also crucial to promote and maintain β-cell identity as it activates β-cell genes and represses the α-cell program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahlgren et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Pdx1</italic>, also known as STF1 (Somatostatin Transcription Factor 1), is expressed in a subset of mouse/human δ-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Piran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Segerstolpe et al., 2016</xref>) and stimulates <italic>Sst</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leonard et al., 1993</xref>). In both murine α and γ-cells, the efficiency of reprogramming to <italic>Insulin-</italic>expressing cells is potentiated by forced expression of Pdx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cigliola et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Perez-Frances et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the expression of <italic>pdx1</italic> could underlie the intrinsic competence of <italic>sst1.1</italic> δ-cells (or mammalian δ-cells) to induce <italic>ins</italic>. However, <italic>pdx1</italic> expression alone is obviously not sufficient to guarantee <italic>ins</italic> expression, and other mechanisms consequent to β-cell loss must operate in synergy, such as metabolic changes and epigenetic regulations. In contrast to <italic>pdx1</italic>, <italic>nkx6.2</italic> and <italic>mnx1</italic>, two genes essential for β-cell development in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binot et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dalgin et al., 2011</xref>), are totally absent in bihormonal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). In mammals, the homologue of <italic>nkx6.2</italic> in β-cells is <italic>Nkx6.1</italic> (see species-specific expression in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5</xref>). Both <italic>Nkx6.1</italic> and <italic>Mnx1</italic> genes in mouse are important to repress non-β endocrine lineage programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schaffer et al., 2013</xref>). Together, the robust expression of <italic>pdx1</italic> and the lack of <italic>mnx1</italic> and <italic>nkx6.2</italic> are potential key players in the hybrid β/δ phenotype.</p><p>Normal glycemia is nearly recovered after 20 days and regenerated animals display perfectly normal glucose tolerance despite the very low abundance of genuine monohormonal β-cells. Bihormonal cells formed after β-cell destruction are abundant – nearly half the initial β-cell mass – and constitute the vast majority of <italic>ins</italic>-expressing cells throughout the whole pancreas and hence the main source of Ins. Their capacity to regulate blood glucose levels is corroborated by their transcriptomic profile showing the expression of the machinery required for glucose responsiveness and insulin secretion as illustrated by the glucose transporter Glut2 (<italic>slc2a2)</italic>, the prohormone convertase <italic>pcsk1</italic>, the K<sub>ATP</sub> subunit SUR1 (<italic>abcc8)</italic> and several components of the secretory pathway. All these findings are further supported by the observation by Singh et al that β/δ hybrid cells gain glucose responsiveness during regeneration as assessed by in vivo Calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). Altogether, we propose that, despite the fact that bihormonal cells are not identical to β-cells, they are the functional units that control glucose homeostasis in regenerated fish, compensate for the absence of monohormonal β-cells and reverse diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

islet. This study probes this phenomenon by exploiting the zebrafish experimental model, which has a much higher adult regeneration capacity than in mammals. A particular novel finding from the study is the identification of a subpopulation of islet delta cells that are similar to beta cells at the transcriptional level and can convert into an insulin/somatostatin co-expressing cell population upon beta cell ablation. The findings will be of particular interest to researchers interested in islet cell biology and pancreatic endocrine cell reprogramming; it will be interesting to explore whether similar delta cell subpopulations exist in mammalian islets to serve as an alternative source of insulin producing cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67576.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Sussel</surname><given-names>Lori</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.06.24.449706">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.24.449706v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. A major issue is the lack of genetic lineage tracing to support the major conclusion of the study. There is good use of a series of transgenic reporter lines but the main claim of the authors of a rapid conversion of delta cells into insulin/somatostatin bihormonal cells is not supported by lineage tracing experiments, and alternative explanations for the rapid appearance of these bihormonal cells are insufficiently explored. The underlying mechanisms may be unique to zebrafish.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. To unequivocally demonstrate the GFP<sup>high</sup>-sst1.1 cells become the bihormonal cells, the authors will need to perform genetic lineage analysis. Alternatively, they should dampen their conclusions and discuss alternative explanations.</p><p>2.

Alternatively, they should dampen their conclusions and discuss alternative explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>To unambiguously determine if the bihormonal cells derive from sst1.1 delta cells, we generated sst1.1:CRE-ERT2 fish (using the same promoter as for our sst1.1:GFP). Unfortunately, the 2 independent lines we obtained (2 independent insertions) were both characterized by broad silencing of the CRE transgene and only a small fraction of the sst1.1 cells expressed CRE (checked by CRE mRNA expression by in situ hybridization in embryos). A fortiori, we could barely detect recombined szYellow+ (tracer marker) cells after breeding with our ubb:loxP-CFPStop-loxP-szYellow line and treatment with 4-OHT.</p><p>As we could not genetically establish the origin of bihormonal cells, we now dampen our conclusions about the sst1.1 delta-cells and discuss more deeply two alternative cellular sources, the beta cells and ductal cells. Indeed, we agree with Reviewer 2 that the beta cell origin of bihormonal cells cannot be firmly excluded on the basis of our beta cell lineage tracing (see Response to Reviewer 2). Our results rather indicate that a fraction of bihormonal cells arise from pre-existing beta cells. In addition, we provide evidence that bihormonal cells differentiate from duct-associated progenitors. Ducts are a well-established source of progenitors for beta cell regeneration in zebrafish in both larvae and adults (Ninov, 2013; Ghaye 2015, Delaspres 2015). In this revised paper, we dedicate Figure 7 and Figure 7supplement 1 to this aspect.</p><p>In addition, we explored the role of proliferation in the formation of bihormonal cells and analysed cell cycle parameters (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p>These findings also validate the transcriptomic profile of bihormonal cells.</p><p>Regarding the cellular origin of bihormonal cells, we would like here to refer to a parallel study by Nikolay Ninov’s group that was submitted in a coordinated manner with ours (Singh et al., bioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.24.449704) and entitled “A single-cell atlas of de novo β-cell regeneration reveals the contribution of hybrid β/δ cells to diabetes recovery in zebrafish”. In their work, using ingle cell transcriptomic analyses, they also identified the existence of “hybrid” ins+ sst1.1+ bihormonal cells in the zebrafish pancreas. Although they did not trace the sst1.1, their data also strongly point to the sst1.1 delta cells as one cellular origin of bihormonal cells after beta cell ablation. In addition, they also do not exclude a ductal origin. We discuss their main findings with respect to ours in this revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Provide functional data on the Sst1.1/insulin bihormonal cells to demonstrate that they are capable of insulin secretion, which is presumed to underlie the recovery from hyperglycemia.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess the secretory capacity of bihormonal cells, one way is to monitor in vivo the intracellular Calcium response in bihormonal cells upon treatment with glucose. This approach has been followed by Singh et al. on zebrafish larvae and they could demonstrate that bihormonal cells formed after ablation in larvae gain glucose responsiveness during regeneration.</p><p>Another way to assess the secretory capacity of bihormonal cells would be to measure blood levels of Insulin, or Insulin secreted from cultured islets. However, this cannot be done in zebrafish due to the very low amount of blood, cells and Insulin even in adult fish.</p><p>Thus, to address the question of the functionality of bihormonal cells, we opted for a complementary approach, ie a glucose tolerance test in adults. We showed that bihormonal cells represent the vast majority (95-99%) of all Insulin-expressing cells throughout the pancreas (see Figure 1 and new Figure 4), thereby minimizing the possibility that a putative population of pure beta cells (SST negative) would significantly contribute to regulate glycemia. The glucose tolerance test reveals that the regulation of blood glucose in regenerated fish after glucose injection is identical to CTL fish (new Figure 4). These observations strongly support that bihormonal cells are the main sources of Insulin in regenerated fish and that they are responsible for blood glucose homeostasis in the near absence of beta cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For the lineage tracing data using the zsYellow label in conjunction with an inducible beta cell specific Cre driver strain, explain why this experiment was done in developing embryos instead of during the adult stage where they made the original observation of the appearance of bihormonal cells that is associated with normalization of glucose levels.</p></disp-quote><p>Beta cell tracing was performed in larvae for the reason that bihormonal cells are observed at any stage, from embryos, larvae to adults, and that CRE/lox experiments are not efficient in adults. Indeed, we had to consider the prosaic reason that inducible CRE-mediated recombination by 4-OHT is faster and more efficient at young stages (Hans et al., Plos One, 2009; Mosimann et al., Development, 2011, see also Response to Reviewer 2) than at adult stages in which acceptable efficiency is hardly reached. This is now clarified in the manuscript lines 162-164.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Include the &quot;data not shown&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are now included in the manuscript:</p><p>i) A single exploratory replicate of RNAseq transcriptome of regenerated ins:Cherry+ cells (new Figure 1—source data 3) that led to the identification of very high expression of sst1.1 in regenerated Cherry+ cells.</p><p>ii) To assess the role of candidate stress agents in bihormonal cell formation, we now include the experiments with treatment with high concentration of glucose, ROS (H2O2) and an inhibitor of Insulin/PI3K signalling, all showing they are not sufficient to induce bihormonal cells or do not affect their formation (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The potential role of the p53 pathway is not convincing and is based on a single experiment. This data should be augmented or perhaps weaken the interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>To augment the data on p53, we present now validations of the activation in the islet of the p53 pathway by in situ hybridization with ccng1 and mdm2 (shown now in Figure 6G), two established p53 target genes that were identified in our transcriptomes. We also explore the cell cycle signatures.</p><p>We decided to remove the experiment with pifithrin alpha. Indeed, using different timely treatments with the p53 inhibitor pifithrin alpha, we obtained two opposite responses: one that confirms the results shown in the first version of the paper (a decrease of bihormonal cells that is moreover paralleled by an increase of sst1.1:GFP cells), the other showing an increase. We think that p53 acts at different levels, possibly in monohormonal sst1.1 delta cells and in bihormonal cells and the understanding of these observations would be the focus of another project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Pdx1 (also known as STF1 for Somatostatin Transcription Factor) is in both beta and delta cells. In addition, there is older literature suggesting that beta and delta cells are in a common lineage, separate from the other islet cell types. This information should be presented in the introduction and much more discussion about the implications of this study's findings in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that Pdx1 is expressed in at least a subset of delta cells in mouse and humans is indeed an important piece of information that we now describe in the manuscript lines 284-286 in the Results section and in the Discussion (lines 453455).</p><p>Although this observation may have led to speculate on a putative beta-delta common precursor, many studies rather indicate that key factors like Pdx1 but also Mnx1, Nkx6.1, Nkx2.2, Pax4, Pax6… are important to repress non-beta program (delta, alpha, epsilon, PP) and maintain/promote beta program in mature beta cells and/or in endocrine precursors/progenitors during development.</p><p>Here, we discuss the case of Pdx1 in beta cells, where it activates/maintains beta cell genes, while repressing the alpha cell program (Ahlgren, Genes and Dev 1998) (Gao et al. Cell Metab 2014) (lines 449 and onwards). In parallel to the expression of Pdx1 in bihormonal cells, we also discuss the case of the lack of the zebrafish equivalent of Nkx6.1, nkx6.2 in bihormonal cells, and of Mnx1 and discuss the impact of on cell identity.</p><p>We think that presenting Pdx1 in the Introduction section would anticipate too much on the results, so we chose to refer to Pdx1 in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The writing could be simplified in the Results section as indicated by reviewer 1 and 2 so that the authors are not over-extrapolating their RNA seq data without other supporting evidence that tests for function or expression at the protein level.</p></disp-quote><p>We simplified and shortened the descriptive parts where we cited gene lists and tended to over-interpret the transcriptomic data.</p><p>Gene lists and GO analyses are nevertheless accessible in the Figures 3, 5 and 6 and the corresponding Source data.</p><p>We also include more experimental validations of the bihormonal transcriptomic data. These include the p53 pathway and the cell cycle signatures (new Figure 6) and the functionality of the bihormonal cells (new Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

It would be extraordinarily useful for the reader to include a table of these factors and indicate their normal islet (cell expression in zebrafish vs mammals).</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this “zebrafish deformation”. Indeed, most of these genes display species-specific differences of expression. As suggested, to facilitate the reading of the manuscript, we include a comparative table (mammals/zebrafish) with the important transcription factors mentioned in the Results and Discussion sections (Figure 3—source data 5) and better definition of them in the corresponding text.</p><p>We decided to remove the example of nkx2.2 because, though very interesting, it is illustrative of a too speculative description of the first version. Indeed, in contrast to mouse/human Nkx2.2 that is expressed in all endocrine cells except delta, in zebrafish, nkx2.2a is expressed in all adult endocrine cell types including delta sst2 and delta sst1.1. It is, however, about 2x less expressed in bihormonal and sst1.1 delta cells compared to the other cell types. The implications of this lower – not absent – expression in bihormonal cells (and sst1.1 delta) cells in terms of cell identity are impossible to deduce without experimental testing. A potential role in maintaining/establishing a monohormonal phenotype is therefore not straightforward. We also removed foxo1 as its mRNA expression is rather ubiquitous in endocrine cells and hence does not inform on protein regulation such as nuclear localization which we did not assessed. We admit that it is not, per se, an endocrine or beta cell marker.</p><p>We explain in the table (Figure 3—source data 5) and lines 203-204 that Nkx6.1</p><p>is not expressed in zebrafish beta cells but instead is replaced by Nkx6.2. Zebrafish Nkx6.1 is considered as a progenitor marker in zebrafish, similar to murine Nkx6.1 during embryonic pancreas development (Figure 3—source data 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
