pathogens, and inflammatory tissue injury. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 regulates these processes in the intestines of mice and humans; the anti-inflammatory activity of IL10 is also conserved in birds. To determine the function of IL10 in avian mucosal immunity, we generated germ line modifications of the chicken <italic>IL10</italic> locus to abolish or reduce IL10 expression. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis of macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide confirmed the loss of IL10 protein expression, the lack of dosage compensation in heterozygotes, and prevention of autocrine inhibition of nitric oxide production in homozygous IL10 knockout macrophages. IL10-deficiency significantly altered the composition of the caecal microbiome, but unlike IL10-deficient mice and humans, IL10-deficient chickens did not exhibit spontaneous colitis. Following experimental challenge with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium or <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> in IL10-deficient chickens, enhanced clearance of the pathogens was associated with elevated transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and increased infiltration of inflammatory cells into gut mucosa. In IL10-deficient chickens challenged with the parasite <italic>Eimeria tenella,</italic> pathogen clearance was accelerated but caecal lesions were more severe and weight gain was compromised. Neither the heterozygous IL10 knockout nor a homozygous IL10 enhancer mutation had a major effect on pathogen clearance or inflammation in any of the challenge models. Our findings highlight the intrinsic compromise in mucosal immune response and have important implications for the development of strategies to combat avian and zoonotic pathogens in poultry.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primordial germ

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Elimination of potential pathogens by the innate and acquired immune systems involves an intrinsic compromise between host protection and tissue injury that requires mechanisms to control the nature, magnitude, duration, and specificity of effector pathways. A key component of specificity is the capacity to distinguish between pathogens and the commensal microbiome, and nowhere is this challenge more pressing than in the intestine. The anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10 (IL10), has long been recognised as an essential feedback regulator of intestinal inflammation in mammals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saraiva et al., 2020</xref>). IL10-deficient mice generated by homologous recombination developed spontaneous enterocolitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kühn et al., 1993</xref>). Subsequent studies revealed that components of the intestinal microbiome were essential to the development of pathology and determined the extent and location of lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sellon et al., 1998</xref>). In humans, homozygous mutations in genes encoding IL10 or its receptor, IL10RA, have been associated with early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saraiva et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, IL10 is produced by both myeloid and T and B lymphoid cells following activation by immune stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saraiva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Couper et al., 2008</xref>), with subtle differences between mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rasquinha et al., 2021</xref>). In the specific context of the intestine, conditional deletion of the <italic>IL10</italic> and <italic>IL10RA</italic> genes in mice indicated that production of the ligand by macrophages was not required for pathology, consistent with T cells being the major source of intestinal IL10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brockmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pils et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, macrophage-specific deletion of the <italic>IL10RA</italic> gene encoding the IL10 receptor was sufficient to elicit spontaneous colitis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernshtein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Redhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zigmond et al., 2014</xref>). The contribution of IL10 to feedback modulation of host defence is not restricted to the gut. There have been countless studies of the impact of IL10 deficiency in mouse parasite, bacterial, fungal, and viral disease models (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Couper et al., 2008</xref>). The primary focus of these studies has been on the mitigation of immunopathology by IL10, with less attention given to pathogen elimination. By contrast to studies in mice, analysis of the quantitative importance of IL10 in other species has been largely correlative. Both ligand and receptor are conserved in vertebrates, and zebrafish has been discussed as a model for understanding IL10 biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piazzon et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we focus on the chicken, both a model vertebrate and an economically important livestock species.</p><p>The original cloning and sequencing of chicken <italic>IL10</italic> cDNA and genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothwell et al., 2004</xref>) described the immunomodulatory activity of the recombinant protein on T cell production of interferon-gamma (IFNγ), its regulated expression in T cells and macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>, and increased mRNA expression during parasite (<italic>Eimeria maxima</italic>) infection. Like the mammalian transcript, chicken <italic>IL10</italic> mRNA contains multiple copies of the AUUUA instability motif in the 3’-untranslated region. We and others have provided evidence that quantitative variation in IL10 production may contribute to inter-individual or inter-breed variation in infectious disease susceptibility in chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boulton et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Swaggerty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Calenge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghebremicael et al., 2008</xref>).

The central importance of IL10 in mediating this balance has been studied extensively in the mouse, notably in the context of parasite infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saraiva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Couper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rasquinha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piazzon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Redpath et al., 2014</xref>). The regulatory function of IL10 is especially important in preventing inappropriate responses to the intestinal microbiome with the potential to drive spontaneous enterocolitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kühn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernshtein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zigmond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Büchler et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we have generated two <italic>IL10</italic> mutations in the chicken genome, a definitive knockout and a putative enhancer mutation. Notwithstanding the development of robust technologies based upon CRISPR/Cas9, the development of models of immune deficiency in chickens remains time-consuming and logistically challenging, and relatively few informative mutations have been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heyl et al., 2023</xref>). The enhancer mutation was intended to generate a quantitative impact on IL10 expression to model selection for reduced expression in production lines of birds. Based upon the mouse <italic>Il10</italic><sup>-/-</sup> phenotype, we also anticipated a possible severe post-hatch failure to thrive due to spontaneous colitis in IL10KO HOM chicks. An unexpected outcome was the discovery that the IL10KO in chicken is not dosage compensated; therefore, the HET provides a second model of the impact of reduced expression. In overview, neither the IL10KO HET nor the IL10EnKO HOM had a large effect on pathogen clearance or inflammation in either of the challenge models, indicating that IL10 biology is not highly sensitive to changes in expression of the magnitude that has been detected in individual lines of commercial broilers and layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boulton et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boulton et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freem et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Detailed analysis of the IL10KO HOM birds in SPF or conventional avian facilities revealed no evidence of spontaneous intestinal inflammation or compromised body weight gain, and only a small and inconsistent effect on specific antibody responses to routine live or inactivated vaccines. Since spontaneous colitis in mice depends upon resident enteric bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sellon et al., 1998</xref>), it is possible that the difference compared to the rodent models lies in the nature of the chicken intestinal microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bajagai et al., 2024</xref>), in which case the changes that we observed in the microbiome of IL10KO HOM chicks may serve to mitigate potential spontaneous intestinal pathology. In any case, the results indicate that deletion of IL10 from the genome or selection in favour of low IL10 expression alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boulton et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghebremicael et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boulton et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freem et al., 2019</xref>) need not necessarily affect production traits.</p><p>In both the bacterial challenge models, and in the <italic>Eimeria</italic> challenge, the response of IL10KO HOM birds highlights for the first time in a non-rodent species the compromise between pathogen elimination and pathology. Accelerated pathogen clearance is associated with increased inflammatory gene expression and local inflammation, and in the case of <italic>Eimeria</italic>, reduced body weight gain. The models we have chosen are not lethal and there is effective pathogen clearance even in WT birds. Findings with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> in IL10KO HOM birds are consistent with elevated intestinal inflammation in a broiler breed with relatively low IL10 expression, albeit a significant reduction in caecal colonisation relative to breeds with higher IL10 expression was not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>). While the caecal load of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> was markedly reduced in IL10KO HOM birds at most intervals examined, some inconsistency existed in the timepoints when the reduction reached statistical significance between cohorts, likely as a consequence of inter-animal variation. This is typical of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> colonisation in chickens, where bacterial population structures have been reported to be variable and unpredictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coward et al., 2008</xref>). Similar variation between time intervals, birds and repeated experiments has been reported when evaluating vaccines against <italic>C. jejuni</italic> colonisation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buckley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nothaft et al., 2021</xref>). In mammals, <italic>Salmonella</italic> has been reported to gain a competitive advantage from intestinal inflammation, both owing to availability of tetrathionate that <italic>Salmonella</italic> can uniquely use as a respiratory electron acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winter et al., 2010</xref>) and remodelling of the indigenous microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rogers, 2021</xref>). It is unclear if <italic>Salmonella</italic> derives the same benefits during colonisation of the avian intestine and the counts of viable bacteria recovered from the caeca of WT and IL10KO HOM birds can only be interpreted as the balance of bacterial growth and killing.</p><p>Our results with <italic>Eimeria</italic> are relevant to commercial studies aimed at targeting IL10 to mitigate disease. Coccidiosis has been estimated to exert costs in excess of £10 billion every year to the chicken production industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blake et al., 2020</xref>), with <italic>E. tenella</italic> among the most common and pathogenic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clark et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long et al., 1976</xref>). Feeding neutralising anti-IL10 antibody to chickens during <italic>Eimeria</italic> infection was reported to mitigate reduced body weight gain (BWG) but had an inconsistent impact on parasite replication and pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rasheed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sand et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, feeding antibody to IL10 receptor 2 (but not receptor 1) reduced lost BWG, but had no effect on oocyst shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arendt et al., 2019</xref>). Feeding chickens genetically modified corn (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) expressing IL10 improved BWG and reduced oocyst shedding and caecal lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lessard et al., 2020</xref>). These results are consistent with the phenotypes associated with a reduction, rather than complete absence, of IL10 observed here.</p><p>Given the excessive inflammatory activation we observed in non-lethal infections, and the literature in mice, IL10KO HOM birds or hypomorphs might be hyper-sensitive to more virulent bacterial infections and viral pathogens, such as avian influenza, that can elicit a cytokine storm. On the other hand, they may be primed for a more rapid and effective response.

The anti-inflammatory role of IL10 was indeed known previously from studies in mammals. The much more general insight from the current study is our demonstration of the intrinsic trade-off between inflammation and tolerance in the response to both the microbiome (which was significantly altered in the IL10 knockout birds) and mucosal pathogens. The study of <italic>Eimeria</italic> challenge in particular highlights the fact that it may be better for the host to tolerate a potential pathogen than to take on the cost of elimination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors were to investigate the functional role of IL10 on mucosal immunity in chickens.

Since IL-10 KO in mice leads to enhanced pathological score upon DSS-mediated induction of colitis, and several colitis models are well established in birds, it will be worthwhile to test the consequence of experimentally inducing colitis in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the novel features of this study is the observation that the microbiome is modified in the IL10KO HOM chicks, which may serve to mitigate potential spontaneous pathology; we now mention this in the discussion. We agree that it could be worthwhile in the future to look at additional challenge models. However, we would argue that the <italic>Eimeria</italic> challenge is a sufficiently adequate experimentally-induced model of colitis to demonstrate the increased inflammation that occurs in an IL10-deficient bird. This is further supported by evidence of enhanced inflammatory responses in the caeca of IL10KO HOM birds challenged with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> or <italic>Salmonella</italic> relative to WT controls. See in the revised manuscript (pages 12-13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) In Figure 2B, the authors should confirm whether the ROS-AV163 groups also have LPS treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>The legend for Figure 2B already states that neutralizing anti-IL10 antibody was added to LPS-stimulated BMDMs: “Nitric oxide production was assessed by measuring nitrite levels using Griess assay for LPS-stimulated BMDMs […] in the absence or presence of neutralizing anti-IL10 antibody ROS-AV163”. However, for added clarity we have now modified the x-axis label for Figure 2B (“+ROS-AV163” replaced by “+LPS +anti-IL10”) and we have also made minor changes to the figure legend. See in the revised manuscript (page 33).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 3F, the authors should discuss why the duodenum of KO birds has enhanced infiltration compared to WT?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what the reviewer is referring to here. Although not specifically mentioned in Figure 3F, there is no statistically significant difference in cellular infiltration in the duodenum of IL10KO WT and HOM birds raised in our specified pathogen-free (SPF) facility, nor in the duodenum of IL10KO WT and HOM birds raised in our conventional facility (Mann-Whitney U tests, p&gt;0.1 in both cases); this can be seen in the sums of histopathological scores shown in Figures 3C (SPF facility) and 3E (conventional facility). Figure 3F shows that there is a statistically significant difference in cellular infiltration scores in the duodenum and proximal colon of both IL10KO WT and HOM birds based on the environment they are raised in (SPF vs conventional). We have made minor changes to the text to clarify this. See in the revised manuscript (page 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors should discuss the observed differences in the C. jejuni colonization results among the two cohorts at week 1 and week 2 post-infection.</p></disp-quote><p>Numbers of C. jejuni in the caeca of IL10KO HOM birds were markedly lower than for WT controls at 1-week post-infection in cohort 1, and at both time intervals post-infection in cohort 2 (Figure 4A). This reached statistical significance at 1-week post-infection in cohort 1 and at 2-weeks post-infection in cohort 2. It is evident from Figure 4A that considerable inter-animal variance existed in each group, and in the IL10KO HOM birds in particular. This is typical of C. jejuni colonisation in chickens, where bacterial population structures have been reported to be variable and unpredictable (Coward et al., Appl Environ Microbiol 2008, PMID: 18424530). Similar variation between time intervals, birds and repeated experiments has been reported when evaluating vaccines against C. jejuni colonisation (e.g. Buckley et al., Vaccine 2010, PMID: 19853682; Nothaft et al., Front Microbiol 2021, PMID: 34867850). We performed two independent studies for this reason. Taken together, we consider that our data provide convincing evidence of elevated pro-inflammatory responses upon C. jejuni infection in IL10KO HOM birds relative to WT controls that associates with reduced bacterial burden. Our data is also consistent with a published observation that a commercial broiler line with low IL10 expression had correspondingly elevated expression of CXCLi-1, CXCLi-2 and IL-1b (Humphrey et al., mBio 2014, reference 33 in our original submission). We have added text to the discussion to capture the points above. See in the revised manuscript (page 13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>For the animal challenging experiments, both IL10KO HOM and IL10EnKO HOM chickens were used for <italic>Eimeria</italic> challenge, but not for <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Campylobacter</italic>. Could the authors justify why?</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>Eimeria</italic> challenge produced a much higher and more reproducible level of inflammation than either of the bacterial challenge models. Within the parasite challenge cohorts, IL10KO HET and IL10EnKO HOM birds were only marginally different from WT controls (e.g. parasite replication: Figures 5A and B; lesion scores: Figures 5E and F; body weight gain: Figures 5G and H). Given the more limited response and the inter-individual variation in the bacterial challenge models, we felt that analysis of a sufficiently large cohort of the IL10KO HOM was appropriate, while additional cohorts of IL10KO HET and IL10EnKO HOM birds large enough to detect statistically significant differences could not be justified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the M&amp;M, there was no mention of # of birds generated for IL10EnKO HOM, HET, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Full details of bird numbers can be found in SI Appendix Table S1 “Number of IL10KO and IL10EnKO WT, HET and HOM chicks hatched in the NARF SPF chicken facility in the first (G1) and second (G2) generations”. Table S1 is already referred to in the Results section “Generation of IL10-deficient chickens”; we have now also clearly referred to it in the “Animals” and “Generation of surrogate host chickens and establishment of the IL10KO and IL10EnKO lines under SPF conditions” sections of the Materials and Methods. In all three sections we have also added some text to clarify that the table details G1 and G2 bird numbers. See in the revised manuscript (pages 5, 15, 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From the results of Campylobacter challenge, the results from the cohort 1 and cohort 2 were not consistent at both 1 and 2 weeks of post-infection. There is not much discussion on this inconsistency. What is the final conclusion: significant difference in week 1 or week 2, OR none of them, OR both of them. What would happen if an additional cohort were conducted for <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Eimeria</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in response to Reviewer 1 (minor point 3), we have now added text to the discussion on the partial inconsistency between independent C. jejuni challenge studies. We do not feel that additional experiments to address this comment are required. Highly significant increases in the infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells and heterophils were detected in IL10KO HOM chickens relative to WT controls in the caeca, a key site of Campylobacter colonisation. This was consistently observed in two independent cohorts at both 1- and 2-weeks post-infection (SI Appendix Figures S7 and S8) and was reflected in similar patterns of expression of pro-inflammatory genes at these intervals in both cohorts (Figure 4B). As our laboratory has observed substantially less variation between repeated <italic>Salmonella</italic> challenges, a single study was performed, but with adequate power to detect statistical differences. The effects of E. tenella infection in IL10KO WT and HOM birds were replicated (compare Figure 4 with data from day 6 in Figure 5).</p></body></sub-article></article>
