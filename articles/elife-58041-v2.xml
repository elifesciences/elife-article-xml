synthesis, one in the cytoplasm (catalyzed by fatty acid synthase, FASN) and one in the mitochondria (mtFAS). In contrast to FASN, mtFAS is poorly characterized, especially in higher eukaryotes, with the major product(s), metabolic roles, and cellular function(s) being essentially unknown. Here we show that hypomorphic mtFAS mutant mouse skeletal myoblast cell lines display a severe loss of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes and exhibit compensatory metabolic activities including reductive carboxylation. This effect on ETC complexes appears to be independent of protein lipoylation, the best characterized function of mtFAS, as mutants lacking lipoylation have an intact ETC. Finally, mtFAS impairment blocks the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts in vitro. Together, these data suggest that ETC activity in mammals is profoundly controlled by mtFAS function, thereby connecting anabolic fatty acid synthesis with the oxidation of carbon fuels.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In human, plant and other eukaryotic cells, fats are an important source of energy and also play many other roles including waterproofing, thermal insulation and energy storage. Eukaryotic cells have two systems that make the building blocks of fats (known as fatty acids) and one of these systems, called the mtFAS pathway, operates in small compartments known as mitochondria. This pathway only has one known product, a small fat molecule called lipoic acid, which mitochondria attach to several enzymes to allow them to work properly.</p><p>The main role of mitochondria is to break down fats and other molecules to release chemical energy that powers many processes in cells. They achieve this using large groups of proteins known as ETC complexes. To build these complexes, families of proteins known as ETC assembly factors carefully coordinate the assembly of many proteins and small molecules into specific structures. However, it remains unclear precisely how this process works.</p><p>Here, Nowinski et al. used a gene editing technique to mutate the genes encoding three enzymes in the mtFAS pathway in mammalian cells. The experiments found that the mutant cells had fewer ETC complexes and seemed to be less able to break down fats and other molecules than â€˜normalâ€™ cells. Furthermore, a family of ETC assembly factors were less stable in the mutant cells. These findings suggest that the mtFAS pathway controls how mitochondria assemble ETC complexes. Further experiments indicated that lipoic acid is not involved in the assembly of ETC complexes and that the mtFAS pathway produces another, as yet unidentified, product that regulates this process, instead.</p><p>MEPAN syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that leads to progressive loss of control of movement, slurred speech and impaired vision in children. Patients with this syndrome have genetic mutations affecting components of the mtFAS pathway, therefore, a better understanding of how the pathway works may help researchers develop new treatments in the future. More broadly, these findings will have important ramifications for many other situations in which the activity of ETC complexes in mitochondria is modified.</p></abstract><kwd-group

including providing the hydrophobic tails of membrane phospholipids, energy storage in the form of triglycerides, and as cell signaling molecules. Aside from the import of exogenous fatty acids, mammalian cells use the well-known and well-studied cytoplasmic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) to make palmitate, which is further modified to form the diverse array of cellular fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith, 1994</xref>). However, it is much less appreciated that mitochondria also harbor a spatially and genetically distinct fatty acid synthesis pathway (mtFAS) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nowinski et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to FASN, which is a very large protein that contains several domains and encompasses all of the enzymatic activities necessary for FAS condensed in a single polypeptide chain, the mtFAS pathway is comprised of at least six enzymes all encoded by separate genes. These enzymes catalyze sequential steps to achieve one cycle of two-carbon addition to a growing acyl chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The nascent fatty acids are covalently attached to the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP), which acts as a soluble scaffold upon which the acyl chains are built. In each cycle of the pathway, malonyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-ACP, which then undergoes a condensation reaction with the growing fatty acyl chain on ACP, extending the chain by two carbons and releasing a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule. Thereafter, the remaining enzymes in the pathway must carry out a series of reduction and dehydration reactions to fully reduce the acyl chain to a saturated fatty acid, which is the substrate for further cycles of two-carbon addition. Among the several differences between mtFAS and cytoplasmic FAS, FASN exclusively produces palmitate, whereas mtFAS appears to have at least two major products.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MtFAS is an essential pathway in mammalian skeletal myoblasts but does not contribute to synthesis of major cellular lipids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway and downstream lipoic acid synthesis.

While these detrimental phenotypes are clear, the molecular consequences of mtFAS loss remain poorly understood.</p><p>MtFAS currently has one known product: an eight-carbon saturated fatty acid, octanoate, that is subsequently converted to lipoic acid. This important cofactor is required for the catalytic activity of a number of mitochondrial enzymes, most notably pyruvate dehydrogenase and Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brody et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wada et al., 1997</xref>), but also branched chain amino acid dehydrogenase, the H protein of the glycine cleavage system, and 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solmonson and DeBerardinis, 2018</xref>). This observation, made more than 20 years ago, has guided mtFAS-focused research for the past two decades. Studies have shown that loss of lipoic acid synthesis and/or failure to efficiently transfer lipoic acid to its target proteins is lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yi and Maeda, 2005</xref>), and attributed other mitochondrial changes as downstream of lipoic acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). However, though the mouse studies described above have demonstrated striking phenotypes that result from loss of mtFAS, they fail to distinguish between direct effects of loss of protein lipoylation versus loss of other mtFAS function(s). Although lipoic acid unmistakably has important central functions in mitochondrial metabolism, there is reason to be skeptical that the sole function of mtFAS is the production of lipoic acid.</p><p>In addition to the eight-carbon precursor for lipoic acid, it is clear that mtFAS also produces longer acyl chains of at least 14 carbons, yet the identity of these lipids and their cellular functions are uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angerer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Witkowski et al., 2007</xref>). Perhaps more surprisingly, these longer acyl chains appear to partially be maintained in attachment to ACP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angerer et al., 2017</xref>), further complicating the question of their cellular functions. We set out to systematically examine the cellular functions of the mtFAS pathway by mutating genes that encode three distinct steps in the pathway, <italic>Mcat</italic>, <italic>Oxsm</italic>, and <italic>Mecr</italic>. For comparison, we also engineered cells with loss of <italic>Lipt1</italic>, the terminal enzyme in the production of lipoylated enzymes downstream of mtFAS. We found that several phenotypes resulting from loss of the mtFAS pathway are not related to lipoic acid, but must instead be due to loss of other products or functions of mtFAS. In particular, we find that loss of mtFAS, but not lipoic acid synthesis, leads to a profound impairment in the assembly of the mitochondrial electron transport chain machinery, with the attendant consequences on metabolism and cell behaviors. Our data therefore suggest that the mtFAS pathway acts as a key regulator of mitochondrial respiratory metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis is an essential pathway that does not contribute to synthesis of cellular lipids</title><p>The enzymes of mtFAS are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, with the highest expression in skeletal muscle and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Triepels et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, we chose cultured skeletal myoblasts as a model system in which to examine the role of this pathway. We employed a CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy to mutate three genes encoding enzymes in the mtFAS pathway, using two different guide RNA sequences per gene. We targeted <italic>Mcat</italic>, encoding the malonyl-CoA ACP transacylase, <italic>Oxsm</italic>, encoding the beta-ketoacyl synthase that condenses malonyl-ACP with the growing acyl chain, and <italic>Mecr</italic>, encoding the terminal reductase in each cycle of two-carbon unit addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is important to note that because mtFAS is a cycle that requires all enzymes for each stepwise two-carbon addition, loss of each individual enzyme blocks fatty acid synthesis at an early, albeit distinct step. <italic>Mcat</italic> mutants should be unable to attach any carbon to ACP, whereas <italic>Oxsm</italic> mutants should be able to produce malonyl-ACP, and <italic>Mecr</italic> mutants could at most build short four-carbon acyl chains. We observed roughly 70% editing efficiency for all six of the guides utilized (based on T7E1 assays, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that transfection with Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting mtFAS genes led to smaller colonies at one-week post-single cell sorting relative to control guides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1B</xref>). Many of the smallest clones stopped growing and/or did not survive expansion. After screening more than 100 of the surviving single cell clones, we failed to identify a single null mutant for any of the three genes targeted. This finding was not altogether unexpected, given that at least one other knockdown study concluded that NDUFAB1, the mammalian mitochondrial ACP, is essential in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, The Broad Instituteâ€™s Depmap lists NDUFAB1 as a â€˜common essentialâ€™ gene, and the mtFAS genes all display negative gene effects, indicating they are essential in at least some cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broad, 2020</xref>). Taken together, our results strongly support the conclusion that the mtFAS pathway is essential in C2C12 skeletal myoblasts.</p><p>Although no complete null clones were generated, we were able to isolate several clonal cell lines with markedly decreased abundance of MCAT, OXSM, and MECR. These clones also had no detectable lipoylation of PDH and OGDH subunits (DLAT and DLST, respectively) in isolated mitochondrial fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and grew slowly relative to control clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1C</xref>). Growth of mtFAS mutant cells in both glucose and galactose, the latter of which requires mitochondrial respiration, was normalized by re-expression of the cognate mtFAS gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). MECR has been reported to have dual localization to the cytoplasm in addition to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2014</xref>), so we performed sub-cellular fractionation to assess these two MECR populations in our mutant cells. We observed an overall decrease in MECR expression that was most pronounced in the mitochondrial compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1F</xref>). We thus moved forward with the characterization of these presumably hypomorphic cell lines.</p><p>As mentioned previously, the canonical function of mtFAS is the production of octanoate, the eight-carbon precursor for lipoic acid synthesis. However, some have speculated that mtFAS might also generate fatty acids that contribute to phospholipid synthesis. Seminal studies found 3-hydroxymyristate as the predominant acyl modification on mitochondrial ACP in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mikolajczyk and Brody, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schneider et al., 1997</xref>). A more recent effort to identify the predominant lipid species found a variety of medium and long chain acyl species, raising the possibility of multiple products in addition to octanoate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angerer et al., 2017</xref>). Although mtFAS mutant yeast display changes in steady-state lipids, the interpretation of this observation is confounded by other phenotypes of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schneider et al., 1995</xref>). In the only study that examines the role of mtFAS in lipid synthesis in mammals, transient knockdown of ACP did not change the abundance of mitochondrial lipids; however, this does not exclude the possibility that cytoplasmic FAS can compensate for loss of mtFAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clay et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We therefore set out to test whether mtFAS contributes to cellular phospholipid pools in the presence and absence of the cytosolic fatty acid synthase, FASN. In wild type and <italic>Oxsm</italic> mutant cell lines, we stably expressed hairpins targeting <italic>FASN</italic>, which encodes the cytoplasmic fatty acid synthase, or a scrambled control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We observed no effect of <italic>FASN</italic> knockdown on protein lipoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We then fed the cells uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C-glucose and observed labeling in cellular lipids to define the relative contributions of cytoplasmic FAS and mtFAS to various cellular lipid pools. By monitoring accumulation of the m+two isotopologue over time, we observed a dependence on FASN expression, but not mtFAS for the synthesis of new phospholipids (shown are two representative PC species, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Higher order isotopologues from additional cycles of elongation by fatty acid synthesis (e.g. m + 4, m + 6, m + 8, and so on) did not show labeling above background in this experiment. Similarly, fatty acid methyl esther analysis (FAMES) showed an effect of <italic>FASN</italic> knockdown, but not <italic>Oxsm</italic> mutation, on incorporation of U<sup>13</sup>C-glucose into c16:0 and c18:0 lipids, which confirmed that the m+2 labeling of phospholipids is likely in the fatty acid tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1G</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that longer acyl chains synthesized by mtFAS do not contribute to cellular fatty acid and phospholipid pools and likely perform some other function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mutation of mtFAS results in a profound mitochondrial respiratory phenotype and loss of ETC complexes</title><p>Given the known and hypothesized functions of mtFAS, we next assayed mitochondrial function in the mtFAS mutant cells.

To verify whether ACP in fact interacts with these additional LYRM family members, we expressed epitope-tagged variants of ACP and each LYRM in cells and confirmed their physical interaction via co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3â€”figure supplement 1D</xref>). Along with other published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>), the finding that NDUFA6, a known LYRM protein, and SDHB, the target of two known LYRM proteins, exhibit decreased abundance in mtFAS mutant cell lines supports the hypothesis that interaction with an acylated ACP is required for the complex assembly functions of these LYRM proteins.</p><p>This finding prompted us to examine the abundance of other LYRM proteins and their targets in the mtFAS mutant cell lines. Indeed, LYRM4 and its target NFS1 were also significantly decreased in abundance in our whole cell proteomics dataset, which was confirmed by western blot, implying that LYRM4 also requires acylated ACP for the stability and function of itself and NFS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Fâ€“H</xref>). Interestingly, NDUFB9, the other CI LYRM, and UQCRFS1, a subunit of CIII and the target of LYRM7, were not significantly decreased in abundance in mtFAS mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3â€”figure supplement 1E,F</xref>), implying that either the interactions between ACP and these LYRM proteins is not dependent on acylation and mtFAS, or that other compensatory mechanisms are at play. We performed immunoblot analysis of UQCRFS1 and found that it was also decreased in abundance similarly to other LYR targets, perhaps explaining the observed decrease in CIII activity despite the partial maintenance of complex assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>Finally, ACP has also been found to interact with an assembly intermediate of the mitochondrial ribosome through a novel LYRM protein called altMiD51 and its target, MALSU1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Brown et al. proposed that this interaction might negatively regulate mitochondrial translation because MALSU1, altMiD51, and ACP bind the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit in a way that precludes small subunit binding, but the role of ACP acylation in this interaction is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dibley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rathore et al., 2018</xref>). Despite this proposed role of ACP in mitochondrial translation, we found that the abundance of mitochondrially encoded proteins was unchanged in the mtFAS mutant cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3â€”figure supplement 1G</xref>). Importantly, this includes MTCO1 and MTCO2, two subunits of CIV, strongly implying that the diminution of CIV in mutant cells does not result from loss of mitochondrial translation. Interestingly, however, MALSU1 was significantly decreased in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3â€”figure supplement 1H</xref>), which raises the possibility that MALSU1 downregulation might be a compensatory adaptation that the cells make to avoid collapse of mitochondrial translation upon loss of mtFAS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Impairment of mtFAS induces reductive labeling of TCA cycle intermediates</title><p>The profound defects observed in mitochondrial respiration led us to examine mitochondrial and cellular metabolism more comprehensively in our mtFAS mutants.

This experiment led to three observations that were particularly interesting. First, glutamate cycling in the TCA cycle is decreased in the mtFAS mutant cells. We observed no differences in glutamine uptake in mutant cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4â€”figure supplement 1F</xref>). However, in pre-steady state measurements we observed reduced labeling of glutamate in mtFAS mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4â€”figure supplement 1G</xref>). Furthermore, after 24 hr of labeling, the mtFAS-deficient cells showed reduced fractional enrichments of the glutamate m+three and m+one isotopologues, which are synthesized on subsequent turns of the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In contrast, the m+five isotopologue contributes a larger fraction of the total pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These data are consistent with decreased processivity of the TCA cycle in cells lacking mtFAS.</p><p>Secondly, we observed that labeling of TCA cycle intermediates shows a clear distinction between succinate and later metabolites. Like glutamate, succinate labeling is initially slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4â€”figure supplement 1H</xref>). After 24 hr in <sup>13</sup>C-glutamine, however, similar to what we observe for glutamate labeling, in control cells subsequent rounds of the TCA cycle cause m+two succinate to accumulate. In mtFAS mutant cells, m+two succinate labeling is reduced while m+four accumulates, indicating its decreased cycling in the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In contrast, m+4 labeling of fumarate, malate, and citrate are all markedly lower at short time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4â€”figure supplement 1Iâ€“K</xref>), and remain low after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Iâ€“K</xref>), along with m+four aspartate, which is derived from m+four citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). These data and the reduced abundances of fumarate and malate support a block of the TCA cycle at the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) catalyzed step, and is in agreement with our data that demonstrate decreased steady state SDHB stability and a near-complete loss of fully assembled Complex II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3H</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the third observation we made from these data is that mtFAS mutants displayed significantly increased levels of m+five citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), which is formed from the reductive carboxylation of Î±-ketoglutarate, and is the canonical marker of reductive carboxylation. Accordingly, we also saw significant increases in m+three fumarate, malate, and aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J and L</xref>), which are formed from this pathway downstream of m+five citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mullen et al., 2011</xref>). Previous analysis of the reductive pathway concluded, as we observed here, that cells with ETC defects continue to produce succinate by the oxidative pathway, perhaps to generate reducing equivalents to drive reductive carboxylationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mullen et al., 2014</xref>). In summary, these data support the conclusion that oxidative cycling of TCA cycle intermediates is decreased overall, with a particular block at the SDH-catalyzed step. Furthermore, mtFAS mutants invoke reductive carboxylation to produce citrate, and reductive labeling of downstream metabolites is also increased. Reductive carboxylation is often seen in models of ETC inhibition or mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mullen et al., 2011</xref>) and further supports the model that hypomorphic mtFAS mutant skeletal myoblasts display significant ETC dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Loss of ETC assembly and reductive carboxylation are not downstream of loss of protein lipoylation</title><p>The best-studied function of mtFAS is the biosynthesis of octanoate, the eight-carbon precursor of lipoic acid, but it also produces longer acyl chains. This raises the possibility that there are at least two independent mechanisms whereby mtFAS might act on mitochondrial function: one via lipoic acid synthesis and another in which these longer acyl chains facilitate the acyl-ACP dependent activation of LYRM proteins in ETC complex assembly. Therefore, we decided to determine whether the metabolic phenotypes observed in mtFAS mutant cells are also found in cells containing an intact mtFAS system, but lacking the ability to transfer lipoic acid to target proteins, including the 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases (2KADHs). We created mutant cell lines for <italic>Lipt1</italic>, the gene that encodes the terminal enzyme in protein lipoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In these mutants, synthesis of octanoate and longer acyl chains by mtFAS should be unaffected, as Lipt1 catalyzes the terminal step in lipoic acid transfer to its target proteins downstream of mtFAS (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solmonson and DeBerardinis, 2018</xref>).

Hypomorphic mutants of these genes lead to loss of detectable protein lipoylation, without affecting structural phospholipids such as PC. Strikingly, mtFAS impairment results in a profound mitochondrial phenotype characterized by loss of assembled ETC complexes I, II, and IV. Quantitative proteomics analysis revealed the specific decreases in the abundance of two LYRM proteins, NDUFA6, a subunit of CI, and LYRM4, a member of the ISC complex, along with its target protein, NFS1, and another LYRM target, SDHB. Importantly, the LYRM proteins that coordinate SDHB in CII assembly, SDHAF1 and SDHAF3, were not identified in our proteomics dataset, however we infer that they are likely also decreased in abundance in mtFAS mutant cells, giving rise to the observed effect on SDHB. RNA-Seq analyses confirmed that the decreased abundance of these proteins is not a result of transcriptional down-regulation, but likely reflects post-translational destabilization. Our data together with that from multiple other eukaryotic model systems support a model in which this effect is mediated through the physical interaction of acyl-ACP with LYRM proteins, resulting in their acylation-dependent activation and functional assembly of ETC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angerer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to mtFAS mutants, <italic>Lipt1</italic> mutants can still synthesize acyl chains on ACP, but fail to transfer lipoate to its target proteins downstream of mtFAS. Thus, like mtFAS mutants, <italic>Lipt1</italic> mutants lose detectable lipoylation of PDH and OGDH, and have impaired mitochondrial respiration. However, the acylation-dependent activation of LYRM proteins and ETC complex assembly appears to require lipid products of mtFAS other than lipoic acid, as although <italic>Lipt1</italic> mutants lose protein lipoylation, they maintain mitochondrial ETC complexes I-IV. This finding is supported by studies in yeast that reached a similar conclusion based upon a suppressor mutation which can rescue OXPHOS in the absence of lipoic acid restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kursu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>). We also found that mtFAS mutants and <italic>Lipt1</italic> mutants both undergo significantly decreased oxidative TCA cycling, however only mtFAS mutants appear to display decreased abundance of TCA cycle intermediates and robustly employ reductive carboxylation. We infer that these metabolic effects are likely downstream of loss of ETC complex function, as has been previously reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mullen et al., 2011</xref>). As both mtFAS mutants and <italic>Lipt1</italic> mutants have undetectable lipoylated PDH and OGDH, but only mtFAS mutants have impaired synthesis of longer acyl chains on ACP, these data suggest that it is these longer acyl chains that are important for the interaction of acyl-ACP and activation of LYRM proteins. These findings also have implications for how patients with mutations in the lipoic acid pathway vs. the mtFAS pathway are treated.</p><p>It is important to note that some of the effects we observe on ETC assembly cannot be explained by the known interactions between LYRMs and acyl-ACP. For example, it is unclear how mtFAS impairment leads to the instability of Complex IV. One possibility is simply that CIV is less stable outside of its association with respiratory supercomplexes, which are almost completely absent in mtFAS mutant cells, likely as a result of Complex I loss. Alternatively, COX5A and COX5B are among the most affected ETC subunits by proteomics, and could be the targets of either a novel LYRM protein or another mtFAS-dependent mechanism. In mammals, the LYRM family includes at least eleven proteins but as this motif is degenerate and poorly defined, there are likely to be many that are still undiscovered. Of the currently annotated LYRM proteins, at least three (LYRM1, LYRM2, and LYRM9) have no known molecular target, although LYRM2 has recently been implicated in CI assembly in addition to NDUFA6 and NDUFB9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dibley et al., 2020</xref>). The extent to which these novel LYRM proteins require ACP acylation for function is also unknown.</p><p>Similarly, further study into the difference(s) between LYRMs that depend on ACP acylation and those that do not is warranted. As mentioned above, we observed decreases in abundance of two LYRM proteins, NDUFA9 and LYRM4, and can infer the destabilization of SDHAF1 and SDHAF3 from the decreased abundance of SDHB. Conversely, we did not observe destabilization of NDUFB9 and UQCRFS1 upon mtFAS mutation, implying that NDUFB9 and LYRM7 are not dependent on ACP acylation for their stability and functions, although orthologs in other eukaryotes seemed to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angerer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is possible that this effect could result from residual mtFAS activity, as complete knockout of the mtFAS pathway proved impossible in this system. Furthermore, at least in the case of UQCRFS1 and LYRM7, the maintenance of CIII may have been clonally selected for as cells require CIII function for quinone oxidation and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity to make uridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khutornenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khutornenko et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, cells that lack CIII are auxotrophic for orotate or uridine, and lack of these metabolites in the culture medium may have provided selective pressure for clones that employ some mechanism to escape the mtFAS-dependent regulation of CIII. In fact, it is tempting to speculate that assembly of CIII may be an essential function of mtFAS in mammalian cells.</p><p>Finally, the question of why cells have evolutionarily maintained a parallel pathway for lipid synthesis in mitochondria remains interesting, especially given recent research demonstrating the transfer of lipids between endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and various other organelles, implying that the answer cannot simply be compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Acetyl-CoA is the nearly universal fuel of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, being the convergence point of the catabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acids, ketones and some amino acids. Acetyl-CoA is also the common substrate of mtFAS and the TCA cycle, where it is broken down to produce the reduced NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> that fuel the electron transport chain. Thus, the interaction of acyl-ACP with the LYRM proteins to facilitate ETC assembly has high potential to be a regulatory mechanism whereby acetyl-CoA regulates its own catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kastaniotis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kursu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>). In other words, as acetyl-CoA is the substrate for mtFAS, it is required for ACP acylation, which in turn is required for interaction with and activation of LYRM proteins and ETC assembly. The assembled ETC catalyzes the oxidation of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, which drives the TCA cycle and consumption of acetyl-CoA. Thus, when acetyl-CoA is low, ACP acylation is diminished, ETC assembly is blunted, TCA cycling slows, and acetyl-CoA consumption falls. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast with defects in mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism exhibit blunted ACP acylation and impaired ETC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>). This elegant regulatory cycle provides cells with a potential mechanism to monitor acetyl-CoA substrate availability and adjust ETC complex levels accordingly, avoiding situations where the ETC sits idle in the absense of substrate, and reducing the attendant deleterious consequences, such as the production of reactive oxygen species. Similarly, it could potentially allow cells to ramp up oxidative capacity in settings of excess mitochondrial acetyl-CoA.</p><p>Human mutations in genes encoding enzymes of the mtFAS pathway are rare, but continue to be discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorukmez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heimer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, patients with <italic>Mecr</italic> mutations exhibit muscle weakness and we show herein that mtFAS mutation interferes with the normal differentiation of cultured myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The implications of these studies for the broader population remain to be seen, however. For example, many age-related human diseases exhibit evidence of decreased mitochondrial respiration, including frequent defects in OXPHOS complex assembly, suggesting the interesting possibility that alterations in mtFAS might contribute to mitochondrial impairments in human disease. The role(s) of mtFAS in aging and more prevalent diseases that also involve mitochondrial pathologies such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer are essentially unstudied. One recent publication suggested that lipoylation of PDH and expression of <italic>Oxsm</italic> may be decreased in some tissues in diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). This raises the intriguing prospect that augmenting mtFAS pathway function could â€˜boostâ€™ or rescue mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in settings where mitochondrial respiration is sub-optimal. Recent studies have shown enhancement of mitochondrial metabolism upon ACP overexpression, although the molecular mechanisms and dependence of these phenotypes on mtFAS are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). It is therefore important to thoroughly examine how this pathway functions both in normal biology and in disease settings. Understanding the rate limiting steps in the cycle, its mode of regulation, and the mechanisms through which it can be manipulated could one day allow mtFAS to be harnessed therapeutically to build better mitochondria and treat metabolic disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

CO<sub>2</sub>. To generate mtFAS knockout clones, two guides per gene were designed targeting exon 1 or exon 2 of the mouse <italic>Mcat</italic>, <italic>Oxsm</italic>, and <italic>Mecr</italic> genes (see key resources table for sequences) and cloned in the pLentiCRISPR v2 vector. Parental C2C12 cells were transfected with pLentiCRISPRv2_sgmtFAS or empty vector. Editing efficiency was assessed in the bulk transfected population by T7E1 assay. Briefly, DNA was isolated using QuickExtract solution (Lucigen). Edited regions were PCR amplified with the primers listed in the key resources table. PCR products were denatured, reannealed, and digested with T7E1 endonuclease (New England Biologicals), which cleaves mismatched DNA. Digests were run on a 2% agarose gel, visualized with SYBR safe DNA stain (Invitrogen) and percent editing was calculated as the sum of the cleaved fragments divided by the total DNA in each lane. To establish clonal lines, 48 hr after transfection, the cells were sorted based on GFP signal and plated in a 96-well plate to obtain single cell colonies. Colony number and size was assessed by brightfield microscopy. Clones were screened based on MCAT, OXSM, and MECR protein levels. Three <italic>Oxsm</italic> and <italic>Mecr</italic> mutant clones, three control clones, and two <italic>Mcat</italic> mutant clones were ultimately selected for further experiments. Quantification of single cell clone number and colony size was assessed 7 days after single cell sort. Small clones =Â &lt;150 cells, MedÂ =Â 150â€“500 cells, Large =Â &gt;500 cells. For growth assays, cells were plated at 100,000 cells/plate in 10 cm dishes in 4.5 g/L glucose and counted every 24 hr using a BioRad TC20 automated cell counter.

Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and gently dried under a nitrogen stream at room temperature. Samples were resuspended in 200 ÂµL EtOAc and transferred to GC-MS vials with insert. GC-MS analysis was performed with an Agilent 5977b GC-MS HES-MSD and an Agilent 7693A automatic liquid sampler. Samples were injected (1 ÂµL) 10:1, with an inlet temperature of 250Â°C. The gas chromatograph had an initial temperature of 67Â°C for one minute followed by a 50Â°C/min ramp to 197Â°C, a second ramp of 10Â°C/minute up to 325Â°C began immediately with a hold time of 2 minutes. A 30-meter Agilent Zorbax DB-5MS with 10 m Duraguard capillary column was employed for chromatographic separation. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a rate of 1 mL/minute.

Matrixes of the theoretical isotopic abundances and the measured isotopic abundances were created. The multiplicative inverse of each matrix was calculated and then the dot product of the theoretical inverse matrix and the measured inverse matrix was calculated. The data from one row of the resulting matrix (all rows are identical) is then sum normalized.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need (within reason), to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Nowinski et al. describe a novel role for mtFAS in mitochondrial respiratory metabolism, independent of protein lipoylation, the best characterized function of the mtFAS system. mtFAS is a poorly characterized mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway which is comprised of at least 6 enzymes. This pathway synthesizes an eight-carbon saturated fatty acid, which is subsequently converted into lipoic acid, an indispensable cofactor for some mitochondrial enzymes. In addition to lipoic acid precursor, mtFAS also produces longer-chain fatty acids, yet the physiological function of these mtFAS-driven longer fatty acids remain unclear. In the current manuscript, the authors show that hypomorphic mtFAS mutant cultured clonal cells exhibit a loss of ETC supercomplexes that is independent of mtFAS protein lipoylation activity.</p><p>Although the results are of interest, the are several issues related to study design and level of mechanistic insight that need to be addressed. How the myFAS pathway regulates the ECT complexes assembly and stability required for optimal mitochondrial activity and how it controls myoblast differentiation are unclear. Without such data, this study will have more limited impact.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A Crispr/Cas9-based strategy is used on skeletal myoblasts to mutate mtFAS genes, followed by the generation of clonal cell lines. This strategy was only partially successful, as the authors failed to identify a single null mutant for any of the genes targeted. Instead, the authors opted for a detailed comparison of distinct clonal cell lines with incomplete target ablation. This is technically challenging due to possible interclonal heterogeneity and long-term compensatory mechanisms. The authors should either perform rescue experiments within clonal cell lines or consider a short-term knockdown approach in polyclonal myoblast cell lines.</p><p>2) It remains unclear how mtFAS supports ETC function, either by producing free metabolites or acyl-ACP. To demonstrate acylation-dependency, the authors could evaluate if a mutant acylation-free ACP1 can interact with LYRM proteins (NDUFA6 and LYRM4).

This strategy was only partially successful, as the authors failed to identify a single null mutant for any of the genes targeted. Instead, the authors opted for a detailed comparison of distinct clonal cell lines with incomplete target ablation. This is technically challenging due to possible interclonal heterogeneity and long-term compensatory mechanisms. The authors should either perform rescue experiments within clonal cell lines or consider a short-term knockdown approach in polyclonal myoblast cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. In response, we have now constructed genetic rescue clonal lines of Mcat, Oxsm, and Mecr mutants by stably expressing retroviral constructs for each gene in the appropriate mutant. As expected, we show that re-expression of the relevant mtFAS gene in the cognate mutant cell population rescues growth in both glucose and galactose, which requires mitochondrial respiration (new Figure 1C and Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1 C and D). We also show that this maneuver also rescues lipoylation, SDHB stability, and ETC complex stability/assembly via BN-PAGE (Figure 2E, 2F, Figure 2â€”figure supplement 1 D and E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It remains unclear how mtFAS supports ETC function, either by producing free metabolites or acyl-ACP. To demonstrate acylation-dependency, the authors could evaluate if a mutant acylation-free ACP1 can interact with LYRM proteins (NDUFA6 and LYRM4). In addition, the authors should examine mtFAS-dependent physical interaction of ACP and LYRM proteins in wild-type and mtFAS mutant cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewersâ€™ intense interest in this question. Unfortunately, while it may seem approachable on the surface, a number of issues detailed below make it an incredibly difficult question to answer. However, evidence from a number of sources support our conclusion that ACP acylation and LYRM binding is the key factor in regulation of ETC assembly.</p><p>Acyl chains are covalently linked to ACP via a 4â€™-phosphopantetheine (4â€™-PP) co-factor that is attached to a conserved serine residue. Structural studies from several labs have shown that the 4â€™-PP co-factor participates in the physical interactions with LYRM proteins, including LYRM4 and NDUFA6 (Cory et al., 2017; Fiedorczuk et al., 2016). These studies and others have shown that mutant ACP loses physical interaction with LYRM4 (Cory et al., 2017; Majmudar et al., 2019; Van Vranken et al., 2016; Van Vranken et al., 2018). However, to accurately assess the requirement of ACP acylation one cannot use a mutant (lacking the serine residue), acylation-free ACP because this construct also lacks the 4â€™-PP. These studies cannot separate the effects of loss of 4â€™-PP from the effects of loss of acylation. Therefore, we did not repeat the numerous studies in the literature using a mutant ACP at this time.</p><p>The second question raised by the reviewers, regarding the mtFAS-dependent physical interaction of ACP and the LYRM proteins LYRM4 and NDUFA6 in wild type and mtFAS mutant cells, is also essentially impossible to address because, as demonstrated by our proteomics data, NDUFA6 and LYRM4 are not stable in mtFAS mutant cells. We have now added western blot data confirming the decreased abundance of LYRM4 that we previously observed in our proteomics study. These data demonstrate that it is undetectable by western blot in mtFAS mutant cell lines (Figure 3H). Although we purchased 3 separate commercially available NDUFA6 antibodies, none gave us detectable signal of a reasonably sized protein (one did give a band at 75kDa, however NDUFA6 has a predicted molecular weight of 18kDa).</p><p>We have previously observed a perfect correlation between LYRM stability and ACP interaction in yeast mtFAS mutants (Van Vranken et al., 2018). In other words, when the LYRM protein is stable, interaction with ACP is maintained in the absence of acylation, thus we speculate from these data that NDUFA6 and LYRM4 require interaction with acylated ACP for their stability. However, when the LYRM protein is not stable in the absence of acylation, this makes it difficult to assess changes in physical interaction via co-immunoprecipitation, because the LYRM proteins are greatly decreased in abundance in the input samples (Van Vranken et al., 2018). Nevertheless, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with a tagged ACP and endogenous LYRM4 in wildtype and mtFAS mutant cells as requested by reviewers. As you can see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, LYRM4 co-immunoprecipitates with ACP specifically in wild type cells expressing the tagged ACP, however the experiment is uninterpretable because LYRM4 is absent from the Oxsm mutant input, in agreement with our other data. Because this experiment is not interpretable as to the causal mechanistic question, we feel it should not be included in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58041-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We were hesitant to overexpress tagged LYRM4 and NDUFA6 constructs because we feared that this might overcome decreased binding affinity in the absence of acylation. However, it appears that in fact even overexpression of these LYRM proteins does not create stably expressed tagged protein. Despite achieving 30% transfection efficiency with peGFP in our wild type and mtFAS mutant C2C12 lines, we were unable to detect the tagged LYRM proteins (expressed from the CMV promoter) in either input or immunoprecipitated lysates. We then turned to 293T as a more robustly transfectable system to verify the expression and interaction of tagged LYRM4, even though we lack a mtFAS mutant 293T cell line. Even in wild type 293T, overexpression of tagged LYRM4 proved very difficult, and was only faintly visible when co-immunoprecipitated with ACP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We believe this is likely because overexpression of these LYRM proteins in the absence of their other binding partners (NFS1 and ISCU in the case of LYRM4, and complex I in the case of NDUFA6) does not result in the creation of stable protein, an effect that has been seen for numerous other electron transport chain subunits. If the reviewers feel that inclusion of these Co-IP data in 293T improve the manuscript, we are happy to include this data in Figure 3â€”figure supplement 1.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58041-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 5, the authors suggest that the defective ETC assembly and reductive carboxylation are independent of protein lipoylation by using Lipt<sub>1/2</sub> mutant cells.

Consistent with our hypothesis, Lipt1 mutants show no difference or slightly increased expression of MCAT, OXSM, and MECR proteins.
