Perturbations in the activity or abundance of epigenetic factors can lead to tumorigenesis. Remarkably, several metabolites influence the epigenetic landscape in cells. Here, we investigated the interplay between a highly expressed epigenetic factor, YEATS2, and a metabolic enzyme, GCDH, in regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in head and neck cancer. We report that the histone reader YEATS2 is responsible for increased invasive potential in head and neck cancer in an SP1-dependent manner. YEATS2 functions by maintaining histone crotonylation, and its abrogation leads to a global decrease in the H3K27cr mark. Mechanistically, we report that YEATS2 maintains high promoter H3K27cr levels by assisting in the recruitment of crotonyltransferase p300 at the promoter of the EMT-promoting gene <italic>SPARC</italic>. Furthermore, we found that the addition of the H3K27cr mark is also dependent on the crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme GCDH. Overall, we describe a novel mechanism of interplay between epigenetics and metabolism in head and neck tumorigenesis, which results in the enhanced expression of EMT-related genes in a histone crotonylation-dependent manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Head and neck cancer</kwd><kwd>histone crotonylation</kwd><kwd>YEATS2</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>GCDH</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STR/2020/000093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shukla</surname><given-names>Sanjeev</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Indian Council for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-8984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shukla</surname><given-names>Sanjeev</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG/2021/004949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shukla</surname><given-names>Sanjeev</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>YEATS2 and GCDH are upregulated in head and neck cancer in an SP1-dependent manner, leading to enhanced levels of promoter histone crotonylation which in turn elevates expression of EMT-associated SPARC.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Head and neck cancer (HNC) is an umbrella term associated with a number of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx. Like other solid tumors of epithelial origin, head and neck cancer involves a multi-step progression towards malignancy, of which transition from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype is a pivotal event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). This epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) involves dramatic changes like loss of cell polarity and acquisition of migratory and invasive properties in the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ribatti et al., 2020</xref>). Underlying this remarkable external transformation in tumor cells, are equally notable changes in gene expression and signalling pathways. Moreover, widespread alteration in the gene expression program of cancer cells undergoing EMT can be a result of either altered activity or the change in abundance of several epigenetic factors. Tumor-specific epigenomic changes thus allow HNC cells to tweak the expression levels of multiple genes at once, thereby leading to a drastic transformation in phenotype during metastasis. These large-scale changes are due to the rapid and global nature of epigenetic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Similar to epigenetic changes, metabolic rewiring is another important hallmark of cancer cells capable of carrying out vast tumor-promoting changes rapidly. Numerous reports in the past have documented instances of loss-of-function mutations or changes in the gene expression of enzymes involved in key metabolic processes, such as glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, to promote oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). However, the discovery of non-canonical functions of several enzymes and their atypical localization in the nucleus has intrigued cancer researchers of late. Metabolic enzymes are now believed to play a more direct role in influencing oncogene expression via crosstalk with the epigenome. One such phenomenon is the role of metabolites produced as a result of aberrant metabolism in acting as substrates for epigenetic factors. A groundbreaking study in this regard by Wellen et al. reported the nuclear localization of a mitochondria-resident protein ACLY/ACL (adenosine triphosphate–citrate lyase). Nuclear pool of ACLY was found to affect histone acetylation directly by producing acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) in colon carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wellen et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, another study reported a direct interaction between α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH) and a histone acetyltransferase leading to the production of localized succinyl-CoA in nucleus, which in turn led to histone succinylation and enhanced expression of genes related to tumor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is another metabolic enzyme known to exhibit a non-canonical function by directly affecting gene transcription. We have recently reported the role of nuclear PKM2-HIF1α-p300 axis in maintaining high levels of H3K9ac marks at the promoter of <italic>PFKFB3</italic>, which thereby leads to its increased expression in hypoxic breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pandkar et al., 2023</xref>). The reports stated herein, along with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diehl and Muir, 2020</xref>), delineate the role of the nexus between aberrant metabolism and the epigenome in regulating various aspects of tumorigenesis in a wide variety of cancers. However, the significance of this partnership in regulating EMT, which is one of the most vital events in cancer, remains largely unexplored.</p><p>In this study, we have made an attempt to dissect the role of a previously unknown link between epigenetic factors and metabolism in promoting EMT in head and neck cancer. To explore tumor-promoting epigenetic factors in HNC, we analyzed large gene expression dataset and narrowed down our search to YEATS2 (YEATS-domain containing protein 2). This gene was found to be overexpressed in HNC, had significant correlation with EMT, and also showed association with poor patient prognosis. YEATS2 is a histone reader protein capable of recognizing epigenetic marks such as histone acetylation and crotonylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Through RNA-seq, it was revealed that silencing of YEATS2 led to a decrease in the expression of multiple EMT-associated genes. Furthermore, the transcription factor SP1 was found to be responsible for YEATS2 expression in HNC. While exploring the relationship of YEATS2 with cancer cell metabolism, we found that YEATS2 is co-expressed with crotonyl-CoA producing GCDH (glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase) in HNC, and the downregulation of either of these two genes led to a decrease in H3K27cr levels in HNC cells. The H3K27cr mark has been previously reported to activate the transcription of pro-tumorigenic <italic>ETS1</italic> in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liao et al., 2023</xref>). Corroborating with the previous finding, high H3K27cr level at the promoter region was associated with an increase in the expression of EMT-related <italic>SPARC</italic> gene. We also demonstrated that YEATS2 interacts with the epigenetic writer p300 to recruit it to the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter, facilitating the deposition of H3K27cr marks. Subsequent investigation revealed that YEATS2 and GCDH worked synergistically in maintaining higher levels of H3K27cr at the promoter of <italic>SPARC</italic>, thereby causing an increase in its expression. Finally, H3K27cr ChIP-seq in YEATS2-abrogated cells uncovered the role of YEATS2 in maintaining global histone crotonylation on the promoter of a large number of genes, many of those genes being associated with EMT. Altogether, we have elucidated a novel link that unifies epigenetic regulation and metabolic rewiring in contributing toward the enhancement of EMT in head and neck cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>YEATS2 is overexpressed in head and neck cancer</title><p>In order to study cancer-associated epigenetic factors, we analysed publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) mRNA expression dataset. The analysis aimed at obtaining genes coding for epigenetic factors that are overexpressed in HNC, and are also significantly associated to overall patient survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The analysis resulted in a list of 10 epigenetic factors that are upregulated in HNC and whose expression levels are associated with poor overall patient survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The expression of these three epigenetic factors was thus evaluated at mRNA level using reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) in pairs of 8 head and neck normal and cancer tissues collected as a part of this study.

A 3D invasion assay was also performed to check the ability of tumor spheres to invade a collagen matrix in YEATS2-knockdown and -overexpressed conditions. It was observed that a reduced number of cells invaded the collagen matrix when YEATS2 was downregulated. The opposite pattern was observed in both the cell lines when YEATS2 was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>).

Luciferase assay was performed in two different HNC cell lines, BICR10 and SCC9. A significant decrease in the luciferase activity was observed for shorter promoter-deletion construct (Luc-311) compared to the full-length construct (Luc-508) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Transcription factor binding-site analysis was then performed with the sequence unique to Luc-508, the region potentially responsible for transcriptional regulation of <italic>YEATS2</italic>. This analysis revealed the presence of multiple consensus binding sites of SP1 and KLF5 transcription factors.

Being a histone reader with a varying magnitude of affinity for multiple histone modifications, the function of YEATS2 could be potentially influenced by the metabolic state of the cell since metabolic intermediates can act as substrates for histone modifying proteins. Therefore, in order to explore the influence of cellular metabolism on the dynamics of histone modifications maintained by YEATS2, we wanted to look into the metabolic enzymes that are co-expressed with YEATS2 in HNC. For this, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with a comprehensive list of essential metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Su et al., 2020</xref>) and found out that KEGG LYSINE DEGRADATION was the top-most pathway associated with high <italic>YEATS2</italic> expression in TCGA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The saccharopine pathway (canonical pathway for lysine degradation) results in conversion of lysine to 2 molecules of acetyl-CoA, with several intermediates including crotonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leandro and Houten, 2020</xref>). Since it is known that YEATS2 has a higher affinity for binding crotonyl groups on histone (specifically on H3K27 residue) than other histone substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesized that the crotonyl-CoA producing enzyme glutaryl CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH), which is a part of lysine degradation pathway, would have increased expression in HNC. We found that <italic>GCDH</italic> was upregulated and had an inverse pattern of expression with the downstream enzyme <italic>ECHS1 (</italic>Enoyl Coenzyme A hydratase, short chain 1<italic>)</italic> in TCGA cancer vs. normal tissue dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the mRNA expression of <italic>GCDH</italic> was significantly upregulated in head and neck cancer samples relative to their matched normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, correlation analysis performed between the expression levels of <italic>GCDH</italic> and <italic>YEATS2</italic> in TCGA data showed significant Spearman correlation coefficient value of 0.32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We then proceeded to check the levels of histone crotonylation (H3K27cr) in a set of nuclear protein lysates obtained from HNC tissues and found that the abundance of this histone mark was higher in tumor as compared to normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, we performed IHC to evaluate the levels of ECHS1, GCDH, YEATS2, H3K27cr, and Twist1 in HNC tumor and their matched normal tissue sections. ECHS1 expression was notably reduced in tumor tissues, whereas GCDH, YEATS2, H3K27cr, and Twist1 exhibited increased staining intensity in tumor sections compared to the adjacent normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings indicate that the presence of YEATS2 and GCDH is possibly leading to an increase in the EMT phenotype (indicated by higher Twist1 expression) in cancer cells by promoting histone crotonylation. Furthermore, our observations suggest that an elevated GCDH/ECHS1 ratio in HNC tissues may be associated with increased levels of histone crotonylation. Since mitochondrial fraction of GCDH cannot influence histone crotonylation directly, we checked its subcellular localization in HNC tissues. Using immunohistochemistry, we detected the presence of nuclear GCDH in HNC tissues and observed that the regions that stained strongly for nuclear GCDH, also showed abundance in H3K27cr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Conversely, the weakly stained regions for nuclear GCDH were less abundant in H3K27cr levels. This established an association between the presence of H3K27cr marks and the expression of GCDH in HNC. Further, on checking the levels of H3K27cr on YEATS2- and GCDH-knockdown using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, we found that the cells silenced for either of the two genes caused a decrease in H3K27cr levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). On the other hand, an increase in H3K27cr signal was observed when YEATS2 was overexpressed ectopically in BICR10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). These findings indicate a coordinated regulation of histone crotonylation in HNC cells by the epigenetic factor YEATS2 and the metabolic enzyme GCDH.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>YEATS2 and glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) regulate histone crotonylation in head and neck cancer (HNC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) plot showing enrichment of KEGG LYSINE_DEGRADATION_PATHWAY in TCGA samples stratified as YEATS2_high as compared to YEATS2_low samples (NES- net enrichment score, NOM p- nominal p-value).

We then performed integration of those genes having YEATS2 ChIP-seq peaks on their promoters with the genes that were downregulated in sh<italic>YEATS2</italic> vs. shControl RNA-seq data, and the genes included in the hallmark EMT gene signature. We found that <italic>SPARC</italic> was the common gene present in all 3 sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The mRNA expression level of <italic>SPARC</italic> in TCGA dataset was also found to be higher in tumor as compared to normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, we chose to further investigate <italic>SPARC</italic> as a direct gene target of YEATS2 in mediating EMT in HNC. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a secreted glycoprotein known to be a part of extracellular matrix (ECM). It interacts with various components of ECM and is known to play a role in processes like tissue remodeling and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rivera et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tremble et al., 1993</xref>). By performing YEATS2 ChIP-qPCR in YEATS2-downregulated cells, we found that the binding of YEATS2 on <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter decreased on its knockdown in BICR10 as well as SCC9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We then checked the expression of <italic>SPARC</italic> at the RNA level on YEATS2-downregulation. <italic>SPARC</italic> expression was decreased in YEATS2-knockdown conditions in both the cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Since SPARC is a secretory protein, we investigated its level in conditioned media obtained from shControl and sh<italic>YEATS2</italic> BICR10 cells. We found a decrease in the secreted pool of SPARC on YEATS2-knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We also observed a decrease in the cellular levels of SPARC protein in SCC9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Since the binding of a histone reader protein to a gene promoter cannot solely lead to its increased expression, we explored the possibility of the involvement of a writer protein in collaborating with YEATS2 to maintain higher levels of SPARC in HNC. For this, we checked the expression of p300, a known writer of H3K27cr mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xie et al., 2024a</xref>) in humans, in TCGA dataset. We found that p300 (<italic>EP300</italic> gene) had increased expression in tumor vs. normal HNC dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). On performing p300-ChIP assay, it was found that its binding was reduced in YEATS2-silenced BICR10 cells when compared to the shControl cells, indicating the potential role of p300 in leading to increased expression of SPARC in HNC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To validate our claim, we performed immunoblotting after p300 knockdown and found that the expression of SPARC in supernatant derived from sh<italic>EP300</italic> BICR10 cells was reduced as compared to shControl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Furthermore, we performed p300 pulldown in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment to check if YEATS2 and p300 function in a protein complex. We discovered the presence of YEATS2 in the p300-immunoprecipitate sample, clearly indicating that YEATS2 and p300 function together as a complex to drive the expression of SPARC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). This set of results indicates a sophisticated epigenetic mechanism promoting increased transcription of the EMT-related gene SPARC in HNC. Finally, we wanted to check the effect of SPARC on invasion. It was observed that the decrease in invasion seen on YEATS2-downregulation was rescued by SPARC overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–J</xref>). This indicates that SPARC is a direct target of YEATS2 and acts as a downstream effector of YEATS2 in maintaining invasive phenotype in HNC cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>YEATS2 regulates expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related SPARC in head and neck cancer (HNC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram showing <italic>SPARC</italic> gene obtained after integration of RNA-seq data (genes downregulated in shControl vs. sh<italic>YEATS2</italic>), YEATS2 ChIP-seq data and, hallmark EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION gene signature.

On performing knockdown of GCDH, we observed a decrease in SPARC at protein and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We then sought to explore the possibility of localized histone crotonylation performed by a multi-protein complex consisting of YEATS2 and GCDH. For this, we performed co-immunoprecipitation; however, we did not observe an interaction between GCDH and YEATS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), ruling out the possibility of the localized production of crotonyl-CoA at a specific gene locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kinnaird et al., 2016</xref>).

However, having detected the presence of nuclear pool of GCDH in HNC tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), we wanted to investigate the role of YEATS2 in affecting the subcellular localization of GCDH in HNC cells.

This indicates that YEATS2 might be involved in regulating the transport of GCDH inside nucleus indirectly by an unknown mechanism. In order to further investigate this epigenome-metabolism interplay, we checked the role of YEATS2 and GCDH in regulating SPARC expression in the absence of SP1. The dual overexpression of YEATS2 and GCDH in SP1-silenced cells rescued the SPARC levels to a greater degree; whereas, YEATS2 and GCDH when overexpressed alone, could only partially rescue SPARC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).

We have shown that the histone reader regulates expression of important EMT-related genes. The mechanism employed by YEATS2 for gene regulation was also investigated. The YEATS domain confers unique properties to this epigenetic factor, making it suitable for binding with modifications other than acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). As stated earlier, YEATS2 has a binding affinity for a variety of chemical groups. Among all histone modifications screened, YEATS2 had the highest affinity for histone crotonylation, specifically at the histone H3 lysine 27 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). There have been conflicting reports about the role of crotonylation at the H3K27 position. YEATS domain-containing GAS41 was found to recruit SIN3A-HDAC1 complex in a H3K27cr-dependent manner at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, thereby leading to their repression in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Conversely, another study in colorectal cancer showed that high H3K27cr at the promoter of <italic>ETS1</italic> gene led to an increase in its expression and promoted metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liao et al., 2023</xref>). In our findings, we have corroborated the latter study by showing the association of H3K27cr with the activation of an EMT-associated gene.</p><p>With the discovery of a plethora of novel histone modifications, researchers have been facing the challenge to understand the role of these marks in influencing gene expression. A group of such histone marks, known as the non-acetyl acylation marks, consists of a wide variety of chemical moieties which differ in structure and chemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). Due to the differences amongst these histone marks, it is obvious to assume that the proteins interacting with such histone modifications would not be the same as those interacting with histone acetylation or methylation. YEATS domain is one of the domains that has affinity for non-acetyl histone acylation marks. There are four members in the family of YEATS-domain containing proteins, AF9, YEATS2, ENL, and, GAS41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). By using multiple high-throughput next generation sequencing techniques, we have strengthened the evidence for the role of YEATS2 in upregulating the expression of EMT-associated gene targets by maintaining a non-acetyl histone mark on their promoters. Global abrogation of pro-EMT genes was seen in RNA-seq data of YEATS2-silenced cells, which was underlaid by a simultaneous decrease seen in H3K27cr levels observed in H3K27cr ChIP-seq. This established a direct relationship between tumorigenic gene expression and histone crotonylation in cancer. Furthermore, in order to thoroughly investigate this link, we have integrated different sets of NGS data and found that invasion-associated gene <italic>SPARC</italic> gene is a direct target of H3K27cr-mediated regulation by YEATS2, and is possibly one of the many ways in which the EMT-promoting effect of YEATS2 is relayed downstream. As a part of the tumor microenvironment, SPARC mediates ECM-tumor cell communication. Several reports have suggested the role of SPARC in contributing towards a pro-invasive phenotype in cells of multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carriere et al., 2021</xref>). Presence of SPARC in tumor stroma was reported to be responsible for recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in high-grade breast carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sangaletti et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we observed that the SPARC was capable of rescuing the decrease in invasive properties of YEATS2-silenced cells, making it the functional downstream effector of YEATS2.</p><p>We have discovered a direct interaction between YEATS2 and epigenetic writer p300 in our study. Research has demonstrated diversity among histone reader families, each exhibiting preferences for specific histone marks. However, considerable overlap exists among histone marks deposited by the same histone writer. Notably, we found that one of the most promiscuous acyltransferases, p300, can deposit H3K27cr marks at the <italic>SPARC </italic>gene promoter in a YEATS2-dependent manner. Using ChIP assays and rescue experiments, we showed that p300 binds to <italic>SPARC </italic>promoter and its binding is reduced in the absence of YEATS2. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of p300-mediated crotonylation at H3K27 and other histone residues in the crucial process of early embryonic development. Depletion of p300 led to reduced histone crotonylation resulting in dysregulated gene expression in developing embryos causing them to be arrested at the 8 cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gao et al., 2024</xref>). Our study adds to the growing body of research underscoring the importance of YEATS2- and p300-mediated histone crotonylation in both physiological and pathological processes.</p><p>Our study demonstrates the cooperation between an epigenetic factor and a metabolic enzyme working together to mediate EMT-promoting gene expression. This crosstalk has not been reported in head and neck cancer previously. Since epigenetic changes and aberrant metabolism are both major hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diehl and Muir, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2018</xref>), it is important to investigate the metabolism-epigenetics axis in order to yield new therapeutic targets. Increasing evidences suggest that the state of chromatin in a cell is a reflection of the metabolic enzymes functioning inside the nucleus. Through gene set enrichment analysis, we found that there was a significant correlation between YEATS2 and the lysine degradation pathway in HNC. This led to the observation that one of the enzymes crucial for the production of crotonyl-CoA, GCDH is overexpressed in HNC. Previous reports have suggested that metabolic enzymes could affect epigenomic changes by functioning closely with epigenetic factors. Studies showing the presence of multi-subunit complexes consisting of a metabolite-producing enzyme, DNA-binding protein, and a histone writer are a testament to the fact that metabolism-epigenome collaboration is more direct than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matsuda et al., 2016</xref>). Although we did not observe direct association of GCDH and YEATS2, we did establish that the nuclear presence of GCDH causes an increase in histone crotonylation in HNC. As per the evidence provided by us, it could be proposed that the surge in GCDH in YEATS2-high cancer cells affects the chromatin by increasing the pool of crotonyl-CoA inside nucleus, which acts as a substrate for histone-modifying enzymes. Since YEATS2 works by recruiting p300 via recognition of histone marks, maintenance of crotonylation at promoter regions could be dependent on sites with a constitutive basal level of H3K27cr or other marks, as a histone reader cannot recognize a genomic locus devoid of pre-existing histone marks. Such constitutive sites would be used by YEATS2 as an anchor to recruit p300 and subsequently induce histone crotonylation on nearby ‘inducible’ sites. Further investigation is needed to precisely locate and distinguish between constitutive and inducible sites of histone crotonylation. Moreover, we have shown that SP1 transcriptionally regulates both YEATS2 and GCDH. This hints towards a possibility of a direct axis initiated by an unknown upstream factor working in order to modify the chromatin in such a manner that it benefits the cancer cell by causing an increase in the tumorigenic properties of the cell.</p><p>In conclusion, we have presented a sophisticated interplay between YEATS2 and GCDH, where the upregulation of both factors contributes towards the enhancement of EMT in head and neck cancer by changes in the global EMT-favoring gene expression, mediated through promoter histone crotonylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our findings provide new insights into the metabolic–epigenetic crosstalk driving EMT and identify the YEATS2–GCDH–SPARC axis as a potential therapeutic target in HNC.</p><fig id="fig9"

We have implemented constructive revisions to the manuscript to address the reviewer’s concerns effectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Comments:</p><p>(1) The title, &quot;Interplay of YEATS2 and GCDH mediates histone crotonylation and drives EMT in head and neck cancer,&quot; appears somewhat misleading, as it implies that YEATS2 directly drives histone crotonylation. However, YEATS2 functions as a reader of histone crotonylation rather than a writer or mediator of this modification. It cannot itself mediate the addition of crotonyl groups onto histones. Instead, the enzyme GCDH is the one responsible for generating crotonyl-CoA, which enables histone crotonylation. Therefore, while YEATS2 plays a role in recognizing crotonylation marks and may regulate gene expression through this mechanism, it does not directly catalyse or promote the crotonylation process.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comment regarding the precision of our title. We agree that the initial wording 'mediates' could imply a direct enzymatic role for YEATS2 in histone crotonylation, which is indeed not the case. As the reviewer correctly points out, YEATS2 functions as a 'reader' of histone crotonylation marks.</p><p>However, our research demonstrates that YEATS2 plays a crucial indirect regulatory role in the establishment of these crotonylation marks. Specifically, our data indicates that YEATS2 facilitates the recruitment of the histone crotonyltransferase p300 to specific gene promoters, such as that of <italic>SPARC</italic>. This recruitment mechanism directly impacts the localized deposition of crotonyl marks on nearby histone residues. Therefore, while YEATS2 does not directly catalyze the addition of crotonyl groups, its presence and interaction with p300 are essential for the regulation and establishment of histone crotonylation at these critical sites.</p><p>To accurately reflect this nuanced, yet significant, regulatory mechanism, we have revised the title. We are replacing 'mediates' with 'regulates' to precisely convey that YEATS2 influences the histone crotonylation process, albeit indirectly, through its role in recruiting the enzymatic machinery. The updated title will now read: 'Interplay of YEATS2 and GCDH regulates histone crotonylation and drives EMT in head and neck cancer.' We believe this change maintains the core message of our findings while enhancing the scientific accuracy of the title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The study suggests a link between YEATS2 and metastasis due to its role in EMT, but the lack of clinical or pre-clinical evidence of metastasis is concerning. Only primary tumor (PT) data is shown, but if the hypothesis is that YEATS2 promotes metastasis via EMT, then evidence from metastatic samples or in vivo models should be included to solidify this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable suggestion regarding the need for clinical or pre-clinical evidence of metastasis. We fully agree that direct evidence linking YEATS2 to metastasis would significantly strengthen our claims, especially given its demonstrated role in EMT.</p><p>Our primary objective in this study was to meticulously dissect the molecular mechanisms by which YEATS2 regulates histone crotonylation and drives EMT in head and neck cancer. We have provided comprehensive upstream and downstream molecular insights into this process, culminating in a clear demonstration of YEATS2's functional importance in promoting EMT through multiple in vitro phenotypic assays (e.g., Matrigel invasion, wound healing, 3D invasion assays). As the reviewer notes, EMT is a widely recognized prerequisite for cancer metastasis[1]. Therefore, establishing YEATS2 as a driver of EMT directly implicates its potential role in metastatic progression.</p><p>To further address the reviewer's concern and bridge the gap between EMT and metastasis, we have performed additional analyses that will be incorporated into the revised manuscript:</p><p>Clinical Correlation with Tumor Grade: We analyzed publicly available head and neck cancer patient datasets. Our analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between YEATS2 expression and increasing tumor grade. Specifically, we observed significantly higher YEATS2 expression in Grade 2-4 tumors compared to Grade 1 tumors. Given that higher tumor grades are frequently associated with increased metastatic potential and poorer prognosis in HNC[2], this finding provides compelling clinical correlative evidence linking elevated YEATS2 expression to more aggressive disease.</p><p>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for Metastasis Pathways: To further explore the biological processes associated with YEATS2 in a clinical context, we performed GSEA on TCGA HNC patient samples stratified by high versus low YEATS2 expression. This analysis robustly demonstrated a positive enrichment of metastasis-related gene sets in the high YEATS2 expression group, compared to the low YEATS2 group. This strengthens the mechanistic link by showing that pathways associated with metastasis are co-ordinately upregulated when YEATS2 is highly expressed.</p><p>These new clinical data provide strong correlative evidence supporting a direct association of YEATS2 with metastasis, building upon our detailed mechanistic dissection of its role in EMT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There seems to be some discrepancy in the invasion data with BICR10 control cells (Figure 2C). BICR10 control cells with mock plasmids, specifically shControl and pEGFP-C3 show an unclear distinction between invasion capacities. Normally, we would expect the control cells to invade somewhat similarly, in terms of area covered, within the same time interval (24 hours here). But we clearly see more control cells invading when the invasion is done with KD and fewer control cells invading when the invasion is done with OE. Are these just plasmid-specific significant effects on normal cell invasion? This needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful examination of Figure 2C and their insightful observation regarding the appearance of the control cells in relation to the knockdown (Figure 2B) and overexpression (Figure 2C) experiments. We understand how, at first glance, the control invasion levels across these panels might seem disparate.</p><p>We wish to clarify that Figure 2B (YEATS2 knockdown) and Figure 2C (YEATS2 overexpression) represent two entirely independent experiments, conducted with distinct experimental conditions and methodologies, as detailed in our Methods section.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>Figure 2B (Knockdown): Utilizes lentivirus-mediated transduction for stable shRNA delivery (shControl as control).</p><p>Figure 2C (Overexpression): Utilizes transfection with plasmid DNA (pEGFP-C3 as control) via a standard transfection reagent.</p><p>These fundamental differences in genetic manipulation methods (transduction vs. transfection), along with potential batch-to-batch variations in reagents or cell passage number at the time of each independent experiment, can indeed lead to variations in absolute basal invasion rates of control cells[3].</p><p>Therefore, the invasion capacity of BICR10 control cells in Figure 2B (shControl) should only be compared to the YEATS2 knockdown conditions within that same panel. Similarly, the invasion capacity of control cells in Figure 2C (pEGFP-C3) should only be compared to the YEATS2 overexpression conditions within that specific panel. The crucial finding in each panel lies in the relative change in invasion caused by YEATS2 manipulation (knockdown or overexpression) compared to its respective, concurrently run control.</p><p>We have ensured that all statistical analyses (as indicated in the figure legends and methods) were performed by comparing the experimental groups directly to their matched internal controls within each independent experiment. The significant increase in invasion upon YEATS2 overexpression and the significant decrease upon YEATS2 knockdown, relative to their respective controls, are robust and reproducible findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 3G, the Western blot shows an unclear band for YEATS2 in shSP1 cells with YEATS2 overexpression condition. The authors need to clearly identify which band corresponds to YEATS2 in this case.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the ambiguity in the YEATS2 Western blot for the shSP1 + pEGFP-C3-YEATS2 condition in Figure 3G. We apologize for this lack of clarity. The two bands seen in the shSP1+pEGFP-C3-YEATS2 condition correspond to the endogenous YEATS2 band (lower band) and YEATS2-GFP band (upper band, corresponding to overexpressed YEATS2-GFP fusion protein, which has a higher molecular weight). To avoid confusion, the endogenous band is now highlighted (marked by *) in the lane representing the shSP1+pEGFP-C3-YEATS2 condition. We have also updated the figure legend accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In ChIP assays with SP1, YEATS2 and p300 which promoter regions were selected for the respective genes? Please provide data for all the different promoter regions that must have been analysed, highlighting the region where enrichment/depletion was observed. Including data from negative control regions would improve the validity of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout our study, we have performed ChIP-qPCR assays to check the binding of SP1 on <italic>YEATS2</italic> and <italic>GCDH</italic> promoter, and to check YEATS2 and p300 binding on <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter.

A critical missing piece is the level of ECSH1 in patient samples. This will clearly delineate if the balance shifted towards crotonylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer's insightful comment regarding the importance of assessing ECSH1 levels in patient samples to clearly delineate the metabolic balance shifting towards crotonylation. We fully agree that this is a critical piece of evidence.</p><p>To directly address this point and substantiate our claim regarding the altered metabolic balance in HNC, we had previously analyzed the expression of both GCDH and ECHS1 in TCGA HNC RNA-seq data (as presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B). This analysis revealed a consistent increase in GCDH expression and a concomitant decrease in ECHS1 expression in tumor samples compared to normal tissues. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that this altered expression profile would indeed lead to an accumulation of crotonyl-CoA and, consequently, an overall increase in histone crotonylation in HNC.</p><p>To further validate and extend these findings at the protein level, we have now performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis for both ECHS1 and GCDH in a cohort of HNC normal vs. tumor tissues. Our IHC results strikingly corroborate the RNA-seq data: GCDH consistently showed increased protein expression in tumor samples, whereas ECHS1 exhibited significantly reduced protein expression in tumors compared to their adjacent normal counterpart tissues (Figure 4E).</p><p>These new data, combined with existing TCGA HNC RNA-seq analysis strongly supports our proposed mechanism where altered GCDH and ECHS1 expression contributes to increased histone crotonylation in head and neck cancer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The p300 ChIP data on the SPARC promoter is confusing. The authors report reduced p300 occupancy in YEATS2-silenced cells, on SPARC promoter. However, this is paradoxical, as p300 is a writer, a histone acetyltransferase (HAT). The absence of a reader (YEATS2) shouldn't affect the writer (p300) unless a complex relationship between p300 and YEATS2 is present. The role of p300 should be further clarified in this case. Additionally, transcriptional regulation of SPARC expression in YEATS2 silenced cells could be analysed via downstream events, like Pol-II recruitment. Assays such as Pol-II ChIP-qPCR could help explain this.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer's insightful observation regarding the apparently paradoxical reduction of p300 occupancy on the SPARC promoter upon YEATS2 silencing (Figure 5F), and their call for further clarification of p300's role and the potential complex relationship with YEATS2. We agree that this point required further mechanistic investigation.</p><p>As we have shown through RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses, YEATS2 broadly influences histone crotonylation levels at gene promoters, thereby impacting gene expression. While p300 is indeed a known histone acetyltransferase (HAT) with promiscuous acyltransferase activity, including crotonyltransferase activity[4], the precise mechanism by which its occupancy is affected by a 'reader' protein like YEATS2 was unclear. Our initial data suggested a dependency of p300 recruitment on YEATS2.</p><p>To directly address the reviewer's concern and thoroughly delineate the molecular mechanism of cooperativity between YEATS2 and p300 in regulating histone crotonylation, we have now performed a series of targeted experiments, which have been incorporated into the revised manuscript:</p><p>(a) Validation of p300's role in SPARC expression: We performed p300 knockdown in BICR10 cells, followed by immunoblotting to assess SPARC protein levels. As expected, a significant decrease in SPARC protein levels was observed upon p300 knockdown (Figure 5G). This confirms p300's direct involvement in SPARC gene expression.</p><p>(b) Direct interaction between YEATS2 and p300: To investigate a potential physical association, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to check for an interaction between endogenous YEATS2 and p300. Our results clearly demonstrate the presence of YEATS2 in the p300-immunoprecipitate sample, indicating that YEATS2 and p300 physically interact and likely function together as a complex to drive the expression of target genes like <italic>SPARC</italic> (Figure 5H). This direct interaction provides the mechanistic basis for how YEATS2 influences p300 occupancy.</p><p>(c) Impact on transcriptional activity (Pol II recruitment): As suggested, we performed RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) ChIP-qPCR on the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter in YEATS2 knockdown cells. We observed a significant decrease in Pol II occupancy on the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter after YEATS2 knockdown in BICR10 cells (Figure 6C). This confirms that YEATS2 silencing leads to reduced transcriptional initiation/elongation at this promoter.</p><p>(d) p300's direct role in H3K27cr on <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter: To confirm p300's specific role in crotonylation at this locus, we performed H3K27cr ChIP-qPCR after p300 knockdown. As anticipated, a significant decrease in H3K27cr enrichment was observed on the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter upon p300 knockdown (Figure 6J), directly demonstrating p300's crotonyltransferase activity at this site.</p><p>(e) Rescue of p300 occupancy and H3K27cr by YEATS2 overexpression in SP1deficient cells: To further establish the YEATS2-p300 axis, we performed SP1 knockdown (which reduces YEATS2 expression) followed by ectopic YEATS2 overexpression, and then assessed p300 occupancy and H3K27cr levels on the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter. While SP1 knockdown led to a decrease in both p300 and H3K27cr enrichment, we observed a significant rescue of both p300 occupancy and H3K27cr enrichment upon YEATS2 overexpression in the shSP1 cells (Figure 6K and L). This provides strong evidence that YEATS2 acts downstream of SP1 to regulate p300 recruitment and H3K27cr levels.</p><p>Collectively, these comprehensive new results clearly establish that YEATS2 directly interacts with and assists in the recruitment of p300 to the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter. This recruitment is crucial for p300's localized crotonyltransferase activity, leading to increased H3K27cr marks and subsequent activation of <italic>SPARC</italic> transcription. This clarifies the previously observed 'paradox' and defines a novel cooperative mechanism between a histone reader (YEATS2) and a writer (p300) in regulating histone crotonylation and gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The role of GCDH in producing crotonyl-CoA is already well-established in the literature. The authors' hypothesis that GCDH is essential for crotonyl-CoA production has been proven, and it's unclear why this is presented as a novel finding. It has been shown that YEATS2 KD leads to reduced H3K27cr, however, it remains unclear how the reader is affecting crotonylation levels. Are GCDH levels also reduced in the YEATS2 KD condition? Are YEATS2 levels regulating GCDH expression? One possible mechanism is YEATS2 occupancy on GCDH promoter and therefore reduced GCDH levels upon YEATS2 KD. This aspect is crucial to the study's proposed mechanism but is not addressed thoroughly.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's valuable comment questioning the novelty of GCDH's role in crotonyl-CoA production and seeking further clarification on how YEATS2 influences crotonylation levels beyond its reader function.</p><p>We agree that GCDH's general role in producing crotonyl-CoA is well-established[5,6]. Our study, however, aims to delineate a novel epigenetic-metabolic crosstalk in head and neck cancer, specifically investigating how the interplay between the histone crotonylation reader YEATS2 and the metabolic enzyme GCDH contributes to increased histone crotonylation and drives EMT in this context.</p><p>Our initial investigations using GSEA on publicly available TCGA RNA-seq data revealed that HNC patients with high YEATS2 expression also exhibit elevated expression of genes involved in the lysine degradation pathway, prominently including GCDH. Recognizing the known roles of YEATS2 in preferentially binding H3K27cr7 and GCDH in producing crotonylCoA, we hypothesized that the elevated H3K27cr levels observed in HNC are a consequence of the combined action of both YEATS2 and GCDH. We have provided evidence that increased nuclear GCDH correlates with higher H3K27cr abundance, likely due to an increased nuclear pool of crotonyl-CoA, and that YEATS2 contributes through its preferential maintenance of crotonylation marks by recruiting p300 (as detailed in Figure 5F-H and Figure 6J-L of the manuscript and elaborated in our response to point 7). Thus, our work highlights that both YEATS2 and GCDH are crucial for the regulation of histone crotonylation-mediated gene expression in HNC.</p><p>To directly address the reviewer's query regarding YEATS2's influence on GCDH levels and nuclear histone crotonylation:</p><p>• YEATS2 does not transcriptionally regulate GCDH: We did not find any evidence of YEATS2 directly regulating the expression levels of GCDH at the transcriptional level in HNC cells.</p><p>• Novel finding: YEATS2 regulates GCDH nuclear localization: Crucially, we discovered that YEATS2 downregulation significantly reduces the nuclear pool of GCDH in head and neck cancer cells (Figure 7G). This is a novel mechanism suggesting that YEATS2 influences histone crotonylation not only by affecting promoter H3K27cr levels via p300 recruitment, but also by regulating the availability of the crotonyl-CoA producing enzyme, GCDH, within the nucleus.</p><p>• Common upstream regulation by SP1: Interestingly, we found that both YEATS2 and GCDH expression are commonly regulated by the transcription factor SP1 in HNC. Our data demonstrate that SP1 binds to the promoters of both genes, and its downregulation leads to a decrease in their respective expressions (Figure 3 and Figure 7). This provides an important upstream regulatory link between these two key players.</p><p>• Functional validation of GCDH in EMT: We further assessed the functional importance of GCDH in maintaining the EMT phenotype in HNC cells. Matrigel invasion assays after GCDH knockdown and overexpression in BICR10 cells revealed that the invasiveness of HNC cells was significantly reduced upon GCDH knockdown and significantly increased upon GCDH overexpression (results provided in revised manuscript Figure 7F and Figure 7—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>These findings collectively demonstrate a multifaceted role for YEATS2 in regulating histone crotonylation by both direct recruitment of the writer p300 and by influencing the nuclear availability of the crotonyl-CoA producing enzyme GCDH. We acknowledge that the precise molecular mechanism governing YEATS2's effect on GCDH nuclear localization remains an exciting open question for future investigation, but our current data establishes a novel regulatory axis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The authors should provide IHC analysis of YEATS2, SPARC alongside H3K27cr and GCDH staining in normal vs. tumor tissues from HNC patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion.

We are committed to making beneficial changes to the manuscript in order to alleviate the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerns:</p><p>(1) The patient cohort is very small with just 10 patients. To establish a significant result the cohort size should be increased.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

Patient details are provided in Supplementary file 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) YEATS2 maintains H3K27Cr levels at the SPARC promoter. The p300 is reported to be hyper-activated (hyperautoacetylated) in oral cancer. Probably, the activated p300 causes hyper-crotonylation, and other protein factors cause the functional translation of this modification. The authors need to clarify this with a suitable experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment regarding the functional relationship between YEATS2 and p300 in the context of H3K27cr, especially considering reports of p300 hyper-activation in oral cancer. We agree that a precise clarification of p300's role and its cooperativity with YEATS2 is crucial to fully understand the functional translation of this modification.</p><p>As we have shown through global RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses, YEATS2 broadly affects gene expression by regulating histone crotonylation levels at gene promoters. We also recognize that the histone writer p300 is a promiscuous acyltransferase, known to add various non-acetyl marks, including crotonylation[4]. Our initial data, showing decreased p300 occupancy on the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter upon YEATS2 downregulation (Figure 5F), suggested a strong dependency of p300 on YEATS2 for its recruitment. To fully delineate the molecular mechanism of this cooperativity and clarify how YEATS2 influences p300-mediated histone crotonylation and its functional outcomes, we have performed the following series of experiments, which have been integrated into the revised manuscript:</p><p>(a) Validation of p300's role in SPARC expression: We performed p300 knockdown in BICR10 cells, followed by immunoblotting to assess SPARC protein levels. As expected, a significant decrease in SPARC protein levels was observed upon p300 knockdown (Figure 5G). This confirms p300's direct involvement in SPARC gene expression.</p><p>(b) Direct interaction between YEATS2 and p300: To investigate a potential physical association, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to check for an interaction between endogenous YEATS2 and p300. Our results clearly demonstrate the presence of YEATS2 in the p300-immunoprecipitate sample, indicating that YEATS2 and p300 physically interact and likely function together as a complex to drive the expression of target genes like SPARC (Figure 5H). This direct interaction provides the mechanistic basis for how YEATS2 influences p300 occupancy.</p><p>(c) Impact on transcriptional activity (Pol II recruitment): As suggested, we performed RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) ChIP-qPCR on the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter in YEATS2 knockdown cells. We observed a significant decrease in Pol II occupancy on the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter after YEATS2 knockdown in BICR10 cells (Figure 6C). This confirms that YEATS2 silencing leads to reduced transcriptional initiation/elongation at this promoter.</p><p>(d) p300's direct role in H3K27cr on <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter: To confirm p300's specific role in crotonylation at this locus, we performed H3K27cr ChIP-qPCR after p300 knockdown. As anticipated, a significant decrease in H3K27cr enrichment was observed on the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter upon p300 knockdown (Figure 6J), directly demonstrating p300's crotonyltransferase activity at this site.</p><p>(e) Rescue of p300 occupancy and H3K27cr by YEATS2 overexpression in SP1-deficient cells: To further establish the YEATS2-p300 axis, we performed SP1 knockdown (which reduces YEATS2 expression) followed by ectopic YEATS2 overexpression, and then assessed p300 occupancy and H3K27cr levels on the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter. While SP1 knockdown led to a decrease in both p300 and H3K27cr enrichment, we observed a significant rescue of both p300 occupancy and H3K27cr enrichment upon YEATS2 overexpression in the sh<italic>SP1</italic> cells (Figure 6K and L). This provides strong evidence that YEATS2 acts downstream of SP1 to regulate p300 recruitment and H3K27cr levels.</p><p>Collectively, these comprehensive new results clearly establish that YEATS2 directly interacts with and assists in the recruitment of p300 to the <italic>SPARC</italic> promoter. This recruitment is crucial for p300's localized crotonyltransferase activity, leading to increased H3K27cr marks and subsequent activation of <italic>SPARC</italic> transcription. This clarifies the previously observed 'paradox' and defines a novel cooperative mechanism between a histone reader (YEATS2) and a writer (p300) in regulating histone crotonylation and gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I do not entirely agree with using GAPDH as a control in the western blot experiment since GAPDH has been reported to be overexpressed in oral cancer.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that GAPDH was not used as a loading control for protein expression comparisons between normal and tumor samples. GAPDH was used as a loading control only in experiments using head and neck cancer cell lines where shRNA-mediated knockdown or overexpression was employed. These manipulations specifically target the genes of interest and are not expected to alter GAPDH expression, making it a suitable loading control in these instances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The expression of EMT markers has been checked in shControl and shYEATS2 transfected cell lines (Figure 2A). However, their expression should first be checked directly in the patients' normal vs. tumor samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now checked the expression of EMT marker Twist1 alongside YEATS2 expression in normal vs. tumor tissue samples using IHC (Figure 4E).</p><p>(7) In Figure 3G, knockdown of SP1 led to the reduced expression of YEATS2 controlled gene Twist1. Ectopic expression of YEATS2 was able to rescue Twist1 partially. In order to establish that SP1 directly regulates YEATS2, SP1 should also be re-introduced upon the knockdown background along with YEATS2 for complete rescue of Twist1 expression.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern regarding the partial rescue of Twist1 in SP1 depleted-YEATS2 overexpressed cells, we performed the experiment as suggested by the reviewer.

Ponceau is typically used for transfer validation. For the same patient, western blot loading controls like Actin/GAPDH should be shown. Also, at various places throughout the manuscript, Ponceau staining has been used.

In such extracellular protein analyses, traditional intracellular housekeeping genes (like Actin or GAPDH) are not applicable. Ponceau S has been used as a control for showing SPARC expression in secretory fraction of mammalian cell lines in previous studies as well11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The manuscript briefly mentions that p300 was identified as the only protein with increased expression in tumours compared to normal tissue in the TCGA dataset. What other writers were checked for? Did the authors check for their levels in HNC patients?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. As stated by previous studies [12,13], p300 and GCN5 are the histone writers that can act as crotonyltransferases at the H3K27 position. Although the crotonyltransferase activity of GCN5 has been demonstrated in yeast, it has not been confirmed in human. Whereas the histone crotonyltransferase activity of p300 has been validated in human cells using in vitro HCT assays[4,14]. Therefore, we chose to focus on p300 for further validation of its role in YEATS2mediated regulation of histone crotonylation. We did not check the levels of p300 in HNC patient tissues. However, p300 showed higher expression in tumor as compared to normal in publicly available HNC TCGA RNA-seq data (Figure 5—figure supplement 1G).</p><p>We acknowledge that the original statement in the manuscript, 'For this we looked at expression of the known writers of H3K27Cr mark in TCGA dataset, and discovered that p300 was the only protein that had increased expression in tumor vs. normal HNC dataset…', was indeed slightly misleading. Our intention was to convey that p300 is considered the major and most validated histone crotonyltransferase capable of influencing crotonylation at the H3K27 position in humans, and that its expression was notably increased in the HNC TCGA tumor dataset. We have now reframed this sentence in the revised manuscript to accurately reflect our findings and focus, as follows:</p><p>'For this, we checked the expression of p300, a known writer of H3K27cr mark in humans, in the TCGA dataset.
