In this study, we describe a kinase-independent function of AKT. In cancer cells harboring gain-of-function alterations in MET, HER2, or Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K), catalytically inactive AKT (K179M) protected from drug induced cell death in a PH-domain dependent manner. An AKT kinase domain mutant found in human melanoma (G161V) lacked enzymatic activity in vitro and in AKT1/AKT2 double knockout cells, but promoted growth factor independent survival of primary human melanocytes. ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors failed to block the kinase-independent function of AKT, a liability that limits their effectiveness compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors. Our results broaden the current view of AKT function and have important implications for the development of AKT inhibitors for cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03751.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03751.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03751.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To maintain a healthy body, the ability of our cells to survive and divide is normally strictly controlled. If any cells manage to escape these restrictions, they may rapidly divide and form tumors, which can lead to cancer.</p><p>A protein called AKT can encourage cells to survive and divide, and in healthy cells it is only allowed to be active at specific times. However, in many cancer cells, the genes that make and control AKT activity can be altered by mutations, which can result in AKT being active at the wrong times.</p><p>Part of the AKT protein acts as an enzyme called a kinase and adds chemical groups called phosphates to other proteins. The phosphate groups can activate or deactivate these proteins to control cell survival and cell division. However, there are other sections to the AKT protein and it is not clear how they are involved in this protein's activity.</p><p>In this study, Vivanco et al. show that AKT has another role in cell survival that does not depend on its kinase. The experiments show that even when the kinase part of the protein is missing, AKT can help cancer cells to survive drug treatments and external conditions that would normally kill them. This role requires another section of the protein called the PH-domain.</p><p>There are several chemicals—called inhibitors—that can stop AKT from working properly, and they have the potential to be used to treat some types of cancer. These inhibitors work in different ways: some were able to block the activity of the kinase, but others inhibited AKT by binding to other parts of the protein. Therefore, to develop AKT inhibitors into effective drugs, it will be important to know precisely what role the protein plays in different types of cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03751.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03751.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>AKT</kwd><kwd>cell survival</kwd><kwd>kinase-independent</kwd><kwd>PI3K</kwd><kwd>oncogenic</kwd><kwd>kinase inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS080944–01, U54CA143798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vivanco</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhi C</given-names></name><name><surname>Yannuzzi</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><name><surname>Campos</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM096558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanos</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

AKT is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, usually due to mutations in upstream components of the Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway. AKT signaling is required for tumor maintenance in certain genetic contexts, as has been shown for some cancer cell lines harboring PI3K mutations or amplification of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">She et al., 2008</xref>). Encouraged by these results, several ATP-competitive and allosteric AKT inhibitors have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engelman, 2009</xref>), but optimal strategies for the clinical development of these agents are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To address this question, we compared the activity of the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirai et al., 2010</xref>) with the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heerding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rhodes et al., 2008</xref>) and GDC0068 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Each of these AKT inhibitors dose dependently inhibited AKT kinase activity in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line EBC1 as determined by phosphorylation of three AKT substrates (PRAS40, GSK3β, and BAD) in whole-cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Okuzumi et al., 2009</xref>), the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors induced hyper-phosphorylation of AKT at the two regulatory phosphorylation sites threonine 308 and serine 473. When we compared the ability of the AKT inhibitors to induce cell death using a trypan blue exclusion assay, we observed significantly greater cell death induction by the allosteric inhibitor MK2206 compared to the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1B—source data 1</xref>) and GDC0068 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1C—source data 1</xref>) despite less complete inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation at these drug concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03751.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Differential sensitivity of human cancer cells to different classes of AKT inhibitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of AKT inhibitors on phosphorylation of AKT and AKT protein substrates.

For this purpose, we first generated EBC1 cells with doxycycline-inducible human-specific shRNAs for both AKT 1 and AKT 2 and then expressed a kinase-deficient (AKT1-K179M) AKT1 cDNA of murine origin that is partially resistant to knockdown due to mismatches in the mouse sequence. Protein levels of the hairpin-resistant AKT allele after doxycycline induction were similar to the levels of endogenous AKT in parental EBC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, top, lanes 6 and 8 vs lanes 1 and 3).

In the absence of growth factors, AKT is inactive because intermolecular interactions between the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domain (KD) keep the kinase in a closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calleja et al., 2009</xref>). Following growth factor stimulation, AKT shifts to an open conformation and becomes accessible to phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473, a process that requires localization of AKT to the plasma membrane through the interaction with the phospholipid products of PI3K, phosphatidyl-inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>], and PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>. Using a PI pull-down assay, we observed that MK2206 markedly impaired phosphoinositide binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This result is consistent with findings from structural studies that allosteric AKT inhibitors lock AKT in a closed conformation with its phospholipid binding site blocked by the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast to our findings with MK2206, incubation with the ATP-competitive inhibitor GSK690693 increased binding of AKT to PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and this was associated with increased localization of AKT to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03751.017</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Kinase-dead AKT protects from drug-induced cell death in a PH-domain-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/− cells stably transduced with human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged AKT2 were treated with vehicle, MK2206, or GSK690693 for 4 hr and lysed.

Our findings that catalytically inactivating kinase domain mutations (AKT1-K179M, AKT2-K181M, AKT2-G161V) or ATP-competitive inhibitor binding to wild-type AKT can promote phosphoinositide binding document the critical importance of the kinase domain conformation on AKT PH-domain functions. It also suggests that hyper-phosphorylation of AKT in response to ATP-competitive inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Okuzumi et al., 2009</xref>) may not only be due to impaired phosphatase access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2011</xref>) but also due to increased phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, given that the loss of phosphoinositide binding does not completely abolish the pro-survival function of kinase-deficient AKT, we suspect that the PH-domain promotes cell survival through regulation of interacting protein partners, and that perturbations in the kinase domain can influence PH-domain function by altering the ability of AKT to reach the appropriate sub-cellular compartment (likely those richest in PI(4,5)P2) and/or interact with specific effector proteins. Further studies are required to identify the effectors of catalytically inactive AKT and define its contribution to other AKT-regulated cellular processes.</p><p>Our findings have implications for the development of drugs to block AKT in cancer. Previous studies have shown that cancer-associated AKT mutations that favor an open conformation show reduced sensitivity to allosteric AKT inhibitors but retain sensitivity to ATP-competitive inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calleja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Parikh et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we show that cancer cells with aberrant AKT activation by common PI3K pathway lesions (HER2, PIK3CA, MET) show the opposite drug sensitivity profile with reduced sensitivity to ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors. The inability of ATP-competitive inhibitors to suppress non-catalytic AKT functions in certain genetic contexts may represent a liability compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors. This concept remains to be tested in ongoing clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals and antibodies</title><p>MK2206, GSK690693, and crizotinib were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Previous studies have established that AKT provides important survival signals mediated by the phosphorylation of protein substrates, Previous studies have established that AKT provides important survival signals mediated by the phosphorylation of protein substrates. Here the authors demonstrate that AKT also promotes survival by a mechanism that is independent of AKT substrate phosphorylation. The identity of this mechanism is not described. Nevertheless, the conclusions of the paper are novel, interesting, and potentially significant for cancer therapy. However, the conclusions of this study are not fully supported by the data presented.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) One weakness of this study is that it is largely based on over-expression of mutant AKT. Controls using WT AKT are not presented (with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>); this important control should be included in each experiment. Moreover, studies of AKT expressed at endogenous levels are essential. Only two studies designed to examine AKT expressed at endogenous levels are presented. The first is a shRNA knock-down/rescue with a shRNA-resistant mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This experiment is difficult to interpret because the mutant AKT is clearly over-expressed and knocked down by the shRNA (despite being stated to be shRNA-resistant). The experiment also lacks controls for off-target actions of the shRNA pools. The second study is an shRNA experiment on endometrial cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) that lacks controls for off-target effects of the shRNA pools. Additional validation of a kinase-independent function of AKT expressed at endogenous levels is required. For example, can the survival function of kinase-dead AKT be phenocopied by blocking upstream pathways that lead to AKT activation?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: The authors argue that the ability of ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors to create complexes with their target(s) that are capable of providing survival signals is revealed by their ability to suppress crizotinib-induced cell death. This would be more clearly validated by a comparison with an “allosteric” inhibitor.</p><p>3) The protein localization data are unclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B, D</xref>), because the conclusions regarding membrane localization are compromised by the apparent membrane ruffling that causes a higher local density of membrane that can give the false appearance of concentration.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: The data obtained with mAKT1-K179M lacking a PH domain are difficult to interpret. Is it targeted to the plasma membrane? Is it substantially resident in other membrane compartments? Could these data indicate that membrane targeting is important, rather than indicating that the survival signals are generated away from membranes, as stated?</p><p>5) The analysis is focused on cells with gain-of-function of pathways leading to Akt activation, including MET and PI3K-pathway mutations. Data on survival in response to allosteric vs ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors using cells without this gain-of-function would provide some initial insight into the potential cancer v normal-cell therapeutic window.</p><p>6) The HA blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2B</xref> is difficult to interpret.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03751.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In response to the reviewers’ excellent suggestions, we have conducted a series of additional experiments that clarified several key points brought up by several reviewers:</p><p>To address the role of AKT protein levels in our observations with kinase-dead AKT allels, To address the role of AKT protein levels in our observations with kinase-dead AKT allels, we now expressed wildtype AKT in multiple cell lines (EBC1, MCF7, MDA-MB-361) and show that wild-type AKT is not sufficient to promote cell survival. We also provided more experimental detail regarding our experiment where we knocked down endogenous (human) AKT and replaced it with a murine, kinase dead AKT protein.</p><p>Regarding the subcellular localization of kinase-deficient AKT mutants, Regarding the subcellular localization of kinase-deficient AKT mutants, we performed additional confocal microscopy experiments. We again found increased plasma membrane localization of kinase-deficient AKT. Furthermore, by re-introducing wild type or kinase-deficient AKT alleles into AKT1/2 double knockout cells, we show enhanced activation loop phosphorylation (T308) in mutant AKT, a phosphorylation event that occurs at the cytoplasmic membrane.</p><p>We now document that the allosteric AKT inhibitor, We now document that the allosteric AKT inhibitor, unlike ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors, does not antagonize the ability of a MET kinase inhibitor to induce cell death in MET-amplified cancer cells.

To address this question, we now overexpressed wild type AKT1 or wild type AKT2 in several cancer cell lines and repeated key experiments with this additional control. Unlike the W80A-AKT mutants, which cannot bind MK2206, expression of wild type AKT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1A</xref>) or AKT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1B</xref>) does not rescue MDA-MB361 breast cancer cells from MK2206-induced cell death (indicated by red arrows below).

The targeting sequences used to knock down AKT1 in our experiments (CCCGAGGTGCTGGAGGACA and GGCAAGGTGATCCTGGTGA) are based on human AKT1 and we used murine AKT as a “rescue” allele. As indicated in the Materials and methods section of our revised manuscript, human and murine AKT1 are mismatched only at one or two nucleotides (underlined) relative to each of the targeting sequences (CCTGAGGTGCTGGAGGACA and GGGAAGGTGATTCTGGTGA), likely explaining the incomplete rescue. Nonetheless, despite the effects of the shRNA-hairpins on the murine mRNA, only cells expressing the murine AKT1 cDNA show residual AKT1 following doxycycline treatment. [Please compare, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref> below, lanes 6 and 8 (green arrows) to lanes 2 and 4 (red arrows).] Of note, levels of residual K179M-mAKT1 (lanes 6 and 8, green arrows) are roughly equivalent to the endogenous AKT levels seen in the absence of doxycycline (lanes 1 and 3, blue arrows), an effect not seen with AKT2 expression. In our revised manuscript, we have revised the figure and text to explain this point more clearly.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>EBC1 cells were stably transduced with doxycycline‐inducible human‐specific AKT1 and AKT2 shRNAs (Control) and subsequently transduced with a murine kinase‐deficient AKT1 cDNA (mAKT1‐K179M).

We found that the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor GSK690693 does not promote cell survival if we block all AKT activating signals through pharmacological PI3-kinase inhibition with the PI3K inhibitor BKM-120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref>). These data suggests that even the kinase-independent functions of AKT require a PI3K input.

In our revised manuscript, we are showing the full experiment which included the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206 and the crizotinib/MK2206 combination.

In our original manuscript, we showed increased phosphorylation of the kinase-deficient AKT1 mutant (K179M) at Serine 308 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 5A</xref>). Other investigators have shown that phosphorylation of AKT at T308 occurs at the plasma membrane (Stephens et al., Science 1998, PMID: 9445477), and we believe that this is consistent with our previously provided immunofluorescence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 5B</xref>).</p><p>In response to the reviewers, we have now also examined the cellular localization of kinase deficient AKT2 (K181M). As shown in confocal images of wild type vs. mutant AKT2 in stably-transduced EBC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 5C</xref>, left column), kinase-deficient AKT2 more robustly colocalizes with the plasma membrane marker Na+/K+ ATPase than its wild type counterpart. Furthermore, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we co-stained these cells with phalloidin which binds F-actin and marks membrane ruffles. We found increased membrane localization of mutant AKT2 even in the absence of membrane ruffles (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 5C</xref>, right column).

The non-catalytic function of AKT requires the presence of the PH domain, as demonstrated by our data with the Δ PH-Myr-Akt1-K179M mutant. Together with the results of our experiments using the R86C and R25C mutants, this data suggest that the kinase-independent function of AKT might require targeting to specific membranes or membrane subdomains, likely those richest in PI(4,5)P2, to which the mutants show enhanced binding.</p><p><italic>5) The analysis is focused on cells with gain-of-function of pathways leading to Akt activation, including MET and PI3K-pathway mutations.

While we have found that amplification of MET and activating PIK3CA-mutations are associated with sensitivity to AKT allosteric inhibitors, we find that the EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines are completely refractory to cell death induction by either MK2206 or GSK690693. Given that these EGFR mutations are capable of activating AKT (PMID: 15731348), these data suggest that the mechanism of PI3K activation (e.g. EGFR activation vs MET activation) is likely critical in establishing AKT dependence.
