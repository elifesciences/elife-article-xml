A gain of function screen for genes that enable proliferation independently of matrix anchorage identified a cell adhesion molecule PVRL4 (poliovirus-receptor-like 4), also known as Nectin-4. PVRL4 promotes anchorage-independence by driving cell-to-cell attachment and matrix-independent integrin β4/SHP-2/c-Src activation. Solid tumors frequently have copy number gains of the PVRL4 locus and some have focal amplifications. We demonstrate that the transformation of breast cancer cells is dependent on PVRL4.

These layers provide inner linings to various cavities and hollow organs throughout the body—including the lungs and glandular organs such as mammary glands. A single-cell layer of epithelium is separated from the tissues beneath it by a supporting substance called the extracellular matrix. The individual cells within a single-cell layer are physically attached to the matrix, and when displaced from it, they promptly undergo programmed cell death. This mechanism preserves the single-cell layer pattern throughout the body and prevents epithelial cells from growing in inappropriate locations.</p><p>It is estimated that up to 90% of cancers in humans originate in epithelial tissue, and the cells within such tumors are known to survive and divide even when they are no longer attached to the extracellular matrix. Understanding how cancerous cells gain this ability may lead to new approaches to stopping tumor cells from dividing and colonizing tissues around the body.</p><p>To address this problem, Pavlova et al. explored which genes enable epithelial cells from the human mammary gland to grow without being attached to the extracellular matrix. They found that the gene that codes for a protein called poliovirus receptor-like 4 (PVRL4) allows attachment-free cell growth and also makes cells cluster together once detached from the matrix.</p><p>Normally, the <italic>PVRL4</italic> gene is not active in breast epithelial cells, but its activity is detected in many breast, lung, and ovarian tumors. Moreover, cancerous cells tend to cluster together when they are detached from the extracellular matrix. This behavior is particularly evident in the cells that divide aggressively to form tumors that subsequently migrate and colonize other tissues around the body. When Pavlova et al. used genetic techniques to silence PVRL4 in cells from breast tumors, they found that it reduced the formation of clusters by the cancer cells and also reduced their ability to grow in the absence of attachment.</p><p>Pavlova et al. also showed that interactions between the PVRL4 in one cell and a related protein called PVRL1 in a neighboring cell were responsible for holding the cells together in clusters. Moreover, PVRL4 triggers a form of signaling between the cells called integrin β4 signaling that allows them to survive without being anchored to the extracellular matrix.</p><p>Finally, Pavlova et al. found that injecting anti-PVRL4 antibodies (mouse proteins that attach to PVRL4 and prevent the formation of clusters) slows down the growth of breast tumors in mice. These findings suggest that inhibiting PVRL4 action with antibodies can be used as a new approach to the treatment of breast, lung, and ovarian cancers in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00358.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00358.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>anchorage-independence</kwd><kwd>transformation</kwd><kwd>genetic screen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Defense BCRP</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elledge</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elledge</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A protein called PVRL4 has a central role in a number of cancers that originate in epithelial tissue, and anti-PVRL4 antibodies could be used to treat some of these cancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As many as 90% of all human cancers originate from epithelial tissues. Epithelia have a distinct ability to form and maintain highly organized monolayers, which is reflected in their role in providing the inner lining of hollow organs. This unique architecture is dictated by the requirement for an epithelial cell to be physically anchored on a basement membrane, an organizing substratum composed of specific extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Cells physically attach to ECM via integrins, a class of signaling molecules that serve to stimulate the survival and proliferation of cells in a matrix attachment-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hynes, 2002</xref>). Conversely, loss of contact with the proper ECM molecules results in initiation of a cell death program known as anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frisch and Screaton, 2001</xref>), and other constraints on cellular expansion.</p><p>Early stages of epithelial cancer progression are universally characterized with genetic changes that confer ability to survive and proliferate in the absence of an appropriate matrix anchorage, which allows cellular expansion in a geometrically unconstrained manner. Though acquired early, the ability to tolerate the loss of anchorage remains critical for the survival of cancer cells throughout the course of disease progression, encompassing stages such as invasion of the underlying stroma, extravasation into blood vessels, survival in the bloodstream, and, eventually, metastatic outgrowth at a distant site with a distinct matrix composition.</p><p>Along with the loss of the requirement for anchorage, a propensity for self-aggregation is a characteristic of aggressive cancer cells. Thus, tumor-derived subclones with greater metastatic capacity in vivo display increased self-aggregation in vitro; at the same time, subclones selected for increased in vitro aggregation were found to be more metastatic in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Updyke and Nicolson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saiki et al., 1991</xref>). Invasion of the underlying stroma is frequently undertaken by large groups of tumor cells, a phenomenon known as collective, or cohort, cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>). Clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been identified from the blood samples of breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer patients as well as from mouse tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Molnar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hou et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, one report demonstrated that, on average, 50% of all breast and lung CTCs exist in circulation as aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2012</xref>). An increase in clustering behavior is not limited to self-aggregation, as interactions with a variety of other cell types have been shown to be essential for the dissemination of cancer cells and subsequent metastatic colonization. Thus, heterotypic interactions of cancer cells with the endothelial lining within the target organ microvasculature were documented as an initiating event for metastatic lesion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Mehdi et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, signaling elicited by the physical association of cancer cells with other cell types, such as platelets and macrophages, has been demonstrated to be essential for successful seeding and metastatic outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Labelle et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, tumor-specific cell–cell contacts can provide a multifaceted survival advantage throughout the course of pathologic progression. Targeted therapies directed towards blocking such cell–cell contacts may therefore represent a novel cancer treatment approach.</p><p>In this study, we have performed an unbiased genetic screen to identify genes that when overproduced promote anchorage-independent cell growth in a human mammary epithelial cell (TL-HMEC) line. Our screen identified a cell adhesion molecule PVRL4 (poliovirus receptor-like 4), also known as Nectin-4, which we demonstrate to be a potent mediator of anchorage-independent colony formation in normal epithelial and cancer cells alike. We demonstrate that PVRL4 promotes the attachment of individual cells to each other via engaging its receptor PVRL1 on a juxtaposed cell. PVRL4-mediated cell-to-cell attachment triggers integrin β4 signaling in a matrix attachment-independent manner, and interfering with this pathway blocks PVRL4-driven anchorage-independence. Our findings point to a model in which signaling via PVRL4-PVRL1-driven cell–cell contacts serves as a surrogate for cell–matrix signaling in conditions of anchorage loss, thus enabling anoikis evasion and subsequent cellular expansion.</p><p>Finally, we show that blocking PVRL4-driven cell–cell contact assembly with monoclonal antibodies potently inhibits anchorage-independent cellular expansion in vitro as well as the growth of orthotopically implanted tumors in vivo, thus validating the therapeutic utility of this approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genetic screen for genes that enable anchorage-independence</title><p>To identify novel genes involved in the transformation of epithelial cells, we carried out a genetic screen for colony formation in the absence of substratum attachment using a TL-HMEC in vitro transformation system.

Eleven ORFs potently induced anchorage-independent colony formation (a fivefold increase over background), and another eight ORFs produced a moderate phenotype (a two- to fivefold increase over background). According to the recently published copy number variation analysis across a variety of tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beroukhim et al., 2010</xref>), eight out of 11 ORFs that potently induced anchorage-independent growth localized to statistically defined peaks of focal amplification in at least one tumor subtype (p=0.009, Fisher’s exact test), providing strong evidence for positive selection of these genes in cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).

Similarly to other nectins, PVRL4 contains an extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reymond et al., 2001</xref>). Extracellular regions of nectins engage in <italic>trans</italic>-interactions on the interface of two juxtaposed cells.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that PVRL4 protects TL-HMECs from the differentiation associated with anchorage loss and promotes subsequent cellular expansion. Importantly, this phenotype is facilitated by the extracellular part of PVRL4 rather than by its intracellular region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PVRL4 facilitates a cell–cell contact assembly that is required for anchorage-independent growth</title><p>Consistent with its role in promoting cell–cell contact formation, PVRL4 drives rapid association of TL-HMECs into multicellular clusters in suspension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). We sought to rule out the possibility that PVRL4-induced colonies were due to an artifact associated with either incomplete dissociation of cells prior to seeding into methylcellulose or potential de novo association of cells during growth in anchorage-independent conditions. To address this, we mixed equal numbers of dsRed- and GFP-labeled TL-HMECs expressing PVRL4 and (i) seeded them into methylcellulose or (ii) co-cultured the mixed population on an adherent surface, subsequently seeding them into methylcellulose. Examining the colors of resulting colonies revealed that out of 56 colonies from sample (i), all 56 were single-color colonies, whereas in sample (ii), 39 out of 40 colonies were single-color, and only one colony contained both GFP and dsRed-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The rarity of double-color colonies demonstrates that PVRL4-induced colonies originate from individual cells. Consistent with this observation, passing cells through a 35 μm cell strainer immediately prior to being seeded in the absence of anchorage did not affect colony numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), further confirming that PVRL4-induced colonies are clonal in origin and that the observed increase in colony numbers is not a result of pre-existing multicellular clusters having a survival advantage over single cells in the absence of anchorage.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00358.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PVRL4 facilitates cell-to-cell attachment, inhibition of which suppresses anchorage-independence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) PVRL4 promotes cell clustering of TL-HMECs.

To test whether PVRL1 was necessary for PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachment, we used an shRNA to stably deplete the PVRL1 transcript in a dsRed-labeled population of TL-HMECs and allowed cells to aggregate with PVRL4-expressing GFP-labeled TL-HMECs. PVRL1 depletion resulted in exclusion of dsRed-labeled cells from multicellular clusters, whereas control shRNA-expressing cells were readily incorporated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that PVRL4-mediated cell–cell contacts are carried out through interaction with its receptor PVRL1.</p><p>We then asked whether PVRL1 was similarly required for PVRL4-driven anchorage-independence.

We asked whether antibodies directed towards the extracellular domain of PVRL4 could block PVRL4-induced cluster formation and anchorage-independent growth. Cell clustering was completely abrogated in the presence of three independent PVRL4 antibodies, whereas control IgG or a blocking antibody against E-cadherin (DECMA-1) did not produce such an effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Neither of the two molecules possesses catalytic activity; in addition, our data show that transmembrane as well as cytoplasmic regions are dispensable for anchorage-independence. Therefore, we considered the possibility that the assembly of a PVRL4-PVRL1 interacting module on the interface of two neighboring cells may be triggering lateral recruitment and/or activation of cell surface-localized proteins, which, in turn, conveys a prosurvival signal. To identify potential cell surface-localized binding partners of PVRL4, we created a C-terminally HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 construct and first verified that cell–cell clustering as well as anchorage-independent growth phenotypes were not affected by the addition of a C-terminal tag (not shown). We then performed immunoprecipitations with anti-HA agarose beads from lysates of TL-HMECs induced to express either HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 or HA/FLAG-tagged GFP and subjected the eluates to tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Since only the extracellular regions of PVRL4 and PVRL1 are required for anchorage-independent colony formation, we searched the list of PVRL4 IP-specific peptides for those that had at least three unique peptides corresponding to cell surface-localized proteins, as classified by Gene Ontology. We identified the transmembrane protein integrin β4 as specifically interacting with HA/FLAG-PVRL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To validate the putative PVRL4–integrin β4 interaction directly in cells under conditions of anchorage deprivation, we performed immunoprecipitations with anti-HA beads from lysates of suspension-incubated TL-HMECs that expressed either HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 or HA/FLAG-tagged GFP. Immunoblotting for integrin β4 verified a specific association of integrin β4 with PVRL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We next asked if the integrin β4–PVRL4 association was affected by cell clustering. The same amount of integrin β4 coprecipitated with HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 from lysates prepared from multicellular clusters and from single-cell suspension.

Levels of activated SFK dropped precipitously in control cells while remaining high in PVRL4-expressing cells but not in PVRL4-expressing, PVRL1-depleted cells.

Indeed, two independent shRNAs against SHP-2 completely abrogated colony formation induced by PVRL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that PVRL4-driven anchorage-independent growth is facilitated via activation of the integrin β4/SHP-2/Src signaling pathway in a manner that is dependent on cell-to-cell attachment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>PVRL4 maintains the transformed properties of breast cancer cells in vitro</title><p>Having uncovered a role for PVRL4 in enabling epithelial cells to escape growth restriction associated with the lack of proper matrix anchorage, we next sought to test its involvement in driving the tumorigenic properties of breast cancer cells. We first focused on an inflammatory breast tumor cell line SUM190, which contains a particularly high-level focal amplification (∼50 kb) of the <italic>PVRL4</italic> genomic locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beroukhim et al., 2010</xref>). To ask whether PVRL4 is involved in enabling anchorage-independent growth of these cells, we designed four independent shRNAs targeting PVRL4 and stably expressed them in SUM190 cells, confirming the extent of depletion by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Paralleling effects seen in TL-HMECs, spontaneous self-clustering of SUM190 cells was abrogated by anti-PVRL4 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) or by RNAi against PVRL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, heterotypic attachment of SUM190 cells with human lung microvascular endothelial (HMVEC-L) cells was prevented by anti-PVRL4 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) and by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). RNAi against PVRL4 potently reduced both anchorage-independent colony formation and clonogenic growth of SUM190 cells, indicating that PVRL4 is involved in the growth and survival of breast cancer cells. Importantly, observed effects correlated with the degree of RNAi-mediated mRNA depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To verify that the effects of PVRL4 depletion are not limited to SUM190 cells, we expressed anti-PVRL4 shRNAs in two additional breast cancer cell lines, Sk-BR-3 and BT-474 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>), which both express lower levels of PVRL4 than SUM190 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fabre-Lafay et al., 2007</xref>), and observed a strong defect in clonogenic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>) and reduced proliferation in the absence of anchorage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00358.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>PVRL4 is amplified in breast cancer and is essential for the transformed phenotype of cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A view from the integrated Genome Viewer program showing focal amplification of the PVRL4 locus in SUM190 cells.

To address this, we treated mice bearing ∼50 mm<sup>3</sup> SUM190-eGFP xenografts with four consecutive intravenous injections of either anti-PVRL4 monoclonal antibody or isotype control IgG at 15 mg/kg each. After the last treatment, we continued to monitor tumor growth for the next 7 days. Whereas tumor volumes in the control group steadily increased over time, the PVRL4 antibody-treated group displayed a remarkable stalling of tumor growth throughout the course of the injection regimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Immunoblotting of tumor lysates revealed that PVRL4 antibody treatment resulted in a precipitous decline of PVRL4 protein levels, suggesting that cells with the highest expression of PVRL4 were eliminated by the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Dissection of excised xenografts revealed a softer, paste-like composition of PVRL4 antibody-treated tumors compared to the more solid consistency of control-treated samples. This latter observation was corroborated by histological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), which revealed areas of widespread necrosis and, importantly, loss of cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>) when compared to control IgG-treated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Finally, examination of three-dimensional tumor architecture in control- and anti-PVRL4 antibody-treated tumors by two-photon confocal microscopy revealed reduced cell–cell contacts in anti-PVRL4 antibody-treated samples as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The loss of cell contacts and necrosis observed in treated tumors supports our model of PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachments conferring ability to sustain growth in conditions of matrix anchorage loss.</p><p>To test whether an in vivo tumor inhibitory effect of an anti-PVRL4 antibody can be explained by antibody-mediated recruitment of components of innate immunity, we asked whether this antibody was capable of inducing ADCC (antibody-dependent cytotoxicity) in vitro. Specifically, we mixed SUM190 cells with fresh human NK cells and measured the relative degree of cell lysis induced by either anti-PVRL4 antibody or control IgG. No increase in cell lysis was observed with anti-PVRL4 antibody over isotype control-incubated cells, demonstrating that anti-PVRL4 antibody was unable to efficiently recruit Fc receptor-containing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of control and anti-PVRL4 IgG-treated tumor sections for a mouse macrophage-specific marker F4/80 revealed no differences in the extent of macrophage infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the observed inhibitory effect is likely to be a consequence of a direct blockade of PVRL4 function.</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that targeting PVRL4-driven tumors with a monoclonal antibody directed towards its extracellular region results in dramatic inhibition of growth and disruption of cell–cell contacts, demonstrating the therapeutic efficacy of such approach. One caveat associated with targeting junctional proteins as an anticancer therapy strategy is that it may inadvertently induce an EMT phenotype and instigate metastasis. To address this, we measured levels of E-cadherin (an epithelial marker) and vimentin (a mesenchymal marker) in SUM190 xenografts treated with anti-PVRL4 antibody in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5A</xref>) as well as in cultured SUM190 cells in which PVRL4 expression was inhibited by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5B</xref>). In both settings E-cadherin and vimentin protein levels remained unchanged, demonstrating that inhibiting PVRL4 in SUM190 cells does not cause EMT; neither does it select for cells with EMT-like characteristics in vivo.</p><p>Another safety concern associated with targeting PVRL4 with a monoclonal antibody is that such treatment has the potential to induce damaging effects in tissues normally expressing the antigen. Both human and mouse PVRL4 were strongly recognized by anti-PVRL4 antibody when expressed on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>). Among normal mouse tissues, PVRL4 expression is strongest in cornea and skin epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). The skin surface of mice treated with anti-PVRL4 antibodies was not visibly affected by treatment, and mice appeared healthy overall, demonstrating that targeted therapy against PVRL4 does not induce acute side effects in this organism. Taken together with our findings that functionally link PVRL4 to tumorigenesis, as well as with its widespread expression in multiple tumor types, targeting PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachment can be viewed as a potential therapeutic strategy directed against a broad spectrum of tumor types.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have performed an unbiased genetic screen to identify genes that facilitate cell growth in the absence of anchorage. The screen identified PVRL4/Nectin-4 as a potent inducer of anchorage-independent growth in a manner that relies upon formation of physical contacts between individual cells. PVRL4 is expressed in a limited set of normal tissues—namely, skin epidermis, hair follicles, placenta, trachea, and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jelani et al., 2011</xref>)—yet it becomes overexpressed in a large fraction of breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fabre-Lafay et al., 2007</xref>), NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takano et al., 2009</xref>), and ovarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Derycke et al., 2010</xref>) tumors. Analysis of a publicly available dataset of copy number alterations involving <italic>PVRL4</italic> in 484 breast tumors indicates a low-level copy number gain in 60.3% of samples, and high-level amplification in another 7.9% of samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, PVRL4 has emerged as a strong predictor of poor postoperative survival of patients with breast and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athanassiadou et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We show that PVRL4-driven colony formation is carried out exclusively via the extracellular regions of PVRL4 and its interacting partner PVRL1, while transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions are not required for this phenotype. Cytoplasmic regions of nectins recruit afadin, a large scaffold protein involved in mediating intracellular signaling. Interestingly, and in contrast to PVRL4, loss of afadin has been shown to be strongly associated with poor outcome in breast cancer patients in a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Letessier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fournier et al., 2011</xref>). Supporting our findings in TL-HMECs, we found that PVRL4 is required for clonogenic and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells in vitro as well as growth of orthotopically implanted tumors in vivo. In lung cancer cells, siRNA-mediated depletion of PVRL4 was shown to negatively affect adherent growth and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takano et al., 2009</xref>), highlighting the functional role of PVRL4 across multiple cancer types. Importantly, we were able to reverse the clonogenic defect by expressing a chimeric construct consisting of the extracellular region of PVRL4 fused to the transmembrane domain of CD8, independently verifying that its function is carried out via an extracellular route.</p><p>Our findings reveal a potential mechanism of PVRL4-driven anchorage-independent growth. Specifically, we identify integrin β4 as a <italic>cis</italic>-interacting partner of PVRL4 and demonstrate that anchorage-independent growth driven by PVRL4 requires intact integrin β4/SHP-2/SFK signaling. An extensive array of evidence functionally links integrin β4 to breast tumorigenesis. Similarly to PVRL4, integrin β4 expression is associated with poor prognosis and a basal-like expression profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diaz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2008</xref>), and targeting integrin β4 with RNAi was shown to inhibit anchorage-independent growth, invasion, and xenograft growth in breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lipscomb et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bon et al., 2006</xref>). Integrin β4 is thought to exhibit a significant degree of signaling autonomy compared to other integrins, due to its atypically long C-terminus which serves as a scaffold for its downstream effectors. This signaling autonomy was convincingly demonstrated in a study utilizing chimeric constructs where extracellular and transmembrane regions of integrin β4 were substituted with those on the TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase. Dimerization of two such chimeric molecules on the cell surface by adding TrkB ligand, BDNF, was sufficient to drive SFK activation, in a manner dependent on SHP-2 phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Merdek et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Trans</italic>-interactions of cell adhesion molecules are thought to trigger the formation of tightly packed zippers of interacting cell adhesion molecules at a cell–cell contact interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walmod et al., 2004</xref>). One possibility is that <italic>trans</italic>-interacting PVRL4 and PVRL1 similarly organize into zippers at sites of cell–cell contact, driving individual integrin β4 molecules into proximity sufficient for their activation. Matrix attachment-independent activation of integrin molecules may then allow sustained SHP-2/SFK signaling sufficient for counteracting the growth-restrictive consequences of anchorage loss.</p><p>In the context of a multicellular tumor, the PVRL4-PVRL1 associated signaling exemplifies a mechanism by which cell-to-cell attachment serves to mimic attachment to matrix, allowing cells to bypass the growth constraint imposed by the requirement for proper anchorage. Interestingly, we found that multiple oncogenic perturbations facilitate increased intercellular adhesiveness. It remains to be further elucidated whether, and through what mechanisms, the increased ability to form contacts functionally contributes to anchorage-independent growth or other tumorigenesis-associated phenotypes in each of these instances. Increased clustering has been previously associated with greater metastatic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Updyke and Nicolson, 1986</xref>), raising an interesting possibility that increased cell–cell adhesiveness is a generalized mechanism that tumor cells employ as a part of their survival strategy. It is possible that while loss of cell adhesion during EMT facilitates invasiveness, it concomitantly places cells under the stress of anchorage deprivation, compromising their survival. Thus, cancer cells may need to replace the loss of homotypic cell–cell contacts with weaker heterotypic interactions capable of promoting survival in the absence of anchorage.</p><p>In addition to enabling anchorage-independent growth at the primary tumor site, cell–cell clustering in the lymphatic vasculature could promote cell survival. This is particularly relevant for PVRL4 as 100% of breast tumors from patients with two or more lymph nodes that are positive for cancer cells express PVRL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athanassiadou et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, we demonstrate that PVRL4 can promote the attachment of cancer cells to other cell types. For example, SUM190 breast cancer cells readily attach to lung endothelial cells (HMVEC-Ls), and inhibiting PVRL4 with RNAi or with blocking antibodies abolishes this interaction. CTC-targeted therapy is a promising new treatment possibility, and it will be of particular interest to investigate the potential role of PVRL4 in mediating these types of interactions in vivo.</p><p>We directly tested the utility of blocking PVRL4-driven cell–cell contacts with monoclonal antibodies as a potential therapeutic strategy. In vitro, we found that such blocking antibodies suppress PVRL4-driven cellular growth and Src family kinase activation in the absence of anchorage, and in vivo, anti-PVRL4 antibody treatment potently inhibited the growth of orthotopically implanted primary tumors. Importantly, post-antibody therapy tumor samples uniformly exhibit marked downregulation of PVRL4, confirming that the observed response is target-specific and not a consequence of a non-specific antitumor effect of the antibody. In addition, we found no difference in the degree of host macrophage recruitment or in vitro ADCC induction between control IgG and anti-PVRL4 antibodies. These observations suggest that the observed tumor growth inhibition is likely due to a direct inhibition of cell-to-cell attachment mediated by PVRL4-PVRL1 binding, and not due to an Fc receptor-mediated immune response. It remains to be tested whether a stronger inhibitory effect could be achieved with an antibody that is both ADCC-competent and capable of inhibiting PVRL4-driven cell clustering.</p><p>Even though treatment with anti-PVRL4 antibodies caused dramatic dissolution of cell–cell contacts, we observed no changes in markers of EMT in tumors from mice treated with the antibody; neither did it produce obvious deleterious effects in treated mice. These observations signify not only the potential efficacy but also the safety of the demonstrated approach. Together, these results suggest that anti-PVRL4 monoclonal antibody therapy aimed at disrupting cell–cell interactions may be a viable strategy for treating cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs and virus production</title><p>For screen candidate validation, ORFs from isolated colonies were subcloned into pRoles retroviral vector (provided by W Harper).

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Pavlova et al present the result of an ORFeome screen for genes that confer anchorage-independent growth on TL-HMEC cells, a model of anchorage-dependent breast cancer. A cDNA for PVRL4/Nectin-4 was repeatedly recovered from this screen. PVRL4 not only caused anchorage-independent growth but also caused strong aggregation of the TL-HMEC cells. They note copy number gains of the genomic region encompassing PVRL4 in some cases of human breast cancer (∼8%). Knockdown of PVRL4 decreased clonogenic survival of one breast cancer line with PVRL4 amplification in the absence of stroma and delayed tumor progression in xenografts. An antibody to PVRL4 decreased xenograft progression, apparently by preventing cell-cell adhesive contacts.</p><p>This study is notable for the elegant ORFeome screen to investigate anchorage-independent growth. PVRL4 appears to be capable of mediating anchorage-independent growth and antibodies to PVRL4 would seem to be a viable therapeutic strategy in a cancer with very high levels of PVRL4 expression. However, more analysis is needed to determine how often human breast cancers (or other cancer types) utilize the PVRL4 pathway oncogenically.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) It is unclear how often PVRL1 is involved in focal and high-level amplifications. The authors state that: “Analysis of a publicly available dataset of copy number alterations from 541 breast tumors identified high-level amplification of PVRL4 locus in 6.5% of samples (Cerami et al., 2012).” This website only lists samples as having gain, loss, or wild-type loci, but does not distinguish high-level amplification from single copy gain. In the Oncomine database, arrayCGH data from 650 invasive ductal breast cancers is available along with a measure of copy number. The PVRL4 copy number alterations appear to be single or low copy number gains rather than high-level amplifications. For example, in this set of tumors, HER2 and CCND1 were amplified &gt; 4N in 9% and 3% of cases, but there are no cases that had this level of amplification of PVRL4. Moreover, while a few cases have focal gains involving PVRL4, the vast majority of gains involving this locus involve broad chromosomal regions. Thus, the evidence from copy number does not strongly support PVRL1 as a driver oncogene in most breast cancers.</p><p>2) Of note, however, many breast cancers seem to over express PVRL4 compared to normal breast epithelium. While overexpression is not as strong evidence of pathogenetic importance, it can be an important oncogenic mechanism in some instances. In this regard, a study of PVRL4 levels by FACS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-7-73">Fabre-Lafay et al. BMC Cancer 2007</ext-link>) showed particularly high levels in the two cell lines that the authors studied, namely SUM190 (m.f.i. 500) and SUM185 (m.f.i. 145). However, the majority of breast cancer lines had much lower levels. For example, the commonly studied breast cancer line MCF-7 had a PVRL4 m.f.i of 22. It would therefore be informative to investigate the role of PVRL4 in a cell line with this lower level of expression, both in terms of in vitro anchorage-independent growth and using xenograft to determine the effect of PVRL4 knockdown and anti-PVRL4 antibodies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00358.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is unclear how often PVRL1 is involved in focal and high-level amplifications.

Thus, the evidence from copy number does not strongly support PVRL1 as a driver oncogene in most breast cancers</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ insightful criticism with regard to the nature of genomic alterations to PVRL4 in human tumors. As the reviewers point out, in the 650-tumor dataset from the Oncomine database, arrayCGH data indicate that PVRL4 in tumors is affected mostly by low-level copy gains, but not by high-level amplifications that are seen for HER2 and CCND1. In agreement with the Oncomine dataset, another cancer genomic alterations database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/">cBioportal</ext-link>, which we cite in our manuscript, similarly indicates that PVRL4 is less often affected by high-level amplifications than HER2. However, we do not completely agree with the reviewers’ statement that cBioportal “does not distinguish high-level amplification from single copy gain”. Indeed, in cBioportal, an <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/faq.jsp#what-do-2-1-0-1-and-2-mean-in-the-copy-number-data">arbitrary score</ext-link> is assigned to indicate the amplitude of a genomic alteration that involves the gene of interest, with “0” indicating a diploid status, “1” a low-level copy gain, and “2” a high-level amplification.</p><p>According to this scoring system, in the case of PVRL4, 60.3% of breast tumors contain low-level copy gains and 7.9% contain high-level amplifications, whereas in case of HER2, 13.9% of breast tumors have low-level copy gains, and 13.2% have high-level amplifications. To address the reviewers’ concerns, we have changed the wording we use to describe the genomic status of PVRL4 and expanded our statement on the status of PVRL4 in tumors to reflect the data more accurately: “Analysis of a publicly available dataset of copy number alterations involving PVRL4 in 484 breast tumors indicates a low-level copy number gain in 60.3% of samples, and high-level amplification in another 7.9% of samples”.</p><p>We would also like to point out that while PVRL4 is not quite as amplified as HER2, it is in the ballpark and the degree of amplification of any particular oncogene depends on many factors, such as genomic structure at the locus and other mechanisms through which overexpression can be achieved. For example, transcription upregulation or protein stabilization could also play important roles in driving PVRL4 expression in 60% of breast cancers, in addition to copy number elevation.</p><p>We fully agree with the reviewers’ statement that neither genomic nor protein expression evidence, in isolation, constitute proof of PVRL4 being a driver oncogene. However, we feel that published genomic and protein expression data from human cancer can be viewed as lending support to the substantive body of functional evidence that we present in this work, and altogether serve to implicate PVRL4 in the promotion of tumorigenesis.</p><p><italic>2) Of note, however, many breast cancers seem to over express PVRL4 compared to normal breast epithelium. While overexpression is not as strong evidence of pathogenetic importance, it can be an important oncogenic mechanism in some instances. In this regard, a study of PVRL4 levels by FACS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-7-73">Fabre-Lafay et al.

It would therefore be informative to investigate the role of PVRL4 in a cell line with this lower level of expression, both in terms of in vitro anchorage-independent growth and using xenograft to determine the effect of PVRL4 knockdown and anti-PVRL4 antibodies</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting that we test the pro-tumorigenic role of PVRL4 in a panel of breast cancer cell lines, in which not only those cell lines with high PVRL4 expression (such as SUM190 and SUM185 cells), but also cell lines in which PVRL4 is expressed at the medium level, would be represented. To address this, we tested the effect of PVRL4 depletion using two independent shRNAs in two extra breast cancer cell lines, Sk-BR-3 and BT-474 (m.f.i. of 75 and 40, respectively – thus falling into a medium range of protein expression, according to FACS analysis performed by Fabre-Lafay et al., 2007).</p><p>We found that both Sk-BR-3 and BT-474 displayed defects in clonogenic growth and anchorage-independence phenotype upon PVRL4 depletion. We opted not to test the effect of an anti-PVRL4 antibody treatment on BT-474 xenografts due to the costs associated with performing an additional antibody experiment in mice, and focused on testing effects of RNAi-mediated depletion of PVRL4 in this line instead, as suggested. Indeed, we found that xenograft growth of BT-474 cells was markedly sensitive to PVRL4 depletion, which was similar to what we have observed with SUM190 and SUM185 cell lines. Altogether, our data indicate that tumors with high PVRL4 and those with intermediate expression of PVRL4 may be sensitive to anti-PVRL4 therapy.</p></body></sub-article></article>
