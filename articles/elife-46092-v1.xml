Zebrafish carrying a null mutation in a neurotrophic factor receptor, Ret, displayed defects in peripheral sensory axon growth cone morphology and dynamics. Ret receptor was highly enriched in sensory pioneer neurons and Ret51 isoform was required for pioneer axon outgrowth. Loss-of-function of a cargo adaptor, Jip3, partially phenocopied Ret axonal defects, led to accumulation of activated Ret in pioneer growth cones, and reduced retrograde Ret51 transport. Jip3 and Ret51 were also retrogradely co-transported, ultimately suggesting Jip3 is a retrograde adapter of active Ret51. Finally, loss of Ret reduced transcription and growth cone localization of Myosin-X, an initiator of filopodial formation. These results show a specific role for Ret51 in pioneer axon growth, and suggest a critical role for long-range retrograde Ret signaling in regulating growth cone dynamics through downstream transcriptional changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pioneer neuron</kwd><kwd>growth cone</kwd><kwd>lateral line</kwd><kwd>axon growth</kwd><kwd>Ret</kwd><kwd>axonal transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01HD072844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nechiporuk</surname><given-names>Alex V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS111419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nechiporuk</surname><given-names>Alex V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Long-range Ret receptor signaling promotes axon outgrowth and regulates growth cone dynamics in pioneer neurons by inducing transcriptional changes in Myosin-X expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One major regulator of axon outgrowth and pathfinding is signaling through neurotrophic factors. Of these, the best studied neurotrophic factors are Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain-derived Growth Factor (BDNF) that signal through the receptors TrkA and TrkB, respectively. NGF and BDNF can have effects locally on axon terminals or signal retrogradely from the axon terminal to the cell body and induce changes in gene expression. NGF/BDNF long-range retrograde signaling is required for survival of sympathetic neurons, where retrograde transport of active endosomal signaling complexes promotes transcription of pro-survival/anti-apoptotic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riccio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to survival, retrograde transport of NGF/TrkA promotes sensory axon outgrowth by inducing transcriptional changes in Serum Response Factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wickramasinghe et al., 2008</xref>), whereas retrograde axonal transport of BDNF/TrkB is required for BDNF-mediated dendritic growth in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). In general, however, the transcriptional targets downstream of retrograde neurotrophic factor signaling that promote axon growth are still largely unknown.</p><p>The neurotrophic factor receptor ‘REarranged during Transfection’ (Ret) and its major ligand, Glial cell line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF), have established roles in axon growth, enteric nervous system and kidney development, and cancer progression. Ret receptor has two primary expressed isoforms, Ret9 and Ret51, each with a unique amino acid sequence of the intracellular C-terminus. The two isoforms have different in vivo signaling properties and roles during development. Initial reports indicated Ret9 is required for proper enteric nervous system and kidney development, while Ret51 is dispensable for these processes in murine and zebrafish models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Graaff et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heanue and Pachnis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong et al., 2005</xref>). However, later reports demonstrated an important role for Ret51 in murine kidney and enteric nervous system development, suggesting that the two isoforms are partially redundant in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2010</xref>). These isoforms are also differentially trafficked and susceptible to degradation in both neurons and non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsui and Pierchala, 2010</xref>). In sympathetic neuron culture, RET9 degrades more slowly than RET51, which is thought to allow retrograde trafficking of RET9 and ultimately promote neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsui and Pierchala, 2010</xref>). In human epithelial cell lines, RET51 is more frequently localized at the plasma membrane, recycled to the plasma membrane after endocytosis, and more rapidly internalized into endosomes after GDNF treatment than RET9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, Ret9 and Ret51 have notably different properties and responses to ligand binding even within the same cell.</p><p>Ret/GDNF signaling promotes sympathetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Enomoto et al., 2001</xref>), sensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Honma et al., 2010</xref>), and motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonanomi et al., 2012</xref>) axon growth and pathfinding. Long-range retrograde RET/GDNF trafficking from distal axons is required for survival of sensory (DRG) neurons and mature sympathetic neurons in rat primary cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coulpier and Ibáñez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsui and Pierchala, 2010</xref>). In sympathetic neurons, retrograde transport of GDNF ligand from axon terminals to cell bodies has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coulpier and Ibáñez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tomac et al., 1995</xref>) but, thus far, retrograde transport of GDNF/Ret in sensory neurons has not. Ret/GDNF signaling can also promote sympathetic axon growth in vitro; however, retrograde signaling/transport is not required for this role over short periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bodmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsui and Pierchala, 2010</xref>). Long-range GDNF/Ret signaling is required for motor neuron extension in developing mouse embryos where loss of GDNF ligand expression in target muscles leads to reduced neuronal expression of <italic>Pea3</italic> transcription factor and disrupts neuronal cell body positioning and dendrite patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haase et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vrieseling and Arber, 2006</xref>). However, the mechanisms mediating Ret/GDNF retrograde transport and the full extent of the Ret/GDNF downstream transcriptional response mediating axon growth are unknown and in vivo studies of Ret retrograde transport and signaling are sorely lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ito and Enomoto, 2016</xref>).</p><p>While Ret/GDNF is required for axon extension during development, whether it has a specific role in pioneer axon outgrowth is unknown. Pioneer neurons are the first to extend axons to a particular region or target, acting as a guide and scaffold for ‘follower’ axons. Pioneer neurons are important in the developing CNS and PNS for the initial navigation to appropriate targets, proper follower axon pathfinding, and promoting follower axon outgrowth. Despite their unique role in neurodevelopment, the molecular program regulates their behavior is not well known.</p><p>In vivo study of long-range neurotrophic factor signaling, receptor transport, and pioneer axon growth is technically challenging. Zebrafish embryos offer a number of advantages for these studies, including optical accessibility, rapid embryonic development, and amenability to transgenesis and genetic manipulation. In this study, we use the long sensory axons of the zebrafish posterior lateral line ganglion (pLLG) neurons because their planar character, superficial localization, and relatively rapid pioneer axon outgrowth make them uniquely suited for live imaging. The pLL senses water movement through mechanical stimulation of sensory hair cells that transduce this input through the pLL axons innervating them. During extension, 3 to 6 pLL pioneer axons are guided by the pLL primordium (pLLP), a group of cells that migrate along the trunk from 22 to 48 hr post-fertilization (hpf). Pioneer growth cones typically have longer and more elaborate filopodial protrusions compared to followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bak and Fraser, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 1991</xref>) and this is the case in pLLG pioneer growth cones, which associate extensively with the migrating pLLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sato et al., 2010</xref>). The pLL primordium expresses GDNF and this ligand production is required for proper pLLG axon outgrowth, but not pLLG neuron specification or survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schuster et al., 2010</xref>). This allowed us to explore the specific mechanisms of long-range Ret-mediated axon outgrowth in sensory pioneer neurons.</p><p>We find that Ret is highly expressed in pioneer neurons and <italic>ret51</italic>, but not <italic>ret9</italic>, isoform is required for pioneer axon outgrowth. In the absence of Ret, pioneer axons display reduced growth cone volume and fewer filopodia. We also show that JNK-interacting protein 3 (Jip3) is required for retrograde transport of activated Ret51 from pioneer growth cones. In <italic>jip3</italic> mutants, retrograde transport of Ret51 is reduced, leading to accumulation of activated Ret in pioneer growth cones. Additionally, we observe live retrograde, but not anterograde, co-transport of tagged Ret51 and Jip3 in pioneer sensory axons. Finally, we find <italic>myosin-X</italic> (<italic>myo10</italic>), a regulator of filopodial formation, is downregulated in <italic>ret</italic> mutant sensory neurons. Myo10 protein is reduced in <italic>ret</italic> mutant pioneer growth cones, and loss of Myo10 produces axon extension defects similar to those in <italic>ret</italic> mutants. This work describes a novel requirement for Ret51 in axon growth and pioneer neuron development, identifies a novel regulator of phosphorylated Ret51 retrograde transport, and suggests long-range retrograde Ret signaling regulates downstream transcriptional targets which are required for pioneer sensory axon growth cone dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ret expression is elevated in pioneer neurons during axon extension</title><p>Previous studies showed that <italic>ret</italic> is expressed in the pLLG neurons and the Ret ligand GDNF, which is expressed by the pLLP, is required for pLLG axon extension but not pLLG neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schuster et al., 2010</xref>).

We reasoned that this difference may be due to both local and long-range requirements for Ret signaling in pLL axons. To distinguish between the local and long-range signaling, we looked for ways to acutely inactivate Ret receptor in <italic>jip3<sup>nl7</sup></italic> mutants. To achive this, we used a multi-kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, which blocks signaling of multiple receptor-tyrosine kinases including Ret, where it potently inhibits Ret activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plaza-Menacho et al., 2007</xref>). To confirm that sorafenib can inhibit Ret in pLL axons, we treated <italic>ret<sup>hu284</sup></italic> mutant and wild-type sibling embryos with 5 μM sorafenib from 24 to 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Furthermore, we observed no significant exacerbation of the axon truncation in <italic>ret</italic> mutants treated with sorafenib compared to either untreated <italic>ret</italic> mutants or sorafenib-treated siblings. This suggests that, in this context, sorafenib functions as a specific inhibitor of Ret signaling. We then treated <italic>jip3</italic> mutant and sibling larvae with sorafenib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Drug treatment induced significantly more severe axon truncations in siblings compared to untreated <italic>jip3</italic> mutants (mean body segment location of axon termination in sorafenib-treated siblings: 16.1 ± 1.5 vs. untreated <italic>jip3<sup>nl7</sup></italic> mutants: 22.5 ± 1.1, p&lt;0.001 by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test).

These results are consistent with the observed difference in axon truncation severity between <italic>ret</italic> and <italic>jip3</italic> mutants and suggest local Ret signaling in the growth cone promotes some aspects of axon outgrowth even in the absence of Jip3-mediated long-range retrograde transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Ret signaling regulates transcription and pioneer growth cone levels of Myosin-X</title><p>Because retrograde transport is required for some aspects of Ret-mediated pLL sensory axon growth, we asked if there were specific transcriptional targets downstream of long-range Ret signaling that are required for pioneer axon outgrowth. Based on the observed defects in filopodial formation and growth cone advancement, we looked for factors that are specifically expressed in pLLG neurons during axon extension and regulate filopodial dynamics. We focused on Myosin-X (Myo10), an unconventional Myosin that promotes initiation of filopodia and links integrins and the actin cytoskeleton to promote cell migration. Myo10 is upregulated during neurite growth following peripheral nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plantman et al., 2013</xref>) and loss of Myo10 disrupts cortical axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>). Although humans and mice have one Myo10 gene, zebrafish have three with specific expression patterns. Of these, Myo10l1 has the most restricted embryonic expression and is the only one expressed in the pLLG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sittaramane and Chandrasekhar, 2008</xref>). We hypothesized that loss of Ret signaling would reduce <italic>myo10l1</italic> transcription, leading to decreased Myo10 in pioneer growth cones. In turn, this would disrupt filopodia formation and subsequent axon growth in <italic>ret</italic> mutants. To test this, we analyzed <italic>myo10I1</italic> levels in <italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> mutants and siblings at 30 hpf using fluorescence in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). <italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> mutant ganglia had significantly reduced mean fluorescence intensity compared to siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). To verify if this reduced Myo10 protein in pioneer growth cones, we immunostained 30 hpf <italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> mutants and sibling <italic>neurod:EGFP</italic> embryos with Myo10 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). This antibody recognized My10l1-eGFP fusion protein expressed in zebrafish sensory neurons using BAC transgenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel A). Consistent with the observed changes in <italic>myo10l1</italic> transcription, we found significantly reduced Myo10 immunostaining fluorescence in distal pioneer axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). Similarly, the levels of Myo10l1 were reduced in aoxn growth cones of <italic>jip3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). If Myo10l1 is required for proper pioneer axon outgrowth, we expect loss of Myo10l1 to disrupt pLLG axon growth, similar to loss of Ret signaling. To test this, we performed G0 CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genetic knockdown of <italic>myo10l1</italic> using the established method of injecting a multiplexed cocktail of three sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) that efficiently target three different regions of <italic>myo10l1</italic> in developing <italic>neurod:EGFP</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels B,C).

Our work finds that the Ret51 isoform is required for sensory pioneer axon outgrowth. We observed enriched expression of <italic>ret9+51</italic> mRNA in a region of the pLLG known to hold the pioneer neuron cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pujol-Martí et al., 2010</xref>). Through retrograde dye labeling of pioneer neuron cell bodies, we found an enrichment of Ret protein in pLLG pioneer neuron cell bodies, corresponding to the region of <italic>ret9+51</italic> mRNA expression. <italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> mutants do not have defects in pLLG pioneer neuron specification or survival but do have a failure of continued growth of pioneer axons. This pioneer axon growth was rescued in <italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> mutants by exogenous expression of <italic>RET51</italic> mRNA but not <italic>RET9</italic>, indicating that Ret51 is specifically required for pioneer axon outgrowth. These data also demonstrate that Ret is a specific marker of pioneer neurons in the pLLG.</p><p>We propose that long-range retrograde Ret signaling mediated by Jip3 is required for pioneer axon outgrowth and growth cone dynamics. While Ret/GDNF signaling could have local effects on growth cone behavior and morphology, we argue that long-range retrograde signaling and a transcriptional response underlie the loss of filopodia and a significant portion of the pLLG axon truncation phenotype described for several reasons. First, the Jip3 and Ret loss-of-function axon truncation and growth cone filopodia phenotypes are very similar. Second, there is no difference in the severity of axon truncation in <italic>jip3<sup>nl7</sup>/rethu<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> double mutants compared to individual <italic>ret</italic> homozygous mutants, suggesting they act in the same pathway. Third, in <italic>jip3</italic> mutants we observe an accumulation of phospho-Ret in extending growth cones and a reduction in retrograde axonal transport of Ret51 and pRet by in vivo imaging and immunostaining following nerve sever, respectively. Fourth, <italic>jip3</italic> constructs lacking the p150 Dynein complex binding domain cannot rescue axon truncation or distal pRet accumulation in <italic>jip3</italic> mutants. However, <italic>jip3</italic> lacking the JNK binding domain fully rescues these defects, and we observe no changes in growth cone pJNK levels in <italic>jip3</italic> or <italic>ret</italic> mutants, indicating Jip3 retrograde transport is required for proper axon outgrowth and retrograde transport of pRet from extending growth cones. Finally, in <italic>ret</italic> mutants we observe a reduction in <italic>myo10l1</italic> expression and Myo10l1 in pioneer growth cones, suggesting a specific downstream transcriptional target of Ret signaling that underlies one of the observed growth cone defects. Consistent with this, knockdown of Myo10l1 disrupted pioneer axon extension similar to <italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> mutants. Thus, we provide evidence for a mechanism by which long-range retrograde signaling induces a specific transcriptional change that in turn regulates pioneer growth cone dynamics and outgrowth. This model is consistent with previous observations in cultured sympathetic and sensory neuron indicating that neurotrophic factor-dependent axon growth over long periods of times requires a transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bodmer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our data also provide support that, in addition to a long-range Ret-mediated retrograde signaling, local Ret activity is necessary for pLL axon growth. We found that genetic loss of Jip3, which presumably blocks retrograde Ret signaling, produces a less severe axon truncation phenotype than loss of Ret. We also find that pharmacological inhibition of Ret in wild-type axons induces a more significant axon truncation than in untreated <italic>jip3</italic> mutants. Finally, we noted differences in the pLLG pioneer axons of <italic>jip3</italic> mutants compared to <italic>ret</italic> mutants. Specifically, unlike <italic>ret</italic> mutants, individual growth cone volume is not significantly reduced in <italic>jip3</italic> mutants. Overall, these observations argue that a combination of both local and long-range Ret signaling are required for axon outgrowth. In fact, we would like to suggest that Jip3-mediated retrograde transport may not be necessary for early stages of the pLLG pioneer axon outgrowth, but is required for continued axon growth as axons extend beyond a certain distance from the soma. This model is consistent with previous observations in cultured sympathetic and dorsal rood ganglia neurons, in which long-range retrograde transport of TrkA receptor is required for long-term (but not short-term) maintenance of axon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bodmer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ret signaling regulates pioneer growth cone morphology and dynamics</title><p>Regulated growth cone dynamics, including formation and disassembly of filopodia and lamellipodia, is required for growth cone advancement and axon outgrowth. Loss of Ret led to fewer filopodia per pioneer growth cone but did not change mean length of filopodia. This suggests a defect in initiation of filopodial formation but not maintenance or continued growth. Consistent with this result, we observed reduction in Myo10l1, an unconventional Myosin that promotes filopodia formation, in <italic>ret</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, transient CRISPR-based knockdown of Myo10l1 in <italic>ret</italic> mutants did not exacerbate the axon truncation phenotype observed in <italic>ret</italic> mutants alone, suggesting that Myo10l1 acts downstream of Ret. Although, to conclusively determine if <italic>myo10l1</italic> acts in a linear pathway with Ret in pLLG neurons during pioneer axon extension, germline <italic>ret;myo10l1</italic> double mutants carrying the <italic>neurod:EGFP</italic> transgene should be generated and their offspring analyzed for axon truncation defects. Disruption of dynamic filopodial formation can prevent proper growth cone motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowery and Van Vactor, 2009</xref>), leading to failed axon outgrowth. Another non-mutually exclusive possibility is that failure to dynamically form filopodia could disrupt proper interaction with the pLLP (which produces GDNF and BDNF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasanov et al., 2015</xref>) necessary for guiding and promoting axon growth. In this case, less interaction with the pLLP could reduce reception of trophic/permissive cues produced by the pLLP, further reducing the formation of growth cone filopodia and producing a positive feedback cycle that ultimately ends in failed growth cone advancement.</p><p>In addition to the loss of filopodia, we also observe a significant reduction in pioneer growth cone volume. The reduced growth cone volume and more compact morphology of <italic>ret</italic> mutant growth cones which lack the typical spread out ‘footprint’ of pioneer growth cones could be caused by defects in formation of lamellipodia, which would ultimately prevent proper growth cone migration and steering. While changes in <italic>myo10</italic> expression are consistent with the filopodial defects and axon outgrowth failure, local Ret signaling may promote lamellipodia formation or other specific growth cone behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Jip3 is an adapter for transport of activated Ret</title><p>While there is evidence that long distance GDNF signaling is required for motor axon pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vrieseling and Arber, 2006</xref>), to date there has been no in vivo observation of retrograde axonal trafficking of Ret receptor or description of the mechanisms that would underlie this transport in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ito and Enomoto, 2016</xref>). In this study, we provide compelling evidence that Jip3 functions as an adapter for the retrograde transport of activated Ret to promote axon outgrowth. We found that Jip3 loss-of-function partially phenocopied pLLG axon truncation and many of the growth cone defects we observed in <italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> mutants. We observed no difference in axon truncation defects in <italic>jip3<sup>nl7</sup></italic> and <italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> null double mutants compared to <italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> mutants, indicating that Ret and Jip3 act in the same pathway to promote axon growth. Our data also show that loss of Jip3 leads to accumulation of activated Ret in pioneer axon growth cones. The Jip3-mediated clearance of pRet requires Jip3 binding to the retrograde motor, consistent with the idea that Jip3 functions as a retrograde adapter in this context. Axon sever experiments showed that activated Ret is retrogradely transported in axons and Jip3 is required for that process. Consistent with this observation, we found a significant reduction in the number of retrogradely trafficked Ret51 particles in <italic>jip3<sup>nl7</sup></italic> mutants. Notably, we did not observe complete loss of retrograde transport of Ret51 in <italic>jip3<sup>nl7</sup></italic> mutants or observe complete co-localization of Jip3/Ret51 retrograde transport. This is likely due to the inability to distinguish between phosphorylated or non-activated tagged Ret receptor in vivo. These observations are consistent with our assumption that Jip3 is required for retrograde transport of activated Ret51, which presumably constitutes only a subset of Ret51 fusion visualized in our live trafficking experiments. Finally, we observed live retrograde co-transport of Jip3 and Ret51 tagged particles in extending pLLG axons, but no co-transport of anterogradely trafficked particles. Collectively, these results indicate Jip3 mediates retrograde transport of phosphorylated Ret51 in pioneer axons.</p><p>It is possible that Jip3 mediates local Ret signaling in pioneer growth cones, since it also can function as a scaffold that regulates local JNK phosphorylation. However, while Jip3 interaction with JNK has been previously implicated in axon extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2013</xref>), it is not necessary for pLL axon extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drerup and Nechiporuk, 2013</xref>) and we observe no change in pJNK levels in pioneer growth cones in <italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic> mutants. Consistent with this, we found that mRNA injection of full-length Jip3 and Jip3 lacking the JNK-binding domain in <italic>jip3<sup>nl7</sup></italic> mutants completely rescued axon truncation and accumulation of pRet in pioneer growth cones. Combined with our previous results, this indicates Jip3-mediated retrograde axonal transport of phosphorylated Ret51 is required for axon outgrowth and proper formation of growth cone filopodia.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A specific role for Ret51 isoform in pioneer axon outgrowth</title><p>Ret receptor isoforms have different roles and requirements during development. Ret9 previously was described as the critical isoform in mouse kidney organogenesis, enteric nervous system development, and embryogenesis in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Graaff et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong et al., 2005</xref>). However, later murine studies argue these isoforms have largely redundant developmental function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2010</xref>). Ret isoform roles are little studied in zebrafish, though initial work indicated Ret9, but not Ret51, is required for proper enteric nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heanue and Pachnis, 2008</xref>). Neuronal studies examining differences in Ret9 and Ret51 subcellular localization and degradation have focused on their roles in neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsui and Pierchala, 2010</xref>). RET51 is expressed in a specific subset of RET9-expressing mouse olfactory neurons during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaplinovsky and Cunningham, 2011</xref>), but the functional consequence of this is unknown. Our work establishes a novel, specific role for Ret51 in pioneer axon extension unrelated to neuronal differentiation or survival and describes in vivo observation of axonal Ret51 isoform trafficking. Though Ret9 failed to rescue mutant axon truncation, it may be that Ret9 has a role in local signaling at the dendrites or cell body that is unrelated to axon outgrowth.</p><p>These isoform-specific functional differences may be explained by differential trafficking properties and degradation rates of Ret isoforms. In cultured mammalian cells (HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells), RET51 is preferentially localized to the plasma membrane, more rapidly internalized upon ligand binding and is differentially ubiquitylated compared to RET9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hyndman et al., 2017</xref>). Different rates of Ret51 degradation are also seen in distinct neuronal populations. In mouse sympathetic neuron culture, RET51 is rapidly degraded in axon terminals following GDNF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsui and Pierchala, 2010</xref>). However, in DRG sensory neuron cultures, RET51 was substantially more resistant to degradation and activated RET51 persisted much longer than in sympathetic neurons, which is correlated with detection of pRET51 in neuron cell bodies. Thus, it is possible that the plasma membrane localization and rapid internalization properties of Ret51 combined with the enhanced longevity of pRet51 in sensory neurons allow for its unique role in pioneer sensory neurons and, potentially, the ability to undergo long-range retrograde axonal transport.</p><p>In summary, our in vivo data demonstrate a novel role for Ret51 in pioneer axon extension and suggest the requirement of long-range, retrograde Ret signaling in this process. Additionally, we establish a system to examine the role of neurotrophic factor signaling in pioneer axon growth without a confounding role in neuronal survival. We identify that Jip3 mediates Ret51 retrograde transport, providing a useful tool to dissect local versus long-range signaling contributions of Ret receptor. Combined with our observation that Ret is specifically and highly expressed in pLLG pioneer sensory neurons, we submit that Ret51 functions as a molecular and transcriptional marker of these pioneers. This finding opens up several new technical avenues to examine the mechanisms underlying pioneer neuron development and pathfinding. In particular, this finding can be leveraged with transcriptomic techniques, such as single-cell RNA-seq, to study the transcriptional mechanisms that specify pioneer neurons and promote their enhanced axon growth and pathfinding capabilities. Finally, our results offer a holistic mechanism of long-range retrograde axonal transport of a neurotrophic factor receptor (Ret) inducing a specific transcriptional change (<italic>myo10l1</italic>) that ultimately impacts local protein levels in the growth cone (Myo10l1) required for proper axon behavior during development (filopodia formation and axon extension, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). By elucidating the specific roles of concrete components involved in this process, our mechanistic account conceptually advance the paradigm of long-range neurotrophic factor signaling in axon growth. Better understanding of the fundamental processes that regulate the unique axonal growth and pathfinding capabilities of pioneer neurons can provide potential therapeutic points of intervention to promote axonal regeneration in response to injury or disease. Future studies will focus on identifying additional potential transcriptional targets downstream of Ret retrograde transport and how these regulate specific changes in pioneer growth cone morphology and behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>TgBAC(neurod:EGFP)<sup>nl1</sup></italic>; <italic>neurod:EGFP</italic></td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5230%E2%80%9307.2008">10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5230–07.2008</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>ret<sup>hu2846</sup></italic></td><td valign="bottom">doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1242/dev.061002">10.1242/dev.061002</ext-link></td><td>ZIRC Catalog ID: ZL3218</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>jip3<sup>nl7</sup></italic></td><td valign="bottom">doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003303">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003303</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>SCG10(STMN2) antibody (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>ProteinTech</td><td>Cat.

The following antibodies were used: anti-GFP (1:1000; Invitrogen #A11122), anti-SCG10 (1:100; ProteinTech, #10586-AP) anti-p905Ret (1:50; Thermo Pierce, #PA517761), anti-Ret (1:100; Santa Cruz, #sc-167), anti-neurofilament (1:500; DSHB, 3A10), anti-Myo10 (1:500; Proteintech #24565–1-AP), anti-pJNK (1∶100; Cell Signaling #9251S). tRet antibody was validated by verifying lack of immunofluorescence signal in pLLG in <italic>ret<sup>hu2864</sup></italic> mutant embryos compared to wild-type siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels B,C). pRet antibody was validated by injecting a plasmid construct encoding RET51-mCherry fusion (<italic>neurod5kb:RET51-mCherry</italic>), identifying embryos with 2–3 pLLG neurons expressing the construct, fixing at 30 hpf, and immunostaining. Co-localization of Ret51-mCherry and pRet was found in extending growth cones, but pRet was largely absent in the ganglion or cell bodies expressing Ret51-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels D,E), consistent with expectation that only a subpopulation of Ret51 would be phosphorylated and that subpopulation would be enriched in extending growth cones near the source of GDNF ligand. For pioneer nerve sever experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>), α-rabbit AlexaFluor 647 secondary (Thermo Fisher) was used to distinguish α-Ret antibody signal from rhodamine. All fluorescently labeled embryos were imaged using a 40X/NA = 1.3 oil objective on a FV1000 laser scanning confocal system (Olympus). Brightness and contrast were adjusted in Adobe Photoshop and figures were compiled in Adobe Illustrator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification of immunofluorescence</title><p>For analysis of pRet and tRet intensity in axon terminals and after nerve injury, individuals were immunolabeled as described above. For consistency of labeling, compared larvae were processed in the same batch. Confocal Z-stacks (0.5 µm between planes) were taken of the area of interest using a 40X/NA = 1.3 oil objective with identical settings. Images were analyzed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramoff et al., 2004</xref>). For fluorescence intensity measurements of pRet or tRet in wild type and mutant growth cones, summed projections of the regions of interest were generated only through regions that contained the <italic>neurod:EGFP</italic> signal and converted to eight bit in ImageJ as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drerup and Nechiporuk, 2013</xref>). Briefly, in the pLL nerve injury analysis, a 30 µm, <italic>neurod:EGFP</italic>-positive region encompassing the proximal or distal edge of the severed axon was selected and summed projections through only this segment were compiled for analysis. Prior to statistical comparison, the mean background fluorescent intensity, measured in a region adjacent to the injury site, was subtracted from the values generated.</p><p>For Myo10 immunostaining and <italic>myo10l1</italic> fluorescent in situ hybridization, wholemount embryos were imaged as described above using 488 and 568 nm excitation channels. Myo10 or <italic>myo10l1</italic> signal intensity was measured in pLL ganglia and collective axon terminals using Imaris (Bitplane) as follows. We used EGFP signal to generate surfaces of either the ganglia or the distal 50 µm of pioneer neuron terminals based on full stacks. We measured 568 nm channel mean fluorescence intensity of axon terminals or ganglia and subtracted the average mean fluorescence intensity of three regions proximal to the ganglion/axon terminals to account for background staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Growth cone imaging and analysis</title><p>For imaging, embryos were mounted in 1.5% low melting point agarose on a glass coverslip, submerged in embryo media containing 0.02% tricaine (MS-222; Sigma) and imaged at 24 or 30 hpf using a 60X/NA = 1.2 water objective on an upright Fluoview1000 confocal microscope (Olympus). The distal 75–125 μm of pLLG axon terminals, indicated by expression of <italic>neurod:EGFP</italic> transgene, were imaged with stacks of sufficient depth to capture all portions of the terminal axons. For individual growth cone imaging, embryos were injected with <italic>neurod5kb:mCherry</italic> plasmid, embryos expressing mCherry in 1–2 pLLG neurons with axons extending at or near the axon terminals (marked by <italic>neurod:EGFP</italic> expression) were selected and imaged as described using 488 and 568 nm excitation channels. Growth cone and collective axon terminal volume was quantified using Imaris software (Bitplane) as described above. EGFP signal was used to generate axonal surfaces of individual growth cones or the distal 75 μm of collective axon terminals, and volume was measured in Imaris. Filopodia were visualized by creating Z-projections of image stacks of individual growth cones in ImageJ and filopodia were traced using the segmented line tool, measured for length, and filopodia ≥1 μm number and length were scored.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Retrograde axon labeling experiment</title><p>40 hpf <italic>neurod:EGFP</italic> embryos were anesthetized and mounted in 1.2% low melt agarose. Tails were severed with rhodamine dextran-soaked scissors just rostral to pLLP growth cones. Embryos were freed from agarose, allowed to develop for 3 hr, then re-mounted and imaged using the FV1000 confocal microscope. Embryos were subsequently fixed and stained to detect Ret immunoreactivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Axon transport analysis</title><p>Zygotes were injected with plasmid DNA encoding fluorescently tagged cargos of interest with expression driven by the <italic>5kbneurod</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mo and Nicolson, 2011</xref>) and imaged as described above in ‘growth cone imaging and analysis.’ At 30 hpf, embryos were sorted under epifluorescence to identify individuals with tagged cargo expression in a few cells of the pLL ganglion. For each embryo, a region of interest (30–150 µm) was selected in the pLL nerve in which a long stretch of axon was observable in a single plane. Scans were taken at three frames per second for 500–1000 frames. Embryos were subsequently released from agarose and processed for genotyping. For co-transport, embryos expressing both constructs in a single cell were selected and imaged as described above using sequential imaging of the 488 and 568 nm excitation channels. 500 frames were collected at three frames per second.</p><p>Transport parameters were analyzed using kymograph analysis in the MetaMorph software package (Molecular Devices, Inc) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drerup and Nechiporuk, 2016</xref>). Kymographs containing 10 or more traces were analyzed and each were averaged within individual embryos for statistical analysis. The number of particles moving in each direction was estimated based on traces on the kymographs and then normalized to length of axonal segment and total imaging time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Axotomy and image acquisition</title><p>Five-day old zebrafish larvae (<italic>neurod:EGFP</italic> carriers) were anesthetized in 0.02% tricaine and embedded in 3% methylcellulose on a slide.

Slides were immersed in Ringer's solution (116 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES pH = 7.2, 1% Pen/Strep) and incubated at 28.5°C for 3 hr.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors present novel and rigorous data demonstrating that Ret, the receptor for the GDNF family of neurotrophic factors, is critical for axon extension and growth cone dynamics of sensory pioneer neurons of Zebrafish. This function requires Ret51 specifically, and not the shorter Ret9 splice variant. Interestingly, the retrograde transport of Ret51 is necessary for regulation of axon extension/growth cone dynamics, and requires Jip3 for retrograde transport. While Jip3 is best known as an adaptor protein critical for <italic>JNK</italic> signaling, in this context the authors demonstrate that its activity as a cargo adaptor for retrograde motors is required and not the <italic>JNK</italic> binding domain. The authors further demonstrate that the retrograde Ret signal upregulates the expression of Myosin-10l1, which is critical for filopodial growth in these neurons. Taken together this manuscript provides new mechanistic insight into retrograde Ret signaling and identifies a novel, surprising function for this retrograde signal: axon extension and growth cone dynamics. There are however some points that should be addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Jip3 mutant phenotype shown in Figure 3B should be quantified.</p><p>2) Differences in growth cone morphology in Jip3 mutants are difficult to appreciate (Figure 3C-D&quot;) and although statistically significant (Figure 3E-G), these changes are less substantial than those observed in RET mutants (Figure 2C-E). Could these changes reflect local RET signaling in the distal axon, while axon stalling is the result of both long-range and local RET signal activation?</p><p>3) Given the striking resemblance of the axon truncation phenotype of RET and Jip3 mutants and genetic evidence of a linear pathway, it was surprising to see a relatively limited co-transport of the two proteins (Figure 6). What is the reason of this apparent discrepancy? Does Jip3 account for all RET retrograde transport? Co-localization between Jip3+ particles and phosho-RET, which is only trafficked retrogradely (Figure 5), should be assessed.</p><p>4) The authors state: &quot;Because retrograde transport is required for Ret-mediated pLL sensory axon growth…&quot;. Technically they haven't shown this, rather they've shown that retrograde transport is required for Jip3-mediated axon growth. To ascertain this, they would need to show that Ret51 cannot rescue the axon truncation phenotype when retrograde transport is blocked. This could be done by testing if Ret51 expression can rescue axon phenotype in the Jip3/Ret double mutant. This experiment would strengthen their conclusions and the double mutant appears to be in hand. However, if the results are difficult to interpret, an alternative would be to tone down the conclusions on this point</p><p>5) The specificity of Myo10Ab staining (Figure 7D'-E&quot;) should be confirmed in myo10I1 mutants. In addition, it would be interesting to determine whether Myo10 expression changes in the cell body and axons of Jip3 mutants with blunted RET long-range signaling.</p><p>6) The conclusion that retrograde Ret signaling and transcriptional activation of myo10 is based on quantification of fluorescence in situ hybridization intensity.

Moreover, the axon truncation is less severe in <italic>jip3</italic> mutants compared to <italic>ret</italic> mutants, further implying that Jip3 mediates only a subset of Ret activities in the extending axon. We agree with the reviewer that the differences between these two mutant phenotypes could be explained by Ret acting as both a long- and short-range signal and Jip3 mediating the long-range aspect of Ret signaling. To better address this question, we blocked Ret signaling in <italic>jip3</italic> mutants using a pharmacological approach. This resulted in an axon truncation phenotype comparable to the <italic>ret</italic> mutant, which is more severe than that of <italic>jip3</italic> alone (new Figure 6C). This experiment, together with additional data presented in the manuscript, is consistent with a model where Jip3 mediates long-range signaling, but is not required for local Ret signaling. To discuss this model we included the following paragraph in Discussion:</p><p>“Our data also provide support that, in addition to a long-range Ret-mediated retrograde signaling, local Ret activity is necessary for pLL axon growth.[…] This model is consistent with previous observation in cultured sympathetic and dorsal rood ganglia neurons, in which long-range retrograde transport of TrkA receptor is required for long-term (but not short-term) maintenance of the axon outgrowth (Bodmer et al., 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the striking resemblance of the axon truncation phenotype of RET and Jip3 mutants and genetic evidence of a linear pathway, it was surprising to see a relatively limited co-transport of the two proteins (Figure 6).

Co-localization between Jip3+ particles and phosho-RET, which is only trafficked retrogradely (Figure 5), should be assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, limited co-transport of Jip3 and Ret51 is not surprising, but is consistent with a model where Jip3 is only required for retrograde transport of the activated or pRet (concluded from accumulation of pRet but not tRet in axon sever experiments). However, in our co-transport experiments, the Ret51-mCherry fusion construct labels both tRet and pRet. We thank the reviewers for their suggestion of immunostaining for Jip3, Ret51, and phospho-Ret. This is an ideal experiment to test the above model. We attempted many different permutations of tagged constructs and immunostaining protocols, but ultimately, it was difficult to draw any conclusions about co-localization from the signal specificity and resolution we observed. We saw some examples that suggested that Jip3/Ret51/pRet co-localized (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), but in most cases we observed staining that did not resolve clearly enough to distinguish individual puncta for scoring (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). One possible reason for our technical difficulties is that, in our hands, pRet antibody only works with Glyofixx, a glyoxal based fixative that contains considerable amounts of alcohol. We presume this affects lipid-based axonal vesicles (including those containing Ret and Jip3), such that we could never get a robust, reproducible signal to quantify the colocalization. Thus, with this approach we are unable to make a reliable claim regarding the ratio of Ret/Jip3/pRet co-localization.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46092.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Triple antibody staining for Jip3-mcherry, Ret51-eGFP, and phospho-Ret (Y905).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We detected instances of axonal puncta that were triple positive (magenta arrowheads), as well as Jip3 and Ret51 particles that were not positive for the other markers (white arrowheads).

This is likely due to inability to distinguish between phosphorylated or non-activated tagged Ret receptor in vivo.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state: &quot;Because retrograde transport is required for Ret-mediated pLL sensory axon growth…&quot;. Technically they haven't shown this, rather they've shown that retrograde transport is required for Jip3-mediated axon growth.

This experiment would strengthen their conclusions and the double mutant appears to be in hand. However, if the results are difficult to interpret, an alternative would be to tone down the conclusions on this point</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct: additional evidence is necessary to conclude that the retrograde transport is required for Ret-mediated axon outgrowth. However, upon reflection we were uncertain if this particular experiment would address the question of whether retrograde transport is required for Ret-mediated axon growth in our system. Our double mutant data shows no significant difference between different permutations of <italic>jip3</italic> genotypes in <italic>ret</italic> homozygous mutants. Attempting rescue by adding back Ret to the double homozygous mutant would result in a condition essentially the same as looking at the Jip3 mutant individually (where Ret is normally present), and mRNA-based rescue is mosaic and variable.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we elected to address a related question: what is the contribution of Jip3-mediated retrograde transport (versus local Ret activity) to the pLL axon growth in the <italic>ret</italic> mutant phenotype? To achieve this, we acutely blocked Ret signaling in <italic>jip3</italic> mutants using pharmacological approach. First, we quantified axon truncation in <italic>jip3</italic> mutants (new Figure 3I) to show that <italic>jip3</italic> mutants alone have a less severe axon truncation than <italic>ret</italic> mutants alone or <italic>ret/jip3</italic> doublemutants. We have provided additional quantification of <italic>jip3</italic> mutant axon truncation in the manuscript and noted that <italic>ret</italic> mutant axon truncations are generally more severe. This suggests that loss of Jip3 does not account for all Ret-mediated axon growth, possibly because local Ret signaling is responsible for some aspects of axon outgrowth. Put another way, “adding back” Ret into the <italic>ret/jip3</italic> double mutant provides a partial but not complete “rescue” of axon growth.</p><p>Next, we tested whether application of a pharmacological Ret inhibitor, sorafenib (which prevents its activating phosphorylation (Plaza-Menacho et al., 2007)), would affect the extent of axon truncation in <italic>jip3</italic> mutants. Ret inhibitor application would prevent activation of Ret in the extending growth cone of <italic>jip3</italic> mutants during axon growth. Sorafenib treatment in wild-type siblings induced a more severe truncation phenotype than that observed in untreated <italic>jip3</italic> mutants. Furthermore, loss of <italic>jip3</italic> did not exacerbate the sorafenib-induced axon truncation phenotype. Combined with our other observations, these data suggest that Jip3, and presumably Jip3-mediated retrograde transport, is required for a significant portion, but not all, of Ret-mediated pLLG axon outgrowth. This additional data is illustrated in Figures 3I, 6C, Figure 6—figure supplement 1. We also added discussion to the manuscript and altered conclusions accordingly (Discussion, third paragraph, as noted in our response to reviewer point #2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The specificity of Myo10Ab staining (Figure 7D'-E&quot;) should be confirmed in myo10I1 mutants. In addition, it would be interesting to determine whether Myo10 expression changes in the cell body and axons of Jip3 mutants with blunted RET long-range signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have a <italic>myo10l1</italic> germ line mutants at hand at this point (this strain is 3 to 6 months away). The data in our manuscript take advantage of transient Myo10l1 CRISPR injections. In the revised manuscript, we addressed Ab specificity by mosaic overexpression of tagged Myo10l1-eGFP, followed by immunostaining with our Myo10 antibody. We observe high levels of Myo10 antibody staining in neurons expressing Myo10l1eGFP (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The conclusion that retrograde Ret signaling and transcriptional activation of myo10 is based on quantification of fluorescence in situ hybridization intensity. This may not be the best approach because absolute fluorescence intensity can vary between embryos. Could the authors show a difference in mRNA levels with quantitative real-time PCR?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, quantitative real-time PCR is a standard technique to assay for differences in mRNA expression. However, in our case, whole embryo qRT-PCR is not sensitive enough to address <italic>myo10l1</italic> expression changes due to the small number of cells whose <italic>myo10l1</italic> expression is impacted compared to the entirety of the embryo. We have previously isolated pLL ganglia (~50 cells) and attempted various methods of producing and amplifying a cDNA library, but, unfortunately, the amount of material present was insufficient for qRT-PCR.</p><p>In our study, we account for fluctuations in fluorescence by subtracting averaged background staining in each individual embryo to get normalized fluorescence intensity values. We process all embryos in the same tube to ensure identical staining conditions and minimize variation. We then image/score each batch of embryos blind and genotype afterwards. This is described in the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
