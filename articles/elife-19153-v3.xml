fundamental to social interactions among animals, including humans. In fact, deficits in voice impair the quality of life for a large and diverse population of patients. Understanding the molecular genetic mechanisms of development and function in the vocal apparatus is thus an important challenge with relevance both to the basic biology of animal communication and to biomedicine. However, surprisingly little is known about the developmental biology of the mammalian larynx. Here, we used genetic fate mapping to chart the embryological origins of the tissues in the mouse larynx, and we describe the developmental etiology of laryngeal defects in mice with disruptions in cilia-mediated Hedgehog signaling. In addition, we show that mild laryngeal defects correlate with changes in the acoustic structure of vocalizations. Together, these data provide key new insights into the molecular genetics of form and function in the mammalian vocal apparatus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19153.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19153.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19153.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nearly all animals communicate using sound. In many cases these sounds are in the form of a voice, which in mammals is generated by a specialized organ in the throat called the larynx. Millions of people throughout the world have voice defects that make it difficult for them to communicate. Such defects are distinct from speech defects such as stuttering, and instead result from an inability to control the pitch or volume of the voice. This has a huge impact because our voice is so central to our quality of life.</p><p>A wide range of human birth defects that are caused by genetic mutations are known to result in voice problems. These include disorders in which the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which allows cells to exchange information, is defective. Projections called cilia that are found on the outside of many cells transmit Hedgehog signals, and birth defects that affect the cilia (called ciliopathies) also often result in voice problems.</p><p>Although the shape of the larynx has a crucial effect on voice, relatively little is known about how it develops in embryos. Mice are often studied to investigate how human embryos develop. By studying mouse embryos that had genetic mutations similar to those seen in humans with ciliopathies, Tabler, Rigney et al. now show that many different tissues interact in complex ways to form the larynx. A specific group of cells known as the neural crest was particularly important. The neural crest helps to form the face and skull and an excess of these cells causes face and skull defects in individuals with ciliopathies. Tabler, Rigney et al. show that having too many neural crest cells can also contribute towards defects in the larynx of mice with ciliopathies, despite the larynx being in the neck.</p><p>Further investigation showed that the Hedgehog signaling pathway was required for the larynx to develop properly. Furthermore, recordings of the vocalizations of the mutant mice showed that they had defective voices, thus linking the defects in the shape of the larynx with changes in the vocalizations that the mice made.</p><p>Overall, Tabler, Rigney et al. show that mice can be used to investigate how the genes that control the shape of the larynx affect the voice. The next step will be to use mice to investigate other genetic defects that cause voice defects in humans. Further research in other animals could also help us to understand how the larynx has evolved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19153.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19153.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>larynx</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>ciliopathy</kwd><kwd>CPLANE</kwd><kwd>Fuz</kwd><kwd>neural crest</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32DE023272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tabler</surname><given-names>Jacqueline M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD073151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vokes</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Egnor</surname><given-names>Roian</given-names></name><name><surname>Wallingford</surname><given-names>John B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD085901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wallingford</surname><given-names>John B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic studies in mice reveal the molecular and embryological mechanisms of vocal fold development and function, thereby informing our understanding of vocal communication and congenital voice defects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vocal communication is fundamental to social interaction. Indeed, the voice is so crucial to our quality of life that the neurobiology of speech and language has been hotly studied for decades, as has the developmental biology of the ear. These bodies of work stand in surprising contrast to our still rudimentary understanding of the developmental biology of the organs of vocalization, the larynx and vocal folds. This is true despite the fact that most animal vocalizations, including human speech, are critically dependent upon the careful control of airflow though the larynx. In fact, larynx and vocal fold morphology and elasticity are key factors influencing vocalization even in animals with widely divergent mechanisms of sound production (e.g. audible vocalizations in humans, ultrasound in rodents).</p><p>This deficit in our understanding of laryngeal and vocal fold development is significant, because many people who are capable of normal <italic>speech</italic> still cannot communicate due to defects in <italic>voice</italic> (e.g. problems with pitch, loudness, etc.). Some voice defects arise from acute insults, such as insufficient hydration of the vocal folds in <italic>laryngitis sicca</italic> or vocal fold hemorrhages resulting from blood vessel ruptures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronson and Bless, 2009</xref>). Other conditions are hereditary and chronic, such as those arising from mutations in genes encoding the extracellular matrix protein Elastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Vaux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Watts et al., 2008</xref>). All of these conditions impact the voice, thereby impacting patients’ well-being.</p><p>A wide array of human birth defect syndromes also involve voice defects, and prominent among these are disorders stemming from failure of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cell-cell communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). For example, Pallister-Hall Syndrome is caused by mutations in <italic>Gli3</italic>, a key transducer of HH signals. These patients have hoarse and/or growling voices, and they frequently exhibit laryngeal clefts and bifid epiglottis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hall et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Tyler, 1985</xref>). Pallister-Hall Syndrome is known for its variable expressivity, and accordingly, this disorder is also associated with milder laryngeal anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ondrey et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, laryngeal and voice defects are not limited to <italic>Gli3</italic> mutation, but have also been associated with mutation in the related factor <italic>Gli2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">França et al., 2010</xref>), in the Shh transducer <italic>Kif7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Putoux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Walsh et al., 2013</xref>), and in <italic>Shh</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Cilia are essential organelles for transduction of HH signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>), and as a result, voice defects are also commonly associated with ciliopathies, human diseases that share an etiology of defective cilia structure or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hildebrandt et al., 2011</xref>). For example, a breathy, high-pitched voice is a diagnostic criterion for Bardet-Biedl and Oral-Facial-Digital syndromes, while hoarse voices are diagnostic for Joubert Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beales et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garstecki et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maria et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rimoin and Edgerton, 1967</xref>). Laryngeal defects such as laryngeal stenosis and bifid epiglottis are also common features of other ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carron, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Silengo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Steichen-Gersdorf et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Stevens and Ledbetter, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the molecular genetic basis for voice disorders in human birth defect patients is not the only factor motivating a deeper study of laryngeal developmental biology. Indeed, vocal communication is ubiquitous in tetrapod animals, impacting a wide array of behaviors. For example, the Panamanian Tungara frog creates a complex, multi-tonal call that critically influences female mate choice, and this call requires a sexually dimporphic elaboration of the male larynx, the developmental basis of which is entirely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Griddi-Papp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ryan and Drewes, 1990</xref>). So too is the morphology of the songbird syrinx central to sound production, yet almost nothing is known of the developmental biology of this functional cognate of the larynx, despite the key role of bird song as a model for the study of acoustic communication. Likewise, the larynx of mice is central to their production of ultrasonic vocalizations throughout life. Despite the widespread use of mice for studies of developmental biology, the molecular genetics of mouse laryngeal development remain only cursorily poorly defined (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Böse et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lungova et al., 2015</xref>]). Clearly, a deeper understanding of the molecular genetic basis of laryngeal patterning and morphogenesis will inform our understanding of vertebrate animal behaviors involving acoustic communication.</p><p>In mammals, the larynx and vocal folds are comprised of an elaborate mixture of cartilages, muscles, nerves, and connective tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harrison, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lungova et al., 2015</xref>). The flanged circle of the cricoid cartilage, along with the C-shaped thyroid cartilage and intervening paired arytenoid cartilages provide the core of the laryngeal skeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, blue, yellow, purple). Anchored to these are the vocal folds, which are in turn comprised of paired <italic>cricoarytenoid</italic>, <italic>thyroarytenoid, cricothyroid</italic> and <italic>vocalis</italic> muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, pink, magenta, grey), as well as paired vocal ligaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, dark blue) and associated loose mesenchyme which we designate as the thyroglottal connective tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, green). The general laryngeal structure is similar across the mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harrison, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kaufman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Roberts, 1975a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>), though rodents communicate most commonly in the ultrasonic range, using a mechanism for sound production that is distinct from that generating audible sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mahrt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Roberts, 1975b</xref>). Importantly however, diverse aspects of rodent ultrasound production parallel those of audible vocalizations in other mammals, including tight control of laryngeal muscle activity and mechanical properties of the vocal folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Riede, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">2013</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19153.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Anatomy of the mouse larynx.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram representing ventral view of mouse laryngeal anatomy.

To understand the developmental trajectory of these defects, we first performed directed genetic fate mapping of the mouse larynx. We defined the embryonic origins for diverse tissues in the larynx, and also show that that laryngeal defects in both <italic>Fuz</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> mutants stem from an invasion of excess neural crest. Finally, we show that viable heterozygous <italic>Gli3</italic> mutant mice display quantitative changes in the morphology of the vocal apparatus accompanied by significant changes in the acoustic structure of their ultrasonic vocalizations. Together, these findings provide an improved foundation for molecular genetic studies of development in the mammalian vocal apparatus, establish a genetic animal model for understanding human congenital laryngeal and voice defects, and demonstrate that excess neural crest is a common etiology underlying diverse Hedgehog-related craniofacial defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Laryngeal and vocal fold defects in mouse models of human ciliopathies and Pallister-Hall syndrome</title><p>Voice and laryngeal defects are common in ciliopathies, including Oral-facial-digital Syndrome Type 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayes et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, we showed that mutation of genes encoding the Ciliogenesis and Planar Cell Polarity effector (CPLANE) proteins results in OFD phenotypes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tabler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Toriyama et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore examined the larynx of mice lacking the CPLANE component <italic>Fuz</italic> as a first step towards understanding the developmental basis for ciliopathic larynx and voice defects. We observed severe malformation of the laryngeal cartilages in <italic>Fuz</italic> mice, as well as severely disorganized and hypoplastic vocal fold musculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).

For example, one study reports that the major laryngeal cartilages are of a neural crest origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Matsuoka et al., 2005</xref>), but that mapping is surprising in light of other mouse genetic studies that suggest a mixed lineage (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jeong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mori-Akiyama et al., 2003</xref>).

While heterozygous <italic>Gli3</italic> mutant pups were capable of producing the full range of vocalizations made by control mice, they were significantly less likely to produce vocalizations with abrupt frequency steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,F</xref>, warm colors), which is consistent with the observed reduction in overall vocal bandwidth in the mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In our map, vocalizations in the same map area are acoustically similar, and so differences in the map between genotypes represent differences in acoustic structure between the genotypes; however, relative distance in the map beyond local relationships cannot be interpreted. For example, the vocalizations in the map area with n = 549 vocalizations differs from the vocalizations in the map area with n = 763 only by the presence or absence of a small initial high frequency component (present in n = 549, absent in n = 763).

We found that 69% of control vocalizations had steps (3257/4718) versus only 48% of mutant vocalizations (2073/4295). Conversely, mutant pups produced a far higher proportion of calls without steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, warm colors).

In sum, <italic>Gli3<sup>xt/+</sup></italic> heterozygous mice, display both morphological defects in the larynx and changes in their patterns of vocalization acoustics. While the acoustic structure of vocalizations is governed not only by the larynx, but also by the structure of the palate and pharynx, as well as neural inputs, our data nonetheless suggest that the mouse can provide a model for studying the links between laryngeal and voice defects in cilia and Gli-related craniofacial syndromes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the fundamental role of the larynx and vocal folds in mammalian communication, we still understand little about the molecular genetic control of their development. Here, we have explored the developmental basis for severe laryngeal defects in the ciliopathic <italic>Fuz</italic> mutant mice, and we describe qualitatively similar laryngeal defects, as well as vocalization defects, in mice mutant for the HH signal transduction protein Gli3. While we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>Fuz</italic> loss may impact additional signaling activities, one parsimonious interpretation is that in the absence of <italic>Fuz</italic>, defective ciliogenesis leads in turn to defective Gli3 processing and disrupted HH signaling. Indeed, the key function of <italic>Fuz</italic> in both mice and frogs is the control of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Park et al., 2006</xref>), and while Fuzzy controls PCP in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collier and Gubb, 1997</xref>), <italic>Fuz</italic> appears not to govern PCP-dependent processes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heydeck and Liu, 2011</xref>). Second, we have shown in <italic>Fuz</italic> mutant mice that both Gli3 processing and HH target gene expression are disrupted in the head during stages of neural crest cell specification and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tabler et al., 2013</xref>). Similar results have been reported for the limb and neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heydeck et al., 2009</xref>). Third, Gli3 is a known transducer of HH signals, and we recently showed that <italic>Fuz</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> mutant mice share a common phenotype of an enlarged crest-derived frontal bone in the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tabler et al., 2016</xref>). That result in the skull parallels what we observed here in the larynx: A severe defect arising from the excess neural crest in <italic>Fuz</italic> mutants and a milder, but qualitatively similar, defect in the HH transducer <italic>Gli3</italic>. Combined with a central role for cilia in HH signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>), we feel the most parsimonious interpretation is that cilia-mediated HH signaling defects in <italic>Fuz</italic> mutants alter laryngeal morphogenesis.</p><p>Our data therefore support a model in which the expansion of laryngeal neural crest in <italic>Fuz</italic> mutants is a consequence of increased neural crest cell numbers at specification stages caused, ultimately, by expanded <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression. This conclusion is supported by our previous findings of increased neural crest cell numbers at E9 in Fuz mutant mice, as well as by our observation of excess <italic>fgf8</italic> gene expression in these mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tabler et al., 2013</xref>) and by the finding in chick that Fgf8 can control neural crest cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Creuzet et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, because <italic>Fuz</italic> is required for Gli3 processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heydeck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tabler et al., 2013</xref>), our data are consistent with previous observations of expanded <italic>fgf8</italic> gene expression in <italic>gli3</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoto et al., 2002</xref>).

First, they shed light on the mechanisms of mammalian laryngeal development and suggest that the mouse larynx provides a tractable animal model for exploring the nexus between laryngeal structure and function. Second, they offer new insights into the role of neural crest in laryngeal morphogenesis, which may inform our understanding of the evolution of vocalization in vertebrates.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Embryonic origins of the mammalian larynx and vocal folds</title><p>Fate mapping is a critical prerequisite for understanding the etiology of defects in development, so our understanding of laryngeal development has been hindered by a lack of directed fate mapping of this organ. In fact, our knowledge of lineage relationships in the mouse larynx comes only from tangential findings in studies focused on other topics. The fate mapping data presented here therefore provides substantial insight and serves as a useful complement to the thorough fate maps of pharyngeal regions in birds and amphibians. We consider several notable findings:</p><p>First, our data demonstrate a mixed origin for laryngeal cartilages. Indeed, we find a mixed lineage even within a single cartilage element, with the thyroid cartilage being predominantly, but not completely, derived from <italic>Wnt1-cre</italic>-labeled neural crest descendants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, the caudal ventral midline of this cartilage was of mesodermal origin, labeled by <italic>Mesp1-cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This result adds the thyroid cartilage to the roster of individual skeletal elements assembled by fusion of crest and mesoderm-derived mesenchymal precursors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Le Lièvre, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Noden, 1988</xref>). In addition, we found no evidence for a neural crest contribution to the arytenoid or cricoid cartilages, and instead our <italic>Mesp1-cre</italic> lineage data suggest a mesodermal origin for these elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>These findings contradict a previous report suggesting a neural crest origin for all three laryngeal cartilages (thyroid, cricoid and arythenoid) with the anterior mesoderm boundary at the tracheal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Matsuoka et al., 2005</xref>). However, several independent lines of evidence support our conclusion of distinct lineages for the laryngeal cartilages. First, we found no evidence for a neural crest contribution to these cartilages using either <italic>Wnt1</italic> or <italic>Pax3</italic> promoters for lineage labeling. Second, conditional deletion of <italic>Smoothened</italic> or <italic>Sox9</italic> using <italic>Wnt1-cre</italic> results in specific loss of the thyroid cartilage but leaves the cricoid and arytenoids intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jeong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mori-Akiyama et al., 2003</xref>). A third line of evidence comes from whole animal loss-of-function for <italic>R-spondin2</italic>, which functions as a modulator of Wnt signaling throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Lau et al., 2014</xref>). In both <italic>R-spondin2</italic> mutants and <italic>Rspondin2/Lrp6</italic> double mutants, both cricoid and arytenoid cartilages are absent, while the thyroid cartilage remains unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yamada et al., 2009</xref>). Because neural crest and mesoderm-derived craniofacial structures are known to respond differently to Wnt signaling (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrell et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Quarto et al., 2009</xref>), these data suggest distinct embryological origins for these cartilages. Fourth, our fate mapping data are consistent with avian fate maps in which the arytenoid and cricoid cartilages have a mesodermal origin, demonstrated both by transplantation and clonal analysis after retroviral labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evans and Noden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Noden, 1986a</xref>). Finally, the amphibian pharyngeal skeleton, while considered to retain a more ancestral form, is nonetheless derived from a combination of neural crest and mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sefton et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A second interesting finding concerns the cranial mesodermal origin for the vocal fold muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This finding is in contrast to what has been previously described; lineage analysis suggested a somitic origin of laryngeal muscles in both birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couly et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Noden, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">1986b</xref>) and amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Piekarski and Olsson, 2007</xref>). Our combined <italic>Pax3<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Isl1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> lineage data indicate that the mammalian vocal fold muscles are not of somitic origin but derived from cranial mesoderm, consistent with recent studies performed in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lescroart et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the data argue for a neural crest origin for diverse connective tissues in the larynx, including the vocal ligaments and thyroglottal connective tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These findings are significant because the viscoelastic properties of such connective tissues play an important role in sound production in mammals (see below).</p><p>Thus, our findings extend previous work highlighting the intricate interrelationship between migratory neural crest- and mesoderm-derived muscles during craniofacial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Noden and Trainor, 2005</xref>). Indeed, interactions between cranial mesoderm and cranial neural crest cells are essential for the normal patterning of the complex musculature of the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grenier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heude et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rinon et al., 2007</xref>), perhaps explaining the lack of differentiated muscle in the crest-infused larynx of <italic>Fuz</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As such, our new data from the mammalian larynx complement existing work in other regions of the vertebrate head and highlight the key role of neural crest in the evolution of craniofacial morphology in general and the vocal apparatus specifically.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Excess neural crest as a common feature underlying craniofacial ciliopathies</title><p>Human ciliopathies commonly involve craniofacial defects as well as laryngeal and voice defects, including breathy voices in Bardet-Biedl Syndrome and a hoarse voice in Joubert and Oral-Facial-Digital Syndromes. Moreover, laryngeal stenosis or narrowing is observed in ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Silengo et al., 1987</xref>), consistent with glottic narrowing in <italic>Gli3</italic> mutants. Interestingly, Barnes Syndrome is a clinical entity that very closely overlaps the spectrum of defects in the known ciliopathy Jeune syndrome, but with the addition of severe laryngeal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burn et al., 1986</xref>). The genetic basis for Barnes syndrome is unknown, but it is possible that mutations in <italic>Fuz</italic> or its interacting CPLANE proteins may be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Toriyama et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In all cases, the embryological basis for human laryngeal defects remains only very poorly understood, but data here and elsewhere argue that excess neural crest may be a central causative agent. For example, the severely deranged <italic>Fuz</italic> larynx was found to be filled with <italic>Wnt1-cre</italic> labeled crest-derived mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which we interpret as a more severe version of the defect observed in <italic>Gli3</italic> mutants. Likewise, the high arched palate that characterizes diverse ciliopathies is also present in <italic>Fuz</italic> mutant mice, where it is accompanied by an excess of the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tabler et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we have also recently described a novel skull defect in <italic>Fuz</italic> mutant mice in which mesoderm derived parietal bones of the skull fail to form at the expense of expanded neural crest-derived frontal bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tabler et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, we also find that a milder version of that phenotype is present in <italic>gli3</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tabler et al., 2016</xref>). We conclude then that laryngeal, palatal, and skull defects arising from defective cilia-mediated Gli signaling share a common etiology rooted in the excessive neural crest.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Laryngeal developmental biology, neural crest, and the evolution of animal vocalization</title><p>Our work here focuses on a tractable model organism with well-developed genetic tools to explore the developmental biology of the mammalian larynx, revealing a key role for neural crest.

While alligators have a vocal folds relatively similar to that of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Riede et al., 2015</xref>), snakes and tortoises have highly derived larynges, in which novel vibrating structures take the place of vocal folds. In bull snakes, defensive hissing sounds are generated by a flexible horizontal shelf in the larynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Young et al., 1995</xref>), while in tortoises, sound appears to be generated by elastic bands on the lateral walls of the larynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sacchi et al., 2004</xref>). The embryonic tissue origins of these structures, as well as the molecular controls that guide their development, will be of interest.</p><p>In all three cases above, these laryngeal specializations are not muscular, but rather resemble connective tissue. Our finding of a neural crest origin for connective tissue in the mouse larynx suggests that novel vocalization structures in other animals may be crest derived. In light of the importance of neural crest in the diversification of vertebrate craniofacial structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frisdal and Trainor, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Le Douarin and Dupin, 2012</xref>), we propose that a broader study of laryngeal developmental biology will shed light on the evolutionary diversification of vertebrate vocalization mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Form and function in the mammalian larynx</title><p>The ultrasonic calls of rodents have emerged as a useful model for studies of mammalian vocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arriaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischer and Hammerschmidt, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heckman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Portfors and Perkel, 2014</xref>). Unlike the audible vocalizations generated by vibrations due to the pressure differential across the apposed vocal folds, rodent USVs are generated by a planar impinging air jet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mahrt et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, USVs are generated by the larynx and vocal fold adduction is an important factor both for sound production generally and for frequency modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Riede, 2013</xref>). Indeed, direct imaging during USV production revealed a tight apposition of the vocal folds but an absence of vibrations normally observed during audible vocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sanders et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, many physiological parameters of mouse USV production parallel those of audible vocalization in other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Riede, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">2013</xref>). Because so little is known about the etiology of human laryngeal birth defects and their relationship to voice dysfunction, we suggest that studies in mouse models will be informative.</p><p>We focused on pup isolation vocalizations, which are acoustically distinct from -and simpler than- adult ultrasonic vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2003</xref>). Pup calls are also processed preferentially in mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elyada and Mizrahi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu and Schreiner, 2007</xref>) and elicit maternal approach, retrieval and care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sales and Pye, 1974</xref>). We found that <italic>Gli3<sup>xt/+</sup></italic> pups produce vocalizations with durations and average frequencies that are not significantly different from those of their control littermates, however the bandwidth of these vocalizations is significantly different. Moreover, our more fine-grained analysis of vocalization shapes revealed that control and mutant mice differed in the proportion of specific vocalization types produced. In particular, <italic>Gli3<sup>xt/+</sup></italic> mutation decreased the propensity of mice to make step vocalizations with abrupt frequency discontinuities, also known as ‘punctuated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panksepp et al., 2007</xref>) or ‘jump’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanson and Hurley, 2012</xref>) syllables.</p><p>The mechanisms by which such step syllables are generated remain unclear, but we consider two possible explanations for this phenotype. First, vocalization requires exquisite neural control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arriaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Van Daele and Cassell, 2009</xref>), and HH signaling is known to control neural patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). It may be, then, that alterations in neural pattern in these mice result in imperfect neural control of the larynx. However, our data on the overall acoustic structure of cells in the mutant mice argue against this explanation. For example, call duration in rats, another rodent with similar ultrasonic vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sales and Pye, 1974</xref>), is precisely correlated with EMG activity of laryngeal muscles, and the activity patterns of these muscles during mouse ultrasonic vocalization reflect patterns seen in other mammals during audible phonation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Riede, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">2013</xref>). However, we found that duration of vocalizations was the same between control and mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, disruption of the vocal center of the adult mouse cortex leads to changes in the distribution of mean frequencies of vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arriaga et al., 2012</xref>), a parameter that was not affected in our <italic>Gli3<sup>xt/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Conversely, manipulation of the vocal center did not alter the distribution of syllables produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arriaga et al., 2012</xref>), while <italic>Gli3</italic> mutation did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Finally, step vocalizations like those affected in our mutant mice are not correlated with either thyroarytenoid muscle EMG activity or sub-glottal pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Riede, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">2013</xref>); and in fact, such step vocalizations can be produced independently of muscle or neural activity in excised bat larynges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kobayasi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that such steps may result from a passive biomechanical effect in the larynx itself, leading us to prefer the alternative explanation that defective vocalization in <italic>Gli3<sup>xt/+</sup></italic> mice results from defects in the larynx. By disrupting the normally tight connection of vocal fold muscles to the thyroid cartilage, we propose that the excess neural crest-derived connective tissue observed in the larynges of <italic>Gli3<sup>xt/+</sup></italic> heterozygous mice may disrupt the biomechanics of the vocal folds and thereby impair normal sound production. Ultimately, further studies will be required to better define the source of vocalization defects in <italic>Gli3</italic> mutant mice. Importantly, however, the data here demonstrate that mouse models can both inform our understanding of mammalian vocalization and could also provide insights into the etiology of human laryngeal and voice defects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>The following mouse lines were used: <italic>Gli3<sup>xt-j</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hui and Joyner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Johnson, 1967</xref>); <italic>Wnt1-cre</italic>: <italic>Tg:(Wnt1-cre)11Rth </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danielian et al., 1998</xref> PMID: 9636087); <italic>Mesp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Saga et al., 1999</xref>); <italic>Isl1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Srinivas et al., 2001</xref>) <italic>Pax3<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engleka et al., 2005</xref>) and reporter line <italic>R26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic>(Ai9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>R26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic>: GT(Rosa)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato-EGFP)Luo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>), Fuz mutants: <italic>Fuz<sup>gt(neo)</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gray et al., 2009</xref>).

Mouse vocalizations were recorded with an Ultrasoundgate 416 hr (Avisoft) sound recording system with a CM16/CMPA microphone (Avisoft) at a 250 kHz sampling rate and 16 bit resolution using Avisoft-RECORDER software, with the microphone suspended 5 cm from the pup. The start and stop times of ultrasonic vocalizations were automatically detected and frequency contours extracted using Ax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Seagraves et al., 2016</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/Ax">https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/Ax</ext-link>). Briefly, time overlapped segments were Fourier transformed using multiple discrete prolate spheroidal sequences as windowing functions, followed by an F-test to identify time–frequency points with intensity significantly above noise (p&lt;0.01). Acoustic segmentation was verified, and, if necessary, corrected manually. Signals that had exceeded the amplitude limit of the recording system (had ‘clipped’) were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Generating map of vocal repertoire space</title><p>In order to compare the vocalizations of the two genotypes we create a single high-dimensional space that fully captures all the acoustic structure in the frequency contours. We then visualize that high dimensional space using dimensionality reduction to create a two-dimensional map of the vocal repertoire. In this way, we are able to look at the vocal similarity across the vocal repertoire in the same reference frame for both genotypes. Frequency contours were mean frequency subtracted, and then all pairs of frequency contours were compared using dynamic time warping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sakoe and Chiba, 1978</xref>) to create an all-to-all distance matrix ((9013 × 9013)/2 comparisons). The data in this high dimensional distance matrix were then embedded into two dimensions using t-SNE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>) (transition entropy = 5, relative convergence of the cost function to 0.0001). t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear embedding method that aims to preserve the local structure within a data set. This is achieved through placing points into a low-dimensional space such that points that were nearby in a higher-dimensional representation remain nearby in the new representation. Specifically, this embedding is calculated through optimally matching local similarity measures obtained in both the high and low dimensional spaces. Unlike other non-linear embedding approaches, this technique preserves clusters within a data set, but will allow for larger length scale distortions in order to obtain the desired dimensionality reduction. This is precisely the opposite of PCA, multi-dimensional scaling, or Isomap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Tenenbaum et al., 2000</xref>), which aim to preserve the global structure at the expense of local distortions. Because t-SNE preserves local neighbor relationships from the full-dimensional space of the frequency contour, regions in the map can be thought of as rough categories of vocalizations based on acoustic similarity. However, only local relationships are preserved, long-length-scale relationships are distorted, which means that the axes of the map are inherently arbitrary. A detailed description of applying t-SNE to a behavioral data set can be found in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berman et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Acoustic analyses</title><p>Simple measures of acoustic structure (duration, bandwidth, and average frequency were calculated from the automatically extracted contours). Differences between WT and HT in these simple measures were tested using single factor ANOVAs on average values for each individual. To test for differences in the number of step and non-step vocalizations between WT and HT each vocalization was labeled as a step or non-step based on their position in the vocal repertoire map. This labeling was automatic and blind to genotype. Regions of significant difference between the HT and WT maps were determined using bootstrapping, where we estimated the variation in the measured probability density functions due having a finite number of vocalizations in the data set. This was achieved through separately resampling the 2-D embeddings of the vocalizations for each case (WT and HT) with replacement 10,000 times and convolving each of these resampled data sets with a Gaussian of width 4 to create distributions, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for each of the PDFs at every point in space (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≡</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≡</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

They analyze the embryological origin of the main tissues in the mouse larynx (e.g., neural crest and mesoderm) using genetic fate mapping techniques (which of course rely heavily on the specificity of the Cre lines utilized). They also study the etiology of the developmental defects in mouse mutants for two genes, <italic>Fuz</italic> and <italic>GLi3</italic>. Finally, they analyze the acoustic function of the vocal apparatus in mice with mild laryngeal defects (i.e., <italic>Gli3</italic>hets) and after some quite sophisticated studies, manage to uncover a phenotype. This is an interesting and well executed study about an understudied yet important organ, presenting high quality data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One main issue to be resolved is to provide better evidence for the conclusion that HH signaling is the main pathway affected during the development of the vocal apparatus in <italic>Fuz</italic> mutants (which provides the basis for the title of the paper).</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the authors should analyze the <italic>Ptch1<sup>-/+</sup></italic> mice to determine whether the vocal apparatus phenotype is similar to the one in <italic>Fuz</italic> mutants; this would add some additional evidence to their hypothesis.</p><p>2) Previous work by this group has shown that <italic>Fuz</italic> mutants have altered Gli processing and that a high arched palate is due to a local increase in neural crest cells in the maxillary prominence, which can be rescued by reducing <italic>Fgf8</italic> gene dosage.

We have no choice now but to proceed without this experiment, and we hope the Reviewers will accept the following: We have adjusted our manuscript to make clear that while cannot rule out the possibility of other effectors, the strong preponderance of evidence (in this paper and in other published works) strongly argues for the role for Fuz and Gli3 in HH signaling. First, we have shown in both mice and frogs that the key function of Fuz is in ciliogenesis, organelles well-known to be essential for HH signaling in mice. Moreover, while Fuz controls PCP in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Aimin Liu’s group has published data that strongly argue against any role for Fuz in mammalian PCP (Heydeck, Dev. Dyn. 2011).</p><p>Second, we have shown in Fuz mutant mice that expression of the commonly used HH reporter genes <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> are decreased in RT-PCRs at neural crest cell specification stages (E9.0), and that processing of the Gli3R protein in western blots is also reduced (Tabler et al. Dev. Cell 2013). Moreover, we have shown by in situ hybridization that the <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression domain is reduced and converges at the craniofacial midline in <italic>Fuz</italic>mutants (Tabler et al. Dev. Cell 2013). Third, Gli3 is a known transducer of HH signals and in a paper published recently, we showed that Fuz and Gli3 mutant mice share a common phenotype of an enlarged crest-derived frontal bone in the skull (Tabler et al., Dev. Biol. 2016). That result in the skull parallels what we observed here in the larynx: A severe defect arising from excess neural crest in Fuz mutant and a milder, but qualitatively similar, defect in the HH transducer Gli3. Combined with the key role for cilia in HH signal transduction, we feel the most parsimonious interpretation is that cilia- mediated HH signaling defects in <italic>Fuz</italic>mutants alter laryngeal morphogenesis.</p><p>Our manuscript has been altered to make these points explicitly.</p><p><italic>2) Previous work by this group has shown that Fuz mutants have altered Gli processing and that a high arched palate is due to a local increase in neural crest cells in the maxillary prominence, which can be rescued by reducing Fgf8 gene dosage. Is this same mechanism, increased Fgf8 expression, producing the increased neural crest?</italic> </p><p><italic>If not, are other signaling pathways altered in this region that may affect the local population of neural crest in the laryngeal region?</italic> </p><p>With our collaborator, Dr. Karen Liu (King’s College), we were able to perform this experiment. In <italic>Fuz</italic> mutants where <italic>Fgf8</italic> is reduced we observed a partial rescue of anatomical organization of the laryngeal cartilages (See new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In our previous work, we also noted that deletion of Fuz using <italic>Wnt1<sup>CRE</sup></italic> did not elicit the high arched palate and skull defects on complete Fuz mutants, arguing that Fuz function was required prior to neural crest specification. We have now performed this experiment in the context of the larynx, and as for the skull and palate, we find that <italic>Wnt1<sup>CRE</sup></italic> deletion of Fuz does not disrupt laryngeal morphogenesis (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we discuss these new data and place them in context, pointing out that they are consistent with our previous findings that reduction of <italic>Fgf8</italic> rescues palatal defects (Tabler et al. 2013) as well as skull defects (Tabler et al., Dev Biol. 2016) in Fuz mutant mice.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>Please respond to this additional question. Why do the larynxes of Fuz mutants look profoundly abnormal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, but more mildly so in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>? Are these mice of the same background? Is this degree of variability observed in the Fuz mutants even on an isogenic background? Comment on the expressivity of the phenotype will be of use to the reader.</italic> </p><p>We regret that the previous manuscript was not sufficiently clear on this point.</p><p>In fact, the phenotype is consistently severe, but the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> are frontal sections, while those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> are transverse sections. We have now altered the manuscript text to make this clear and to point out the clear separation of esophagus and glottis in controls and the lack of an apparent glottis in mutants. We also changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> to make this point more clear.</p><p>These changes are in the Results section of the manuscript, as well as in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>With the addition of the Fgf8 partial &quot;rescue&quot; data, the Discussion needs to better reflect the model being proposed. Is the primary effect of Fuz and Gli3 mutation the generation of neural crest via expanded Fgf8 expression, or is there a direct effect of HH signaling on laryngeal morphogenesis. This can be made clearer.</italic> </p><p>We have added text to the Discussion to address this point. We propose that cilia-mediated HH signaling plays a crucial early role in the generation of neural crest cell numbers, and on the basis of various findings, we also suggest that it play additional later roles. This latter speculation will require temporally- and spatially-controlled manipulations of HH signaling that we feel would be beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>The new verbiage can be found in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
