While it is established that DNA methylation hinders CTCF binding, the impacts of this methylation-sensitive CTCF binding on chromatin architecture and transcription are poorly defined. Here, we used a selective DNMT1 inhibitor (DNMT1i) to investigate the characteristics and functions of ‘DNMT1i-specific’ CTCF peaks resulting from global DNA demethylation. We found that DNMT1i-specific peaks preferentially form chromatin loops on gene bodies and interact with highly looping partner peaks located in regions of active chromatin. Notably, both DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly looping partners are enriched near nuclear speckles – condensate bodies implicated in transcription and splicing. Utilizing targeted protein degradation, we specifically depleted CTCF and nuclear speckles to elucidate their functional interplay. By degrading CTCF upon DNMT1 inhibition, we revealed that CTCF is important for DNMT1i-dependent interactions between chromatin and speckle proteins. Moreover, we found that CTCF promotes the activation of genes near speckles upon DNMT1 inhibition. Conversely, acute depletion of nuclear speckles revealed that they influence RNA abundance but do not maintain CTCF binding or looping. Collectively, our study suggests a model wherein DNA methylation prevents spurious CTCF occupancy and interactions with regulatory elements near nuclear speckles, yet CTCF looping is robust toward the loss of speckles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>DNA looping</kwd><kwd>CTCF</kwd><kwd>nuclear speckles</kwd><kwd>degron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007229</institution-id><institution>Harvard University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roseman</surname><given-names>Shelby A</given-names></name><name><surname>Siegenfeld</surname><given-names>Allison P</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Ceejay</given-names></name><name><surname>Lue</surname><given-names>Nicholas Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Waterbury</surname><given-names>Amanda L</given-names></name><name><surname>Liau</surname><given-names>Brian B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE1745303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lue</surname><given-names>Nicholas Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CTCF binding promotes chromatin-nuclear speckle interactions and gene activation after DNA demethylation, yet its binding and looping patterns are unaffected by speckle depletion.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian genome is organized at multiple length scales into compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromatin loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rowley and Corces, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Misteli, 2020</xref>).

Furthermore, CTCF binding and looping on or near genes can directly enforce enhancer-promoter loops and facilitate differential splicing and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rinzema et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kubo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ruiz-Velasco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nanavaty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alharbi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López Soto and Lipscombe, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Steensel and Furlong, 2019</xref>).

However, these methylation-sensitive sites comprise only a small subset of all potential methylated CTCF sites, suggesting that DNA methylation serves as a specialized mechanism to regulate specific CTCF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maurano et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, recent work has revealed that DNA methylation regulates a subset of CTCF loops and CTCF-dependent genes during mESC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monteagudo-Sánchez et al., 2024b</xref>). While methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks have been linked to gene expression and mRNA processing in some instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flavahan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flavahan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ruiz-Velasco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nanavaty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monteagudo-Sánchez et al., 2024b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schuijers et al., 2018</xref>), the functions of most methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks remain unknown.

We found that DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks within genes form loops to highly looping partner peaks located in active chromatin regions. Remarkably, DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly looping partners are located close to nuclear speckles – condensate bodies of protein and RNA that have been implicated in transcription and splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Belmont, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Spector and Lamond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ilık and Aktaş, 2022</xref>). Subnuclear localization relative to nuclear landmarks such as nuclear speckles is linked to genome structure and function, so we explored this relationship further by developing acute degron systems for both CTCF and speckles. Through these experiments, we clarify the directionality of the relationship between CTCF and speckles and glean novel insights into how methylation-sensitive CTCF contributes to chromatin structure and gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNMT1 inhibition activates CTCF peaks and loops on gene bodies</title><p>Loss of DNA methylation leads to increased CTCF occupancy at hundreds to thousands of CTCF sites depending on the cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maurano et al., 2015</xref>), but a global understanding of their looping patterns and functions is lacking. Recently, selective, noncovalent DNMT1 inhibitors (e.g. GSK3484862) have become available, enabling dynamic control of DNA methylation with fewer undesirable effects such as DNA damage and cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azevedo Portilho et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pappalardi et al., 2021</xref>).

Consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maurano et al., 2015</xref>), DNMT1i treatment increased CTCF binding at thousands of sites, which we term ‘DNMT1i-specific peaks’ (2079 up- and 2 downregulated peaks in K562, 6686 up- and 328 downregulated peaks in HCT116). These peaks are known to overlap with CTCF peaks in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maurano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spracklin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). As expected, DNMT1i-specific CTCF sites were 80–90% methylated in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and half of the CTCF binding motifs enriched within these peak regions were methylated at two key CpG sites implicated in CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spracklin et al., 2023</xref>).

CTCF HiChIP revealed that a large subset of DNMT1i-specific peaks (45% K562, 30% HCT116) resides within at least one loop anchor and these are henceforth called ‘looping’ peaks (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lareau and Aryee, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lareau and Aryee, 2018b</xref>).

On average, loops that are anchored by DNMT1i-specific peaks increase moderately in strength upon DNMT1 inhibition (average log<sub>2</sub>fold-change~0.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We next sought to evaluate these findings using our published LIMe-Hi-C dataset following DNMT1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Siegenfeld et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, we analyzed Hi-C interaction strength using standard aggregate pileup analysis over all DNMT1i-specific CTCF sites identified in our ChIP-seq data. Consistent with our Hi-ChIP data, this analysis revealed an increase in Hi-C interaction signal at DNMT1i-specific peaks following 3 days of DNMT1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>We next characterized the genomic annotations of looping and nonlooping DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks. Consistent with previous findings using azacitidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maurano et al., 2015</xref>), loss of DNA methylation through DNMT1i treatment led to the preferential reactivation of CTCF peaks on non-intron gene bodies, with half of K562 DNMT1i-specific peaks emerging in exons, promoters, or transcription termination sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>).

Altogether, selective DNMT1 inhibition leads to the emergence of thousands of DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks on gene bodies that engage in new chromatin interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks interact with highly looping partners near nuclear speckles</title><p>We next scrutinized the CTCF partners that loop to DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks. Notably, the CTCF partners of DNMT1i-specific peaks tend to engage in a moderately greater total number of different loops compared to all CTCF peaks (i.e. have more looping partners, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), mostly for K562 cells (average increase ~1.3-fold). This trend is in part driven by the tendency of non-intronic gene body CTCF peaks to more frequently participate in loops with highly looping CTCF partners in comparison to intronic or intergenic CTCF peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To characterize these highly looping partners, we ranked all CTCF peaks by the number of different partners they interact with and called those with the most partners ‘highly looping’, analogously to how superenhancers or supersilencers were previously characterized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>). HiChIP loops between DNMT1i-specific peaks and highly looping peaks also increased in strength upon DNMT1 inhibition (average log<sub>2</sub>fold-change~0.3), consistent with increased interactions between these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The propensity for a given CTCF site to engage in many contacts may reflect architectural stripes, a chromatin structural feature identified from Hi-C data that is postulated to result from persistent loop extrusion at a single region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yoon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrington et al., 2019</xref>). Stripe anchors are enriched for chromatin accessibility and histone modifications associated with active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vian et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, regions near highly looping CTCF peaks are accessible and modestly enriched for active chromatin marks such as H3K9ac and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, based on previously published Hi-C data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Siegenfeld et al., 2022</xref>), highly looping CTCF sites have an approximately twofold stronger propensity to engage in chromatin interactions compared to ordinary CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, stripe anchors identified from these Hi-C data also reside closer to highly looping CTCF peaks than all peaks, consistent with the similarities between these features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, these results show that upon DNA demethylation, DNMT1i-specific CTCF sites form loops to highly looping partners associated with active regulatory marks and stripe anchors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks interact with highly looping partners near nuclear speckles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Number of different loops (loops to different partners) the maximally looping partner peak makes (y-axis) for all vs. DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks (x-axis) in DNMT1i for K562 (left) and HCT116 (right).

As such, we next sought to study the nature of this relationship through degrading either CTCF or nuclear speckles. We first generated a HaloTAG-CTCF homozygous knock-in HCT116 cell line, which enabled the inducible recruitment of CTCF to the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase upon addition of the small molecule HaloPROTAC3, causing subsequent proteolytic degradation within 8 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Clusters 1, 2, and 4 comprise genes that increase in expression upon DNMT1 inhibition, whereas Cluster 3 contains the few genes that decrease in expression upon DNMT1 inhibition.

Interestingly, DNA-methylation-sensitive CTCF sites have recently been shown to regulate gene expression during differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells, supporting the important role of these highly regulated sites in modulating cell state transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Monteagudo-Sánchez et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monteagudo-Sánchez et al., 2024b</xref>). Here, we leveraged a selective DNMT1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azevedo Portilho et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pappalardi et al., 2021</xref>) to gain new insights into how DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks interface with chromatin looping and transcription. This new inhibitor is a valuable tool for reactivating CTCF at shorter timescales without the confounding effects caused by the covalent nature and toxicity of earlier hypomethylating agents or the compensatory feedback mechanisms that can result from gene knockout.</p><p>We found that DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks preferentially form loops on gene bodies and interact with promiscuous partner peaks at stripe anchors. Architectural stripes may contribute to transcription by promoting enhancer contacts with gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yoon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrington et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kraft et al., 2019</xref>) and may also represent a mechanism to poise transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrington et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we propose that DNMT1i-specific peaks enable transcriptional activation by interacting with regulatory elements through highly looping CTCF partner peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, DNA demethylation causes pleiotropic effects ranging from changes in gene expression to transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azevedo Portilho et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yin et al., 2017</xref>), and we cannot rule out that these other features could contribute to the effects we observe.</p><p>Strikingly, DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly looping partners are located near nuclear speckles, consistent with prior studies, showing that subcompartments near nuclear speckles exhibit increased CTCF binding and looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jabbari et al., 2019</xref>). We first explored this relationship by degrading CTCF and intriguingly observed that DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks gain SON Cut&amp;Tag signal upon DNMT1 inhibition in a CTCF-dependent manner, indicating a functional tie between DNMT1i-specific CTCF and speckles. This is consistent with a recent preprint reporting that CTCF helps establish basal speckle-gene contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yu et al., 2025</xref>). Additionally, our CTCF degron experiments demonstrate that a large fraction of genes that are differentially expressed upon DNMT1 inhibition depends on CTCF for upregulation. These genes preferentially gain CTCF binding and are located near nuclear speckles. Consequently, CTCF peaks that bind upon DNMT1 inhibition could facilitate the activation of genes near speckles, perhaps by mediating the engagement of genic CTCF sites with speckle-associated stripe anchors and/or splicing factors, although this model requires further study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). A role of CTCF in facilitating chromatin loops near speckles is synergistic with proposed models, suggesting that intragenic looping contributes to gene splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ruiz-Velasco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liao and Regev, 2021</xref>). Thus, DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks may reorganize genes near nuclear speckles as a means of influencing transcription.</p><p>We next studied whether speckles impact CTCF binding or looping by achieving the first acute degradation of nuclear speckles. Previous work knocking down SRRM2 supports a causative role of speckles in modulating chromatin structure but did not specifically study changes in CTCF binding or looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Although acute disruption of speckles supports their direct involvement in RNA abundance, we observed minimal impacts on CTCF binding or looping. This notion is consistent with recent work, showing that CTCF clustering and looping is not dependent on phase separation or nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ulianov et al., 2021</xref>) and that transcriptional disruption does not immediately impact chromatin looping or CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luan et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings also suggest that the genome interactions disrupted upon SRRM2 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2019</xref>) are not mediated by CTCF or only occur after a longer time. However, it is possible that nuclear speckles contribute to the establishment, but not maintenance, of CTCF loops, which may not be evident in our system due to the short time points employed for speckle degradation. Moreover, other features enriched near speckles, such as open chromatin, high GC content, and active gene expression, could instead contribute to increased CTCF binding and looping near speckles. Overall, our speckle degradation experiments help clarify the directionality of the relationship between speckles and CTCF.</p><p>Taken altogether, our findings highlight one possible mechanism through which DNA methylation may modulate genome architecture – by protecting a subset of genic CTCF sites from engaging with promiscuous CTCF peaks located near nuclear speckles. Genes near nuclear speckles may be particularly susceptible to activation through CTCF-dependent mechanisms, and thus might require this layer of protective regulation. Notably, the effects of DNA demethylation cannot be fully uncoupled from gene activation in our experiments, and thus this mechanism will require further study. Furthermore, the GC-rich composition of non-intron gene bodies might increase the likelihood of CTCF motifs in comparison to other genomic regions, increasing the vulnerability of these sites to ectopic CTCF binding. More broadly, our work nominates new functions for the known antagonism between gene body methylation and CTCF occupancy in regulating transcription through remodeling genome architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>K562 was obtained from ATCC.

To generate aggregate profile plots of public K562 histone modification bigwig files over CTCF peaks, deepTools (v 3.4.3) computeMatrix was used with the following parameters: reference-point <monospace>--referencePoint</monospace> center -bs 5 0-a 5000 -b 5000 <monospace>--skipZeros</monospace>, and results were visualized with deepTools (v 3.4.3) plotProfile. Overlap of peaks with subcompartments and TSA-seq was performed as described above for all CTCF peaks. The following published files were used from the ENCODE consortium for the peak characterization pileups: ENCFF239EBH.bigWig, ENCFF469JMR.bigWig, ENCFF600FDO.bigWig.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Calculating looping changes across conditions</title><p>To calculate fold-change and mean CPM loop strength between conditions, mango Hichipper output files for individual replicates were input into Diffloop (v 1.16.0) and processed with the loopsmake mango function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lareau and Aryee, 2018a</xref>). The full loop list was then filtered for loops with FDR&lt;0.01 and with at least 8 PETs across samples for a given cell type, and loops that appeared strongly (&gt;5 PETs) in only one replicate but 0 PETs in the other were removed. The quickAssoc function was then used to get loop strength fold-change and CPM values for each loop. Diffloop output files obtained from the summary() function were then intersected with genomic features (such as DNMT1i-specific peak overlap, subcompartment, Cut&amp;Tag signal) for further analyses using pgltools (v 2.2.0) intersect1D and redundant loops were merged using pgltools (v 2.2.0) merge and files were further processed in Python (v 3.7.0) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</ext-link>) with Pandas (v1.0.3), Matplotlib (v 3.2.1), Seaborn (v 0.11.2), and Statannot (v 0.2.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greenwald et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Cut&amp;Tag data processing</title><p>Paired-end reads were aligned to hg38, deduplicated, and converted to bam and tdf files as described above for ChIP-seq.

Hierarchical clustering was performed on the regularized log<sub>2</sub>-transformed counts using Euclidean distance as a metric and the complete clustering method. All genes with both an p-adj&lt;0.05, calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction, and |log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change)|&gt;0.5 between wild-type DNMT1i and DMSO were included in the clustered heatmap. The regularized log<sub>2</sub>-transformed counts for the variable genes were grouped by K-means clustering (K=4), and the Z-scores for the variable genes, ordered according to their cluster identity, are depicted. For differential exon analysis, DEXSeq (v 1.34.1) was used. Files were then imported into R, and fold-change values were computed according to the standard DEXSeq workflow. BioMart was used to map the genomic ranges for each gene onto RNA-seq differential expression output files. Gene expression changes were compared with Cut&amp;Tag signal and CTCF peak overlap using bedtools (v 2.26.0) map with -o mean.

It has been known for decades that CTCF is sensitive to 5-cystosine DNA methylation (5meC) in certain contexts.

A number of labs (eg, Schubeler and Stamatoyannopoulos) have assessed the impact of DNA methylation on CTCF binding, but it is important to also interrogate the effect on chromatin organization (ie, looping). Here, Roseman and colleagues used a DNMT1 inhibitor in two established human cancer lines (HCT116 [colon] and K562 [leukemia]), and performed CTCF ChIPseq and HiChIP. They showed that &quot;reactivated&quot; CTCF sites-that is, bound in the absence of 5meC-are enriched in gene bodies, participate in many looping events, and intriguingly, appear associated with nuclear speckles.

As previous reported, and as expected based on our knowledge that CTCF binding is methylation-sensitive, the authors find that loss of methylation leads to additional CTCF binding sites and increased loop formation. By comparing novel loops with the binding of the pre-mRNA splicing factor SON, which localizes to the nuclear speckle compartment, they propose that these reactivated loops localize to near speckles. This behavior is dependent on CTCF whereas degradation of two speckle proteins does not affect CTCF binding or loop formation. The authors propose a model in which DNA methylation controls the association of genome regions with speckles via CTCF-mediated insulation.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The strengths of the study are (1) the use of a new, specific DNMT1 inhibitor and (2) the observation that genes whose expression is sensitive to DNMT1 inhibition and dependent on CTCF (cluster 2) show higher association with SON than genes which are sensitive to DNMT1 inhibition but are CTCF insensitive, is in line with the authors' general model.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>There are a number of significant weaknesses that as a whole undermine many of the key conclusions, including the overall mechanistic model of a direct regulatory role of DNA methylation on CTCF-mediated speckle association of chromatin loops.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive comments and address them point-by-point below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The authors frequently make quasi-quantitative statements but do not actually provide the quantitative data, which they actually all have in hand. To give a few examples: &quot;reactivated CTCF sites were largely methylated (p. 4/5), &quot;many CTCF binding motifs enriched...&quot; (p.5), &quot;a large subset of reactivated peaks...&quot;(p.5), &quot;increase in strength upon DNMT1 inhibition&quot; (p.5); &quot;a greater total number.....&quot; (p.7). These statements are all made based on actual numbers and the authors should mention the numbers in the text to give an impression of the extent of these changes (see below) and to clarify what the qualitative terms like &quot;largely&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, &quot;large&quot;, and &quot;increase&quot; mean. This is an issue throughout the manuscript and not limited to the above examples.</p><p>Related to this issue, many of the comparisons which the authors interpret to show differences in behavior seem quite minor. For example, visual inspection suggests that the difference in loop strength shown in figure 1E is something like from 0 to 0.1 for K562 cells and a little less for KCT116 cells. What is a positive control here to give a sense of whether these minor changes are relevant. Another example is on p. 7, where the authors claim that CTCF partners of reactivated peaks tend to engage in a &quot;greater number&quot; of looping partners, but inspection of Figure 2A shows a very minor difference from maybe 7 to 7.5 partners. While a Mann-Whitney test may call this difference significant and give a significant P value, likely due to high sample number, it is questionable that this is a biologically relevant difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the text to include actual values, instead of just qualitative statements. We have also moderated our claims in the text to note where effect sizes are more modest.</p><p>The following literature examples can serve as positive controls for the effect sizes that we might expect when perturbing CTCF. Our observed effect sizes are largely in line with these expected magnitudes.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8386078/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8386078/</ext-link> Fig. 2E</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(23)01674-1.pdf">https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(23)01674-1.pdf</ext-link> Fig. 3J,K</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/18/10934/7740592">https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/18/10934/7740592</ext-link> Fig. S5D (CTCF binding only).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The data to support the central claim of localization of reactivated loops to speckles is not overly convincing. The overlap with SON Cut&amp;Tag (figure 2F) is partial at best and although it is better with the publicly available TSA-seq data, the latter is less sensitive than Cut&amp;Tag and more difficult to interpret. It would be helpful to validate these data with FISH experiments to directly demonstrate and measure the association of loops with speckles (see below).</p></disp-quote><p>A recent publication we co-authored validated the use of speckle (SON) Cut&amp;Run using FISH (Yu et al, <italic>NSMB</italic> 2025, doi: 10.1038/s41594-024-01465-6). This paper also supports a role of CTCF in positioning DNA near speckles. Unfortunately, the resolution of these FISH probes is in the realm of hundreds of kilobases. This was not an issue for Yu et. al., as they were looking at large-scale effects of CTCF degradation on positioning near speckles. However, FISH does not provide the resolution we need to look at more localized changes over methylation-specific peak sites.</p><p>Instead, we use Cut&amp;Tag to look at these high-resolution changes. In Figure 3C, we show that SON localizes to DNMT1i-specific peaks only upon DNMT1 inhibition. We further demonstrate that this interaction is dependent on CTCF. In response to reviewer comments, we have now also performed spike-in normalized Cut&amp;Tag upon acute (6 hr) SON degradation to validate that our signal is also directly dependent on SON and not merely due to a bias toward open chromatin.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102930-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>TSA-seq has been validated with FISH (Chen et. al., doi: 10.1083/jcb.201807108, Alexander et.

We apologize for any confusion and have clarified this in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is not clear that the authors have indeed disrupted speckles from cells by degrading SON and SRRM2. Speckles contain a large number of proteins and considering their phase separated nature stronger evidence for their complete removal is needed. Note that the data published in ref 58 suffers from the same caveat.</p></disp-quote><p>Based upon the reviewers’ feedback, we generated Tranmission electron microscopy (TEM) data to visualize nuclear speckles +/- degradation of SON and SRRM2 (DMSO and dTAG). We were able to detect Interchromatin Granules Clusters (ICGs) that are representative of nuclear speckles in the DMSO condition. However, even at baseline, we observed a large degree of cell-to-cell variability in these structures. In addition, we also observe potential structural changes in the distribution of heterochromatin upon speckle degradation. Consequently, we hesitate to make quantitative conclusions regarding loss of these nuclear bodies. In the interest of transparency, we have included representative raw images from both conditions for the reviewers’ consideration.</p><p>We also note that in Ref 58 (Ilik et. Al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60579">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60579</ext-link>), the authors show diffusion of speckle client proteins RBM25, SRRM1, and PNN upon SON and SRRM2 depletion, further supporting speckle dissociation in these conditions.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102930-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102930-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors ascribe a direct regulatory role to DNA methylation in controlling the association of some CTCF-mediated loops to speckles (p. 20). However, an active regulatory role of speckle association has not been demonstrated and the observed data are equally explainable by a more parsimonious model in which DNA methylation regulates gene expression via looping and that the association with speckles is merely an indirect bystander effect of the activated genes because we know that active genes are generally associated with speckles. The proposed mechanism of a regulatory role of DNA methylation in controlling speckle association is not convincingly demonstrated by the data. As a consequence, the title of the paper is also misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is difficult to completely rule out indirect effects, we do not believe that the relationship between methylation-sensitive CTCF sites and speckles relies only on gene activity.</p><p>We can partially decouple SON Cut&amp;Tag signal from gene activation if we break down Figure 4D to look only at methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks on genes whose expression is unchanged upon DNMT1 inhibition (using thresholds from manuscript, P-adj &gt; 0.05 and/or |log2(fold-change)| &lt; 0.5). This analysis shows that many methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks on genes with unchanged expression still change speckle association upon DNMT1 inhibition. This result refutes the necessity of transcriptional activation to recruit speckles to CTCF.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102930-sa2-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We note the comparator upregulated gene set here is small (~20 genes with our stringent threshold for methylation-sensitive CTCF after 1 day DNMT1i treatment).</p><p>However, we acknowledge that these effects cannot be completely disentangled. We previously included the statement “other features enriched near speckles, such as open chromatin, high GC content, and active gene expression, could instead contribute to increased CTCF binding and looping near speckles” in the discussion. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have further tempered our statements on page 20/21 and also added a statement noting that DNA demethylation and gene activation cannot be fully disentangled. While we are also open to a title change, we are unsure which part of the title is problematic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) As a minor point, the authors imply on p. 15 that ablation of speckles leads to misregulation of genes by altering transcription. This is not shown as the authors only measure RNA abundance, which may be affected by depletion of constitutive splicing factors, but not transcription. The authors would need to show direct effects on transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we have changed this wording to say RNA abundance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>CTCF is one of the most well-characterized regulators of chromatin architecture in mammals.

One unfortunate aspect was that this paper neglected to discuss findings from our recent paper, wherein we also performed CTCF HiChIP in a DNA methylation mutant (Monteagudo-Sanchez et al., 2024 PMID: 39180406). It is true, this is a relatively recent publication, although the BioRxiv version has been available since fall 2023. I do not wish to accuse the authors of actively disregarding our study, but I do insist that they refer to it in a revised version. Moreover, there are a number of differences between the studies such that I find them more complementary rather than overlapping. To wit, the species (mouse vs human), the cell type (pluripotent vs human cancer), the use of a CTCF degron, and the conclusions of the paper (we did not make a link with nuclear speckles). Furthermore, we used a constitutive DNMT knockout which is not viable in most cell types (HCT116 cells being an exception), and in the discussion mentioned the advantage of using degron technology:</p><p>&quot;With high-resolution techniques, such as HiChIP or Micro-C (119-121), a degron system can be coupled with an assessment of the cis-regulatory interactome (118). Such techniques could be adapted for DNA methylation degrons (eg, DNMT1) in differentiated cell types in order to gauge the impact of 5meC on the 3D genome.&quot;</p><p>The authors here used a DNMT1 inhibitor, which for intents and purposes, is akin to a DNMT1 degron, thus I was happy to see a study employ such a technique. A comparison between the findings from the two studies would strengthen the current manuscript, in addition to being more ethically responsible.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments, which we address in the point-by-point response below.

We have confidence in our use of TSA-seq and Cut&amp;Tag to study SON association with CTCF sites on a genome-wide scale, which would not be possible with individual FISH probes. Specifically, since the submission of our manuscript several other researchers (Yu et al, Nat. Struct. and Mol. Biol. 2025, Gholamalamdari et al eLife 2025) have leveraged CUT&amp;RUN/CUT&amp;TAG and TSA-seq to map speckle associated chromatin and have validated these methods with orthogonal imaging based approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Demonstrate loss of speckles upon SON or SRRM2 by probing for other speckle components and ideally analysis by electron microscopy which should show loss of interchromatin granules.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed TEM in K562 cells +/- SON/SRRM2 degradation. Please see response to Reviewer 1 comment #3. Specifically, interchromatin granule clusters are visible in the TEM images of the DMSO sample (see highlighted example above), however, given the heterogeneity of these structures and potential global alterations in heterochromatin that may be occurring following speckle loss, we refrained from making quantitative conclusions from this data. We instead include the raw images above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should either perform experiments to clearly show whether loop association is transcription dependent or whether association is merely a consequence of gene activation. Alternatively, they should tone down their model ascribing a direct regulatory role of methylation in control of loop association with speckles and also discuss other models.

Ideally, genome bisulfite sequencing should be performed to show that the DNMT1i-specific CTCF binding sites are indeed unmethylated. But at the very least, a quantitative method should be employed to show the extent to which 5meC levels decrease in the presence of the DNMT1 inhibitor</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now included analysis of genome wide bisulfite information from LIMe-Hi-C (bisulfite Hi-C) in K562 following DNMT1i inhibition. Specifically, we leverage the CpG methylation readout and find that DNTM1i-specific CTCF sites are more methylated than non-responsive CTCF peaks at baseline. In addition, these sites show the greatest decrease in CpG methylation upon 3 days of DNMT1 inhibition. We include a figure detailing these analyses in the supplement (Fig S1E). In addition, we have added CpG methylation genome browser tracks to (Fig S1D). In terms of global change, we have found that 3 days of DNMT1 inhibitor treatment leads to a reduction in methylation to about ~1/4 the level at baseline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am not convinced that CUT&amp;Tag is the proper technique to assess SON binding. CUT&amp;Tag only works under stringent conditions (high salt), and can be a problematic assay for non-histone proteins, which bind less well to chromatin. In our experience, even strong binders such as CTCF exhibit a depleted binding profile when compared to ChIP seq data. I would need to be strongly convinced that the analysis presented in figures 2F-J and S2 D-I simply do not represent ATAC signal (ie, default Tn5 activity). For example, SON ChIP Seq, CUT&amp;Tag in the SON degron and/or ATAC seq could be performed. What worries me is that increased chromatin accessibility would also be associated with increased looping, so they have generated artifactual results that are consistent with their model.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have now performed spike-in normalized SON Cut&amp;Tag with DNMT1 inhibition and 6 hours of SON/SRRM2 degradation in our speckle dTAG knockin cell line. These experiments confirm that the SON Cut&amp;Tag signal we see is SON-dependent. If the signal was truly due to artifactual binding, gained peaks would be open irrespective of speckle binding, however we see a clear speckle dependence as this signal is much lower if SON is degraded.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102930-sa2-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Moreover, in our original Cut&amp;Tag experiments, we did not enrich detectable DNA without using the SON antibody (see last 4 samples-IgG controls).

They state “In K562 cells, 5-aza-CdR treatment resulted in weaker reactivation than in DKO cells…” In addition, cell-type-specific responsiveness to DNA methyltransferase KO depending upon global CpG methylation levels, has also been observed in ES and EpiLC cells (Monteagudo-Sanchez et al., 2024), which we now comment on in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>⁃ How many significant CTCF loops in DNMTi, compared to DMSO?
