yet a detailed understanding of its coordinated transcriptional programmes is lacking. To reveal the finer details of circadian variation in the mammalian SCN transcriptome we combined laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-seq over a 24 hr light / dark cycle. We show that 7-times more genes exhibited a classic sinusoidal expression signature than previously observed in the SCN. Another group of 766 genes unexpectedly peaked twice, near both the start and end of the dark phase; this twin-peaking group is significantly enriched for synaptic transmission genes that are crucial for light-induced phase shifting of the circadian clock. 341 intergenic non-coding RNAs, together with novel exons of annotated protein-coding genes, including <italic>Cry1</italic>, also show specific circadian expression variation. Overall, our data provide an important chronobiological resource (www.wgpembroke.com/shiny/SCNseq/) and allow us to propose that transcriptional timing in the SCN is gating clock resetting mechanisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10518.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10518.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10518.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The daily cycles of life in mammals are driven by a small region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (or SCN). The SCN receives signals from sunlight and other environmental factors to help coordinate most aspects of daily biological activity and behaviour. To work correctly, it is essential that the SCN switches certain genes on and off at exactly the right time. However, many questions remain over the identity of these genes and how their levels of activity change during a 24-hour period.</p><p>When a gene is active (or “being expressed”), it is used as a template to build the molecules of RNA that are needed to make proteins and to help to control how cells work. Pembroke et al. have now sequenced the RNA molecules made in the SCN of mice (which plays the same role as the equivalent human brain region) over a 24-hour period. The mice spent half of each day in the light, and half in the dark. This revealed that the expression levels of over a quarter of all the genes that are found in the SCN fluctuate over a 24-hour period. One particular group of genes peak in activity twice a day; Pembroke et al. suggest that these genes are important for controlling how an animal can adjust its body clock to light.</p><p>Further research is now needed to find out which of the newly discovered fluctuating genes play the most important roles in daily activity rhythms, and which might play a part in disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10518.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10518.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>transcriptomic</kwd><kwd>non-coding RNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme Grant, Functional Genomics Unit</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Kay E</given-names></name><name><surname>Ponting</surname><given-names>Chris P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute (SCNi)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Kay E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNA sequencing reveals the finer details of circadian variation in the mammalian master pacemaker over 24 hours, which suggests that transcriptional timing influences clock resetting mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the seat of the principal circadian clock in mammals. Entrained by photic information and other external stimuli, this group of neurons maintains 24-hr rhythms of physiology and behaviour by synchronising molecular oscillators in the brain and peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Welsh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ko and Takahashi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maywood et al., 2007</xref>). The transcriptional output of the SCN is thus critical for this fundamental biological adaptation to night and day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An early microarray study of the SCN identified 650 genes displaying circadian oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). However, this number will have been limited by the number of genes surveyed, the low signal-to-noise ratio of certain genes (e.g. <italic>Per2</italic>), and the use of experimental samples likely to include a large proportion of the surrounding hypothalamic tissue. The study of such heterogeneous samples will result in reduced amplitudes of oscillations for genes that cycle asynchronously in different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>). A recent study estimated that over half of all protein-coding genes show circadian oscillations in the mouse, although only 642 could be identified in hypothalamic samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>). Furthermore, many circadian transcriptomic surveys of mammalian systems have utilised constant lighting conditions to focus on the endogenous, free-running circadian clock and have not assessed more physiologically relevant light/dark (LD) cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hurley et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To identify circadian processes driven by photic cues, we combined RNA-seq with laser-capture microdissection (LCM) of the SCN to provide a comprehensive and tissue-specific transcriptomic investigation of the master pacemaker. These data reveal many hundreds of novel cycling transcripts and provide evidence that the temporal variation in a specific group of genes plays a role in modulating light-induced phase resetting of the circadian clock.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA-seq of high quality SCN samples identifies novel SCN enriched genes</title><p>LCM accurately isolated the entire SCN for transcriptional profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Ellipses delineate the 95% confidence intervals for each tissue. The first principal component (PC1) explains nearly 80% of the expression variance in samples and displays a large separation between liver and brain tissues signifying substantial transcriptomic differences between these disparate tissues. The second principal component (PC2; approximately 10%) in part explains variation among different regions of the brain. Samples from the same tissue (e.g. cerebellum) cluster together more closely than tissue samples from the same study (labelled by number) but different brain region.

Of 10 key circadian-clock genes, 8 showed the classic sinusoidal circadian profile (q &lt; 0.05) with a zenith and nadir at the expected timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); this verifies the temporal expression of our LCM SCN transcriptome dataset and indicates that any sequencing batch effects are minimal. Furthermore, quantitative (q)PCR of the LCM SCN samples showed a high degree of concordance with the RNA-seq expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Our SCN transcriptomes are also separable from those in other brain regions and non-CNS tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzi et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, four key SCN markers (<italic>Avp, Vip, Grp</italic> and <italic>Six6</italic>) showed a far greater expression enrichment in the SCN over other brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In summary, these data provide the first identification of SCN enriched genes either on a genome-wide scale or over a 24-hr period and allow an anatomically precise and comprehensive examination of the SCN transcriptional output over the full day. To allow further exploration into the dataset, we provide a user-friendly web application (www.wgpembroke.com/shiny/SCNseq/).</p><p>A total of 146 genes were identified whose expression is highly enriched in the SCN (Materials and methods; analysis of variance (ANOVA), q &lt; 0.05) of which 4 out of 4 were confirmed using in situ hybridisation (ISH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These genes included many known SCN markers, as well as others not previously implicated in circadian biology or in SCN function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Their significant enrichments for the Mouse Phenotype term ‘abnormal circadian rhythm’ (q = 1.2×10<sup>-4</sup>) and for Gene Ontology (GO) annotations relating to signalling pathways (q &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) are consistent with the SCN’s role as the master pacemaker. Enrichment for the flagellum annotation and G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) may reflect the roles of primary cilia as GPCR signalling hubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Omori et al., 2015</xref>). These results thus suggest that GPCR-mediated neuropeptide signalling via cilia may be important for SCN function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of sinusoidally cycling genes</title><p>We next identified 4569 genes (24% of 18,889 Ensembl-annotated coding or non-coding models expressed (≥1 read) in over six samples) whose expression oscillated in a sinusoidal manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) according to both JTK Cycle and DESeq2 approaches (Materials and methods). Importantly, this number of cycling genes is sevenfold higher than previously reported in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). This large increase is likely to reflect a combination of factors: first, the significantly improved anatomical enrichment of the SCN tissue we have surveyed; second, the greater sensitivity and specificity of the statistical approaches we have applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes et al., 2010</xref>); and finally, our sampling approach under LD as opposed to the constant dark (DD) conditions utilised in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). For example, we are able to detect cycling genes that may be physiologically relevant to light exposure or light-induced transcriptional cascades that are undetectable as cycling under DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ueda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leming et al., 2014</xref>). Our new collection of SCN cycling genes were enriched for GO terms relating to key processes such as translation and mitochondrion-related genes, in line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). De novo transcription has been shown to drive rhythmicity of approximately 20–30% of all cycling genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menet et al., 2012</xref>), which illustrates the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in shaping the circadian transcriptome. Interestingly, we observe novel enrichments among cycling genes in terms relating to RNA splicing and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) which suggests that these processes may establish oscillatory expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Other post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as miRNA level fluctuation, which were not assessed in this experiment, could also contribute to initiating these patterns.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10518.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gene clustering identifies a novel twin-peaking synaptic gene module with a potential role in phase resetting.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative expression of each gene present in the identified twin-peaking module over 24 hr.

Our module eigengene for the twin-peaking module (blue dotted line) indicates that when its expression lies above the threshold level (black horizontal line), the phase of the organism is able to shift. The greater the expression over this threshold, the larger the phase shift. Conversely, when expression is low and below this threshold, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is resistant to phase shifting induced by light pulses. This suggests the presence of susceptibility windows (shown by green bars) when light impulses are able to shift the phase of the SCN.

Twin-peaking gene-encoded proteins identified by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) SCN RNA-seq are indicated in blue. Photic information is transmitted to the SCN via glutamatergic signalling through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). (i) Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gates glutamatergic synaptic transmission by regulating either presynaptic release or membrane channel activity. (ii) Voltage-gated potassium channels hyperpolarise the SCN neurons allowing photic input from the RHT to elicit a significant response. (iii) Glutamate binding to glutamate receptor, ionotropic, N-methyl D-aspartate (GRIN) receptors induces calcium influx inducing CaMKII autophosphorylation. (iv) Active pCaMKII phophorylates neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which generates nitric oxide (NO), producing differential effects according to time of day. (v) In early night (ZT14), we observe peaking of genes relating to small guanosine triphosphate (GTPase) activation and actin-based cytoskeletal remodelling.

Alternative and potentially functionally important expression profiles may thus have been overlooked. Using Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), which does not assume a single mode of temporal variation, we identified a single module of 766 genes, which instead of adopting a sinusoidal profile, displayed two peaks of expression at ZT14 and ZT22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). From this ‘twin-peaking’ module 496 genes individually exhibited statistically significant temporal fluctuations (DESeq2, q &lt; 0.05), of which 17 of 17 were validated by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This profile is also distinct from previously described 12-hr harmonics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cagampang et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>), and prior to this, only single genes from individual studies were shown to possess similar expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shinohara et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cagampang et al., 1998c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">1998d</xref>). For example, isoforms of protein kinase C (<italic>Prkcb</italic> and <italic>Prkcg</italic>) exhibit a twin-peaking profile in rat SCN similar to that observed in our RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cagampang et al., 1998c</xref>). This twin-peaking transcriptional profile, particularly for this large number of genes, was thus unexpected. Functional annotations related to synaptic transmission, calcium signalling and gated channel activity were greatly and significantly enriched among these twin-peaking genes (q &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting a circadian component to establishing the electrophysiological environment of the SCN.</p><p>The peaking of expression at ZT14 and ZT22 coincides with phase shifting ‘susceptibility windows’; time periods in which the photic input permits phase shifting (or ‘resetting’) of the clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iyer et al., 2014</xref>). This is demonstrated by the phase response curve (PRC): a light impulse at ZT14 will initiate a phase delay of the clock whereas a light impulse at ZT22 will initiate a phase advance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Golombek and Rosenstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 1994</xref>). At all other timepoints we assessed under an LD cycle the twin-peaking genes exhibited low expression levels exactly when the clock is resistant to phase shifts. This suggests a possible transcriptional gating mechanism in which a threshold level of gene expression needs to be exceeded for light to activate this phase shifting pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillette and Mitchell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iyer et al., 2014</xref>). Transcriptional profiling at a higher temporal resolution would be required to confirm the elevated expression of twin-peaking genes above this critical threshold at timepoints when light-induced phase shifts are possible (e.g. ZT12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Genes previously known to participate in this light-induced phase shifting pathway display this twin-peaking pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and their pharmacological inhibition (e.g. for <italic>Grin2a/b, Camk2a, Nos1, Ryr2</italic>) blocks light-induced phase shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ebling et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yokota et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2010</xref>). Many genes whose expression peaks singly at ZT14 have functions related to actin cytoskeleton reorganisation and/or to small GTPase signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>).

Taken together, our data indicate that oscillations in the SCN transcriptome play an important role in gating the differential responses to light, a fundamental circadian process. The complex relationship between photic and non-photic cues and their relative roles in phase adjustment must also be considered, however. Light exposure during constant conditions can still modify the processing of non-photic signals by the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Challet and Pevet, 2003</xref>). For example, novelty-induced running in the subjective mid-day induces a phase advance in mice, although a 1-hr light pulse administered after access to running wheels can significantly attenuate this affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biello and Mrosovsky, 1995</xref>).

Mammalian Phenotype (MP) enrichment was determined using the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eppig et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>qRT-PCR and RT-PCR</title><p>For validation of results from RNA-seq, qRT-PCR was performed using the BioMark system (Fluidigm) as according to the two-step single-cell gene expression protocol using EvaGreen as described in the Real-Time PCR Analysis User Guide (PN 68000088, Fluidigm). For the process, 666 ng of starting RNA was used for each sample, which underwent 18 cycles of specific target amplification (STA) followed by a tenfold dilution. SCN CT values were normalised using the housekeeping genes <italic>ActB, Gapdh</italic> and eight genes which showed the most stable expression in the SCN according to sequencing data (<italic>Ankrd40, Nkiras1, Sar1a, Smarce1, Snrpn, Tpgs2, Tsn</italic> and <italic>Ywhaz</italic>). Primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>For RT-PCR of novel exons of <italic>Cry1</italic>, total RNA was purified from dissected SCN tissue and used to prepare cDNA (Revertaid, Fermentas). Primers representing previously annotated (5’ GTGAGGAGGTTTTCTTGGAAG 3’) and novel (5’ CTTCTAGGGAATTGCGACTG 3’) exons were used with a common reverse primer (5’ CTGGGAAATACATCAGCTGG 3’) to amplify products by RT-PCR followed by visualisation on an agarose gel and sequencing. The genomic coordinates of the novel exon are: chr10: 85,183,342 to 85,183,832 (mm10) with splicing into the following exon at 85,183,342 or 85,183,510.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>In situ hybridisation</title><p>Brains from male mice representing ZT6 were isolated as above and frozen sections at 15 μM were cut and mounted onto Superfrost slides (VWR).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Louis Ptáček (Reviewing Editor) and Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this submission (manuscript and on-line tool), Pembroke and colleagues report on a transcriptomic profile and search tool for the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), site of the brain's main circadian pacemaker. They improve on earlier studies of this type by 1) limiting the sampling of the tissue to the SCN itself (some other studies did not have this degree of neuroanatomical resolution and instead sample the SCN along with extraSCN tissue). 2) by sampling under the physiologically relevant light-dark cycle (as opposed to constant lighting). By combining RNAseq with 1 and 2, they provide exciting new evidence that many other transcripts cycle in a SCN specific manner as do long intergenic non-coding RNAs. Further, they show that some transcripts show two peaks in expression per 24h. Additionally they characterise a novel isoform of the key clock gene, <italic>Cry1</italic>.</p><p>They use established algorithms and analytic tools to identify functionally related groups of genes whose expression cycles and confirm these with qPCR In some instances they also confirm expression via in situ hybridisation. The manuscript is linked to an on-line tool which appears relatively easy to use and allows researchers to interrogate this database. This is a valuable resource, particularly for researchers with limited knowledge/insight into these types of investigations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In their description of the times of rising and falling transcripts, the authors highlight that the peak in some transcripts occurs at time when light cannot shift mouse rhythms and while others peak at times when light can shift the mouse SCN clock. There is somewhat of an over interpretation in this aspect (paragraph two, subheading “Identification of novel twin-peaking synaptic module”) since mice light-pulsed mice in constant dark will show shifts during the late subjective day or early subjective night. The authors show this is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Indeed, light pulses during the day can counteract shifts to non-photic stimuli given at these times. This means that the apparent paucity/abundance of transcript may or may not be important for shifts to light. This aspect needs to be softened in the text.</p><p>2) When using the on-line resource, it is clear that the level of variability of some transcripts can be very high. For example, for <italic>npy2r</italic> and <italic>avpr1a</italic>, the variability in night (ZT18 or 22) is much higher than at other time points. The authors need to comment on why this is the way it is and also describe further the functional consequences.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, is it GRP receptor transcript or GRP transcript itself that was measured?</p><p>4) For the transcripts showing 2 peaks in expression per 24h, this pattern has been previously observed (Cagampang et al., 1998a, b) and this merits discussion.</p><p>5) For reporting replicates, could the authors please provide details on the total number of mice used – is it 5 mice=1 data so samples from 15 mice are combined for the average expression profile at a given time point?</p><p>6) As the authors themselves point out, the fact that they find 7x more oscillating transcripts than Panda 2002 is simply a reflection of improved methodologies, or the fact that their experiments were conducted in LD rather than DD conditions. Some might also arise due to more evolved statistical criteria. Discussion on this point is warranted.</p><p>7) The claim that half the genes oscillating in the SCN do not oscillate in other tissues is unfortunately marred by the fact that they are comparing their L:D dataset to D:D datasets, as the authors state. This should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10518.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) In their description of the times of rising and falling transcripts, the authors highlight that the peak in some transcripts occurs at time when light cannot shift mouse rhythms and while others peak at times when light can shift the mouse SCN clock.

This means that the apparent paucity/abundance of transcript may or may not be important for shifts to light. This aspect needs to be softened in the text.</italic> </p><p>The highest levels of expression of the twin-peaking genes we identified are correlated with well-established susceptibility windows for phase-shifting in rodents. However, as the reviewers correctly state, light is also able to induce shifts at times when our twin-peaking genes do not ‘peak’ (such as at the end of the light phase); in these cases, we suggest that mRNA abundance remains above a particular threshold to facilitate phase shifting, despite not peaking at this time point. To illustrate this hypothesis more clearly, we have amended <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> so that when the expression of the twin-peaking module lies above a threshold level (the horizontal line) it allows the potential for a light-induced phase shift.</p><p>In addition, we agree that there are undoubtedly complex interactions between photic and non-photic cues that are important for phase adjustment behaviour, and we have now cited additional examples and expanded upon this point in the main text (paragraph two, subheading “Identification of novel twin-peaking synaptic module”). We do not believe that these specific studies necessarily affect our more general hypothesis that transcript abundance is important for light-responsive phase shifting. Nevertheless, we have toned-down our argument in several places (e.g. paragraph two, subheading “Identification of novel twin-peaking synaptic module” and subheading “Identification of novel transcripts with circadian expression profiles”) by acknowledging that more work will be required to determine the link between transcript levels and light-mediated behavioural changes.</p><p><italic>2) When using the on-line resource, it is clear that the level of variability of some transcripts can be very high. For example, for npy2r and avpr1a, the variability in night (ZT18 or 22) is much higher than at other time points. The authors need to comment on why this is the way it is and also describe further the functional consequences.</italic> </p><p>Our experimental design sought to reduce technical and biological variation in the data by pooling tissue from 5 animals for each individual sample and counterbalancing for factors such as the position of the cage in the light-controlled chamber prior to dissection. We also re-assessed potentially confounding factors such as RNA quality (RIN value) and the number of sequencing reads/library size obtained. None of these factors was found to be biased towards certain time points or time of day.</p><p>Although the two genes mentioned above do show large variation at these time points, they are not representative of the transcriptome as a whole. For example, the related gene <italic>Avp</italic> shows a very small degree of variation in expression at the same time points despite low levels of expression towards the end of the dark phase. In addition, by examining the coefficient of variance (CV) for all genes at each time point, we found that there was not a trend for greater variance of expression during the night as suggested, although it was marginally elevated during the day (12% increase; p&lt;10<sup>-5</sup> Kruskal-Wallis test).</p><p>Nevertheless, the reviewers raise an interesting point that increased variability at certain times could have a functional consequence. For example, a gene with an elevated CV at a particular time point may not need to be tightly regulated at that specific time; expression may only be required to reach a threshold level to induce its necessary function, with the generation of additional mRNA having no detrimental outcome. Variation may also be dampened at the functional level due to translational efficiency or other molecular feedback mechanisms. Alternatively, a gene might have a reduced CV representing tighter regulation at a particular time point if the precise level of mRNA at that time is functionally important.</p><p>In summary, from our own RNA-seq data we are reluctant at this stage to come to biological conclusions regarding the variation of single genes based on three biological replicates at each time point, but we are confident that there is no time-dependent technical bias in the dataset that influences our conclusions.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, is it GRP receptor transcript or GRP transcript itself that was measured?</italic> </p><p><italic>Grpr</italic> encodes the GRP receptor.</p><p><italic>4) For the transcripts showing 2 peaks in expression per 24h, this pattern has been previously observed (Cagampang et al., 1998a, b) and this merits discussion.</italic> </p><p>In the text we had mentioned 12-hour harmonics, but we were not aware of these particular studies highlighting ‘twin-peaking’ genes as shown by in situ hybridisation, including isoforms of PKC. We thank the reviewers for this observation and have cited these studies in the text (paragraph one, subheading “Identification of novel twin-peaking synaptic module”).</p><p><italic>5) For reporting replicates, could the authors please provide details on the total number of mice used – is it 5 mice=1 data so samples from 15 mice are combined for the average expression profile at a given time point?</italic> </p><p>This is correct; we have now further clarified this point in the Methods (subheading “SCN RNA sample preparation”).</p><p><italic>6) As the authors themselves point out, the fact that they find 7x more oscillating transcripts than Panda 2002 is simply a reflection of improved methodologies, or the fact that their experiments were conducted in LD rather than DD conditions.

This should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>We have added additional discussion and citations to address both these important points (paragraphs one and two, subheading “Identification of sinusoidally cycling genes”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
