source of new enzymes, and conversely, understanding the activities of MGE-encoded proteins can elucidate MGE function. Here, we biochemically characterize three proteins encoded by a conserved operon carried by the Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome (SCC<italic>mec</italic>), an MGE that confers methicillin resistance to <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, creating MRSA strains. The first of these proteins, CCPol, is an active A-family DNA polymerase. The middle protein, MP, binds tightly to CCPol and confers upon it the ability to synthesize DNA primers de novo. The CCPol-MP complex is therefore a unique primase-polymerase enzyme unrelated to either known primase family. The third protein, Cch2, is a 3’-to-5’ helicase. Cch2 additionally binds specifically to a dsDNA sequence downstream of its gene that is also a preferred initiation site for priming by CCPol-MP. Taken together, our results suggest that this is a functional replication module for SCC<italic>mec</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primase</kwd><kwd>SCCmec</kwd><kwd>A-family polymerase</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>mobile genetic elements</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM121655</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bebel</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>Melissa A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mir-Sanchis</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>Phoebe A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long-Term Fellowship ALTF 65-2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bebel</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SCC<italic>mec</italic> genomic islands encode a novel primase-helicase pair in which priming ability is conferred upon an A-family DNA polymerase domain by a novel protein cofactor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a dangerous human pathogen, due in part to the emergence of multi-drug-resistant strains such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>). MRSA strains have acquired resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (including methicillin) mainly through horizontal gene transfer of a mobile genomic island called staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moellering, 2012</xref>). SCC<italic>mec</italic> is a variant of SCC that carries a methicillin resistance gene, <italic>mecA</italic>. SCC<italic>mecs</italic> have been found in all known MRSA isolates, highlighting the crucial role of the element in the emergence of MRSA. Despite its clear medical importance, very little is known about how SCC<italic>mec</italic> is propagated in bacteria, especially about the steps occurring between excision from the host genome and transfer to new bacterial host, which could include replication of the circularized element as previously shown for certain other mobile genomic islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Novick et al., 2010</xref>). Determining the biochemical functions of the conserved proteins encoded by these elements can shed light on these processes and advance our understanding of SCC<italic>mec</italic> biology.</p><p>SCC elements show great diversity in size and gene content, with two common features: a single integration site within the <italic>S. aureus</italic> genome, and a conserved cassette chromosome recombinase (<italic>ccr</italic>) locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito et al., 1999</xref>). To date, at least 14 distinct types of SCC<italic>mec</italic> have been classified based on the features of their <italic>mecA</italic> and <italic>ccr</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">International Working Group on the Classification of Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome Elements (IWG-SCC), 2009</xref>). In addition to the conserved ORFs, SCC elements may carry different cargo, such as ORFs providing mercury or fusidic acid resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ito et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). SCCs also encode many so-far uncharacterized ORFs, presenting opportunity for discovery of proteins with interesting novel functions and potential biotechnological uses.</p><p>Recently, SCC elements have been divided into two groups based on the pattern (arrangement and predicted domains) of the conserved ORFs in their <italic>ccr</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mir-Sanchis et al., 2016</xref>). The first operon differs most between the two patterns. In pattern 2, it encodes three proteins, which are the focus of this work: a putative A-family DNA polymerase CCPol, MP (a small protein with no conserved domains), and a putative helicase Cch2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In pattern 1, the operon encodes a small single-stranded DNA-binding protein, LP1413, and a different helicase, Cch, that shows close similarities to the archaeal/eukaryotic MCM replicative helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mir-Sanchis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mir-Sanchis et al., 2018</xref>). Central to both patterns are the site-specific recombinases - CcrA and CcrB (pattern 1) or CcrC (pattern 2) - that excise SCC from the host and integrate it into the recipient genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Misiura et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, both patterns encode three small ORFs (not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) containing domains of unknown function (DUFs) 950, 960, and 1643. The first has been renamed SaUGI, as it acts as a staphylococcal uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor, and we propose that it could protect newly synthesised SCC DNA from host UDGases as seen in phage replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Serrano-Heras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of a repertoire of proteins consistent with replication (replicative helicase, ssDNA-binding protein, putative polymerase, and SaUGI) led to the idea that SCCs might replicate after excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mir-Sanchis et al., 2016</xref>). Replication could increase the copy number of the element upon excision therefore assuring its stable inheritance as well as more efficient transfer to a new host strain. It could also increase the copy number of cargo genes when under selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallagher et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Organization of conserved ORFs in SCC elements.</title><p>Pattern 1 elements (including types I-IV, VI, and VIII-XI) carry an operon encoding a short ssDNA-binding protein, LP1413, and a helicase, Cch, whereas Pattern 2 elements (including types V, VII, and XII-XIV, and SCC<italic>mer</italic>) carry an operon encoding CCPol, MP, and Cch2, which are characterized in this manuscript. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the sequence alignments of CCPol, MP, and Cch2 from various SCC elements.

The following SCC sequences were used for the alignments: the two gene clusters (SCC<italic>mer</italic>-like L and type V-like R) from a composite SCC<italic>mec</italic> from TSGH17 strain (SCC accession number AB512767), type V element from WIS strain (AB121219), type VII from JCSC6082 (AB373032), type XII from strain BA01611 (JCSC6082), type XIII from isolate 55-99-44 (MG674089), type XIV from strain SC792 (LC424989), and SSC<italic>mer</italic> (carrying a mercury resistance cluster) from strain 85/2082 (AB037671).

Cch and Cch2 belong to different families of helicases; each is predicted to be a distant homologue of a different self-loading replication initiator (Rep) helicase from unrelated staphylococcal genomic elements, the Staphylococcal Pathogenicity Islands (SaPIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mir-Sanchis et al., 2016</xref>). Cch, containing DUF927, is related to SaPIBovI Rep helicase while Cch2 contains a Primase_Cterm domain similar to that of SaPI5 Rep, which is also found in many virus and plasmid primase-helicase fusion proteins (these are often also annotated as containing a D5_N domain, referring to the N-terminal portion of the helicase segment of the vaccinia virus D5 primase-helicase fusion protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hutin et al., 2016</xref>). The two small proteins, LP1413 and MP share no homology; and the putative polymerase CCPol (previously named PolA for its similarity to A family polymerases) is only present in pattern 2 SCCs. Therefore, the structural and functional understanding of pattern 1 proteins gathered to date likely does not fully recapitulate the role of pattern 2 proteins.</p><p>Many mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that undergo replication, such as pathogenicity islands, plasmids, and viruses (including phages), encode an initiator helicase, a primase (occasionally both proteins are fused), and a recognized origin of replication. A notable example are the aforementioned SaPIs. SaPI replication requires a Rep helicase that uses its C-terminal domain to recognize an origin of replication, found directly downstream from the helicase gene and consisting of multiple short sequence repeats (‘iterons’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ubeda et al., 2007</xref>). Functionally, this is reminiscent of certain viral helicases such as SV 40 large T antigen and papilloma virus E1 protein which also recognize their cognate origins of replication but do so using an N-terminal dsDNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergvall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanning and Knippers, 1992</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, SaPIs also encode a primase that plays a role in but is not essential for SaPI replication in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ubeda et al., 2008</xref>). Known primases belong to one of the two evolutionarily unrelated families: DnaG-like (bacterial primases containing conserved a TOPRIM domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravind et al., 1998</xref>) and archaeo-eukaryotic primases (AEPs; containing a highly derived version of the RNA recognition motif also found in certain RNA and DNA polymerases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iyer et al., 2005</xref>). Both primase types are employed frequently by MGEs, including elements integrated into the host genomes, with both the SaPIbov1 and SaPI5 primases belonging to the AEP family. Generally, most known primases synthesize short RNA primers with notable exceptions being human PrimPol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">García-Gómez et al., 2013</xref>), a deep-sea vent phage NrS-1 PrimPol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2019</xref>), or PolpTN2 from pTN2-like plasmids in Thermococcales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gill et al., 2014</xref>), all of which prefer to synthesize DNA, and some of which make much longer products. While most often the RNA primers used for DNA replication are synthesized by specialized primases, there are instances where the host RNA polymerase has been co-opted to perform this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kramer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zenkin et al., 2006</xref>). SCC elements encode proteins that could take on the canonical functions required for MGE replication: Cch and Cch2 could act as initiator helicases equivalent to the Rep proteins of the SaPIs, while the polymerase in pattern 2 SCCs could replicate the DNA. However, the other typical components of MGE replication systems – a canonical AEP- or DnaG-like primase and the origin of replication – were not previously identified for SCCs.</p><p>In this project, we biochemically characterized pattern 2 conserved proteins CCPol, MP, and Cch2. We showed that all three interact with each other in vitro. Cch2 is an active 3’-to-5’ helicase that acts specifically on a putative SCC<italic>mec</italic> origin of replication sequence downstream of the operon. CCPol and MP form a complex that not only extends primers in a template-dependent fashion, but can also synthesize new DNA strands in the absence of primers. This DNA primase activity depends on the presence of MP, suggesting a novel primase-polymerase mechanism, and the preferred primase start site maps to the putative SCC<italic>mec</italic> origin of replication. The individual functions of the three proteins are consistent with their joint role in replication of SCC<italic>mec</italic>, where Cch2 would act as the replication initiator helicase and CCPol-MP would create DNA primers using the unwound origin as a template.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SCCPol, MP, and Cch2 interact with one another</title><p>In pattern 2, the three ORFs (CCPol, MP, and Cch2) upstream from the recombinase gene were predicted to comprise a single operon, which we will refer to as the ‘Cch2 operon’. We cloned the type V operon from the composite SCC<italic>me</italic>c element found in <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain TSGH17 (additionally carrying an SCC<italic>mer</italic>-type operon, with approximately 70% amino acid sequence identity between the two operons; see sequences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Operons identical to the cloned type V operon are found in SCC elements not only in other <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains, but also in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, <italic>S. heamolyticus</italic>, and other Staphylococci. To see whether all three proteins were expressed as predicted (e.g. without fusion by ribosomal frameshifting), we cloned the whole Cch2 operon into an <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vector with the first ORF (CCPol) His<sub>6</sub>-tagged. Upon induction, we observed expression of all three proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Furthermore, all three proteins co-eluted from nickel beads and from a size-exclusion column, suggesting that they interact with one another.

We observed interactions within all possible pairs (CCPol-Cch2, CCPol-MP, and MP-Cch2), with the strongest interactions between CCPol/MP and CCPol/Cch2 and the weakest interactions of tagged Cch2 with either CCPol or MP (suggesting that the N-terminal tag might interfere with the interactions).

SaPI origins are found just downstream from their <italic>rep</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ubeda et al., 2007</xref>), and contain a series of short repeats of a specific sequence (referred to as ‘iterons’) which Rep appears to bind as two hexamers. We therefore proposed that the intergenic region between the <italic>cch2</italic> and <italic>ccrC</italic> genes could act as an SCC<italic>mec</italic> origin of replication. This region is highly similar among different pattern 2 conserved loci and it contains indirect and direct repeats that could potentially serve as iterons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Purified Cch2 formed two discrete complexes with dsDNA PCR products representing this intergenic sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, WT). Deletion of the inverted repeats did not affect binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, -IR) while deletion of the direct repeats completely abolished it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, -DR). Furthermore, Cch2 did not bind to random DNA sequences with length and GC-content similar to the intergenic sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, R1and R2) unless the 23-bp direct repeat region was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, R1+DR and R2+DR).

To assess that, we used a non-denaturing gel to monitor the formation of a second DNA strand complementary to a radiolabeled template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). A slower migrating product could be detected for CCPol-MP both in the presence and absence of a primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, lanes 3 and 5). Both observed products could be denatured by heat (lanes 4 and 6), showing that they are in fact forming a DNA duplex and are not a result of template extension (which is in principle blocked by the presence of a 3’dideoxynucleotide). This indicates that CCPol-MP can synthesize DNA de novo and therefore acts as a DNA primase. Less duplex product appears in the absence of primer suggesting that initiation of DNA synthesis is less efficient than simple elongation. Binding the first two dNTP’s and/or forming the first chemical bond may be the rate- limiting step. Furthermore, since the duplexes observed both in the presence and absence of a primer run similarly in the presence of SDS, we conclude that the priming mechanism does not involve covalent protein-DNA interactions. Strikingly, in the case of CCPol alone duplex product could only be observed in the presence of a primer (lanes 8–11). As an additional control, we showed that the Klenow (exo-) fragment of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA polymerase I, as expected, does not display primase activity (lanes 15 and 16) while it is efficient in primer extension (lanes 13 and 14). Finally, we looked at the protein-DNA complexes formed in this assay by omitting the SDS otherwise used to dislodge bound proteins. Consistent with previous results, CCPol-MP preferentially shifted the ss template DNA over the ds product (lane 7) while CCPol alone did not bind the template DNA (lane 12).

In the priming assay, CCPol-MP could only form reaction products in the presence of dNTPs when no primer was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that CCPol-MP is a dNTP-incorporating primase. In comparison, CCPol alone was inactive in the absence of primers regardless of the nucleotides added (lanes 9 and 10), consistent with our proposal that MP is required for priming.

Strikingly, Klenow extended most of the CCPol-MP-made primers to products seven nt shorter than the template, which suggests that the main primase starting site on this particular template is seven nt from the 3’ end of the template (see more below). Moreover, we supplemented the inactive variants of CCPol-MP (D169A and D324A) with Klenow (exo-) and saw no priming or extension products, suggesting that Klenow cannot compensate for inactive CCPol in this assay, and therefore that, while MP can facilitate primer synthesis by CCPol, it cannot do so for a heterologous polymerase such as Klenow.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>CCPol-MP shows preference for the priming start site</title><p>When presented with templates of different, randomly chosen sequences but similar sizes, CCPol-MP began DNA synthesis in different places (or not at all), as seen in our prime-then-elongate assay (where after the priming reaction, additional unlabeled dATP is added to allow for further elongation of primers by CCPol-MP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). For example, a reaction in the presence of the 31-nt template 1 (2nd lane from left) and CCPol-MP yielded two major priming/elongation products of 23 and 24 nt.

These results suggest functional interaction between the putative initiator helicase Cch2 and the primase/polymerase CCPol-MP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we biochemically characterized three conserved proteins encoded by an operon found in all pattern 2 SCC elements. We find that these proteins physically interact with one another and have activities consistent with DNA replication: Cch2 is a 3’-to-5’ helicase that binds specifically to sequence motifs found just 5’ of its own coding sequence and CCPol is a DNA polymerase that can synthesize DNA primers de novo when complexed with MP.</p><p>The CCPol-MP complex constitutes a novel type of primase. Neither CCPol nor MP belong to either of the so-far characterized families of DNA primases: the DnaG-like or the AEP (archaeo-eukaryotic primase) families. In fact, NCBI annotates CCPol as carrying a ‘PolA’ conserved domain, and it has 15–22% sequence identity to other A-family polymerases. Based on modeling servers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) and predicted secondary structure alignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), CCPol is closely related to bacterial DNA PolI enzymes, but contains only the polymerase domain and completely lacks the 3’-to-5’ and 5’-to-3’ exonuclease domains usually present in PolI enzymes. In our assays, CCPol without MP is a template- and primer-dependent DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6a</xref>). However, upon addition of MP, the complex becomes proficient in template-dependent de novo synthesis of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>). We could not find any sequence- or secondary structure-based homologues of MP, nor could any known domains be identified. Furthermore, the largely beta predicted secondary structure of MP does not match the winged helix-turn-helix fold of the ssDNA-binding protein LP1413 from the pattern 1 SCC<italic>mec</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mir-Sanchis et al., 2018</xref>), despite its analogous position upstream from the Cch helicase gene.</p><p>A previous bioinformatic study included CCPol in a proposed new group of A-family polymerases termed the TV-Pols for their occurrence in transposons and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iyer et al., 2008</xref>). Due to their genetic association with D5-family helicases, which often have an N-terminal DnaG or AEP – type primase domain, it was suggested that the TV-Pols might act as primases. However, MP was not mentioned, and to our knowledge, none of the other members of the proposed TV-Pol family have been biochemically characterized.</p><p>The CCPol-MP primase-polymerase complex features a number of unique properties. As already mentioned, CCPol-MP is an exceptional DNA primase in that it cannot be classified into either of the two known families of primases. In contrast to most members of those families, CCPol-MP does not have a zinc-binding domain and does not appear to require zinc ions for activity (although it does require magnesium ions, consistent with the general metal-ion-dependent polymerase mechanism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geibel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kusakabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Powers and Griep, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, CCPol shows a strong preference for incorporating dNTPs over NTPs, and under our assay conditions CCPol-MP exclusively uses dNTPs to synthesize primers, which is striking since only a handful of known primases uses dNTPs rather than NTPs for primer synthesis (see Introduction). The structural features governing the choice of dNTPs over NTPs by a primase have been described for the AEP-like human PrimPol, where steric clashes between active site amino acids and the 2’ hydroxyl of a ribose sugar prevent incorporation of NTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rechkoblit et al., 2016</xref>). As CCPol is most closely related to DNA Pol I, we note that it does conserve two residues used to discriminate against ribonucleotides by <italic>E. coli</italic> PolI: E710 (our E174) and F762 (our F225).</p><p>Primases must be able to grip the template strand in the absence of a primer. In agreement with this, we found that MP confers tight ssDNA binding to the CCPol-MP complex even though binding to dsDNA was much weaker in our EMSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6a</xref>). Other primases also utilize a second protein or domain to aid in binding the single-stranded template: DnaG and PrimPol use a zinc-binding domain whereas many AEP-family primases use a helical bundle that is sometimes fused to the catalytic module and sometimes part of a separate subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geibel et al., 2009</xref>). Accessory domains and/or subunits have also been implicated in helping the primase enzyme bind the initial two nucleotide triphosphates, which MP might also do. These similarities suggest that in spite of involving different types of proteins, CCPol-MP might present yet another twist on a two-component primase system.</p><p>Clues about the CCPol-MP priming mechanism might be provided by the RNA polymerases of bacteriophages T7 and N4, which belong to the A family of polymerases yet can initiate synthesis of RNA de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cermakian et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lenneman and Rothman-Denes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sousa, 1996</xref>). These require an additional DNA promoter binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai and Rothman-Denes, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikeda and Richardson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennedy et al., 2007</xref>). CCPol-MP might function in an analogous way, with MP helping to deliver the single stranded template to the PolA-type active site. Another feature of these RNA polymerases is that the last helix of the thumb is shorter than in DNA Pol Is, allowing space for the triphosphate group of the first nucleotide. This helix is also predicted to be shorter in CCPol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; residues 151–156 in CCPol vs. 684–692 for <italic>E. coli</italic> Pol I).</p><p>Primer synthesis by CCPol-MP frequently stopped at about 14-15nt in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7a,d</xref> and the shorter products in part c). These short products corresponded to assays that used a low concentration of radiolabeled dATP, which may have been limiting (further extension was observed when substantial additional dATP was added later in the reaction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, the roughly consistent size of the primers made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7a,d</xref> as well as the bimodal distribution of sizes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref> hints that MP acts as an ‘anchor’ through interactions with ssDNA upstream of the priming site, which would provide a barrier to elongation even if MP is flexibly linked to CCPol, and would limit the length of primers produced when the enzyme is in priming mode. High dNTP concentrations may force the system over that barrier, leading to longer products. Many other primases form products ranging from 5 to 10 nt, with a particular ability of most primases to count the exact length of a primer made (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frick and Richardson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuchta and Stengel, 2010</xref>). For some primases, for example the human PrimPol, there is a proposed conformational change between the priming and elongation modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The elongation products that we observed suggested that CCPol-MP utilizes specific priming start sites. Within the consensus sequence for priming, the most commonly used nucleotides partially match (8/11 nts) a fragment of the putative origin of replication sequences, centering on one of its direct repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, top). Most primases do not start primer synthesis on a template at random but rather choose a specific site, with the level of specificity ranging from a simple requirement for a template pyrimidine (human primase) to a short (2–5 nt) specific template sequence (T4, T7 primases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuchta and Stengel, 2010</xref>). CCPol-MP appears to start the primer synthesis at discrete positions, with the first nucleotide added most often being a dGTP (opposite to the template dCTP) and with 90% of the template start sites being a pyrimidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). It is worth noting that T7 RNAP shows a similar bias towards using GTP as a first nucleotide incorporated, which could be explained by the architecture of the RNAP active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chamberlin and Ring, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennedy et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, CCPol-MP priming requires at least seven nt at the 3’end of the template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>), potentially due to the natures of CCPol-MP binding, MP-ssDNA binding, and resulting spatial constraints.</p><p>Our experiments suggest that Cch2 may act as a self-loading helicase. It has ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity and binds specifically to a highly conserved sequence downstream from its coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref>), as do the SaPI replication initiators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ubeda et al., 2007</xref>). However, other factors (for loading or activation) may be required, as we found only three iterons in the binding site, and our helicase activity in vitro was consistently low. It should be noted that for the founder of the D5 helicase family, from the vaccinia virus helicase-primase D5 protein, no helicase activity at all could be demonstrated in vitro, also suggesting that additional factors may be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hutin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The data presented here, combined with our previous studies of pattern 1 SCC element- encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mir-Sanchis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mir-Sanchis et al., 2018</xref>), strongly suggest that SCC elements are in fact replicative. A Cch or Cch2 operon can be found in all SCC elements identified to date, further supporting an essential role of the operon in SCC maintenance. Moreover, the Cch2 operon discussed here presents the same features as the replication modules of other replicative MGEs. For example, in nearly all DNA viruses that encode a replicative primase, a helicase domain is fused to the primase or is encoded in its vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kazlauskas et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, SaPI5 Rep, the closest homologue of Cch2, contains both primase and helicase domains, with putative SaPI origin of replication directly downstream from its gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mir-Sanchis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ubeda et al., 2007</xref>). SCC replication remains to be demonstrated in vivo and it is not known what naturally activates expression of these genes. However, replication could serve several purposes: it could increase the stability of the element by providing a copy for reinsertion after excision, it provides a mechanism for transient copy number expansion under selection, and it would greatly enhance the efficiency of any mechanism of horizontal transfer to new hosts.</p><p>It remains unclear whether additional SCC-, helper MGE-, or host-encoded factors are necessary for replication, and what the exact mechanism of SCC replication might be. Nevertheless, based on our biochemical analysis we can present a rough proposal for the initiation of pattern 2 SCC replication. Cch2 would bind to the origin of replication marked by the three iterons we identified, perhaps as two hexamers. After bubble opening and loading onto ssDNA by an unknown mechanism, Cch2 could then unwind the DNA, presenting a ssDNA template for priming by CCPol-MP, which shows a preference for and can efficiently begin priming at the sequences at the origin of replication. Since CCPol-MP does not appear to be highly processive and has no proofreading activity, a host polymerase would probably then use CCPol-MP-generated primers to efficiently complete replication of the element.</p><p>In summary, we have presented a biochemical characterization of three conserved proteins invariably encoded by pattern 2 SCC elements and likely involved in the replication of the element. Two of the proteins, CCPol and MP, form a complex acting as an intriguingly novel primase-polymerase, highlighting the importance of MGEs as reservoirs for proteins and protein complexes with potentially exciting enzymatic functions. Furthermore, since classical genetic approaches have been unsuccessful in elucidating SCC biology, we believe that this work and further characterizations of conserved SCC proteins will help advance our understanding of SCCs, most importantly of the SCC<italic>mec</italic> found in MRSA, the spread of which threatens new epidemics of multi-drug resistance <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SCCmec</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">AB512767.1</td><td valign="top">Mobile genetic element</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CCPol</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">AB512767.1 ORF TS025; <break/>BAK57481.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MP</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">AB512767.1 ORF TS025; <break/>BAK57482.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Cch2</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">AB512767.1 ORF TS025; <break/>BAK57483.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DH5alpha</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fischer</td><td valign="top">Cat # 18265017</td><td valign="top">Cloning strain (chemically competent cells)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21 (DE3)</td><td valign="top">Novagen (Sigma-Aldrich)</td><td valign="top">Cat # 69450</td><td valign="top">Expression strain <break/>(chemically competent cells)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Rosetta (DE3) pLysS</td><td valign="top">Novagen (Sigma-Aldrich)</td><td valign="top">Cat # 70956</td><td valign="top">Expression strain <break/>(chemically competent cells)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pET21a <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Novagen (Sigma-Aldrich)</td><td valign="top">Cat # 69740</td><td valign="top">Expression plasmid</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pET28a (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Novagen (Sigma-Aldrich)</td><td valign="top">Cat # 69864</td><td valign="top">Expression plasmid</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pUC19 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">NEB</td><td valign="top">Cat # N3041</td><td valign="top">Cloning plasmid</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pET28-SUMO</td><td valign="top">This work</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Expression plasmid with N-terminal SUMO tag introduced.

most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A novel DNA primase-helicase pair encoded by SCCmec elements&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Janice Pata (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The consensus amongst the referees is that the revised paper should include more quantitative analysis of the data, in better support of the comparisons of activities that are made in the Discussion. In the absence of quantitation, the characterization of both the polymerase and primase activities seem incomplete. There was also a consensus that Figure 5 and its model were not sufficiently supported by the data. That said, the reviewers all agreed that this is a fascinating set of observations and they hope that you will be able to revise the work for eventual publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Please see the full reviews below for the requested revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In addition to its obvious medical significance, this is a fascinating system from which we can glean fundamentally new insights into the regulated modulation of polymerase function and diversification of helicase and primase behavior. The fact that helicase is sequence-specific is very unusual. The fact that MP can cause the polymerase to switch from being template dependent synthesizing primers <italic>de novo</italic> is interesting too. The unique primase characteristics are fascinating, representing a totally new paradigm (using dNTPs, having a unique fold). The combined function of the complex is interesting as well. The data indicate that SCC elements are fully replicative – which is important for understanding mechanisms for conferring resistance. Some specific suggestions and comments are below.</p><p>1) It is important to define &quot;iteron&quot; and perhaps other terms, as <italic>eLife</italic> is a general journal. Particularly because this paragraph is confusing overall (for example, the text jumps from a description of Cch2 as a hexameric protein to a description of the intergenic region, and the reader does not see the connection) it is important that the terms are clear.</p><p>2) Subsection “Cch2 binds a putative origin of replication downstream from its gene” – helicases with actual sequence specificity are really rare. Even RecC is only a degenerated helicase that can bind to Chi. Therefore, it would be good if the text mentioned this novelty and quantitatively described how much tighter the observed binding is relative to random sequence (see point below about the unnecessarily qualitative nature of the work).</p><p>3) Subsection “CCPol-MP has primase activity” – Figure 6. There is clearly primer-independent extension in the presence of MP – but it is a small amount relative to the case with primer, which is not really discussed. It would be helpful for the authors to provide an explanation.</p><p>4) From above, the apparent primer independent (primase) activity is really weak based on the data. To make the bold claim that this is a unique primase, this reviewer thinks that the products should be sequenced. Perhaps it would be easiest the old fashioned way, with chain terminators of each nucleotide to read out the sequence.</p><p>5) The following statement, for example, exemplifies one of the issues I have with the paper, &quot;we found that MP confers tight ssDNA binding&quot;, however, the authors did not actually measure affinities so the statement is basically invalid. All the measurements in the paper are qualitative when it would have been a simple matter to conduct many of the experiments (such as the EMSAs) in a manner that would have yielded semi-quantitative Kd values (for example Figure 5), enabling accurate comparative statements in the paper.</p><p>6) Discussion, seventh paragraph: This section is contradictory. The experiments done at higher amounts of dATP do, in fact, contraindicate that the length is explained by limiting amounts of radiolabeled dATP. It is not clear why the authors are hedging so much. &quot;We cannot exclude that the length of primers observed for CCPol-MP arose due to limiting amounts of radiolabelled dATP in the reactions (priming reactions were conducted with 9nM labelled dATP compared to the optimal 0.67 mM of dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP used), although doubling or quadrupling the amounts of labelled dATP in the priming reaction did not change the product size distribution, only increased the amount of primers produced (not shown).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors describe the cloning, expression, purification and initial biochemical characterization of 3 proteins (CCPol, MP and Cch2) from a mobile genetic element (SCC<italic>mec</italic>) that carries a methicillin resistance gene in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. These proteins are predicted, based on sequence conservation and gene organization, to be involved in the replication and propagation of SCC<italic>mecs</italic>, which are found in all methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates.</p><p>The biochemical data presented in the manuscript convincingly demonstrate that:</p><p>– CCPol, MP and Cch2 form a soluble complex. (Figure 2)</p><p>– CCPol and MP form a heterodimeric complex. (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C)</p><p>– Cch2 forms large, oligomeric complexes, that migrate on a native protein gel at sizes consistent with hexamers and dodecamers. (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A)</p><p>– Cch2 binds to double-stranded DNA that contains three AAGTG directs repeats found in a 23-bp sequence downstream of the Cch2 gene in the SCC<italic>mec</italic> element – a sequence that is a putative origin of replication. (Figure 3A, B, C. Figure 3—figure supplement 1)</p><p>– The C-terminal 138 amino acids of Cch2 binds to the same ds-DNA fragment (Figure 3D)</p><p>– Cch2 displays helicase activity, with a preference for single-stranded DNA on the 3' side of the duplex region. (Figure 3E)</p><p>– CCPol and the CCPol-MP complex display DNA primer/template-dependent DNA polymerase extension activity, which is dependent on the two aspartates (D169 and D324) that are predicted to be magnesium-binding catalytic residues in CCPol, based on alignment with A-family DNA polymerases. (Figure 4A, B, D, Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2)</p><p>– The CCPol-MP complex and, to a much lesser extent, CCPol display 3' terminal transferase activity on single-stranded DNA, with a strong preference for addition of dCTP. (Figure 4C)</p><p>– MP confers strong ssDNA- and weak dsDNA-binding properties to the CCPol-MP complex, with DNA-containing one complex visible by EMSA on ssDNA of lengths 15 and 20, and at least 2 complexes on longer ssDNA. (Figure 5A, B, C)</p><p>– The CCPol-MP complex, but not CCPol alone, can initiate DNA synthesis de novo on ssDNA and the activity is dependent on the catalytic residues (D169 and D324) of CCPol. (Figure 6)</p><p>– The CCPol-MP complex can act as a reverse transcriptase on DNA-primed RNA, but could not initiated de novo primer synthesis. (Figure 6D)</p><p>– CCPol-MP preferentially initiates DNA primer synthesis at sites 8-14 nucleotides from the 3' end of the ssDNA template; a weak consensus sequence has intriguing similarity to the putative origin of replication sequence. (Figure 7)</p><p>Because of the importance of SSC<italic>mec</italic> elements and the lack of an understanding on how they move between cells, the findings reported are exciting, especially the novel observation that CCPol-MP has the ability to both synthesize DNA primers de novo and extend them in a template-dependent manner! These findings are all consistent with the idea presented that these proteins are involved in the propagation of the SSC<italic>mec</italic> elements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript identifies and then biochemically characterizes an ORF in a Pattern 2 SCC element that contains DNA polymerase, primase and helicase activities. Importantly the 3 gene products in this cluster physically associate and act at direct repeats to initiate DNA replication. This appears to be a functional replication module. Overall, the paper is in interesting and provide scientific value to this novel replication system, however, the experiments need better quantifications and are missing some importance facets to nail down the biochemistry of these complexes. Moreover, some of their conclusions are not backed up by the data.</p><p>1) The authors show an interaction between primase-helicase, helicase-pol and primase-pol (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). They then focus their experiments primarily on the primase-pol interaction and activities. But does the DNA synthesis rate or processivity increase in the presence of helicase (pol-helicase interaction).</p><p>2) Subsection “CCPol and the CCPol-MP complexes are active polymerases”, second paragraph: They should be able to determine whether limiting dATP/ATP in the reaction or the template itself is limiting full length product. I see in Figure 4B on polyT that there is full length extension. So, they can either dope in 32pdATP into cold dNTPS to effectively maintain high nucleotide concentrations, or they should try this on different templates. It is possible that there is a template nucleotide that is not replicated effectively. This would be interesting. Or they need to eliminate 2nd structures with other sequences or polyN DNA templates.</p><p>3) Figure 3—figure supplement 2: can Cch2 helicase load onto DNA by itself? Or does it need nucleotides?

Particularly because this paragraph is confusing overall (for example, the text jumps from a description of cch2 as a hexameric protein to a description of the intergenic region, and the reader does not see the connection) it is important that the terms are clear.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we changed the subheading to “Cch2 forms oligomers and binds specifically to a putative origin of replication” to make the topic switch between paragraphs less jarring.</p><p>Second, the paragraph in question has been rewritten to better explain iterons and our logic in general.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Cch2 binds a putative origin of replication downstream from its gene” – helicases with actual sequence specificity are really rare. Even RecC is only a degenerated helicase that can bind to Chi. Therefore, it would be good if the text mentioned this novelty and quantitatively described how much tighter the observed binding is relative to random sequence (see point below about the unnecessarily qualitative nature of the work).</p></disp-quote><p>The Introduction now includes a note about analogous viral helicases that recognize their own origins of replication in dsDNA – note that these (like Cch2) recognize sequences in double-stranded DNA whereas RecC recognizes single stranded chi.</p><p>Also, the new binding assays were done under more quantitative conditions (careful titrations with [DNA] &lt; Kd). Unfortunately, for Cch2 (but not for CCPol-MP) this led to smearing and material in the wells that made accurate estimations difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “CCPol-MP has primase activity” – Figure 6. There is clearly primer-independent extension in the presence of MP – but it is a small amount relative to the case with primer, which is not really discussed. It would be helpful for the authors to provide an explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We suspect that initiation of DNA synthesis is less efficient than simple elongation – the rate limiting step may be binding the first two dNTP’s and/or making that first bond between them. We have added a note in the main text to this effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) From above, the apparent primer independent (primase) activity is really weak based on the data. To make the bold claim that this is a unique primase, this reviewer thinks that the products should be sequenced Perhaps it would be easiest the old fashioned way, with chain terminators of each nucleotide to read out the sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we ran out of time to do this – because the initiation site is variable it is possible but not quite as simple as hoped. However, the other assays clearly show primase activity, and noted above, one might expect <italic>de novo</italic> initiation to be more difficult than extension.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The following statement, for example, exemplifies one of the issues I have with the paper, &quot;we found that MP confers tight ssDNA binding&quot;, however, the authors did not actually measure affinities so the statement is basically invalid. All the measurements in the paper are qualitative when it would have been a simple matter to conduct many of the experiments (such as the EMSAs) in a manner that would have yielded semi-quantitative Kd values (for example Figure 5), enabling accurate comparative statements in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The binding assays in question have been all repeated in a more quantitative manner resulting in an almost entirely new Figure 5 and calculations of the apparent Kd and Hill coefficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discussion, seventh paragraph: This section is contradictory. The experiments done at higher amounts of dATP do, in fact, contraindicate that the length is explained by limiting amounts of radiolabeled dATP. It is not clear why the authors are hedging so much. &quot;We cannot exclude that the length of primers observed for CCPol-MP arose due to limiting amounts of radiolabelled dATP in the reactions (priming reactions were conducted with 9nM labelled dATP compared to the optimal 0.67 mM of dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP used), although doubling or quadrupling the amounts of labelled dATP in the priming reaction did not change the product size distribution, only increased the amount of primers produced (not shown).</p></disp-quote><p>We realized this was confusing and have re-written that paragraph.</p><p>Our original point was that even though 4 x 9 = 36 nM is still far less than 0.67mM, if limiting dATP was the only thing limiting product size, we might have seen at least some increase in primer length rather than simply an increase in primer amount when quadrupling the labeled dATP concentration.</p><p>We suspect that very high dNTP concentrations somehow kick our system over an intrinsic barrier to elongation past ~15nt. However, we agree that the experiments presented aren’t enough to really nail down the conclusion. Therefore, we have simplified the Discussion by referring to what is now Figure 8 (old 7) where the concentration of dATP was raised to .67 mM (to match that of the other dNTPs) and the primers were extended to full length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:(…)</p><p>1) The authors show an interaction between primase-helicase, helicase-pol and primase-pol (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). They then focus their experiments primarily on the primase-pol interaction and activities. But does the DNA synthesis rate or processivity increase in the presence of helicase (pol-helicase interaction).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question but because the helicase activity is weak and dependent on a specific sequence in the dsDNA part of the substrate for reasons that we can’t fully explain mechanistically, we think it is beyond the scope of the study at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “CCPol and the CCPol-MP complexes are active polymerases”, second paragraph: They should be able to determine whether limiting dATP/ATP in the reaction or the template itself is limiting full length product. I see in Figure 4B on polyT that there is full length extension. So, they can either dope in 32pdATP into cold dNTPS to effectively maintain high nucleotide concentrations, or they should try this on different templates. It is possible that there is a template nucleotide that is not replicated effectively. This would be interesting. Or they need to eliminate 2nd structures with other sequences or polyN DNA templates.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated Figure 4A adding additional cold dATP after a long enough incubation to get a hot enough product to see. From this we can conclude that it isn’t the template itself – it was the limiting dATP.</p><p>There is a misunderstanding about Figure 4B: The “T” in T1, T2, T3 and T4 refers to “Template” not “Thymidine” – these templates are not poly-dT. To clarify we have inserted a note in both the main text and figure legend pointing to Supplementary file 1—supplementary table 2 where the sequences of these templates can be found.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3— figure supplement 2: can Cch2 helicase load onto DNA by itself? Or does it need nucleotides? Also what about loading onto circular DNA templates either ss or ds?</p></disp-quote><p>We suspect that we didn’t see binding to linear ssDNA because it can probably slide off the ends, and have added a note in the text saying so. Small circular DNAs are a good idea but we did not have time to try this before the lab closed. Regarding circular dsDNA: because the specific dsDNA sequence is needed for helicase activity, we have not yet been able to distinguish unambiguously between the binding mode that is most likely occurring in Figure 3 where the C-terminal domain is bound to dsDNA versus a more canonical helicase-like mode with the DNA through the hole in the protein ring. This will hopefully be more straightforward in the future once we have figured out what is limiting our helicase activity, but that may require substantial additional work. For this manuscript we feel that the main feature is the new primase activity, with some characterization of the helicase that it interacts with as a “bonus”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;roughly similar efficiency&quot;- instead, they can quantify these results, may be calculate a binding constant. Same with Figure 3C, the curve for dsDNA binding by Cch2 should be fit to a binding equation. Lots of quantitative information is lost in this manuscript in favor of qualitative descriptions. This includes data in Figures 5 and 6.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the impetus to improve this paper. As noted above, the binding assays have now been redone under more quantitative conditions. Unfortunately, for Cch2 binding the resulting gels are not rigorously quantifiable because those conditions led to some smearing and material in the well in addition to a discrete shifted band. Although with more time we might have been able to perfect conditions for these binding assays, we feel that these new gels, in combination with the earlier assays on longer DNAs that don’t yield Kd but show two discrete shifted bands, are sufficient characterization to make the points that are most important for this paper.</p><p>However, please note that the new set of CCPol-MP binding assays has been fit to binding curves now as requested, and the section of text has been completely rewritten.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the processivity of primer extension be compared for CCPol-MP vs. CCPol? I would expect MP to increase processivity. A single-turnover assay should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted this assay just before the lab closed down and sadly the answer was that we need to do a lot more work adjusting the conditions before we can make reliable, printable conclusions. Although we agree that this would add to the paper we don’t think it’s critical to our central points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5C and subsection “MP contributes ssDNA-binding activity to the CCPol-MP complex”: while it is true that the increasing substrate length should decrease the mobility, can the 5nt difference in the protein-DNA be seen in this small EMSA?

However, we suspect not for three reasons. First, priming was successful whether the template’s 3’ end was blocked with a dideoxyC (Figure 6A, B) or a phosphate (Figure 6C, D and 7A, D (=old 6E, F)). Second, in the Figure 6C panel 2, priming products were seen on a circular M13 template. Third, in Figure 8 (old 7) the distance from the priming site to the three prime end is variable.
