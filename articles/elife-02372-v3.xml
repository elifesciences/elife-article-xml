Individual myofibers and tenocytes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> interact through integrin (Itg) ligands such as Thrombospondin (Tsp), while vertebrate muscles attach to complex ECM fibrils embedded with tenocytes. We show for the first time that a vertebrate thrombospondin, Tsp4b, is essential for muscle attachment and ECM assembly at myotendinous junctions (MTJs). Tsp4b depletion in zebrafish causes muscle detachment upon contraction due to defects in laminin localization and reduced Itg signaling at MTJs. Mutation of its oligomerization domain renders Tsp4b unable to rescue these defects, demonstrating that pentamerization is required for ECM assembly. Furthermore, injected human TSP4 localizes to zebrafish MTJs and rescues muscle detachment and ECM assembly in Tsp4b-deficient embryos. Thus Tsp4 functions as an ECM scaffold at MTJs, with potential therapeutic uses in tendon strengthening and repair.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02372.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02372.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02372.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tendons, the tough connective tissues that link muscles to bones, are essential for lifting, running and other movements in animals. A matrix of proteins, called the extracellular matrix, connects the cells in a tendon, giving it the strength it needs to prevent muscles from detaching from bones during strenuous activities.</p><p>To achieve this strength, extracellular matrix proteins bind to one another and to receptors on the muscle cell surface that are linked to its internal scaffolding, thereby organizing other proteins into a structure called a myotendinous junction. However, despite the essential roles of tendons, scientists do not fully understand how this organization occurs, or how it can go awry.</p><p>Subramanian and Schilling screened zebrafish for genes that are essential for proper muscle attachment, and zeroed in on a gene encoding a protein called Thrombospondin-4b (Tsp4b). A similar protein helps to connect muscle and tendon cells in fruit flies. Without Tsp4b, zebrafish are able to form connections between muscles and tendons, but the muscles detach easily during movement. This weakened connection is caused by disorganization of the proteins in the extracellular matrix, which results in reduced signaling from the muscle cell receptors.</p><p>When a human form of this protein was injected into zebrafish embryos lacking Tsp4b, it settled into the junctions between muscle and tendon cells. The human protein repaired the detached muscles and restored the proper organization of the matrix. This improved the strength of the muscle-tendon attachment in the treated fish embryos, suggesting that similar injections could also help to strengthen and repair muscles and tendons in people.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02372.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02372.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>myotendinous junctions</kwd><kwd>muscle attachment</kwd><kwd>ECM organization</kwd><kwd>tendon development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AR62792, R01 DE13828</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>Thomas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional attachments between muscles and tendons require pentameric Thrombospondin-4, revealing novel roles both as an integrin ligand and extracellular matrix scaffold.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular structure and function depend on dynamic interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, defects in which cause many diseases such as muscular dystrophies and osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Emery, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mayer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kanagawa and Toda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carmignac and Durbeej, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maldonado and Nam, 2013</xref>).

Tsp4 facilitates collagen fibril packing in mouse tendons and ECM of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frolova et al., 2014</xref>). However, there are no known functions for Tsps during formation of muscle attachments and MTJ development in vertebrates.</p><p>We have identified a novel zebrafish Tsp, Tsp4b, expressed and localized at all muscle attachment sites in the developing embryo and in adults. We show that zebrafish Tsp4b, in its pentameric form alone, interacts with ECM proteins such as Lam, activates Itg signaling within muscles, and is required for establishment and maintenance of muscle attachments. Furthermore, recombinant human TSP4 is functionally interchangeable with Tsp4b and capable of repairing and strengthening tendons when provided exogenously. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for pentameric Tsp4 in ECM protein assembly and maintenance at MTJs and a potential therapeutic approach for improving tendon strength and repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Requirements for Tsp4b in muscle attachments</title><p>Through an in situ expression screen for markers of muscle attachments, we identified a zebrafish <italic>tsp4</italic>, <italic>tsp4b</italic> (69% similar to human TSP4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), which is expressed at all muscle attachment sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). In zebrafish, two genes share sequence similarity with other vertebrate <italic>Tsp4</italic> genes—<italic>Tsp4a</italic> and <italic>Tsp4b</italic> (previously designated as zgc: 111910, <italic>tsp-4a</italic> and <italic>thbs4</italic> on chromosome 21). Similar to other subclass B Tsps, Tsp4b is predicted to be secreted as a pentamer as it contains a conserved CX<sub>2</sub>C motif (CQAC—Cys-Gln-Ala-Cys) identical to human TSP4 in its hydrophobic coiled-coil oligomerization domain (CCD) (25/36 residues are identical with human and mouse Tsp4), which is required for inter-subunit disulfide linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Efimov et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Expression disappears in myoblasts as they differentiate and by 60 hpf becomes restricted to putative tendon cells near somite boundaries and along the horizontal myoseptum (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) as well as at all muscle attachment sites of the head by 72 hpf (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

By 72 hpf, Tsp4b protein was detected at the ends of all larval axial, appendicular, pharyngeal and extraocular muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–L</xref>). In the cranial region, these include muscle-cartilage attachments, inter-muscular attachments (between segments of the sternohyoideus [SH] muscle) and muscle-soft tissue attachments. These results suggest that during initial stages of muscle development in the trunk, myoblasts secrete their own Tsp4b to initiate attachment and MTJ assembly, and at later stages of somite muscle maturation, Tsp4b levels are maintained by secretion from tenocytes in mature MTJs.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02372.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Zebrafish Tsp4b localizes to all muscle attachments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>L</bold>) Whole mount immunostaining of wild type embryos using anti-MHC (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>D</bold>, <bold>G</bold>, <bold>J</bold>; green) and anti-Tsp4b (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>E</bold>, <bold>H</bold>, <bold>K</bold>; red) and merged (<bold>C</bold>, <bold>F</bold>, <bold>I</bold>, <bold>L</bold>).

Zebrafish Tsp4b lacks an RGD but contains a non-canonical Itg-binding (KGD—Lys-Gly-Asp) motif in its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ruoslahti, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 2004</xref>). We hypothesized that secreted Tsp4b in the ECM interacts with Itgs on muscle cell surfaces to promote attachment. To address this we examined effects of depleting Tsp4b on Itg activation and functional interactions with downstream Itg signaling components. Tsp4b-deficient animals showed severe reductions in key indicators of Itg signaling within myofibers. First, in 20–22 hpf embryos injected with <italic>tsp4b</italic>-MO, levels of activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK, detected with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylation at Tyrosine 861—pFAK<sup>y861</sup>) were dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D,G</xref>), which was rescued by injection of <italic>tsp4b</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Henry et al., 2001</xref>), and at later stages (36 hpf) were mislocalized or lost in local regions along somite boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–K</xref>), which was also rescued by co-injection of <italic>tsp4b</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L,M</xref>). In regions where pFAK was mislocalized along the somite boundaries, muscle attachments appeared disorganized. Second, simultaneous partial reduction of Tsp4b (sub-threshold doses of <italic>tsp4b</italic>-MO) and Itg signaling in heterozygous <italic>integrin-linked kinase</italic> (<italic>ilk</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>) mutants, neither of which causes any detachment on its own, led to dramatic and widespread muscle detachment upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Postel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). Third, in Tsp4b-deficient embryos, expression and localization of a GFP-tagged Paxillin (Pxn)—<italic>Tg[Pxn-GFP]</italic> - was significantly reduced, indicating a severe reduction in Itg signaling within the myofibers themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

A western blot of the protein extract showed that Tsp4b-FLAG and Tsp-GFP predominantly existed as a pentamers, while SQAS-GFP was exclusively present as monomers, further confirming that the oligomerization function of Tsp4b mediated by CQAC motif of CCD is essential for localization of Tsp4b to the MTJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>To test requirements for oligomerization of Tsp4b in muscle attachment, ECM organization and Itg signaling we injected wild type embryos with the SQAS form of <italic>tsp4b</italic> mRNA.

We propose a model in which pentameric Tsp4 in vivo functions as a scaffold to assemble other ECM components, and their interactions with Itgs and Dys complexes at MTJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our mutational studies of the CQAC motif support this hypothesis and show, for the first time in vivo, that pentamerization of Tsp4 is central to its scaffolding role, which organizes collagen fibrils in tendons in response to contractile force from muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hauser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kjaer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aparecida de Aro et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02372.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Tsp4b establishes and maintains MTJ ECM organization.</title><p>A model for ECM assembly at an MTJ.

Zebrafish Tsp4b shares the conserved C-terminal domain with human TSP4 and TSP5. The C-terminal region of mammalian Tsp5, which also functions as a pentamer, has been suggested to interact with multiple ECM proteins in cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hecht et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2007</xref>) and with collagen fibrils in tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Södersten et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tan and Lawler, 2009</xref>). We hypothesize that Tsp4 serves as a central organizing factor in MTJs by interacting with multiple ECM proteins, proteoglycans and receptors on muscle membranes. Other Tsps could play similar organizational roles as pentamers (subclass B) or trimers (subclass A) in contexts where they are required such as neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, wound healing and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arber and Caroni, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kyriakides et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sid et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of Tsp4b expression in zebrafish reveals surprising differences in muscle-tendon cell interactions during MTJ development in different muscle groups. Axial muscles attach directly to the basement membrane at somite boundaries in the early embryo and become contractile and functional at least 12 hr before tenocytes are detected at MTJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Devoto et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barresi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Henry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Snow and Henry, 2009</xref>). Our results suggest that after axial muscle progenitors attach, they secrete their own Tsp4b, which they downregulate upon differentiation, while later Tsp4b is secreted and maintained by tenocytes. Tenocytes in the zebrafish trunk likely originate from the syndetome compartment in each somite, similar to their counterparts in the chick, and migrate to sites of muscle attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brent et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shukunami et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen and Galloway, 2014</xref>). In contrast, we observe Tsp4b expression in cranial tenocytes at MTJs but not in cranial muscles. This difference in the timing and sources of Tsp4b between cranial and axial muscles suggests that there are distinct types of interactions between myoblasts and tenocytes involved in forming different types of MTJs. Our results suggest that Tsp4b is required for both initial attachments of some early muscles, which correlates with defects in early ECM, as well as more broadly in the maintenance of all types of attachments.</p><p><italic>Tsp4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice show progressive weight loss, atrophy of muscle mass and disrupted packing of collagen fibrils, but they are viable and fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frolova et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2014</xref>). Similarly, Tsp4b-deficient zebrafish appear largely unaffected until their muscles are subjected to multiple contractions. Stress-induced expression appears to be a common feature of many Tsps. For example, TSP4 (and other Tsps) is upregulated in response to exercise, myocardial infarction and in several types of muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Timmons et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frolova et al., 2012</xref>). Tsp5 expression is elevated in response to biomechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hecht et al., 1998</xref>). Subclass A Tsps (Tsp 1–2) are also elevated in response to injury or inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bornstein et al., 2004</xref>). Elevated Tsp expression in all these scenarios could reflect an attempt by cells at ECM repair but may also be detrimental by causing tissue fibrosis.

This elevated accumulation of Col is reversed with application of TSP4 in an in vitro cell culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frolova et al., 2012</xref>). This result is similar to our in vivo study, where injected TSP4 rescues the Tsp4b-deficient phenotype, suggesting that the scaffolding function of Tsp4 is evolutionarily conserved and functions as a modulator of ECM organization in multiple tissue types. Recent work on the functions of Tsp4 in cardiac ECM has shown interesting intracellular functions, where Tsp4 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of cardiac fibroblasts promotes nuclear shuttling of activating transcription factor 6 alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting study providing convincing evidence for a role of Thrombospondin 4b in muscle attachment in the zebrafish embryo. As in Drosophila, Thrombospondin is required for stable muscle attachments in vertebrates. Human <italic>tsp4b</italic> RNA rescues zebrafish <italic>tsp4b</italic> morphants suggesting conservation of function. Elegant mosaic analysis shows regional rescue of muscle around Tsp4b-expressing cells. Also demonstrated clearly are effects through Tsbp4 on other integrin mediated events both inside and the cell (FAK phosphorylation and paxillin localisation) and outside the cell, laminin organisation. The manuscript has the potential to be stunning and impactful, adding to our understanding of muscle and tendon development and function in the zebrafish model, and has relevance and implications for the study of human muscle/tendon disease and injury.</p><p>In general, the work is careful and thorough, the figures are clear, and the conclusions are well supported by the data shown. However, the citation of others' work could be improved and the statistical analyses need attention before publication.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors assume that Tsp4b only interacts with laminin and/or collagen binding integrins. Why is this assumption made given interactions between thrombospondins and Fibronectin? The tools exist for the authors to investigate which Integrins interact with Tsp4b. Determining mechanisms would expand the scope. If authors have a sound argument for not investigating Fn this needs to be presented in a coherent fashion.</p><p>2) There are two different phenotypes shown. One phenotype is muscle detachment. The conclusion is that “Our results suggest that Tsp4b is required to strengthen and maintain both types of attachments, but not for tenocyte formation or initial MTJ formation”. The other phenotype contradicts the above statement - there are discontinuous MTJs early in muscle development (20-24hpf). Tsp4b could play roles in both events - development of MTJ and strengthening/maintenance of attachment - but the data presented need to be clearly interpreted.</p><p>2a) Discontinuous MTJs: The authors show that Paxillin does not localize to MTJs at 20hpf, there is patchy laminin expression, and Fak phosphorylation is disrupted. The Time Axis needs to be considered. Are the initial somite boundaries forming but not being maintained? Are they not forming? Why are some muscle cells longer than others? And why is this phenotype not reflected in images shown in the beginning? This is a fundamental issue as the phenotype and conclusions drawn change throughout the manuscript. Does a lower dose lead to muscle detachment upon electrostimulation and a higher dose lead to developmental defects?</p><p>3) Lack of integration with the literature: “While the organization of the ECM at myotendinous junctions has been descripted, the developmental processes underlying its establishment and maintenance are poorly studied.” If the purpose of the manuscript is to further understand ECM establishment and maintenance at the zebrafish MTJ a logical approach would be to cogently describe what is known in the fish model. This would include that somites form, what is known about integrin signaling and matrix changes as MTJs form, what ECM proteins are known to be at the fish MTJ, phenotypes when these proteins are disrupted, and pathways that regulate their expression. While the authors are completely correct that MTJ development is not well understood, they should at least establish what is known in the field and how their results contribute. This is also true in the Discussion - multiple labs investigate ECM at these boundaries and have clearly laid out a time course and some cellular and molecular mechanisms of Fn and laminin deposition at these boundaries. Where does tsp4b fit into these pathways?</p><p>4) The conclusion that pentamerisation of Tsp4 is required for muscle-specific Itg signalling is not well supported (see comments for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> below) and this should either be toned down or strengthened by further experiment.</p><p>5) Can the authors explain their choice of mutation from KGD to KGE? Given that KGD appears to substitute for RGD, it is perhaps surprising that KGE fails to substitute for KGD, given that D and E amino acids are closely related.</p><p>6) Figures</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>:The description here refers to “isolated cells”, but they look like groups of cells in the figure.

Why is this assumption made given interactions between thrombospondins and Fibronectin? The tools exist for the authors to investigate which Integrins interact with Tsp4b. Determining mechanisms would expand the scope. If authors have a sound argument for not investigating Fn this needs to be presented in a coherent fashion</italic>.</p><p>We do not intend to state that Tsp4b interacts with only laminin or collagen. Tsp interactions with different matrix proteins have been well studied. We have tried to examine Fn localization in Tsp4b deficient zebrafish embryos, using different fixation conditions (4% PFA, acid-methanol, TCA) but we have had trouble in getting available antibodies to work. We tried anti-Fibronectin (MP Biomedicals LLC, Cat No. 55066), anti-Fibronectin H300 (Santa Cruz biotechnology Cat No. SC-9068), and anti-Fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich Cat No. F3648), but all three failed to show any specific signal at the somite boundaries in wt embryos (Garavito-Aguilar et al., 2010). Previous studies have shown that rat Tsp4 interacts with laminin (Lam), fibronectin (Fn), collagens (Col), and matrillin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Narouz-Ott et al., 2000</xref>). Zebrafish somite boundaries contain Lam, Fn and Cols, which become highly localized to the boundaries in larvae older than 3 dpf.</p><p>Availability of suitable antibodies has also hampered our ability to study integrins (Itgs) in zebrafish. Among three antibodies against focal adhesion kinase (FAK) – Anti-FAK (pY397) (Cat No: 44-625G), Anti-FAK (pY576) (Cat No: 44-652G), Anti-FAK (pY861) (Cat No: 44-626G) from Invitrogen - Anti-FAK (pY861) showed specific localization to basal ends of muscle fibers at MTJs. This demonstrated that activated Itg signaling requires Tsp4b signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>In our attempt to identify Itg receptors for Tsp4b we have now examined expression and localization of two likely candidates, Itga5 and Itga6, both expressed in embryonic mesoderm (Goody et al., 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lackner et al., 2013</xref>). We obtained <italic>Tg(Itga5-rfp)</italic> (gift from S Holley) and with live confocal imaging found that Itga5 localizes to the basal ends of muscles as they attach. <italic>itga5-rfp</italic> expression was modestly reduced at the membrane of Tsp4b-deficient embryos, consistent with a function as a Tsp4b receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). We also prepared a fusion construct of <italic>itga6-gfp</italic> from a full length cDNA clone of <italic>itga6</italic> and injected in vitro-synthesized mRNA into wt embryos. We found that itga6-GFP localized along the entire length of muscle fibers, not just at their ends as we might imagine for a Tsp4b receptor. Itga6-GFP localization was also slightly reduced in Tsp4b-deficient embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). These results have been added to the manuscript. From these results, we can postulate that similar to its interactions with Lam, itga5 is a good candidate for a Tsp4b receptor.</p><p><italic>2) There are two different phenotypes shown. One phenotype is muscle detachment. The conclusion is that “Our results suggest that Tsp4b is required to strengthen and maintain both types of attachments, but not for tenocyte formation or initial MTJ formation”. The other phenotype contradicts the above statement - there are discontinuous MTJs early in muscle development (20-24hpf). Tsp4b could play roles in both events - development of MTJ and strengthening/maintenance of attachment - but the data presented need to be clearly interpreted</italic>.</p><p>Previous studies on early development of somites have shown that the ECM at the somite boundary and MTJ undergoes dynamic changes with changing levels of Fn and increased deposition of Laminins and Collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Devoto et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Henry et al., 2005</xref>). Tsp4b interacts with all these ECM components in the MTJ and as a scaffold enables organization of these ECM components enabling muscle attachment at both early and later stages of somite development. The slow muscle fibers, which develop first, initially attach through predominantly integrin dependent interactions with Fn and later as Fn levels decrease, integrin-laminin and integrin-collagen interactions play an important role in attachment. At later stages, dystrophin-dystroglycan adhesion complexes also interact with matrix components of the MTJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jacoby et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, the nature of muscle attachment at the MTJ varies depending on the development stage of muscle fibers and the predominant matrix component involved in the attachment. Tsp4b, as a scaffolding protein and integrin ligand is expressed from early somitogenesis through adult life and modulates the organization of the ECM at the MTJ during every stage of development from somitogenesis.</p><p>Hence, the variation in the phenotype between early and later stages of development is probably not due to a change in Tsp4b function but due to the temporal changes in ECM composition at the MTJ. We have emphasized the later role in maintenance because generally muscle attachments form normally in Tsp4b-deficient embryos, but the variable defects we see in muscle attachments and Lam localization at 24-26 hpf could indicate an earlier role. Hence, we have changed our conclusions to state that Tsp4b has a role in both muscle attachment and strengthening/maintenance of ECM at the MTJ.</p><p><italic>2a) Discontinuous MTJs: The authors show that Paxillin does not localize to MTJs at 20hpf, there is patchy laminin expression, and Fak phosphorylation is disrupted. The Time Axis needs to be considered. Are the initial somite boundaries forming but not being maintained? Are they not forming? Why are some muscle cells longer than others? And why is this phenotype not reflected in images shown in the beginning? This is a fundamental issue as the phenotype and conclusions drawn change throughout the manuscript. Does a lower dose lead to muscle detachment upon electrostimulation and a higher dose lead to developmental defects?</italic></p><p>Initial boundaries form and are maintained for the most part in Tsp4b-deficient embryos – an embryo lacking early Lam or Pxn localization shows a fairly normal somite boundary. Part of the problem in presentation is that MHC staining does not label the entire mediolateral extent of the somites – so not all muscle cells are shown in figures like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1</xref>. Similarly, mutations in Itga5 and integrin linked kinase (ilk) do not affect the formation of all somite boundaries and <italic>loc</italic> (ilk<sup>-/-</sup>) mutants muscles also form attachments initially (Koshida et al., 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Postel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lackner et al., 2013</xref>). Apparently, the early defects we see in Lam and Pxn localization do not prevent muscles from forming attachments other than the occasional mislocalized attachment and an ectopic somite boundary. We have altered the text to clarify that Tsp4b could play roles in both MTJ development and strengthening/maintenance of attachments.</p><p>Muscle fibers that are longer than others occur at spots along the somite boundary where they extend across an entire additional somite to form an attachment with the next somite boundary. These could be at locations that lack Lam, in which case individual fibers have to either find the next boundary or form ectopic attachments with neighboring fibers as we sometimes see in Tsp4b-deficient embryos.</p><p>We performed our Tsp4b-MO injections as well as our electrostimulation assay in a dose-wise manner to determine optimal voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A</xref>)<underline>,</underline> and optimal concentrations of MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>). These chosen conditions have been used in all experiments unless stated otherwise.</p><p><italic>3) Lack of integration with the literature: “While the organization of the ECM at myotendinous junctions has been descripted, the developmental processes underlying its establishment and maintenance are poorly studied.” If the purpose of the manuscript is to further understand ECM establishment and maintenance at the zebrafish MTJ a logical approach would be to cogently describe what is known in the fish model. This would include that somites form, what is known about integrin signaling and matrix changes as MTJs form, what ECM proteins are known to be at the fish MTJ, phenotypes when these proteins are disrupted, and pathways that regulate their expression. While the authors are completely correct that MTJ development is not well understood, they should at least establish what is known in the field and how their results contribute. This is also true in the Discussion - multiple labs investigate ECM at these boundaries and have clearly laid out a time course and some cellular and molecular mechanisms of Fn and laminin deposition at these boundaries. Where does tsp4b fit into these pathways?</italic></p><p>We have expanded the Introduction and Discussion to add detail regarding the proteins and pathways involved in somite boundary formation and muscle attachment.</p><p><italic>4) The conclusion that pentamerisation of Tsp4 is required for muscle-specific Itg signalling is not well supported (see comments for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>below) and this should either be toned down or strengthened by further experiment</italic>.</p><p>We have performed experiments to verify the effect of the SQAS mutation on Tsp4b structure and function. We have presented the results of this study in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures1-3</xref> above. A Western blot performed on protein extract from <italic>SQAS-gfp</italic> injected embryos and <italic>tsp4b-FLAG</italic>/<italic>tsp4b-gfp</italic> injected embryos conclusively shows that loss of the cysteine residues prevents Tsp4b to form pentamers. We stained Tsp4b MO-injected embryos injected with SQAS full-length mRNA with anti-Tsp4b and detected no protein at somite boundaries in contrast to Tsp4b-deficient embryos injected with full length wt <italic>tsp4b</italic> mRNA. In order to verify synthesis and secretion of the mutant protein, we made GFP fusions of wt and SQAS mRNAs. Full length <italic>tsp4b</italic>-<italic>gfp</italic> or <italic>SQAS-gfp</italic> mRNAs were co-injected with Tsp4b-MO and imaged live on a confocal microscope at several stages. Both constructs were expressed at early stages of development (tail bud) while by 36 hpf the SQAS-GFP was not localized to somite boundary – there was weak fluorescence throughout the embryo – in contrast to Tsp4b-GFP. SQAS-GFP also disrupted the localization of Tsp4b-FLAG at somite boundaries when co-injected into Tsp4b-deficient embryos. These results conclusively show that CQAC motif in the CCD is required for pentamerization of the protein, which is required for proper localization and function at the somite boundary.

Given that KGD appears to substitute for RGD, it is perhaps surprising that KGE fails to substitute for KGD, given that D and E amino acids are closely related</italic>.</p><p>Previous studies of RGDs in Fn and other Itg ligands have shown that mutating RGD to RGE abolishes their ability to interact with Itg and promote downstream signaling. Itg interactions with RGD but not RGE are sufficient to promote mTOR activation and S6 protein phosphorylation, which are key steps for adhesion of fibroblasts with Itg ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian and Kuppuswamy, 2003</xref>). Mutation of RGD to RGE in the P2Y2R receptor inhibits its association with Itgs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Erb et al., 2001</xref>).
