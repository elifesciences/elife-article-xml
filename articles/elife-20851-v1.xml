Reasoning that this homeostatic challenge confronts all pulsatile organs, we developed a high resolution imaging and analysis toolset for measuring cardiac function in intact, unanesthetized <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We demonstrate that, as in humans, normal aging primarily manifests as defects in relaxation (diastole) while preserving contractile performance. Using this approach, we discovered that a pair of two-pore potassium channel (K2P) subunits, largely dispensable early in life, are necessary for terminating contraction (systole) in aged animals, where their loss culminates in fibrillatory cardiac arrest.

However, despite our understanding of the molecular basis of the heartbeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monfredi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Solaro, 2010</xref>), societies must confront an increasing failure of this process, which represents an intersection between normal aging and deleterious environmental and genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yancy et al., 2013</xref>). Previous research has demonstrated that many biophysical properties of the heart are altered over the course of a lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrick-Ranson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lakatta et al., 2014</xref>). These changes exist structurally, with myocardial fibrosis and arterial stiffening playing a leading role, but also manifest functionally, with alterations in the electrical waveform and calcium handling. However, whether these changes reflect normal senescence or compensatory attempts to maintain function remains an intense area of investigation.</p><p>The maintenance of cellular and organismal physiology, termed homeostasis, is essential for all living organisms. To uncover the mechanisms that maintain cardiac function, it has been necessary to develop a systems perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohl et al., 2010</xref>). These efforts have revealed that the heart’s rhythmic behavior is not uniform but exhibits variations that precisely match local mechanical needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brutsaert, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schram et al., 2002</xref>). Alterations in the heart’s rhythm also occur during normal aging, where the action potential is prolonged in an apparent effort to maintain the intracellular calcium dynamics necessary for contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janczewski et al., 2002</xref>). Such electrical remodeling is also observed in chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation and in several genetic and pharmacological models, suggesting that ion channels are under homeostatic regulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nattel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosati and McKinnon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that the heart monitors its own efficacy and adaptively remodels its electromechanical tone. However, significant implications to the pathophysiology of heart disease notwithstanding, the extended lifetimes and complexity of traditional mammalian models, as well as the necessity of their cardiovascular system for organismal survival, have confounded our ability to examine these potential homeostatic responses.</p><p>In seeking to develop a more tractable model for understanding this process, we reasoned that all electromechanical biological oscillators must defend themselves against intrinsic and environmental instability and compensate for natural senescence if they are to maintain their efficacy over time. The first primordial cardiomyocytes likely originated in Bilateria, and the transcription factors <italic>tinman</italic> (<italic>Nkx2.5</italic> in mammals), <italic>hand</italic> and <italic>mef2</italic> represent a conserved cardiogenic program linking the evolution of Protostome and Deuterostome hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bishopric, 2005</xref>). Despite having an open circulatory system that reverses the direction of flow periodically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wasserthal, 2007</xref>) and a greatly simplified architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rotstein and Paululat, 2016</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> has proven to be of significant utility in the study of cardiac development and physiology, revealing mechanisms of cardiogenesis and heart function that are highly conserved with mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">den Hoed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frasch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monnier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neely et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, <italic>Drosophila</italic> serves as a uniquely high-throughput ‘pioneer’ genetic model for uncovering conserved pathways involved in cardiomyocyte development and function.</p><p>A variety of imaging modalities have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ocorr et al., 2014</xref>). Most notably, an in situ preparation has been used to isolate the intrinsic regulators of cardiac performance in a defined physiological solution and in the absence of neuronal input. A complementary approach would be to monitor heart function in intact animals, where the full suite of intrinsic, environmental and homeostatic processes regulating the heart would be accessible to investigation, with minimal decay in cardiac performance for hours after preparation. While simple transmitted or reflected luminance measures can robustly monitor the rhythm of the heart in vivo, one cannot accurately measure heart wall displacement using this approach. Optical coherence tomography has been utilized to measure heart rhythm and displacement in vivo, and has successfully uncovered several novel genes affecting cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolf et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alex et al., 2015</xref>). However, increasing heart wall contrast relative to the lumen and surrounding tissues could yield further improvements in our ability to assess cardiac function in the intact animal.</p><p>In this study, we present a high resolution fluorescence imaging and analysis toolset for measuring cardiac function in intact, unanesthetized <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Using this platform, we demonstrate that, as in humans, normal aging manifests primarily as defects in relaxation (diastole) while preserving contractile performance, suggesting a conserved susceptibility to aging-related declines in the electrical, biochemical or structural processes facilitating relaxation. We also uncover a critical role for a heteromeric two-pore potassium channel in maintaining cardiac rhythmicity during aging, which appears dispensable for heart function early in life but is critical for preventing fibrillatory cardiac arrest in aged animals. We propose that the robustness, speed and resolution of this in vivo platform will significantly increase the utility of <italic>Drosophila</italic> in understanding conserved mechanisms of cardiac aging and homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Imaging cardiac performance in intact, unanesthetized <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>We developed a fluorescence-based approach for imaging the heart in intact, unanesthetized <italic>Drosophila.</italic> Briefly, the red fluorophore tdTomato was transgenically expressed in working cardiomyocytes using a newly discovered heart enhancer R94C02 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>).

Both visualizations demonstrated that the mechanical rhythm of the heart is reproducible between animals. This consistency is also evident in the four primary measurements of the cardiac cycle: the systolic interval, diastolic interval, end systolic diameter, and end diastolic diameter. The standard deviations for these four measurements are between 7% and 11% for our wild-type dataset of young animals between 10 and 30 days of age (n.s., Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, n = 68), demonstrating that this in vivo preparation is highly reproducible.</p><p>We next performed a series of control experiments to assess the stability of the preparation.

Indeed, the most striking change associated with aging was an increased latency in transitioning from systole to diastole, which primarily reflected a decrease in the velocity of relaxation (positive values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and an increase in the time period from peak contraction velocity to peak relaxation velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, blue, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.73). In contrast, the kinetics of contraction was much less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).

For example, atrial fibrillation exhibits an age-dependent penetrance that reflects self-reinforcing electrophysiological remodeling and normal aging. The action potential is shortened, which facilitates reentrant excitation, causing further shortening of the action potential thereby completing the feed-forward loop. Conversely, aging hearts exhibit action potential prolongation, which augments contractility but also predisposes the heart to Torsades des Pointes tachyarrhythmia, a ventricular rhythm defect that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Such age-dependent pathogenesis is evident in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of long QT syndrome where KCNQ potassium channel mutants develop progressive dysrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ocorr et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We systematically quantified the age-dependent progression of diastolic failure in <italic>sandman</italic> mutants. <italic>sandman</italic> mutants displayed only minor defects in cardiac function early in life.

However, by 30 days of age heart function was severely compromised; cardiac output per second and per stroke declined precipitously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) while the systolic and diastolic durations increased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). By 50 days of age, median total cardiac output per second had declined approximately 100-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Our imaging methodology permits the extended imaging of heart function in intact, unanesthetized animals for several hours, without measurable declines in cardiac performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). The resolution and reproducibility of our measurements revealed specific changes to the heartbeat waveform as animals age. Using a total of 146 wild-type flies from six different ages, we visualized approximately 65,000 heartbeats, reconstructing median heartbeat waveforms for each age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and demonstrating a progressive decline in the kinetics of relaxation but not contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).</p><p>The throughput of this in vivo assay facilitates the identification of novel genes that establish and maintain cardiac function and can therefore complement more complex vertebrate models. In a small scale screen, we identified two K2P channel subunit genes, <italic>sandman</italic> and g<italic>alene</italic>, which together give rise to a heteromeric potassium channel that appears essential for terminating systole and promoting relaxation in aged animals. Our analysis of <italic>sandman</italic> mutants revealed that the pumping function of the heart is acutely dispensable for adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> survival under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Although cardiac function is not required for zebrafish embryogenesis or the first week of development, heart function is otherwise essential for the survival of all adult vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Staudt and Stainier, 2012</xref>). Differences in heart dispensability likely originate in the decoupling of gas exchange and heart function in larval zebrafish or insects, where sufficient gas exchange can occur via local diffusion. This opens a unique window for understanding the physiological transition to, and maintenance of, fibrillatory arrest without the confounds of organismal or cardiomyocyte death. The future development of in vivo approaches for monitoring cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the beating heart will facilitate a clearer mechanistic view of the biophysical mechanisms initiating and sustaining fibrillatory arrest.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sandman is required to maintain diverse biological oscillators</title><p>Oscillatory behaviors exist across diverse timescales, from migratory cycles in birds to ultrafast spiking neurons in the auditory system. One conserved feature of oscillators is their capacity to be modulated by internal and external cues, thus adapting the system to immediate physiological needs or entraining the phase of the cycle to the external world. Interestingly, <italic>sandman</italic> appears to play a central role in two radically different biological oscillations: organismal sleep-wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>) and the contraction-relaxation of aging hearts (this paper). Pimental and colleagues demonstrated that Sandman-dependent potassium currents are upregulated by dopamine via a G-protein cascade that is pertussis toxin sensitive. This increase in potassium ‘leak’ significantly reduces the excitability of sleep-promoting dFB neurons and therefore tips the balance of the cycle towards wakefulness. Phenotypically, our results suggest that <italic>sandman</italic> plays a critical role in maintaining a contraction-relaxation oscillator during aging. Loss of <italic>sandman</italic> does not grossly perturb cardiac rhythmicity in young animals but the balance between contraction and relaxation degenerates catastrophically with age, leaving the heart in a persistently contracted state.</p><p>While the molecular mechanism by which pertussis-toxin sensitive G-protein signaling upregulates Sandman currents is not yet understood, a variety of downstream signaling events are known to affect the activity and localization of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inanobe and Kurachi, 2014</xref>). Similar pathways play a significant and complex role in the neurohormonal regulation of the mammalian heart, for instance by the counterbalanced G-protein coupled pathways activated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008</xref>). Aging human hearts exhibit diminished responsiveness to these modulatory pathways, suggesting senescent defects in signal transduction or a system driven to the limits of its dynamic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaye and Esler, 2008</xref>). Similarly, work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has demonstrated that the heart is sensitive to neural input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dulcis and Levine, 2005</xref>). It will be interesting to determine whether extrinsic or intrinsic regulatory signals tune Sandman activity during aging and thus optimize the heart’s contraction-relaxation balance in a fashion analogous to that observed in the sleep center of the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Diastolic decline with preserved contractility may represent a conserved feature of aging cardiomyocytes</title><p>Young hearts possess abundant repolarizing reserve and can often compensate for losses in individual conductances without impeding the heart’s ability to rapidly relax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nattel et al., 2007</xref>). For reasons that are not well understood, this reserve steadily declines with age in humans and animal models, leaving the heart susceptible to late-onset dysrhythmias. The cardiac phenotype observed upon loss of <italic>sandman</italic> is strikingly age-dependent, transitioning from grossly normal heartbeat in young animals to complete fibrillatory arrest later in life. Our in vivo pharmacological results implicate defects in action potential repolarization, consistent with the rectification behavior of the Sandman/Galene heteromeric channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These observations suggest that a progressive loss of repolarization reserve may represent a conserved feature of cardiac aging. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this age-dependent loss are not known.</p><p>In humans, an increasing number of heart failure cases display significant defects in relaxation while largely preserving contractile performance, termed 'Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction' (HFpEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borlaug, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma and Kass, 2014</xref>). Owing to the closed nature of the vertebrate cardiovascular system, the pathophysiology of such diastolic decline reflects a diverse and complicated assemblage of causal mechanisms including cardiomyocyte dysfunction, structural remodeling and increased vascular resistance. Despite dramatic differences in the architecture of their cardiovascular systems, aging <italic>Drosophila</italic> similarly exhibit preferential diastolic decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although many pathways likely contribute to the pathophysiology of HFpEF, our results suggest that cardiomyocytes across phylogeny may possess a conserved active mechanism driving this differential outcome.</p><p>Previous work has uncovered several potential mechanisms that may differentially regulate systolic and diastolic tone. Mechanically, a growing body of literature has implicated isoform switching and postranslational modifications of the giant macromolecular spring Titin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Linke and Hamdani, 2014</xref>). Patients experiencing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction exhibit Titin hypophosphorylation, which increases the resting tension of cardiomyocytes and impairs diastolic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamdani et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, increasing Titin compliance experimentally has a beneficial effect on diastolic performance but compromises elements of systolic function, notably the Frank-Starling reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Methawasin et al., 2014</xref>). Electrophysiologically, there is considerable evidence that action potential duration is differentially remodeled in aging hearts, heart failure and atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beuckelmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heijman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janczewski et al., 2002</xref>), which may ameliorate the initial dysfunction but predisposes the heart to later dysrhythmia. In animal models and patients exhibiting chronic heart failure, several potassium channel subunits appear downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beuckelmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nattel et al., 2007</xref>), prolonging the action potential in an apparent attempt to augment contractile function. Such decline has also been observed in aging <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where KCNQ transcripts appear downregulated and animals lacking KCNQ display progressive dysrhythmia in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ocorr et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Together, these observations suggest that contractile function may be adaptively regulated by mechanisms that are conserved across phylogeny and that age-related diastolic decline and increased susceptibility to dysrhythmia may represent unintended side effects of this compensation. Our results also implicate a heteromeric potassium channel as a critical effector for maintaining normal rhythmicity during aging, suggesting that age-dependent cardiomyocyte membrane properties may play a key role in maintaining cardiac function into old age. Several important questions remain unaddressed. How does the heart or the brain sense, integrate and respond to alterations in contractile efficacy? Do these mechanisms exacerbate declines in diastolic function during normal aging and to what extent do these homeostatic mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of heart disease? The acute dispensability of the fly heart pumping, the extensive genetic tools available in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and the intravital imaging system we developed provide an exciting opportunity for exploring this dynamic nexus between cardiac physiology, aging and disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>DNA plasmids used for fly transgenesis and heterologous cell transfection were assembled using standard molecular biological techniques and sequenced to confirm accuracy and identity.

Excitation light was provided by a DMD projector (DS + 6K-M, Christie Digital Systems, Cypress, CA) with the green light excitation intensity (538–568 nm, 4.3 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) and spatial extent controlled by PsychoPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peirce, 2007</xref>), using a standard 8 bit RGB tiff file as the signal. The projector was coupled to the microscope using a relay formed by two 150 mm focal length achromatic doublet lenses (Thorlabs Inc., Newton, NJ), placed into a tube assembly and attached to a second camera port above the vertical illuminator (Olympus U-DP and U-DP1XC), with the filter cube installed in the U-DP. We utilized a 20x/1.0 NA water-immersion objective (Olympus) and a sCMOS camera (PCO-Tech Inc., Romulus, MI), triggered using the vertical-sync of the projector signal as frequency doubled by a Master-8 stimulator (AMPI Jerusalem, Israel). Each fly was briefly anesthetized using ice, coupled to a No. one coverslip using Norland Optical adhesive #61 cured using a 365 nm 3 watt UV LED (LED Engin Knc., San Jose, CA) for 10 s and allowed to recover for 10 min before imaging. The coverslip was mounted to the microscope using an assembly containing a small goniometer (Thorlabs GN-05) which allowed the pitch of each fly to be optimized. The optical path is as follows: water immersion objective, coverslip, optical cement, and intact fly. Images were acquired in global shutter mode using a 255 MHz clock with a 6 ms exposure at 120 frames per second. Each animal was recorded for 90 s, with 10,800 frames written directly to an array of 15 spindle disks using a RAID controller with write back cache enabled (LSI SAS9280, Avago Technologies, San Jose, CA). Acquisitions were Gaussian downsampled to 1 µm per pixel and converted to 8 bit using an ImageJ script prior to analysis. All heart wall videos in the manuscript utilized the same transgenic heart marker, <italic>R94C02::tdTomato</italic>[<italic>attP40</italic>], as heterozygotes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Heartbeat digitization</title><p>Using a manually-assisted ImageJ script, YT orthogonal kymographs of the heart wall just anterior to the ostial valve of the second heart chamber were generated. At this time, we also manually traced the systolic lumenal area of the second heart chamber, as specified by an average projection of the entire 10,800 frame stack. This assisted script calculated the area of the second chamber in systole and its length, which were appended to the image as metadata for later use. A second ImageJ script detected the right and left heart wall positions in the kymograph independently using a maximal contrast algorithm, refined by a four pixel maximum intensity search medial to that call. These calls were subsequently low pass filtered using an 8-pole 12 Hz Bessel filter (filter poles calculated using online software at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/mkfilter/trad.html">http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/mkfilter/trad.html</ext-link>). Rapid transient displacements resulting from errors in the heart wall detection algorithm were recursively smoothened using preceding and subsequent heart wall position calls. Analysis for the knockdown of <italic>galene</italic> was performed single-blind, but all other experiments were not blinded to genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Heartbeat segmentation</title><p>We automatically segmented each heartbeat into discrete contraction and relaxation events and analyzed these events in detail using VisualBasic scripts written for Diadem 2011 (National Instruments, Austin, TX). The following represents a summary of the material algorithms used to generate the functional parameters presented herein. First, we detected all contraction and relaxation events that fulfilled minimum velocity (75 µm/s), duration (24 ms) and displacement (2.5 µm) criteria. We then eliminated all prospective events where the two heart walls were not moving in unison, which resolved the residual fraction of false heart wall position calls. We next eliminated excess contraction and relaxation calls using nested timing and amplitude criteria so that the principal contractions and relaxations are interleaved 1:1. The initiation and end of contractions were then calculated by walking back to the last zero velocity time point before each contraction and relaxation. The software then acquired the heart diameters when contraction initiated and ended, which represent the end diastolic diameter (EDD) and end systolic diameter (ESD), respectively. These heartbeats were subsequently refined by consolidating compound contractions or relaxations not separated by a minimum duration (24 ms), below the minimum fractional shortening (0.04) or not exhibiting sufficient coherence between the two heart walls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Heartbeat analysis</title><p>A variety of functional parameters were calculated from the segmented heartbeat waveforms and are italicized and underlined for ease of reference. The <italic>end diastolic diameter (EDD)</italic> and <italic>end systolic diameter (ESD)</italic> were calculated as described in the previous section. We also quantified <italic>heart chamber diameter</italic> across the cardiac cycle, denoted by ∀. The <italic>systolic interval</italic> is the duration of contraction. The <italic>diastolic interval</italic> is the time elapsed between the end of contraction and the initiation of the next contraction. We observe only the occasional pause at the end diastolic diameter in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The <italic>fractional shortening</italic> is the percentage change in diameter for each contraction where FS = (EDD - ESD)/EDD. The <italic>stroke volume</italic> of each heartbeat was estimated by modeling the heart as a radially contracting cylinder, using the average systolic diameter and fixed chamber length, in microns, generated for each animal during digitization as fixed variables. The average chamber systolic diameter was divided by the mean ESD to scale the measured ESDs onto the heart model. The estimated chamber systolic diameter for each heartbeat is therefore the ESD times this scaling factor. The estimated chamber diastolic diameter is then calculated by dividing the estimated chamber systolic diameter by the fractional shortening. The stroke volume in picoliters is therefore:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1000</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1000</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p><italic>Cardiac output per second</italic> was calculated by integrating all stroke volumes that occurred in each second.

The <italic>median heartbeat</italic> was derived by extracting the median diameter at each time point for time-aligned heartbeats until the median duration was reached. Quartiles were calculated similarly. Longer duration and more weakly relaxing heartbeats attenuate the apparent EDD at the end of the median heartbeat which is why a diameter mismatch between the initiation and end of the median heartbeat develops in animals exhibiting diastolic dysfunction. The <italic>heart wall velocity</italic> for each dataset was calculated using the derivative of the median heartbeat for that dataset. The <italic>time to peak velocity</italic> of contraction, and from peak contraction to peak relaxation, was calculated for each animal using their median heart wall velocities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Heartbeat visualization</title><p>We generated all graphs using DataGraph 4β (Visual Data Tools) using the data output from Diadem 2011. Two-dimensional probability maps of chamber diameter and event duration were calculated in Diadem 2011 by aligning all contractions and heartbeats to the initiation of contraction and then displaying the normalized probability in DataGraph 4β. Probability maps of fractional shortening and systolic interval were similarly normalized to the maximum observed probability. Because <italic>sandman</italic> mutants displayed considerable phenotypic variability from animal to animal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), we did not find all datasets to exhibit normal distribution. Therefore, nearly all data is shown using Tukey boxplots so that the distributions can be accurately compared. The exception to this was when stroke volumes were juxtaposed with cardiac output per second; we presented stroke volumes as mean +/− s.d. for ease of visualization. Lastly, representative images of the heart, kymographs, and videos were overlaid with the heartbeat digitizations using ImageJ scripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To more accurately reflect sample size and variability, we considered individual heartbeats as interdependent and performed all statistics using the mean values for each animal.

Pilot experiments established that the principal phenotypes and their rescue were sufficiently robust to be statistically tested using moderate sample sizes. Because not all datasets exhibited normal distributions, we utilized a non-parametric statistical test, Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s Multiple Comparison Test. ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test reported similar results without material deviations in significance. For the sensitivity tests to excitation light intensity and mounting duration presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, we utilized paired one-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Chao Zhou (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Klassen et al., describe the development of a novel method to analyze dynamic heart contraction in live adult fly based on high resolution fluorescent imaging. Using this method, they show that, like in humans, the aging <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart manifests primarily defects in relaxation (diastole) rather than in heart contraction (systole). Using their novel method the authors discovered that a pair of two-pore potassium channel (K2P) subunits, largely dispensable in younger flies, are necessary for terminating contraction (systole) in aged animals, where their loss culminates in fibrillatory cardiac arrest. This study paves the road for using the fly heart as a model for understanding the signaling networks maintaining cardiac performance during normal aging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authors need to show that <italic>sandman</italic> and <italic>galene</italic> are expressed in the adult fly heart.</p><p>2) Does overexpression of <italic>sandman</italic> &quot;rescue&quot; the aging phenotype?</p><p>3) Need a negative control for <italic>galene</italic> – <italic>sandman</italic> interaction in cell culture. Since other K2P channels were screened and had no effects on heart function they should be tested.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – Because it has been shown in previous studies of the fly heart that there are differences in the rates and rhythmicity of anterograde and retrograde hearts beats in intact flies one would expect that heartbeat parameters would also vary. Was the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref> based on all the heartbeats in a record or subsets of the data binned into anterograde or retrograde? This is not clear nor are the differences in the two types of contractions discussed with respect to the data.</p><p>Subsection “Imaging cardiac performance in intact, unanesthetized <italic>Drosophila</italic>”, last paragraph – The authors state that irradiation has no effect on heart function at low levels, however, they cannot actually show what the heart is doing without UV irradiation. In our experience UV irradiation increases heart rate and arrhythmicity. How would they address this?</p><p>Subsection “Imaging cardiac performance in intact, unanesthetized <italic>Drosophila</italic>”, last paragraph – Since it has been reported that 80% of female flies are dead after 18 hours of desiccation, it is not clear how the preparation can still be viable after 19 hours glued to a slide.</p><p>Subsection “Normal aging manifests as diastolic dysfunction while preserving contractile performance”, second paragraph – The authors group data from the two 'wild-type' genetic backgrounds, <italic>w1118</italic> and <italic>Canton S</italic>, for analysis. This is troublesome as these two genotypes have very different genetic backgrounds – known to influence heart function. The average fly size and heart size in these two genotypes are different. Having similar rates does not seem sufficient rational for grouping data from these two lines. Especially since they are also using this data to generate other parameters that are <italic>not</italic> based solely on rate (e.g. Cardiac output).</p><p>Subsection “A pair of K2P subunits, <italic>sandman</italic> and <italic>galene</italic>, are required for terminating systole in aged animals” – Why were two different cardiac drivers used for the <italic>sandman</italic> and <italic>galene</italic> KD? What happens when the two drivers are reversed, does tinCd4&gt;Sandman RNAi have the same effect as for R94C02&gt;Sandman KD? And vice versa for Galene RNAi?</p><p>Subsection “Sandman is required to maintain diverse biological oscillators”, first paragraph – &quot;oscillatory balance degenerates catastrophically with age&quot; What does this mean in terms of cardiomyocyte function how does it relate to the persistent contractions in <italic>sandman</italic> KD?</p><p>Introduction, third paragraph – The authors misrepresent their system as a high throughput system. If it is high throughput why did they have to pool wt genotypes and analyze only 24 flies per age group for the aging study? In fact, as for all other fly heart model systems including OCT, their system requires manual mounting and orientation of flies and manual tracing of data after the fact to facilitate analysis. These are not characteristics of a high throughput system.</p><p>4) The work has one major limitation, however. It is inferred that calcium cycling abnormalities underlie the actual relaxation abnormalities detected, but cardiomyocyte calcium cycling is not measured. This seems curious as the proposed role of calcium is central to the overall proposed mechanism introduced in the last paragraph of the subsection “The <italic>sandman</italic> phenotype reflects a loss of repolarization rather than structurally congestive remodeling”. Moreover, others have successfully measured cardiomyocyte calcium cycling in intact <italic>Drosophila</italic> using fluorescent techniques that should be readily adaptable to the current system (for example, the Maack group's work on <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitochondrial-SR calcium microdomains in Circ Res 2012). Direct calcium measurements are not replaceable by inferences drawn after introduction of EGTA, etc., and their absence here substantially limits confidence in the overall mechanistic conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20851.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Authors need to show that sandman and galene are expressed in the adult fly heart.</italic> </p><p>We have microdissected the adult fly heart from the rest of the animal and utilized RT-PCR to confirm that <italic>sandman</italic> and <italic>galene</italic> transcripts are indeed expressed there as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Does overexpression of sandman &quot;rescue&quot; the aging phenotype?</italic> </p><p>We have overexpressed the <italic>sandman</italic> cDNA in the heart of <italic>wild type</italic> and <italic>sandman</italic> mutant animals through 50 days of age, when <italic>wild type</italic> animals show signs of cardiac decline and <italic>sandman</italic> mutants show profound defects in heart function.

Since other K2P channels were screened and had no effects on heart function they should be tested.</italic> </p><p>As a negative control for heteromeric interaction in cell culture, we recorded from CHO cells combinatorially expressing the K2P genes most closely related to <italic>sandman</italic> and <italic>galene</italic>, CG1688 and CG10864, to determine whether these subunits might form functional homomers or, if not, whether they were capable of forming functional heteromeric channels if co-expressed with <italic>sandman</italic> or <italic>galene</italic>. We found that, of all possible combinations of these genes, only <italic>sandman-galene</italic> co-transfection produced measurable currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – Because it has been shown in previous studies of the fly heart that there are differences in the rates and rhythmicity of anterograde and retrograde hearts beats in intact flies one would expect that heartbeat parameters would also vary. Was the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref> based on all the heartbeats in a record or subsets of the data binned into anterograde or retrograde? This is not clear nor are the differences in the two types of contractions discussed with respect to the data.</italic> </p><p>All data combine anterograde and retrograde heartbeats. We do observe qualitative differences in the contraction-relaxation waveform of anterograde versus retrograde heartbeats (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which may reflect differences in pressure waves arising from bolus flow and/or differences in the electrical waveform emanating from the two distinct pacemakers. Although we do plan to extend our computer code to automatically discriminate anterograde and retrograde heartbeats in the future, we do not believe that subdividing our dataset is necessary to support the principal conclusions of our present manuscript. Sustained contractions appear for both directions in <italic>sandman</italic> mutants that are not yet terminally contracted (e.g. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Furthermore, contraction-relaxation waves become discontinuous and chaotic in <italic>sandman</italic> mutants or <italic>galene</italic> knockdown, which makes any segmentation of anterograde and retrograde heartbeats less trivial than two-point discrimination. Because of these observations, we feel that attempting to subdivide the data into two separate bins would not increase our mechanistic insight and risks diminishing the readability of the manuscript and particularly the figures.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Imaging cardiac performance in intact, unanesthetized Drosophila”, last paragraph – The authors state that irradiation has no effect on heart function at low levels, however, they cannot actually show what the heart is doing without UV irradiation. In our experience UV irradiation increases heart rate and arrhythmicity. How would they address this?</italic> </p><p>At the light intensities utilized throughout the paper, we did not observe any meaningful arrhythmicity in wild-type animals. It is possible that spatially restricting illumination to a small region of interest and not using UV excitation has avoided the potential arrhythmic effects previously observed by the reviewer.</p><p>We do not use UV irradiation during imaging. We only utilize a brief 10s pulse of 405nm LED light to polymerize the optical glue during cold anesthesia. After 15 minutes of recovery, imaging is performed with green light excitation (538-568nm, 4.3 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) limited to a small (150x500um) region of interest, which is less than 20% of the total surface of the abdomen. Fly hearts imaged using optical coherence tomography (e.g. Wolf et al., 2006; Alex et al., 2015) or near-IR spectroscopy (Wasserthal, 2007), neither of which utilize UV-activated optical cement, exhibit similar mean heart rates to those reported here (4.5-6.5 Hz vs 5.6 Hz in 10 day animals declining to 3.8 Hz at 110 days).</p><p>We tested the effects of increasing green light excitation on the heart and found a 0.39% increase in heart rate per mW/mm<sup>2</sup> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93) which would suggest that our green light illumination levels increase the heart rate less than 2% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To ensure that we minimized any effects arising from the excitation light, we also tested illumination intensities 60% lower than utilized, equivalent to a small spot of restricted light only 50% stronger than sunlight, or less total irradiation than the fly would experience exposed during midday. We observed no differences between these two intensities, suggesting that we minimized any excitation light related artifacts. Light intensities 20-fold higher than utilized exhibited significant tachycardia but only the occasional early aftercontraction.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Imaging cardiac performance in intact, unanesthetized Drosophila”, last paragraph – Since it has been reported that 80% of female flies are dead after 18 hours of desiccation, it is not clear how the preparation can still be viable after 19 hours glued to a slide.</italic></p><p>We hydrated the immobilized flies overnight using a small drinking capillary and apologize for omitting this detail, now corrected.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Normal aging manifests as diastolic dysfunction while preserving contractile performance”, second paragraph – The authors group data from the two 'wild-type' genetic backgrounds, w1118 and Canton S, for analysis.

The genesis of this difference is unclear but may reflect the fact that our <italic>Canton S</italic> animals are somewhat healthier and are therefore easier to subtly overcrowd during rearing, leading to slightly smaller animals.</p><p>It is possible that polymorphisms not linked to the <italic>white</italic> locus have contributed to the differences observed by others, but their genetic identity or prevalence within stocks across the fly community has not been characterized in the literature.</p><p><italic>Subsection “A pair of K2P subunits, sandman and galene, are required for terminating systole in aged animals” – Why were two different cardiac drivers used for the sandman and galene KD?

And vice versa for Galene RNAi?</italic> </p><p>We utilized tinCd4::Gal4 for all RNAi experiments. It is the strongest heart Gal4 driver and is almost universally used by our peers for heart-specific RNAi (e.g. Neely et al., 2010). We initially used R94C02 for rescue out of genetic convenience given the stocks we had assembled at the time. We have now attempted rescuing the <italic>sandman</italic> phenotype using two additional Gal4s to allay the concerns expressed by the reviewer. tinCd4::Gal4 robustly rescues the <italic>sandman</italic> phenotype while a Gal4 expressed in many muscle subtypes excepting the heart (R37B05::Gal4) does not rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>Subsection “Sandman is required to maintain diverse biological oscillators”, first paragraph – &quot;oscillatory balance degenerates catastrophically with age&quot; What does this mean in terms of cardiomyocyte function how does it relate to the persistent contractions in sandman KD?</italic> </p><p>The term “oscillatory balance” was meant to reflect the balance between contraction and relaxation that progressively trends toward persistent contractions in aged <italic>sandman</italic> mutants. This is most easily observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, where the median heart contraction is not balanced with an equivalent magnitude heart relaxation in aged <italic>sandman</italic> mutants. We have clarified this language in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Introduction, third paragraph – The authors misrepresent their system as a high throughput system. If it is high throughput why did they have to pool wt genotypes and analyze only 24 flies per age group for the aging study? In fact, as for all other fly heart model systems including OCT, their system requires manual mounting and orientation of flies and manual tracing of data after the fact to facilitate analysis. These are not characteristics of a high throughput system.</italic> </p><p>Our apologies. In our defense, we routinely mount and record 15 flies, collecting approximately 7,000 heartbeats per hour, and our heart wall detection and heartbeat segmentation algorithms are fully automated. We believe this is a significant throughput advance over existing methodologies for any heart system. The only manual steps are selecting the longitudinal position for the kymograph and tracing the chamber once to estimate its average systolic volume, which is script assisted and takes less than 30 seconds per fly.</p><p>The wild-type dataset comprises 146 flies in total. We combined the <italic>w1118</italic> and <italic>Canton S</italic> datasets because they were not meaningfully different from one another and were available for inclusion. We did not collect additional flies for this dataset as the principal conclusions were readily quantifiable at this sample size. We strongly believe that our methodology scales particularly well and will permit considerable forward genetic screening in future studies but have moderated references to throughput in line with the reviewer’s comments.</p><p><italic>4) The work has one major limitation, however. It is inferred that calcium cycling abnormalities underlie the actual relaxation abnormalities detected, but cardiomyocyte calcium cycling is not measured. This seems curious as the proposed role of calcium is central to the overall proposed mechanism introduced in the last paragraph of the subsection “The sandman phenotype reflects a loss of repolarization rather than structurally congestive remodeling”. Moreover, others have successfully measured cardiomyocyte calcium cycling in intact Drosophila using fluorescent techniques that should be readily adaptable to the current system (for example, the Maack group's work on Drosophila mitochondrial-SR calcium microdomains in Circ Res 2012). Direct calcium measurements are not replaceable by inferences drawn after introduction of EGTA, etc., and their absence here substantially limits confidence in the overall mechanistic conclusions.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, there are no published methodologies for measuring cardiomyocyte calcium cycling in intact <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We agree that it would be useful to monitor the calcium and voltage waveforms in vivo but the field has yet to surmount technical limitations associated with these experiments. The calcium wave observed by the Maack group and others utilizes the in situ preparation which beats at approximately 1-2Hz and is therefore sufficiently slow for GCaMP calcium imaging. However, this calcium wave is several fold longer in duration than what one would expect to observe in vivo, which may arise from the heart being removed from its normal physiochemical environment and/or slow GCAMP off kinetics distorting the signal. The fly heart beats at approximately 5-6 Hz in vivo, which means that best current generation genetically encoded calcium indicators do not have sufficiently rapid off-decay times (t<sub>1/2</sub> GCaMP6f 350ms, Chen et al., Nature 2013) to adequately resolve individual calcium waves in vivo. Given such dramatic differences in the calcium waveform in situ vs. in vivo, it stands to reason that there exist significant differences in the relative strength and kinetics of the various inward and outward conductances, making comparisons about ion channels problematic.</p><p>We invested considerable time attempting to overcome this technical hurdle, even testing GCAMP6 variants with reduced calcium affinity, but have determined that the temporal resolution of the optical signals is currently inadequate, compounded by the difficulty imaging cytosolic GFP signals intravitally and addressing motion artifacts that cannot be deconvolved without ratiometric approaches. This last point of particular concern as most published papers using this methodology neglect to compensate for motion artifacts arising from the contraction-relaxation cycle, which Lin et al., 2011, who developed this methodology for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart, demonstrated represents 50% of the resultant signal (see their Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Effectively, one can derive an equivalent ‘calcium’ signal using cytosolic GFP. Cetoxymethyl ester conjugated calcium sensitive dyes, while having sufficiently fast off-kinetics and internal ratiometric controls, have been reported by others to load very poorly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g. Lin et al., 2011 and our experience). We tried paralyzing the heart <italic>in situ</italic> using blebbistatin and/or cytochalasin-D but have found that these compounds trigger significant dysrhythmia in wild-type animals, as measured by genetically-encoded voltage indicators.</p><p>While we are sympathetic to the reviewer’s desire to directly visualize calcium, we feel that the experiments detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> should not be discounted as inadequately supporting our model as it relates to the scope of this publication. We are unaware of any mechanistic basis for a calcium independent contraction-relaxation of the sarcomere but have moderated our text accordingly.</p><p>To better understand the terminal phenotype of <italic>sandman</italic> mutants, we directly visualized sarcomere dynamics in vivo, for which the biophysical linkage between calcium and contraction is well established. This was a significant technical accomplishment and provides excellent spatiotemporal resolution of individual sarcomeric behavior (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). During the sustained contractions observed in <italic>sandman</italic> mutants, sarcomeres actively contract and relax out of phase with one another, suggesting that sufficient ATP was available locally to drive myosin activity, myosin dissociation and the various pumps that can sequester calcium. Interestingly, this fibrillatory behavior periodically and rapidly resolves itself in a synchronous manner globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>), an effect that is most plausibly explained by a global repolarization closing sarcolemmal Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, which inactivate much more slowly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> relative to vertebrates (t<sub>1/2</sub> 1-2s, Haraet al., J Neurogenetics 2015) and could therefore generate a prolonged window current sustaining calcium influx in the absence of sufficient repolarization back to the resting potential.</p><p>Further support of our model comes from our pharmacological experiments, which importantly are acute (seconds). First, chelating extracellular calcium using membrane impermeable EGTA demonstrates that calcium influx across the sarcolemmal membrane is necessary for sustaining contractions in <italic>sandman</italic> mutant animals. Second, creating an artificial but highly selective K<sup>+</sup> leak across the sarcolemmal membrane using valinomycin also terminated the persistent contractions. Accordingly, these experiments exclude a calcium and/or potassium independent means of sustaining the persistent contractions in sandman mutants. Because potassium channels play well-established roles in cardiac repolarization back to the resting potential and L-type voltage gated Ca channels are essential for heart contractions in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we feel that a mechanistic link between the loss of a potassium channel and the persistent contractions observed is not unduly speculative.</p><p>What we do not yet understand is why the phenotype is progressively age-dependent and what mechanisms cause the fibrillatory cycling of individual sarcomeres during the sustained contractions. Having high-resolution voltage indicators as well as calcium measures for the cytosol and SR would allow us to address these questions, which we hope to develop in a future manuscript. In conclusion, we feel that our intravital imaging methodology and our characterization of this novel potassium channel are worthy of publication and look forward to extending this work in future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
