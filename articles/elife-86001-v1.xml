Sex differences in immune cell activation drive obesity-mediated pathologies where males are more susceptible to obesity comorbidities and exacerbated inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that the macrophage-secreted protein RELMα critically protects females against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Compared to male mice, serum RELMα levels were higher in both control and HFD-fed females and correlated with frequency of adipose macrophages and eosinophils. RELMα-deficient females gained more weight and had proinflammatory macrophage accumulation and eosinophil loss in the adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF), while RELMα treatment or eosinophil transfer rescued this phenotype. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the adipose SVF was performed and identified sex and RELMα-dependent changes. Genes involved in oxygen sensing and iron homeostasis, including hemoglobin and lncRNA Gm47283/Gm21887, correlated with increased obesity, while eosinophil chemotaxis and response to amyloid-beta were protective. Monocyte-to-macrophage transition was also dysregulated in RELMα-deficient animals. Collectively, these studies implicate a RELMα–macrophage–eosinophil axis in sex-specific protection against obesity and uncover new therapeutic targets for obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>eosinophil</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>adipose</kwd><kwd>RELMα</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI153195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nair</surname><given-names>Meera G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD091167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coss</surname><given-names>Djurdjica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD026929</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nair</surname><given-names>Meera G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The small macrophage-secreted protein RELMα is a sex-specific protein that protects against diet-induced obesity through regulating the macrophage–eosinophil innate immune axis in the adipose tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is an epidemic of significant public concern and contributes to the increased risk of several diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and COVID-19. Currently in the US, over 30% of men and women are classified as obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30  kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">The Lancet Public Health, 2018</xref>). There are profound sex differences in adipose tissue deposition and obesity-associated diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Link and Reue, 2017</xref>). Obese men are more at risk for metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and myocardial infarction than obese women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerdts and Regitz-Zagrosek, 2019</xref>). Male mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) gain more weight and have an increased risk of insulin resistance than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parks et al., 2015</xref>). Despite these sex differences, most studies have historically focused on obesity mechanisms in males, since males gain weight more rapidly than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camporez et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, there remain many gaps in knowledge about the underlying mechanisms for obesity and whether these are sex dependent, which can impact the development of therapeutics that are equally effective for both males and females. To address this gap, the focus of recent studies has been identifying mechanisms that provide protection in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lainez et al., 2018</xref>). Males and females accumulate fat into different adipose tissue depots; males deposit more fat into visceral adipose depots, while females deposit fat preferentially into subcutaneous depots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lainez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palmer and Clegg, 2015</xref>). Since visceral adiposity is associated with the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wajchenberg, 2000</xref>), differential fat accumulation may explain male propensity for obesity-mediated pathologies.</p><p>An underlying immune component for obesity pathogenesis is well recognized, with obesity being regarded as a chronic inflammatory process. Macrophages are critical immune effectors in obesity. Increases in adipose tissue size correlate with macrophage infiltration into the fat depots and proinflammatory cytokine production in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weisberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olefsky and Glass, 2010</xref>). Obese adipose tissues produce increased levels of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruen et al., 2007</xref>), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, or CCL2 chemokine) that binds CCR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kanda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaplan et al., 2015</xref>), which may serve as chemoattractant to recruit monocytes. In turn, they can be activated or differentiate into macrophages, initiating the secretion of cytokines and chemokines to exacerbate inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lackey and Olefsky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McNelis and Olefsky, 2014</xref>). Given the role of macrophages in obesity, sex differences in macrophages are of particular interest and have been demonstrated before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gal-Oz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varghese et al., 2022</xref>). Visceral fat contains more infiltrating macrophages and higher expression of inflammatory cytokines than subcutaneous fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weisberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Strissel et al., 2007</xref>), and male visceral adipose tissues accumulate more macrophages than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>). The presence of sex-steroid hormones, specifically estrogen, was postulated to contribute to sex differences in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camporez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palmer and Clegg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keselman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grove et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stubbins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heine et al., 2000</xref>). Alternatively, we and others have demonstrated intrinsic sex-specific differences in macrophages, independent of sex-steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shenoda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singer et al., 2015</xref>). Male macrophages are more migratory and inflammatory, while protection in females is associated with higher production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lainez et al., 2018</xref>). Macrophage function and activation in the adipose tissue are guided by their ontogeny, the cytokine environment, as well as myriad factors such as hypoxia, metabolites, and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakarov et al., 2022</xref>). CD11c<sup>+</sup> M1-like macrophages are activated through innate TLR2/4 receptors and produce proinflammatory mediators (e.g. TNFα, IL-6, and CCL2) that drive metabolic changes. Adipose tissue macrophages or metabolically activated macrophages can be distinguished from other proinflammatory macrophages by several different cell surface markers, although they produce proinflammatory cytokines as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, a T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine environment within the adipose tissue promotes metabolic homeostasis and protective CD206<sup>+</sup> M2 macrophages that suppress inflammation. Immune drivers of the Th2 cytokine environment for M2 macrophage activation include IL-4-producing eosinophils and innate lymphoid cell (ILC)-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brestoff et al., 2015</xref>). It is now recognized that macrophage activation is far more complex than the M1/M2 paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakarov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>). However, the M1/M2 macrophage paradigm is a useful framework to begin to address pathways that can be targeted for obesity pathogenesis, and whether these are influenced by sex.</p><p>The focus of this study was to identify sex-specific immune effectors that regulate obesity pathogenesis, focusing on the M2 macrophage signature gene Resistin-like molecule α (RELMα). RELMα is a small, secreted cysteine-rich protein that is expressed by macrophages primarily in response to Th2 cytokines, but can also be induced by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lv and Liu, 2021</xref>). RELMα has pleiotropic functions ranging from inflammatory or immunoregulatory to microbicidal roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krljanac et al., 2019</xref>). Within the myeloid population, RELMα is preferentially expressed in monocyte-derived macrophages, and is important for monocyte differentiation, infiltration into other tissues and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sanin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2022</xref>). In the adipose tissue, RELMα is a defining marker for perivascular macrophages and is co-expressed with CD206 and Lyve1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakarov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>). A beneficial function for RELMα in metabolic disorders has been proposed; CD301b<sup>+</sup> phagocytes promoted glucose metabolism and net energy balance through secretion of RELMα, and RELMα overexpression promoted cholesterol homeostasis in hyperlipidemic low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these previous findings, the goal of this study was to investigate how sex and RELMα regulate diet-induced obesity and inflammation by employing RELMα-deficient mice and utilizing flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing of visceral adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF) to identify sex-specific and RELMα-dependent targets of obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RELMα protects female mice from HFD-induced obesity and inflammation</title><p>Studies investigating sex differences show that female mice are protected, or have delayed, diet-induced obesity, unless aged or challenged by ovariectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lainez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salinero et al., 2018</xref>). In support of the critical role of macrophage polarization in sex-specific differences, previous studies demonstrated that protection in females is associated with Th2 cytokine-induced M2 polarization, for example CD206 expression, while males exhibit increased CD11c-positive ‘proinflammatory’ M1-like macrophages in the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>). The secreted protein RELMα is a signature protein expressed by M2 macrophages, with regulatory functions in downregulating inflammation and promoting tissue healing. A role for RELMα in promoting metabolic homeostasis has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that female-specific protection from HFD may be influenced by RELMα. To examine systemic and local factors that may provide protection to females, serum and visceral adipose tissue homogenate were obtained from male or female mice on a control-fed (Ctr) or HFD-fed for over 12 weeks. Under both Ctr and HFD conditions, female mice had significantly higher RELMα in the serum than males, and in adipose tissue under Ctr diet. Exposure to HFD diminished adipose RELMα levels in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RELMα protects females from diet-induced obesity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RELMα levels in serum and visceral adipose tissue from 18-week-old male (♂) and female (♀) C57BL/6 mice after exposure to control (Ctr) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks.

RELMα deficiency did not affect Ctr or HFD weight gain in males, however, RELMα deficiency in females led to significantly increased weight gain on HFD compared to WT on HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Whole-body weight, and visceral and subcutaneous adipose weights were similarly increased in WT and KO males on HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). However, RELMα deficiency only affected HFD-fed females, with significantly increased body weight, and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue mass compared to HFD WT females. Chemokines that change with exposure to HFD were assessed in the adipose tissue of these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The monocyte chemoattractant CCL2 was significantly elevated in WT and KO HFD males, while it remained low in females regardless of diet, as demonstrated before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>). On the other hand, females had higher levels of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 than males, as demonstrated before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lainez et al., 2018</xref>), as well as the regulatory T cell growth factor GM-CSF, and the Th2 cytokine IL-5. The higher level of IL-10 and GM-CSF in females was dependent on RELMα and was further decreased with exposure to HFD, while IL-5 was not detected with HFD. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β were also measured, but no RELMα-dependent differences with HFD exposure were observed. A larger animal cohort size may have provided more powered analysis and identified more adipose protein differences between groups especially with CCL2, which demonstrated the greatest variability. Nonetheless, the adipose protein profile indicates sex- and RELMα-dependent effects of diet-induced obesity, which correlates with increased proinflammatory CCL2, and decreased anti-inflammatory and Th2 cytokines, IL-10, GM-CSF, and IL-5, respectively.</p><p>Adipose tissue inflammation was next examined by flow cytometry of the SVF from the visceral adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). RELMα deficiency and HFD resulted in significantly higher leukocyte frequency in the male SVF, demonstrating a role of RELMα in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). WT females did not exhibit increased leukocyte frequency in adipose tissues with HFD, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>). Compared to HFD-fed WT females, RELMαKO females fed HFD had significantly more SVF leukocytes, specifically macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In contrast, the proportion of eosinophils was lower in HFD-fed males compared to females with the same diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), suggesting a reduction in the protective type 2 immune response. This was consistent with the reduction in IL-5 in the adipose tissue following HFD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The contribution of diet, sex, and genotype to body weight and adipose tissue inflammation was assessed by three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; <italic>n</italic> = 4–5 per group) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Diet, followed by sex, then genotype, were all significant factors accounting for the variance in body weight, at both 6 and 12 weeks post diet. While diet was the greatest factor in adipose tissue inflammation, evaluated as SVF leukocyte frequency, RELMα deficiency was a greater factor accounting for variance than sex. For SVF macrophage frequency, diet then sex were the significant factors accounting for variance, while for eosinophil frequencies, sex differences were the main driving factor. Together, these data show that female-specific protection from diet-induced obesity is associated with elevated RELMα expression, and that RELMα deficiency selectively affects females, leading to increased weight gain, adipose tissue mass, and adipose tissue inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RELMα deficiency results in dysregulated macrophage activation and impaired eosinophil homeostasis in the adipose tissue</title><p>We performed flow cytometry followed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding">t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding</ext-link> (tSNE) analysis to evaluate immune cell heterogeneity and surface marker expression in the visceral adipose SVF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). tSNE analysis was performed based on gating strategies detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>. Within the groups, eosinophils demonstrated the greatest changes; Ctr-fed male and female mice had high eosinophil numbers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and this eosinophil population disappeared in male mice upon HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, red outline). WT female mice retained their eosinophil subset even with HFD. In contrast, RELMα KO females had decreased eosinophil population following HFD. Within the eosinophil subset, heterogeneity is observed in females, with Ctr mice exhibiting a different cell distribution compared to the HFD mice. The macrophage population also exhibited changes; Ctr-fed female mice, had a smaller macrophage subset compared to males, regardless of genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, green outline). In both sexes, HFD led to an increase in this macrophage subset, and in their heterogeneity, especially in RELMα KO mice. Within the CD64<sup>+</sup>MerTK<sup>+</sup> macrophage subset, expression of CD11c, a marker for proinflammatory M1-like macrophages, was evaluated. There was an increase in both number of CD11c+ macrophages and surface expression of CD11c on a per macrophage cell basis, in response to HFD in both males and females, however males had higher levels of CD11c than females under both diet conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). RELMα deficiency exacerbated the increase in CD11c, particularly in the HFD-fed females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This may indicate that the increase in CD11c arises due to the abrogation of RELMα levels in the visceral fat after HFD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). On the other hand, anti-inflammatory ‘M2’ macrophage marker, CD206, decreased with HFD, but was not dependent on the presence of RELMα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). CD301b, another M2 marker that is upregulated by IL-4, also decreased with HFD in both males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Specifically in HFD females, CD301b was further decreased with a loss of RELMα. Although the number of eosinophils decreased in HFD-fed males of both genotypes, eosinophils in all groups maintained high expression of SiglecF, which was further increased with HFD specifically in RELMα KO females but not WT females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). SiglecF is a paralogue of human Siglec-8, and in mice is expressed on eosinophils and alveolar macrophages. The function of SiglecF appears to be context dependent, with reported evidence of stimulatory and inhibitory roles on eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Willebrand and Voehringer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Westermann et al., 2022</xref>). One study showed that SiglecF stimulation induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that the higher expression of SiglecF on the RELMα-deficient eosinophils from HFD KO female mice may contribute to their susceptibility to apoptosis, explaining their reduced frequency. We evaluated if eosinophil surface marker expression changed based on sex, diet, and genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). CXCR4 and MHCII expression was reduced following HFD in both WT and KO females but not males, which may account for the subset heterogeneity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In contrast, SVF eosinophil frequencies were negatively correlated with body weight. RELMα expression has been reported by many immune cell subsets, including macrophages, eosinophils, and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), although expression in the adipose tissue is less clear. Given that RELMα protein was present in the visceral adipose tissue, especially of females (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), flow cytometry analysis of intracellular RELMα in the SVF cells was performed in Ctr or HFD-fed female mice. SVF macrophages expressed RELMα, especially in the CD11c-negative subset, which was reduced with HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).

Of note, these RELMα-driven differences were unique to females since they were not identified in the comparison between WT vs. KO males.

They were significantly more abundant in WT females compared to the other groups (p &lt; 0.01, S2C). We investigated if any subcluster in the fibroblast cell population expressed pre-adipocyte marker genes (Ppara, Pparg, Foxo1, Sirt1, Cebpa, and Cebpb) but no cluster-specific expression of these genes was observed (data not shown). Compared to WT males, SVF fibroblasts from WT females exhibited over-represented pathways involved in inhibition of cell proliferation and M2 macrophage responses (e.g. IL-4R, insulin growth-like factor, IGF-R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C–L</xref>). On the other hand, WT male fibroblasts upregulated genes involved in vasculogenesis and extracellular matrix deposition, such as collagen genes and <italic>Ccn2</italic>, which contributes to chondrocyte differentiation. Similar trends were observed between WT and KO females, indicating again that RELMα deficiency results in females that are more similar to males by adipose tissue gene expression. KO females had increased levels of fatty acid-binding proteins, <italic>Fabp4</italic> and connective tissue development, <italic>Ccn3</italic> and <italic>Mmp3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G–I</xref>). In males, WT males SVF fibroblasts increased expression of prostaglandin transporter, <italic>Slco2a1</italic> and stromal chemokine <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, while KO males upregulated pathways involved in the inhibition of the antioxidative functions, resulting in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, such as <italic>Txnip</italic>. ILC2 are drivers of Th2 cytokine responses and are protective in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brestoff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ikutani and Nakae, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). ILC2 were present at small frequencies in the SVF in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2M–P</xref>). Gene expression analysis revealed that ILC2 from WT female mice expressed significantly higher Th2 cytokines (<italic>Il13</italic>, <italic>Il5</italic>) and <italic>Csf2</italic>, encoding for GM-CSF, which fits the increased adipose protein levels of IL-5 and GM-CSF in females (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Functional pathway analysis revealed that fatty acid metabolism genes were over-represented in WT females compared to males. When comparing WT and RELMα KO female mice, there was a reduction in <italic>Csf2</italic> in the KO females compared to WT females. These data indicate that ILC2 in females are functionally distinct from males, and may contribute to the protective Th2 cytokine environment and metabolic homeostasis in the adipose tissue.</p><p>Myeloid cells/macrophages were the main immune cell subset that changed in the SVF in response to sex and RELMα deficiency; macrophage proportions were lowest in WT females, but expanded in the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, orange). GO analysis revealed that the IGF pathway, chemokine and cytokine activity pathways were over-represented in WT female myeloid cells, while innate immune activation (e.g. TLR-4, RAGE receptor) and extracellular matrix remodeling were higher in WT males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data match macrophage polarization signatures where protective M2 macrophages produce and are responsive to IGF, while M1 macrophages respond to danger signals (e.g. LPS, RAGE). RELMα-dependent changes were observed in both females and males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Upregulated pathways in WT myeloid cells all involved innate chemokines and migration. Counterintuitively, downregulated pathways in WT compared to KO myeloid cells in females were associated with adipose tissue browning (e.g. brown fat cell differentiation, cold-induced thermogenesis), which are generally associated with protection from obesity. These data implicate RELMα in promoting innate immune cell migration and inhibiting adaptive thermogenesis. Overall, these scRNA-seq data identify sex-specific and RELMα-dependent changes in the adipose tissue that are associated with obesity-induced inflammation. Drivers of obesity included increased macrophages and innate immune activation. On the other hand, protection from obesity involved more fibroblasts, Th2 cytokine expression by ILC2, and chemokine expression by myeloid cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Monocyte-to-Mac1 macrophage transition and functional pathways are dysregulated in RELMα-deficient mice</title><p>Based on previous studies, macrophage subclusters were defined and enumerated according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref> study , and subset-specific gene expression was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>).

These two subsets in particular, were more abundant in WT males than WT females, and in KO males compared to KO females, but further increased in both sexes with a lack of RELMα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, black contour, monocytes; red contour, Mac1). Determined by scRNA-seq data from WT mice, RELMα (<italic>Retnla</italic>) exhibited higher expression in the Mono and Mac1 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, F</xref>). We evaluated cell-intrinsic effects of RELMα on these subsets. GO analysis revealed strong enrichment for genes involved in leukocyte migration in both the Mono and Mac1 subsets from WT females, specifically eosinophil chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Evaluation of the top DEG indicated similar gene expression by sex rather than genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Focused chemokine analyses identified sex and genotype-specific eosinophil-recruitment chemokines. In particular, the eosinophil-recruiting chemokine <italic>Ccl24</italic> was significantly reduced in Mono and Mac subsets from KO females compared to WT females. We examined the Mac1 subset in females, to identify RELMα-regulated genes within this population that typically expresses RELMα under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G, H</xref>). Hemoglobin genes were the most highly upregulated genes in KO female Mac1 cells compared WT females (5–10 Log2 fold change). The hypoxia-induced lncRNA <italic>Gm47283/Gm21887</italic> was also upregulated in KO female Mac1. The hemoglobin expression was not due to red blood cell (RBC) contamination for several reasons: first, mice were perfused and then RBC lysis was performed on the single-cell suspension; second, filtering was performed to remove doublets (see methods); third, single-cell analysis of the myeloid subsets for an RBC-specific gene (Gypa/CD235a) showed no expression, in contrast to the hemoglobin genes, which were expressed in the KO females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). To further validate that hemoglobin expression in macrophages was not tied to RBC contamination, IF staining for F4/80, hemoglobin, and RBC-specific marker Ter119, was performed on perfused adipose tissue sections from HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Hemoglobin protein was present (magenta), especially in RELMαKO females (white arrows), and co-localized with F4/80 (green). In contrast, there was little Ter119 staining, and minimal co-localization with hemoglobin, even at higher magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Last, analysis of hemoglobin protein concentration in the adipose tissue lysates of WT and KO females was performed by ELISA, and determined significantly upregulated hemoglobin protein in KO females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Together, these data indicate that RELMα deficiency induces hemoglobin genes in adipose tissue macrophages. Previous studies have shown that macrophages can upregulate hemoglobin genes during inflammation and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saha et al., 2014</xref>).

In WT females, monocytes were the point of origin, leading to the generation of Mac1 subsets. Mac2 and Mac3 were related but separate clusters. Dendritic cells and Mac4 were even more distinct from monocytes suggesting that they are resident and not monocyte derived. These trajectories were similar in WT males. However, in KO males and females, the clusters were no longer distinct, and the Mac1 cluster was able to become Mac2/3 clusters, suggesting that loss of RELMα leads to dysregulated differentiation of monocytes to Mac1 or Mac2/3 subsets. We evaluated Mono to Mac1 transition in WT females and observed enriched pathways in IL-4 responsiveness and chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In contrast, Mono to Mac1 transition in RELMα KO females involved proton transport and ATP synthesis pathways, suggesting dysregulated differentiation leading to metabolically active, inflammatory Mac1 subsets. Together, these data implicate a critical function for RELMα in myeloid cell function and differentiation in the adipose tissue. First, we uncover a RELMα cell-intrinsic mechanism whereby RELMα-expressing Mono and Mac1 cells mediate leukocyte recruitment, and Mac1 preferentially recruits eosinophils. Second, RELMα is necessary to drive functional Mac1 differentiation; in the absence of RELMα, Mac1 cells become metabolically active and increase their oxygen-binding capacity by upregulating hemoglobin genes. Given that Mac1 in the normal setting are defined as the protective, vascular-associated, and anti-inflammatory subset, the loss of function of this myeloid population may be the underlying mechanism for increased inflammation in RELMα KO mice.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Trajectory analysis reveals dysfunctional myeloid differentiation in RELMα knockout (KO) females.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UMAP plots of trajectory analysis with monocytes set as the root were made for the myeloid subsets within each group (WT female, WT male, KO female, and KO male fed high-fat diet [HFD] for 6 weeks).

Herein, we uncover an eosinophil–macrophage axis in females that is driven by RELMα and protects from diet-induced obesity and inflammation. A role for RELMα in whole-body metabolism has been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Munitz et al., 2009</xref>), but none of these studies delineated sex-specific differences in chronic obese conditions. Here, by performing side-by-side comparisons between male and female RELMα KO or WT mice we identify sex- and RELMα-specific immune mechanisms of obesity pathogenesis. While C57BL/6J females are protected from obesity compared to males, we show that loss of RELMα abrogates this protection. RELMα deficiency also had significant effects in males, but to a lesser extent than females. For instance, RELMα KO males had increased proportions of leukocytes and CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the SVF to the same degree as exposure to HFD. Compared to WT females, RELMα KO females exhibited more diet-induced inflammatory changes than their male counterparts did. Under control and obese conditions, females had higher levels of RELMα than males, which likely explains why RELMα deficiency affected females more than males.</p><p>Several studies demonstrated the protective role of estrogen in obesity-mediated inflammation and in weight gain, as discussed above. Whether estrogen protection occurs via estrogen regulation of RELMα levels is a focus of our future studies. Alternatively, intrinsic sex differences in immune system have been demonstrated as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singer et al., 2015</xref>) that are dependent on sex chromosome complement and/or <italic>Xist</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Syrett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pyfrom et al., 2021</xref>), and RELMα may be regulated by these as well. Additionally, aging-mediated increase in inflammation (including of adipose tissue, recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>), may also occur via changes in RELMα levels. Our studies used young but developmentally mature mice (4–6 weeks old when placed on diet, 18 weeks old at sacrifice), and future work on aged mice would be needed to investigate aging-mediated inflammation. Furthermore, there are sex differences in fat deposition, metabolic rates and oxidative phosphorylation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mauvais-Jarvis, 2015</xref>), and adipokine expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>) which regulate cytokine and chemokines levels, and therefore may regulate levels of RELMα as well. These possibilities will be addressed in future studies.</p><p>A significant strength of this study was the use of single-cell sequencing to identify adipose tissue SVF heterogeneity and detect new targets and pathways to alleviate obesity. We first examined the top DEGs in protected WT females compared to the other groups and identify <italic>Pim3</italic> as protective. <italic>Pim3</italic> encodes a kinase that is a negative regulator of insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vlacich et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Pim3</italic> is functionally responsive to forskolin, a cAMP activator that is also dietary supplement for weight loss and heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Godard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mukaida et al., 2011</xref>). Our data indicate that forskolin’s effectiveness through Pim3 might be sex dependent. As the most significantly upregulated gene in the protected WT females, our data also point to cAMP activation as a promising target to alleviate diet-induced obesity. GO pathway analyses revealed that WT females upregulate genes in cellular responses to amyloid-beta. Amyloid-beta synthesis is elevated in obesity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tharp et al., 2016</xref>). In adipose tissue, it plays a role in lipolysis and secretion of adipokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wan et al., 2015</xref>). The increased cellular response to amyloid-beta specifically in females may explain female resistance to obesity-mediated changes. On the other hand, obese males had increased expression of <italic>Sult1e1</italic>, a sulfotransferase that leads to the inactivation of many hormones, including estrogen. <italic>Sult1e1</italic> is associated with increased BMI in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ihunnah et al., 2014</xref>). Males also had higher expression of inflammatory genes (e.g. <italic>Lcn2</italic>, lipocalin 2, and C7, complement 7). WT males also upregulated genes in terpenoid and isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, such as <italic>Aldh1a3</italic>, <italic>Fdps</italic>, and <italic>Hmgcs1</italic> that regulate cholesterol synthesis, triacylglycerol absorption and fat deposition. Their association with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome may explain the male propensity to develop these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castellano et al., 2020</xref>). Examination of RELMα-dependent genes within the SVF led to the discovery of lncRNA <italic>Gm47283/Gm21887</italic>, which is the most significantly induced RNA by RELMα deficiency in both males and females. This lncRNA is located in the syntenic region of sex chromosome; <italic>Gm47283</italic> on Y chromosome, while 100% identical <italic>Gm55594</italic> and <italic>Gm21887</italic>, are located on the X chromosome. Very little is known about <italic>Gm47283</italic>, apart from one recent paper indicating it is a biomarker for myocardial infarction that is induced in hypoxia and involved in prostaglandin 2 synthesis and ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao, 2022</xref>). It is also called erythroid differentiation regulator 1 (Erdr1), which may correlate increase in this lncRNA in RELMα KO with hemoglobin gene induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houh et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings indicate that RELMα potently downregulates this lncRNA, and future research is warranted to investigate whether <italic>Gm47283/Gm21887</italic> is a downstream effector of RELMα.</p><p>Both control and HFD-fed females had a higher proportion of eosinophils in adipose tissues than males, and furthermore, males lost their eosinophil subset after exposure to HFD. Correlation analyses implicated that higher RELMα levels in females contributed to the higher proportion of eosinophils in female adipose tissues and female protection. This protection was lost in RELMα KO HFD-fed females, associated with the loss of eosinophils. Eosinophil transfer and RELMα treatment experiments confirmed this mechanistic link whereby RELMα recruits eosinophils with the overall outcome of reduced weight gain, decreased adipose tissue inflammation, and decreased CD11c<sup>+</sup> proinflammatory macrophages. These findings support the potential for RELMα treatment in males to protect from obesity-mediated inflammation by driving eosinophils. A critical function for eosinophils in establishing a Th2 cytokine environment in the adipose tissue has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, through use of eosinophil-deficient mice or transgenic mice that have increased eosinophils, these studies demonstrate that eosinophils produce IL-4 to promote M2 macrophages, which in turn mediate adipose tissue beiging and other protective pathways against obesity. In the context of helminths, studies also identified eosinophils as the underlying mechanism whereby helminth infection protects from obesity. Our studies uncover further complexity to eosinophil function by demonstrating that females have significantly increased adipose eosinophils, and that eosinophilia is critically dependent on RELMα. Since females do not gain weight compared to males, investigation of female-specific pathways in murine models of obesity is an understudied area. However, there is an urgent need to determine what mechanisms are protective in females and whether these change with age or menopause. These would allow the identification of new therapeutic targets and will also distinguish whether treatments may differ in their effectiveness according to sex. Our findings open a new area of investigation into RELM proteins, which are produced in humans, and whether they regulate eosinophils to protect from obesity. Another study investigated whether IL-5-induced eosinophils could protect obese male mice from metabolic impairments but reported no protective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolus et al., 2018</xref>). They concluded that physiological levels of eosinophils are not protective, in contrast to the previous studies that used transgenic mice to delete or artificially expand eosinophils. By additionally examining female mice and performing adoptive eosinophil transfer, our findings support a protective function for eosinophils even at physiologic levels, but also identify eosinophil heterogeneity. tSNE plot flow cytometric analysis of adipose SVF cells indicated that eosinophils were heterogeneous and different in females compared to males. These included changes in surface expression of CXCR4 and MHCII with HFD in females but not in males. In addition, single-cell sequencing analyses of the adipose SVF indicated striking sex- or RELMα-specific changes in multiple eosinophil chemoattractants such as IL-5, produced by ILC2, and myeloid cell-derived eotaxin-2 (CCL24) and CXCL10. Eotaxin-2 was produced by myeloid cells in the SVF female WT mice, but was significantly decreased with the loss of RELMα. Our data implicate female-specific and RELMα-dependent immune mechanisms in the adipose environment, whereby ILC2 and myeloid cells recruit eosinophils that function to downregulate obesity-induced inflammation.</p><p>Myeloid cells are critical for adipose tissue homeostasis, and monocyte recruitment and differentiation to proinflammatory macrophages are associated with obesity. Strikingly, RELMα deletion led to induction of hemoglobin genes in SVF female KO mice compared to WT females and KO male mice. This may have significant health implications. The importance of hemoglobin in erythrocytes is well accepted, but the presence of hemoglobin in non-erythroid cells is less well known with limited studies. Hemoglobin gene induction was first detected in RAW264 and isolated peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). Alternatively, hemoglobin genes can be induced by iron-recycling macrophages, derived from Ly6c<sup>+</sup> monocytes during hemolysis, after erythrophagocytosis. Hemoglobin synthesis in cells other than erythroid lineage occurs in hypoxic conditions to increase oxygen binding and compensate for low oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grek et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the lack of RELMα in females leads to hypoxia in adipose tissues. Alternatively, hemoglobin may be induced in KO females in response to macrophage activation and nitric oxide (NO) production, since hemoglobin can bind NO in addition to oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gell, 2018</xref>), which is produced by activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orecchioni et al., 2019</xref>). Induction of hemoglobin genes may lead to dysregulation in iron handling and anemia, which have been associated with obesity. While obesity-increased incidence of anemia is not conclusive, iron deficiency is correlated with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cepeda-Lopez and Baye, 2020</xref>). Macrophages normally recycle iron, but lack of RELMα in obese females may have disrupted this ability. Increase in hemoglobin gene expression may lead to iron sequestration and would explain iron deficiency that is observed in obesity especially in women. Hemoglobin components include heme and iron, which can be cytotoxic. Overexpression of hemoglobin genes in the RELMα myeloid cells may not only act as a sink to deplete iron, oxygen, and heme with consequences for the SVF environment, but could also constitute cytotoxic stress for the myeloid cells themselves, in a positive feedback cycle spurring further adipose dysfunction. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a hemoglobin pathway in myeloid cells during metabolic dysfunction and may point to new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for adipose tissue inflammation and obesity pathogenesis.</p><p>RELMα function in peritoneal macrophages was previously demonstrated to be sexually dimorphic, where peritoneal macrophage replenishment from the bone marrow is lower in females, and macrophage differentiation in females, but not males, is RELMα dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bain et al., 2020</xref>). Our data further reveal that RELMα expression is sex dependent and has critical functions in the adipose tissue through macrophage and eosinophil-driven mechanisms. We also demonstrate RELMα-specific effects on monocyte-to-macrophage transition in the adipose tissue that occur in both males and females. Whether these effects may be influenced by sex-specific differences in myeloid cell ontogeny from the bone marrow is unclear and an important avenue for future research. The importance of monocyte expression of RELMα for survival and differentiation has recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sanin et al., 2022</xref>). Trajectory analysis of the myeloid subsets revealed that WT animals of both sexes followed expected trajectories of monocyte differentiation to either Mac1 or to Mac2/3 clusters. Mac2/3 clusters express markers of proinflammatory macrophages, such as Ly6c, while Mac1 expresses markers of anti-inflammatory macrophages, such as <italic>Mrc1</italic> (CD206). The lack of RELMα in KO animals of both sexes led to dysregulated monocyte differentiation, where the ‘protective’ Mac1 cluster could become Mac2/3 cells. This trajectory change implies that lack of RELMα disrupts myeloid differentiation leading to a more proinflammatory profile. Genes enriched in monocyte-to-Mac1 transition in WT vs. RELMα KO female mice were examined to determine cell-intrinsic functions for RELMα. These analyses revealed that RELMα expression is critical for monocyte differentiation into IL-4 responsive macrophages, but in its absence, monocytes begin to increase expression of genes associated with high metabolic activity, which could result in oxidative stress.</p><p>In conclusion, these studies demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for RELMα in modulating metabolic and inflammatory responses during diet-induced obesity that is sex dependent. Results from these studies highlight a critical RELMα–eosinophil–macrophage axis that functions in females to protect from diet-induced obesity and inflammation. Promoting these pathways could provide novel therapies for obesity pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RELMα knockout</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34349768">34349768</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>H. polygyrus</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36569914">36569914</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-Hemoglobin alpha (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #

Each group consisted of three biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). SVF single-cell suspension from each mouse was labeled with the 10× Genomics CMOs following the manufacturer’s protocol (10× Genomics, Demonstrated Protocol, CG000391). Cell suspensions from mice in the same group were pooled and processed for the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ v3.1 Dual Index (10× Genomics, Demonstrated Protocol, CG000388). For generation of single-cell gel beads in emulsion (GEM), 50,000 cells were loaded on the Chromium Chip and barcoded, in order to reach a targeted cell recovery of 30,000 cells per group. GEM reverse transcription was achieved in order to generate barcoded cDNA. GEMs were broken, and cDNA was cleaned up using DynaBeads MyOne Silane Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and SPRIselect Reagent kit (Beckman Coulter). Full-length barcoded cDNA was amplified, cleaned up, and fragmented in order to generate Illumina-ready sequencing libraries. 3′ single-cell gene expression libraries were generated using a fixed proportion (25%) of the total cDNA per sample. Libraries were amplified by PCR, after which the library was split into two parts: one part for generating the 3′ gene expression library and the other for the multiplexing library. Libraries were indexed for multiplexing (Chromium Dual Index Kit TT Set A, PN-1000215, 10× Genomics), quantified by Qubit 3 fluorometer (Invitrogen), and quality assessed by 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent). Equivalent molar concentrations of libraries were pooled and sequenced using Novaseq 6000 (Illumina) using 10× Genomics recommended sequencing depth and run parameters (sequencing depth of 20,000 read pairs per cell, paired end sequencing) at the UC San Diego (UCSD) Institute for Genomic Medicine (IGM) Center.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data processing and analysis</title><p>Demultiplexed FASTQ files were provided and downloaded by a secure portal on the UCSD IGM core and were used for downstream processing. Raw scRNA-seq FASTQ files were aligned to the mouse mm10-2020-A genome with Cell Ranger v6.1.2 with default settings using STAR aligner in the Cell Ranger multiplex (multi) pipeline. The Cell Ranger multi pipeline specifically analyzes 3′ Cell Multiplexing data combined with 3′ Gene expression data. The reference genome was downloaded from the 10× Genomics website and built as per official release notes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/release-notes/build#mm10_2020A">here</ext-link>). Every group was analyzed using the Cell Ranger multi pipeline, which allows multiplexing libraries to be processed together with the paired gene expression (GEX) libraries for each group. CMO deconvolution was performed using the Cell Ranger multi pipeline. Briefly, a multi config CSV was created containing the library definitions and experimental design variables (deposited on the Github repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rrugg002/Sexual-dimorphism-in-obesity-is-governed-by-RELM-regulation-of-adipose-macrophages-and-eosinophils">https://github.com/rrugg002/Sexual-dimorphism-in-obesity-is-governed-by-RELM-regulation-of-adipose-macrophages-and-eosinophils</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li, 2023</xref>). These parameters contain sections that specify parameters relevant to analysis of the gene expression library including the 10× Genomics-compatible reference genome, a samples section that specifies sample information and CMO identity for cell multiplexing and a section that highlights the identity and location of the input FASTQ file for each sample as well as the chemistry of the assay. After generation of the multi config CSV, Cell Ranger multi was performed with the output folder containing the main pipeline outputs, such as the generalized multiplexing outputs and the demultiplexed outputs per sample. Dimensionality reduction analysis was performed as an automated secondary analysis as part of the Cell Ranger multi pipeline. Briefly, Cell Ranger performs PCA using gene expression features as PCA features, using a python implementation of the IRLBA algorithm. These data are then passed into the nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, t-SNE analysis in order to visualize the data in a 2D space. Unbiased clustering of the data was then performed in order to group cells together that have similar expression profiles based on their principal components using a graph-based method. Cell Ranger produces a table indicating differentially expressed features in each cluster relative to other clusters, with the top hits being used to identify cell populations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Sequencing reads for all 12 samples were then integrated using the Cell Ranger aggregation (aggr) pipeline, which enables batch effect correction to be performed on the combined dataset. Cell Ranger aggr pipeline generates a normalized integrated count matrix was generated by dividing the UMI count for each gene by the total number of UMIs in each cell, followed by log-transformation. To filter out poor quality cells, cells with threshold UMI count of &gt;20,000 and&lt;500 and mitochondrial fraction of &gt;10% were filtered from analysis using the Loupe Browser software v 6.2. re-clustering tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Gene expression visualization and differential gene expression analysis</title><p>The 10× Genomics Loupe Browser software v 6.2 (10× Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) was used to project tSNEs of the cell-type clusters obtained after integration of all 12 samples (4 groups, WT female, WT male, KO female, KO male, <italic>n</italic> = 3 per group) using the Cell Ranger aggr pipeline.</p><p>Differential gene expression analysis for the myeloid cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), fibroblast, and ILC2 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) subclustering analysis was calculated using the Loupe Browser’s integrated locally distinguishing function, which determines the features that distinguish the selected groups from one another or by distinguishing cells from one selected cluster vs. cells from another selected cluster. The locally distinguishing function of Loupe Browser utilizes the negative binomial test based on the sSeq method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), with Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple tests and calculates log-normalized average expression values across the two samples or cell populations being compared. When performing pseudobulk differential gene expression analysis between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; WT female vs. male, KO female vs. male, KO female vs. WT female, KO male vs. WT male), the globally distinguishing function on Loupe Browser was used to find features between checked groups relative to all clusters in the dataset. Differential gene expression file outputs from Loupe Browser were downloaded and data were presented as volcano plots and average counts for select genes were plotted as histograms between both groups (GraphPad Prism). Heatmaps of differential gene expression data were plotted using Loupe Browser software and are generated using hierarchical clustering with Euclidian distance and average linkage.</p><p>GO enrichment analysis of the genes from DEG analysis was performed using the ShinyGo 0.76.3 platform (South Dakota State University [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ge et al., 2020</xref>]). ShinyGo 0.76.3 fold enrichment algorithm utilizes a hypergeometric distribution followed by false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Background gene sets are all protein-coding genes in the mouse genome. The top 30 DEGs that were up- and downregulated for each respective comparison were visualized using a dotplot chart plotting fold enrichment for each respective enriched GO term for Biological Processes. For each GO enrichment analysis, FDR of &lt;0.05 was applied, with the pathway minimum set to 10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Trajectory analysis</title><p>For trajectory analysis, we utilized the Seurat package (Seurat_4.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) and Monocle3 (v 3_1.2.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2019</xref>) to process and analyze the scRNA-seq data. The raw data were initially read into R using the readMM function, with the matrices for features, barcodes, and counts extracted from the input files. The Seurat object was created by applying the CreateSeuratObject function with a minimum of 3 cells per gene and 100 features per cell, which was then saved as an RDS file for subsequent analysis. Cell barcodes annotated from the 10× Genomics Loupe Browser were imported as separate CSV files. These annotations were subsequently integrated into the Seurat object’s metadata. We then subset the data to focus on dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes for further trajectory analysis using Monocle3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haghverdi et al., 2018</xref>). The expression matrix, cell metadata, and gene annotations were extracted from the Seurat object and used to create a new CellDataSet (CDS) object in Monocle3. The CDS was preprocessed with a dimensionality reduction set at 100 dimensions, followed by an alignment step to adjust for batch effects using the Sample.ID variable. Lastly, a trajectory graph was constructed by applying the learn_graph function, which infers the developmental trajectories of the cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Code availability</title><p>Experimental protocols and the data analysis pipeline used in our work follow the 10× Genomics and Seurat official websites.

diet-induced obesity in mice, demonstrating a role for macrophage-derived RELMa secretion in determining female-specific obesity protection. They provide evidence for the impact of RELMa signaling in eosinophil recruitment for diet-induced obesity protection in female mice. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the stromal vascular fraction of control and RELMa deficient animals were used to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the protection. The conclusion of these findings provides evidence supporting dysregulation of cell differentiation pathways.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86001.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Benayoun</surname><given-names>Bérénice A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03taz7m60</institution-id><institution>University of Southern California</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Ocanas</surname><given-names>Sarah R</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/035z6xf33</institution-id><institution>Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.01.13.523880">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.13.523880v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Shlomo Melmed as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sarah R. Ocanas (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consulting together with the reviewer, we believe these are the essential revisions required to support the claims in the manuscript:</p><p>1. Increased clarity/details in the methodology, specifically in the processing and analysis of the scRNAseq dataset (including parameters, batch correction method, and immediate availability of code) [Rev 1 and 3].</p><p>2. Better discussion of why eosinophils could not be detected [Rev 1 and 3].</p><p>3. Trimming down conclusions from introductions and results, make it clear what is directly supported and what is conjecture [Rev 1, 2 and 3].</p><p>4. Check of mutilplexing/demultiplexing, since a top-regulated gene in females, Gm47283, is Y encoded [Rev 3]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The nature of the t-SNE analysis provided in Figure 2 is not well explained. What is the input data? How is the clustering performed? How are cell types annotated in the analysis? In general, neither the text nor the figure legend gives a good description of the content of Figure 2 in its current state.</p><p>2. There is a general lack of details on the analytical strategies and methods, especially computational methods, that is not acceptable for the evaluation of results and long-term reproducibility. The authors need to provide extensive additional information about used bioinformatic tools and/or analyses.</p><p>a. The authors give only very generic text about using &quot;standard&quot; data processing, which does not inform about specific algorithm choices for analysis. For instance, the authors mention using batch correction but do not specify the algorithm used (or its parameters). The pipeline for CMO deconvolution is also not described and needs to be described, especially for any future reanalysis of the data. In addition, the version of R, and all versions of R packages should be provided as well (e.g. monocle), as this can impact the final results. There is also no mention of which test was used to identify markers in Seurat, and how the tests were set up. Thus, it is crucial that the method section be revised to include all necessary information for readers to evaluate and reproduce the bioinformatics analyses of the scRNA-seq data.</p><p>b. Although a functional enrichment analysis is mentioned in the text [lines 230-232], there are no details about the algorithm used for enrichment beyond the name &quot;shinyGO&quot;. Is this a hypergeometric enrichment or ranked list-type algorithm? What version of the GO database was used, and was it the 3 domains of GO? What background gene list was used to compute enrichment? All this information needs to be explicitly included. A supplementary table with all enriched terms would also be invaluable.</p><p>c. The code availability section uses language to say that the code is generic, following established tutorials. Since there are always choices made in the R implementation of a pipeline with a specific dataset (in terms of parameters), this is not acceptable for reproducibility or peer-review evaluation. In addition, it seems like different sources had to be used since batch correction is mentioned as well. For long-term reproducibility, it is crucial to either deposit all R scripts that were used to a public repository such as GitHub or provide it as a supplemental archive to accompany the manuscript. A reference to standard pipelines is not compatible with the methodological review.</p><p>d. The methods provide no description of the infection paradigm used to harvest eosinophils.</p><p>e. The authors do not provide any information about the time of day of euthanasia of animals, which impacts many phenotypes (including immune phenotypes) due to circadian rhythms.</p><p>3. Granulocytes, including eosinophils, are notoriously RNA-poor, and it has been established by 10xGenomics that special adjustments to the protocol (specifically, increased amplification of cDNA) are required for captured [https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004024032-Can-I-process-neutrophils-or-other-granulocytes-using-10x-Single-Cell-applications-]. It would be important to discuss the RNA-poorness of these cells in the section discussing with eosinophils were not captured (lines 280-283), as this is more likely the reason for lack of capture over limited transcriptional identity or degranulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While we generally find the manuscript well written and well organized, there are some comments and concerns below we would like to share to help improve the manuscript:</p><p>Figure 1E: Small animal cohort size and large standard deviation in data. The figure would be strengthened by adding additional animals to improve the sample size.</p><p>Figure 1G: Differences in immune cell populations don't seem to correlate well with cytokine/chemokine expression (1E). Can classic cytokines known to increase during obesity like TNFa, IL-6, and IL-1b be looked at more carefully to better understand how the loss of RELMa influences their expression?</p><p>Figure 2A. Please state clearly in the body of the manuscript that this is flow cytometry data. This was not obvious from reading the text.</p><p>Figure 2E: Switch CD206 (main figure) and CD301 (supplementary).</p><p>Figure 2F: What is the significance of higher Siglec-F expression by eosinophils? please elaborate further on why this is important.</p><p>Line 206: It would be more proper to say M1-like macrophage, a classic M1 macrophage is defined by stimulation with LPS, and multiple papers over the years have shown CD11c+ macrophages in HFD models do not express classic M1 macrophage genes (PMID: 25242226).</p><p>Figure 4D-F does not seem to be representative flow plots based on the data graphed below. Recommend choosing a flow plot that represents the median of the graphed data.</p><p>Consider merging figures 5 and 6, as they are both limited in scope.</p><p>Figure 7a: Is the annotation able to differentiate fibroblast vs pre-adipocytes? Also in the Figure to the right of the TSNE plot, it is hard to determine the sex and genotype of these mice. Please draw groups on the x-axis like in 7C.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below is a point-by-point critique to aid the authors in understanding specific points from the public review.</p><p>Title – We recommend including &quot;in young mice&quot; as part of the title.</p><p>Introduction – We believe that the introduction could benefit from editing down. Some of the details would be more appropriate for the discussion. Conclusions from the scRNA-Seq analyses will need to be updated after correcting the analyses.</p><p>Results – An experimental design figure prior to Figure 1 and Figure 4 would be helpful to the reader.</p><p>There are several instances in the text where the authors claim that there is a significant difference between the two groups, but the statistics for these comparisons are not shown in the figure.</p><p>– Line 97-98 – &quot;Under both Ctr and HFD conditions, female mice had significantly higher RELMα in the serum and visceral adipose tissue than males (Figure 1A).&quot; – It does not appear that there is a significant difference in RELMa within the female visceral fat under HFD.</p><p>– Figure 1B – Why was a t-test used for this figure when there were four groups to compare? Were any comparisons made between the Ctr groups? In the text (lines 100-101), it states &quot;RELMα 101 deficiency did not affect Ctr or HFD weight gain in males…&quot;; however these statistics are not described in the legend or text.</p><p>– Lines 107-108 – &quot;The monocyte chemoattractant CCL2 was significantly elevated in HFD-males…&quot; – Was this statistic assessed? It is not shown in Figure 1C.</p><p>– Lines 111-12 – &quot;The higher level of IL-10 and GM-CSF in females were dependent on RELMα and were further decreased with exposure to HFD…&quot; – In figure 1E, the effect of HFD was not shown to be statistically significant.</p><p>– Line 112 – &quot;…while IL-5 was only decreased with HFD&quot; – this statistic was not shown in Figure 1E.</p><p>– Figure 2B – Quantify and show statistics for the claim on lines 140-141 &quot;Ctr-fed male and female mice had high eosinophil numbers, and this subset disappeared in male mice upon HFD&quot;.</p><p>– Figure 2E – It is difficult to determine which comparisons are being highlighted on the box plots. In the text (lines 154-156) the authors claim that this is an HFD effect – does this hold for both sexes?</p><p>It is unfortunate that eosinophils could not be identified in the single-cell analysis since this population of cells was shown to be important in rescuing the RELMα-deficiency in HFD-fed females. The authors should note in the discussion how future scRNA-Seq experiments could overcome this limitation (i.e., enriching immune cells prior to scRNA-Seq). Although another scRNA-Seq experiment including eosinophils would add to the report, we believe it is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>– Lines 283-286 – &quot;We employed targeted approaches to identify eosinophil clusters according to eosinophil markers (e.g. Siglecf, Prg2, Ccr3, Il5r), and relaxed the scRNA-Seq cutoff analysis to include more cells and intronic content, but still could not find eosinophils.&quot; – Please provide the feature plots showing expression across clusters for Siglecf, Prg2, Ccr3, Il5r as supplemental figures.</p><p>– Lines 286-288 – &quot;We conclude that eosinophils may be absent due to the enzyme digestion required for SVF isolation and processing for single-cell sequencing, which could lead to specific eosinophil population loss due to RNases or cell viability issues.&quot; – Do you use the same single cell dissociation techniques for flow cytometry as were employed for the scRNA-seq? If so, what proportion of cells are eosinophils?</p><p>There is inconsistency in the presentation and interpretation of the correlations in Figure 3.</p><p>– The correlations in Figure 3A, 3B, and 3E appear to be driven entirely by diet effect. Is it possible that the HFD and not body weight are responsible for this effect?</p><p>– Figure 3C-G – Why are males absent from this analysis?</p><p>– Figure 3E – Why are all groups not included in this particular correlation, as in Figure 3A and Figure 3B? Is this a female-specific effect? I understand why the KO groups were not included, but the text does not describe the sex difference here.</p><p>– Lines 183-184 – &quot;suggesting that the protective effect of RELMα may be impaired with body weight gain (Figure 3F-G).&quot; – This result could also imply that HFD (and not body weight) is causing a decrease in RELMα. Do you think that this same effect would be seen in another obesogenic diet (i.e., a high carbohydrate diet)? We are not recommending adding these experiments to the current report, but authors may choose to comment on this in the discussion.</p><p>There are several issues with the scRNA-Seq analysis and interpretation. More details on the steps taken in the single-cell analyses should be included in the methods section.</p><p>– Deposition of code to a public repository (i.e., GitHub) would allow for rigor and reproducibility of the analyses.</p><p>With regards to the 'pseudobulk' analyses presented in Figures 5-6, several of the differentially expressed genes identified in Figure 6 are hemoglobin genes (i.e., Hba, Hbb genes). It is not uncommon to filter these genes out of single-cell analysis since their presence usually indicates red blood cell (RBC) contamination (PMID: 31942070, PMID: 35672358). We would recommend assessing RBC contamination as well as removing Figure 6 from the manuscript and focusing on cell-type-specific analyses.</p><p>– Figure 5D – It is unclear what comparisons are generating these lists of genes. Please provide a supplemental table with all differentially expressed genes from the analyses.</p><p>Within the text, there are several instances where the authors claim that a pathway is upregulated based on their Gene Ontology (GO) over-representation analysis (ORA). To come to this conclusion, the authors identify genes that are upregulated in one condition and then perform GO-ORA on these genes. However, the authors do not consider negative regulators, whose upregulation would actually decrease the pathway. Authors should either replace their GO-ORA analysis with one that considers the magnitude and direction of differentially expressed genes and provides an activation z-score (i.e., Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) or replace instances of 'upregulated' or 'downregulated' pathways with 'over-represented' pathways.</p><p>For Figure 7A, a representative tSNE plot for each group (WT Female, KO Female, WT Male, KO Male) should be shown to ensure there is proper integration of the clusters across groups. There are some instances where the scRNA-Seq data do not appear to be integrated properly (i.e., Supplemental Figure 2C). The authors should explore integration techniques (i.e., Seurat; PMID: 29608179) to correct for potential batch effects within the analysis.</p><p>– Lines 338-339 – &quot;When analyzing scRNA-seq data from WT mice, RELMα (Retnla) is expressed in the Mono and Mac1 clusters (Figure 7D, F).&quot; – It appears that RELMα is also expressed in the Mac4 cluster. Did you perform a plot to see if RELMα is present in any other clusters from Figure 7A?</p><p>LncRNA Gm47283 is identified as a gene that is differentially expressed by genotype in HFD females (Figure 7G); however, according to Ensembl this gene is encoded on the Y-chromosome (https://uswest.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Gene/Summary?g=ENSMUSG00000096768;r=Y:90796007-90827734). The authors should use the RELMα genotype and sex chromosomally-encoded genes to confirm that their multiplexing was appropriate.</p><p>For Figure 8, samples should be co-clustered and integrated across groups before performing trajectory analysis to allow for direct comparisons between groups.</p><p>– Line 289-291 – &quot;The main population in the SVF, accounting for 50-75% of cells, were non-immune cells identified as Pdgrfa+ fibroblasts (green). These were significantly increased in WT females compared to the other groups (p&lt;0.01, S2C).&quot; – Were these data integrated using a feature like the &quot;IntegrateData&quot; command in Seurat? It does not appear that the cells cluster well when comparing males and females.</p><p>Scale bars on several heatmaps are not labeled with what they represent (Figures 5E, 7F, 7G, S2N, S2O, S4B, S4C).</p><p>Since the experiments presented in this report were from young mice using a single diet intervention, the authors should comment on how age and other obesogenic diets may impact the results found here. Also, the authors should expand their discussion as to what upstream regulators (i.e., hormones or genetics) may be driving the sex differences in RELMα expression in response to HFD.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86001.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consulting together with the reviewer, we believe these are the essential revisions required to support the claims in the manuscript:</p><p>1.

The authors give only very generic text about using &quot;standard&quot; data processing, which does not inform about specific algorithm choices for analysis. For instance, the authors mention using batch correction but do not specify the algorithm used (or its parameters). The pipeline for CMO deconvolution is also not described and needs to be described, especially for any future reanalysis of the data. In addition, the version of R, and all versions of R packages should be provided as well (e.g. monocle), as this can impact the final results. There is also no mention of which test was used to identify markers in Seurat, and how the tests were set up. Thus, it is crucial that the method section be revised to include all necessary information for readers to evaluate and reproduce the bioinformatics analyses of the scRNA-seq data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided a paragraph on the CMO deconvolution methods using the 10x Cell Ranger multiplex (multi) pipeline, a pipeline that is specific to CMO calling and deconvolution using 3’ CellPlex. Markers for identified clusters were identified using Cell Ranger, where each cluster contained a list of top differentially expressed genes. From that list we were able to identify cell type populations based on known markers in cell populations, examples of which are included in Figure 6B. As mentioned now in detail in our Materials and methods section, we performed principal component analysis, dimensionality analysis, CMO deconvolution, integration and differential gene expression using the Cell Ranger v.6.1.2 software. Information on unique cell features, barcodes and matrices were then exported and used to make a Seurat object for trajectory analysis using Monocle 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

Source code is reported in the publication, Steven Xijin Ge, Dongmin Jung, Runan Yao, ShinyGO: a graphical gene-set enrichment tool for animals and plants, Bioinformatics, Volume 36, Issue 8, April 2020, Pages 2628–2629, and is available on the Github repository (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz931). This is a hypergeometric enrichment algorithm. We used the ShinyGo 0.76, which is based on Ensembl Release 104 with revision, archived on September 2, 2022. ShinyGo 0.76 uses the GO database version V2017.5, consisting of 11,943 GO terms for Biological Processes.

Additional text in Methods: ‘For adoptive transfer, peritoneal exudate cavity cells were recovered from Heligmosomoides polygyrus-infected WT female BL/6 mice. Specifically, groups of 3-5 WT female BL/6 mice were infected by oral gavage with 200 H.polygyrus L3, which leads to adult worms in the intestine and eosinophilia by day 10 post-infection, and a chronic infection in BL/6J for at least at least 3 months (PMID: 36569914). Infection was confirmed by egg count in feces. To ensure sufficient eosinophil recovery, 2-3 H.polygyrus-infected female mice were euthanized between days 14 and 20 post-infection for eosinophil recovery. Peritoneal exudate cavity eosinophils were column-purified with biotinylated anti-SiglecF (BioLegend), followed by anti-biotin MicroBeads then magnetic separation with MS columns according to manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi). 1x10<sup>6</sup> eosinophils were transferred to recipient mice by i.p. injection every two weeks.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e.

Our primary focus was to determine differences between all groups in ALL immune cells in the stromal vascular fraction that arise due to obesity. We were concerned to deviate from the standard protocol and increase amplification due to possible amplification bias, which may prevent comparison with previous studies. We had discussions with other researchers and 10X genomics concerning granulocyte populations, and opted to use this protocol to gain the most insight into all immune cells, especially myeloid lineage that is critical in obesity, even if it diminished granulocyte RNA. We included more discussion on this point, including citing a recent paper that is the first to our knowledge to report single cell sequencing in eosinophils: “At the same time as our ongoing analysis, the first publication of eosinophil single cell RNA-seq was published, using a flow cytometry based approach rather than 10x, including RNAse inhibitor in the sorting buffer, and performing prior eosinophil enrichment (PMID: 36509106). We employed targeted approaches and relaxed the scRNA-Seq cutoff analysis to include more cells and intronic content to attempt eosinophil identification using eosinophil markers (e.g. Siglecf, Prg2, Ccr3, Il5r), but still could not find eosinophils – see new panel Figure 2—figure supplement 1G. We conclude that eosinophils may be absent due to the enzymatic digestion required for SVF isolation and processing for single cell sequencing, which could lead to specific eosinophil population loss due to low RNA content, RNases or cell viability issues. Future experiments would be needed to optimize eosinophil single cell sequencing, based on the recent publication of eosinophil single cell sequencing”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While we generally find the manuscript well written and well organized, there are some comments and concerns below we would like to share to help improve the manuscript:</p><p>Figure 1E: Small animal cohort size and large standard deviation in data.

However, since CCL2 is not regulated by RELMa, and differences between males and females have already been demonstrated by our group (PMID:33268480), we do not think that it is justifiable to sacrifice additional animals for confirmatory studies, and it would not comply with 3 R’s requirement for animal research. We have added a statement acknowledging the caveat of this small animal cohort size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1G: Differences in immune cell populations don't seem to correlate well with cytokine/chemokine expression (1E).

We indeed saw differential expression of SiglecF, with female RELMalpha KO eosinophils expressing significantly higher SiglecF than WT Eos. Studies using mice deficient in SiglecF identified a role for SiglecF in inhibiting lung allergic responses (PMID: 17272508), but other studies show it promotes type 2 inflammation (PMID: 34996839; PMID: 27690378). The former study showed that SiglecF stimulation promotes apoptosis (PMID: 17272508). It is possible that the increased SiglecF expression in KO eosinophils can lead to increased apoptosis of these cells, thereby explaining the reduced eosinophil frequency, but we have no supportive data for this. Nonetheless, we provide these citations and discussion for the readers: “Siglec-F is a paralogue of human Siglec-8, and in mice is expressed on eosinophils but also alveolar macrophages. The function of Siglec-F appears to be context-dependent, with reported evidence of stimulatory and inhibitory roles on eosinophils (PMID: 34996839; PMID: 27690378). One study showed that SiglecF stimulation induced apoptosis (PMID: 17272508). It is possible that the increased expression of SiglecF on the RELMα-deficient eosinophils from HFD KO female mice may increase their susceptibility to apoptosis, explaining their reduced frequency”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 206: It would be more proper to say M1-like macrophage, a classic M1 macrophage is defined by stimulation with LPS, and multiple papers over the years have shown CD11c+ macrophages in HFD models do not express classic M1 macrophage genes (PMID: 25242226).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed to M1-like throughout the text, where relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4D-F does not seem to be representative flow plots based on the data graphed below.

Do you think that this same effect would be seen in another obesogenic diet (i.e., a high carbohydrate diet)? We are not recommending adding these experiments to the current report, but authors may choose to comment on this in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that several studies have demonstrated that HFD per se, prior to weight gain can cause changes in immune cells. Most studies using diet-induced obesity models, are confounded with the combination of diet and obesity: animals are analyzed after they gain weight in response to HFD. This also creates problems delineating causes of downstream pathology, since obesity is a state of hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, in addition to chronic inflammation. Several studies attempted to answer this question. For example, it was shown that HFD causes inflammation in the hypothalamus before the onset of obesity; only 1 day of HFD exposure caused cytokine induction (PMID: 16002529; PMID: 22201683). Another study demonstrated that HFD itself caused inflammation rather than obesity per se, using monogenic obese mice (ob/ob or db/db that are obese without exposure to HFD), at least with respect to brain macrophage /microglia activation (PMID: 24166765). On the other hand, later studies demonstrated that ob/ob mice also experience inflammation, demonstrated by cytokine increase, indicating that genetic obesity without HFD can contribute to inflammation (PMID: 32296847; PMID: 32422516).</p><p>We first analyzed the levels of RELMa after HFD and as demonstrated in Figure 1A and 1B, serum levels of RELMa are not affected by diet, but adipose tissue levels are, which may imply that increased tissue inflammation lowers RELMa. Figure 3F-G demonstrate correlation between weight and RELMa after exposure to HFD. Protective effects of RELMa were demonstrated in Figure 4 with RELMa treatment. The text has been revised to improve clarity. We consider that the same effect would be observed with any obesogenic diet, since increased adiposity causes inflammation, and RELMa decreases in inflammatory conditions, as a marker of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells. We have added discussion of this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several issues with the scRNA-Seq analysis and interpretation.

It is not uncommon to filter these genes out of single-cell analysis since their presence usually indicates red blood cell (RBC) contamination (PMID: 31942070, PMID: 35672358). We would recommend assessing RBC contamination as well as removing Figure 6 from the manuscript and focusing on cell-type-specific analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Prior to our first submission, we consulted with 10x support scientists and the UCR bioinformatics core director to ensure that our analyses included the appropriate filtering. We have now detailed this in the methods, and believe our analysis is robust (and this is confirmed by the experts we consulted above). The PMIDs provided above are from studies that looked at hippocampus development (where they didn’t perfuse so there may be blood contamination) or whole blood (where there would be significant red blood cell contamination). Instead, we perfused our mice and treated the single cell suspension with RBC lysis buffer, see methods. Also, we have now extended our scSeq analysis to compare hemoglobin RNA to red blood cell specific marker Gypa/CD235a. While hemoglobin is distributed throughout the myeloid population in the female KO mice, Gypa/CD235a, which would suggest RBC contamination is not expressed at all (see new Figure 7). Additionally, we provide hemoglobin protein ELISA and IF staining to support our finding that macrophages from KO mice express hemoglobin protein. Last, two publications support hemoglobin expression by nonerythroid sources, including macrophages (PMID: 10359765; PMID: 25431740). While we are confident based on above that our data is not due to RBC contamination, we cannot exclude the fact that, although unlikely, macrophages may be phagocytosing RBC and preserving specifically hemoglobin RNA and protein. Nonetheless, we discuss this possibility in the text. In conclusion, based on the justification above and the new data, we are confident that our findings and overall conclusions are robust.</p><p>To assess for potential RBC contamination, we looked at top marker genes expressed by murine erythrocytes (PMID: 24637361).

To come to this conclusion, the authors identify genes that are upregulated in one condition and then perform GO-ORA on these genes. However, the authors do not consider negative regulators, whose upregulation would actually decrease the pathway.

The authors should explore integration techniques (i.e., Seurat; PMID: 29608179) to correct for potential batch effects within the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of proper integration of the clusters across groups. We performed integration using the Cell Ranger aggregation (aggr) pipeline (see updated Materials and methods section). In addition, many technical controls were performed to prevent batch effects between our samples. For sequencing, we used the 10x genomics library sequencing depth and run parameters for both gene expression and multiplexing libraries. For all 3’ gene expression library sequencing, we sequenced at a depth of 20,000 read pairs per cell and for all cell multiplexing library sequencing we sequenced at a depth of 5,000 read pairs per cell. All libraries were paired-end dual indexed libraries and were pooled on one flow cell lane using a 4:1 ratio (3’ Gene expression: Multiplexing ratio) in the Novaseq, as recommended by 10x Genomics, in order to maintain nucleotide diversity and prevent batch effects during the sequencing process. When performing integration/aggregation of all sample gene expression libraries using the Cell Ranger aggregation (aggr) pipeline, we performed sequencing depth normalization between all samples. Cell Ranger does this by equalizing the average read depth per cell between groups before merging all sample libraries and counts together. This is a default setting in the Cell Ranger aggr pipeline, and this approach avoids artifacts that may be introduced due to differences in sequencing depth. Thus, we are confident that changes we observed in gene expression and cell type populations are due to biological differences and not technical variability.
