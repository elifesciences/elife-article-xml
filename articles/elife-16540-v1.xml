We have used formation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight musculature for studying the assembly and maturation of thin-filament arrays in a skeletal muscle model system. Employing GFP-tagged actin monomer incorporation, we identify several distinct phases in the dynamic construction of thin-filament arrays. This sequence includes assembly of nascent arrays after an initial period of intensive microfilament synthesis, followed by array elongation, primarily from filament pointed-ends, radial growth of the arrays via recruitment of peripheral filaments and continuous barbed-end turnover. Using genetic approaches we have identified Fhos, the single <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the FHOD sub-family of formins, as a primary and versatile mediator of IFM thin-filament organization. Localization of Fhos to the barbed-ends of the arrays, achieved via a novel N-terminal domain, appears to be a critical aspect of its sarcomeric roles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16540.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16540.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16540.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscles owe their ability to contract to structural units called sarcomeres, and a single muscle fiber can contain many thousands of these structures, aligned one next to the other. Each mature sarcomere is made up of precisely arranged and intertwined thin filaments of actin and thicker bundles of motor proteins, surrounded by other proteins. Sliding the motors along the filaments provides the force needed to contract the muscle. However, it was far from clear how sarcomeres, especially the arrays of thin-filaments, are assembled from scratch in developing muscles.</p><p>When the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> transforms from a larva into an adult, it needs to build muscles to move its newly forming wings. While smaller in size, these flight muscles closely resemble the skeletal muscles of animals with backbones, and therefore serve as a good model for muscle formation in general. New muscles require new sarcomeres too, and now Shwartz et al. have observed and monitored sarcomeres assembling in developing flight muscles of fruit flies, a process that takes about three days.</p><p>The analysis made use of genetically engineered flies in which the gene for a fluorescently labeled version of actin, the building block of the thin filaments, could be switched on at specific points in time. Looking at how these green-glowing proteins become incorporated into the growing sarcomere revealed that the assembly process involves four different phases. First, a large store of unorganized and newly-made thin filaments is generated for future use. These filaments are then assembled into rudimentary structures in which the filaments are roughly aligned. Once these core structures are formed, the existing filaments are elongated, while additional filaments are brought in to expand the structure further. Finally, actin proteins are continuously added and removed at the part of the sarcomere where the thin filaments are anchored.</p><p>Shwartz et al. went on to identify a protein termed Fhos as the chief player in the process. Fhos is a member of a family of proteins that are known to elongate and organize actin filaments in many different settings. Without Fhos, the thin-filament arrays cannot properly begin to assemble, and the subsequent steps of growth and expansion are blocked as well.</p><p>The next challenges will be to understand what guides the initial stages in the assembly of the thin-filament array, and how the coordination between assembly of actin filament arrays and motor proteins is executed. It will also be important to determine how sarcomeres are maintained throughout the life of the organism when defective actin filaments are replaced, and which proteins are responsible for carrying out this process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16540.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16540.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>muscle fiber</kwd><kwd>sarcomere</kwd><kwd>muscle actin</kwd><kwd>formin</kwd><kwd>Fhos/FHOD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>557/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schejter</surname><given-names>Eyal D</given-names></name><name><surname>Shilo</surname><given-names>Ben-Zion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Weizmann UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Joint research program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schejter</surname><given-names>Eyal D</given-names></name><name><surname>Shilo</surname><given-names>Ben-Zion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Actin is incorporated into the thin-filament arrays of skeletal muscle sarcomeres in discrete steps, and Fhos, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of FHOD-family formins, is an essential player in the process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sarcomeres constitute the basic functional units of muscle fibers, endowing these large and specialized cells with their contractile capacity. Central to sarcomere function is the lattice-like organization of two filament systems: an actin-based thin-filament array, which provides a stiff backbone along which thick filaments, composed of myosin motor proteins, 'slide' in order to produce force and contractile motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Squire, 1997</xref>). The spatial organization and efficient operation of this remarkable cellular machinery relies on a host of dedicated proteins and protein complexes, which act to regulate sarcomere size and streamline its activity, and to coordinate between the multiple sarcomeric units that comprise individual myofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehler and Gautel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gautel and Djinovic-Carugo, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite their fundamental significance, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying assembly, maturation and maintenance of thin-filament arrays remains one of the major open issues in the study of sarcomere structure and function. While mechanisms relating to size definition and stability of the arrays have been extensively investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandes and Schock, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyer and Wright, 2013</xref>), other key aspects of microfilament array formation and dynamics, including determination of distinct phases of array maturation, the identity and regulation of elements mediating filament nucleation/elongation, and the processes governing incorporation of additional filaments into nascent arrays are not resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ono, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here we address these matters in the context of formation and development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscles (IFMs). These are the largest muscles of the adult fly, which power flight by regulated contraction of the thorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dickinson, 2006</xref>). A major subset of the IFMs, the dorso-longitudinal muscles (DLMs), closely resemble vertebrate skeletal muscles in both their developmental program and in their mature myofibrillar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dutta and VijayRaghavan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1999</xref>), making them a particularly attractive model system, in which the powerful molecular genetic approaches available to study <italic>Drosophila</italic> development can be harnessed to investigate and elucidate general principles of myogenesis.</p><p>DLM formation initiates by fusion of hundreds of individual myoblasts to a set of larval muscles during the first 24-30 hours of pupal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandes et al., 1991</xref>). The subsequent ~80 hrs of myogenesis leading up to eclosion of the adult fly include formation and maturation of a parallel arrangement of myofibrils and assembly and growth of sarcomeric units within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reedy and Beall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weitkunat et al., 2014</xref>). This sequence of events takes place over a wide time window, providing an opportunity to temporally dissected and manipulate the coordinated processes giving rise to thin-filament array assembly and maturation.</p><p>IFM sarcomeres initiate as small, nascent structures, that grow considerably over the course of pupal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sparrow and Schock, 2009</xref>), reaching a final, uniform size of 3.4 µm in length and 1.5 µm in diameter. Spatial organization of the mature, evenly-spaced IFM sarcomeres closely mirrors that of striated vertebrate skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reedy and Beall, 1993</xref>). Individual sarcomeric units are defined by Z-disc borders, which serve as anchoring sites for the barbed ends of the thin-filament arrays, and by a central, microfilament-free H-zone, bordered by the pointed-ends of neighboring thin-filament arrays. We utilized temporally-controlled expression of GFP-tagged actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roper et al., 2005</xref>) to follow thin-filament array dynamics, and recognize key phases and distinct transitions of the arrays throughout sarcomerogenesis. In parallel we identified Fhos, the single <italic>Drosophila</italic> member of the conserved FHOD family of formin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schonichen and Geyer, 2010</xref>), as a major contributor to thin-filament array assembly and growth. An important aspect of Fhos involvement is its critical role in radial growth of the arrays, by mediating incorporation of new peripheral filaments to the nascent core structure. The elongation of thin filament arrays, shown to occur primarily from their pointed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler, 2001</xref>), is mediated by the WH2-domain actin regulator Sals protein. While the combined activities of Fhos and Sals can account for most aspects of thin-filament array growth and maturation during pupal stages, other elements are likely involved in additional processes that shape and maintain the arrays, such as continuous monomer exchange at the barbed-ends.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distinct modes of thin-filament array assembly and growth</title><p>Assembly of sarcomeric thin-filament arrays has been traditionally studied by monitoring global changes in sarcomere structure in fixed samples of muscle tissue. However, in order to decipher the underlying regulatory mechanisms and uncover the machineries that drive this process, it is essential to monitor the dynamic patterns of actin monomer incorporation into the growing sarcomere. We therefore followed the incorporation of GFP-tagged actin monomers into IFM sarcomeres, throughout the pupal stages of development, as a means of revealing the assembly and maturation of IFM sarcomeric thin-filament arrays in developing flies. Inducible UAS-based GFP-actin transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verkhusha et al., 1999</xref>) have proven to be reliable tools and have been used extensively to study microfilament localization and dynamics during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fulga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacinto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaltschmidt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perkins and Tanentzapf, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schottenfeld-Roames and Ghabrial, 2012</xref>).

We therefore employed temporally-restricted induction protocols of UAS-GFP-actin88F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roper et al., 2005</xref>), and compared the resulting GFP patterns to the outlines of phalloidin-stained sarcomeres, as a primary tool for following the dynamics of IFM thin-filament array development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16540.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Four distinct modes of GFP-actin monomer incorporation contribute to formation of IFM thin-filament arrays.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of IFM development intervals used for unrestricted and temporally restricted expression of GFP-actin88F (<bold>B–E”</bold>) or GFP-<italic>actin5C</italic> (<bold>G–I</bold>).

The normal size and appearance of the IFM sarcomeres indicates that the GFP-tagged actin does not block or interfere with the structuring and organization of the thin filament arrays throughout the process, and the overlap between the phalloidin and GFP-actin patterns demonstrates the reliability of this tool for monitoring thin-filament array assembly.</p><p>We now attempted to break down into stages the processes of IFM thin-filament array organization and growth, by restricting actin-GFP expression to defined 'time windows' during pupal development. Temporal control of expression was achieved by using the general muscle driver <italic>mef2</italic>-GAL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ranganayakulu et al., 1996</xref>) in combination with the GAL80<sup>ts</sup><italic>/</italic>TARGET system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>). While the timing of induction of GFP-actin is readily controlled using this system, effective 'chase' is not possible due to the stability of the GFP-actin monomers. We first induced expression of GFP-actin88F at the onset of pupariation, and examined the nascent IFMs at 30 hr APF (after puparium formation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C”</xref>). Individual myofibrils are already apparent at this early stage, displaying a nearly homogeneous distribution of microfilaments and an irregular pattern of nascent Z-disc structures, revealed using the early Z-disc marker Zasp52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jani and Schock, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katzemich et al., 2013</xref>). A full correspondence between the GFP-actin88F and phalloidin patterns is observed, implying that the bulk of early IFM microfilaments are formed by extensive <italic>de novo</italic> filament polymerization.</p><p>A very different profile of actin monomer incorporation is observed when a 15 hr pulse of actin88F-GFP expression is provided at 30–45 hr APF, immediately following the initial period of extensive polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D”</xref>). The GFP-actin and microfilament distributions become markedly distinct from each other during this phase, in which the patterns of Zasp52, the M-line marker Obscurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>) and phalloidin are now indicative of repeating sarcomeric units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D”</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). In contrast to the early 'smeared' pattern that filled the myofibrils, actin-GFP is now restricted to discrete, isolated spots, the great majority of which (~80%) positioned at either or both the ends of the nascent arrays (insets <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,D’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>). This pattern suggests that the initial establishment and structuring of individual sarcomere scaffolds, achieved during this interim phase of pupal development, relies on organization of the existing microfilaments, produced earlier (between 0–30 hr APF). Utilization of newly produced monomers during this interim phase of assembly is limited, and primarily involves 'patchy' incorporation along and (mostly) at the ends of nascent thin-filament arrays, thereby contributing to the generation of uniformly-sized sarcomeres.</p><p>A subsequent pulse, between 50 and 90 hr APF, revealed yet a third pattern of actin incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E”</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–H”</xref>). During this (final) phase of pupal development, sarcomere units grow noticeably in both length and width, and the characteristic striated pattern of alternating Z-discs and filament-free H zones becomes clearly evident. Newly added actin is observed to form a distinct 'frame' that surrounds a dark rectangular core (insets <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and E’</xref>). The core presumably corresponds to the initial thin-filament array assembled during earlier phases. Conversely, the frame-like structure is likely composed of two separate contributions of newly synthesized actin to the nascent core array: extension of the initial fibers at their 'pointed' (M-line associated) ends, and addition of complete new fibers at the circumference of the sarcomere. This picture coincides well with previous studies of global IFM sarcomere growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reedy and Beall, 1993</xref>). Subdividing this relatively large interval further, by initiating GFP-actin88F production at 60 hrs APF, generated similarly shaped 'frames' of monomer incorporation, but of smaller size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H–J</xref>). These observations demonstrate that both aspects of actin incorporation- pointed end growth and peripheral thickening- continue throughout the entire period. Monitoring of actin monomer incorporation patterns reveals therefore a dynamic, multi-faceted timeline of IFM thin-filament array assembly during pupal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>An additional, prominent feature of the GFP-actin pattern following the 50–90 hr APF pulse was a dark stripe overlying the entire Z-disc (insets <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E’</xref>), implying that actin88F-GFP was not incorporated at this position, in neither the core array nor in newly added filaments at the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,E’</xref>’). This observation suggests that elongation and thickening of the array during the final 50–90 hr APF interval are accompanied by a third mode of monomer incorporation, at the barbed end of the arrays. Absence of GFP-actin88F incorporation at the Z-disc was previously noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roper et al (2005)</xref>, who also demonstrated preferential localization of other GFP-actin isoforms at this site, implying a specific, possibly steric hindrance of GFP-actin88F incorporation. We therefore chose to use the GFP-tagged version of actin5C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roper et al., 2005</xref>), a ubiquitous isoform, as a tool for monitoring monomer incorporation dynamics at barbed ends of the thin-filament array. Expression of GFP-actin5C during the 40–90 hr APF time-window resulted in a nearly complementary incorporation profile to the one generated by actin88F-GFP: a prominent stripe of GFP-actin adjacent to the Z-disc and relatively limited incorporation in the peripheral actin strands and pointed ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Initiation of the GFP-actin5C pulse at different times within this 50 hr interval, generated a thin bright incorporation stripe of constant width adjacent to the Z-disc in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>). This result implies continuous exchange and turnover of actin, rather than actual growth at the barbed ends of the arrays, and is consistent with the notion that lateral growth of array filaments occurs primarily at their pointed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Littlefield et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Molnar et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The correspondence between the regular length of the sarcomeres and the size of the actin monomers can provide a rough estimate of the number of actin monomers that build the entire structure and the proportion undergoing turnover. In a mature sarcomere, the length of thin-filament actin fibers (as measured from the Z-disc to the H-zone) is ~1.70 µm. It is difficult to accurately measure the width of the domain of dynamic actin-monomer exchange due to the limitations of light microscopy resolution, but it is roughly 0.15–0.3 µm on each side of the Z-disc. Given an estimated actin subunit size of 2.7 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sept et al., 1999</xref>), we can say that a complete thin filament is comprised of ~650 monomers, whereas the zone of continuous exchange at the Z-disc encompasses 50–100 monomers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The formin protein Fhos is a major mediator of sarcomeric thin-filament array assembly and growth</title><p>To identify actin regulators that are involved in the different phases of IFM thin-filament array organization and growth, we focused on members of the formin protein family, which are major mediators of nucleation and elongation of linear microfilament arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>).

These observations raised the possibility that the larger isoforms, which have not been extensively studied, provide Fhos activities necessary for IFM sarcomere formation.</p><p>To address this issue directly, we utilized a transgenic RNAi construct specifically targeting the large 5’ coding exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Expression of this RNAi construct in muscle cells, which should eliminate only the long isoforms in this tissue, led to a strong disruption of sarcomere organization, closely resembling null mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,E’</xref>; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schnorrer et al., 2010</xref>]). Furthermore, we observed similar deleterious effects on the IFM organization in flies hemizygous for MI04231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), a MiMIC insertion allele that is predicted to specifically disrupt the long Fhos isoforms and leave the short isoforms intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results lead us to conclude that the long N-terminal protein domain is critical for IFM function of Fhos.</p><p>To determine whether the long Fhos isoforms are sufficient, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to generate small deletions in the exon encoding the N-terminal region of the short Fhos isoforms. One of these, <italic>Fhos</italic><sup>ΔG99</sup>, results in a single nucleotide deletion, generating a translational frameshift and a predicted termination of translation of the short Fhos isoform after only 58 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). <italic>Fhos</italic><sup>ΔG99</sup> hemizygous flies, which do not express functional short Fhos isoforms, are fully viable and fertile, and do not exhibit any obvious morphological defects. Importantly, the IFMs of these flies display normal myofibril and sarcomere organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These observations imply that the long Fhos isoforms are sufficient for proper IFM myogenesis, and furthermore, that they can provide most, if not all, functional requirements for <italic>Fhos</italic>.</p><p>Identifiable protein domains are not found within the 1198 residue long protein sequence encoded by the large 5’ exon, which raised the possibility that this extension to the canonical FHOD-like formin provides a localization cue, rather than an additional functional moiety. To pursue this notion, we set out to determine the localization patterns of the different Fhos isoforms. We first made use of a MiMIC transposable element insertion in the <italic>Fhos</italic> gene locus (MI09324) and the RMCE technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Venken et al., 2011</xref>) to generate a GFP 'protein trap' (Fhos-GFP), so that all isoforms of endogenous Fhos would also harbor a GFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Monitoring the Fhos-GFP signal at 45 hr APF revealed an initial diffuse localization to myofibrils, with some enrichment over nascent sarcomeric units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I’</xref>). At later stages (65 hr APF), the localization of Fhos refines to discrete stripes overlying the barbed and pointed ends of the microfilament arrays within the sarcomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–J’’</xref>), a pattern that persists throughout pupal stages and is still observed in young adult flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–A”’</xref>). Staining with an antibody we raised to the Fhos C-terminal domains shared by all isoforms of the protein, displayed a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–A”’</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the localization patterns of representative tagged versions of the short and long isoforms of Fhos, following their expression in IFMs. EGFP-Fhos-PA, representing the shorter isoform, was found to localize exclusively to the vicinity of sarcomere M-lines, corresponding to the pointed-ends of the thin-filament arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–K”</xref>). This observation raised the possibility that the short isoform is not functional on its own in IFMs due to its restricted localization pattern, which does not include the Z-disc associated barbed-ends of the thin-filament arrays. Notably, instances of ectopic localization of EGFP-Fhos-PA to Z-discs, which were sporadically observed when this construct was over-expressed in a null <italic>Fhos</italic> mutant background, were associated with markedly improved organization of the affected sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–B”’</xref>). This observation supports the notion that localization of Fhos to the Z-disc region is critical for its function in the growing sarcomere.</p><p>To monitor localization of the long Fhos isoform, we generated an HA-tagged version of Fhos-PH, which contains 410 residues of the novel N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Remarkably, HA-Fhos-PH was found to localize exclusively to the Z-disc region of IFM sarcomeres following expression via <italic>mef2</italic>-GAL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L–L”</xref>), in complementary fashion to EGFP-Fhos-PA. Taken together with the genetic analysis, which identified the long isoform as the functional Fhos variant in IFMs, we conclude that localization of Fhos to the Z-disc/array barbed-end region, mediated by the long, novel N-terminal domain, is critical for its sarcomeric function. Interestingly, despite the localization of the HA-Fhos-PH construct to the Z-disc region, it only partially rescued the sarcomere organization defects of <italic>Fhos</italic> null flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–C”’</xref>). In addition, we observe that the long Fhos isoforms, which provide full sarcomeric functionality, localize to both the Z-disc and M-line regions in <italic>Fhos</italic><sup>ΔG99</sup> hemizygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, while Z-disc localization of Fhos is an essential requirement for proper sarcomere assembly, we cannot rule out that Fhos performs functional roles at additional sites within maturing IFM sarcomeres.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The roles of Fhos in actin incorporation into thin-filament arrays</title><p>Having established that Fhos is a major contributor to IFM sarcomere organization, we now sought to elucidate its specific roles, by monitoring actin monomer incorporation patterns in the absence of Fhos function. Towards this end, we examined IFMs from <italic>Fhos</italic> knockdown pupae, following a restricted expression of GFP-actin88F during early (0–30 hr APF), interim (30–60 hr APF) and late (60–90 hr APF) phases of pupal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

While wildtype IFMs display an irregular 'patchy' pattern of incorporation spread out over the nascent sarcomeric arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>), <italic>Fhos</italic> knockdown IFMs exhibited a repetitive, undulating pattern, with peaks of incorporation centered at the pointed-ends of the arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). Fhos therefore appears to mediate monomer incorporation into filament patches, but is not involved in the emerging process of array elongation from pointed ends. This feature of <italic>Fhos</italic> knockdown IFMs persists during the final phase of pupal development, when wildtype sarcomeres display a frame-like pattern of incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–J</xref>). While such 50–90 hr old <italic>Fhos</italic> knockdown IFMs retain pointed-end incorporation, they appear to be thinner and lack the circumferential accumulation of incorporated GFP-actin88F, which represents radial growth of the arrays through addition of peripheral microfilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J</xref>), implying a requirement for Fhos in the array 'thickening' process. Finally, a GFP-actin5C incorporation band of normal width was readily detected adjacent to sarcomere Z-discs in <italic>Fhos</italic> knockdown IFMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–M</xref>), implying that actin monomer exchange at barbed ends of the arrays is Fhos independent.</p><p>Analysis of actin monomer incorporation patterns thus provides a higher resolution and reveals specific roles for Fhos in mediating thin-filament array assembly and growth. These include the organization of microfilaments into nascent structures, shaping sarcomeres into uniformly sized and regularly-spaced units and, finally, radial growth of the arrays via peripheral thickening. On the other hand, the synthesis of the initial pool of microfilaments, array elongation from pointed ends and actin exchange at the Z-disc do not require Fhos, and thus rely on the activity of other actin regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sals is required for thin filament elongation from the pointed ends of the array</title><p>As the incorporation data suggests that filament extension from the pointed-ends of the arrays does not require Fhos, we sought to identify alternative elements that may mediate this key aspect of sarcomere growth.

However, the barbed-end localization and associated activities of Fhos appear to be essential for the maturation of nascent arrays, implying a multi-faceted involvement of this formin in sarcomere formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Formation of the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> IFMs during pupariation provides an established model system to study formation of skeletal muscles, and in particular the generation of the repeated sarcomere structure, the core functional unit underlying muscle contractility. The IFM system possesses several key features that make it amenable for detailed analysis. These include an extended developmental time window of ~60 hr, the availability of genetic methods for investigation (e.g., RNAi-based knockdown) and the highly ordered and repetitive organization of sarcomeric units within IFM myofibrils, which allows for the detection and analysis of both major and subtle alterations and defects. Our study focused on the actin based thin-filament array component of sarcomeres. Towards this end, we utilized an additional, highly useful feature of the IFM system: the capacity to monitor the incorporation pattern of new actin monomers at discrete stages of the process, using transgenic GFP-actin constructs whose expression can be readily manipulated. The analyses performed using the various approaches and tools available for the study of the IFMs allow us to chart the principles, timeline and molecular basis for assembly, organization and maturation of thin-filament arrays within this model of sarcomerogenesis.</p><p>While it is likely that regulators of linear actin belonging to the formin family play a central role in the formation and maintenance of actin filament arrays in the sarcomere, redundancy among them appears to be commonplace in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosado et al., 2014</xref>), complicating the elucidation of distinct functional roles. Our detection of severe sarcomeric phenotypes following disruption of <italic>Fhos</italic> activity on its own, identifies Fhos as a key contributor to the processes governing IFM thin-filament array assembly, and sets the stage for studying the involvement of formins in this major aspect of microfilament organization, via utilization of genetic approaches. FHOD-family formins have been previously associated with sarcomere organization in cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wooten et al., 2013</xref>), but the roles these proteins play during skeletal myogenesis have been difficult to ascertain. The ability to dissect the program of IFM sarcomere formation and to disrupt the activity of Fhos to different extents and at distinct phases, provides a comprehensive view of the role of this formin-family protein in the process, and of skeletal muscle thin-filament array assembly at large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16540.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of IFM thin-filament array assembly and the roles of Fhos and Sals.</title><p>Four distinct stages of thin-filament array assembly and maturation are represented in correlation to pupal developmental stages.

The identity of actin nucleators and in particular formins involved in the extensive initial polymerization is not known, and it is certainly possible that several formins act redundantly, given our failure to disrupt this process by single formin knockdowns, including that of <italic>Fhos</italic>. An initial sign of internal myofiber organization is seen in the segregation of the abundant microfilaments produced during the early phase of pupal development, into elongated myofibrils that align in parallel to the fiber. We do not know the nature of the signal governing this alignment, but it is noteworthy that previous studies of the dynamic organization of sarcomeres in cultured muscle cells have indicated that microtubules which are aligned along the fiber may provide an initial cue for the recruitment and orientation of myosin heavy chain and possibly microfilaments as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pizon et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>2. The initial, widespread polymerization gives way to a more limited mode of incorporation, characterized by 'patches' of actin monomers that are added to a nascent microfilament array, suggesting that this period is devoted to proper structuring of the arrays within individual, uniformly-sized and regularly separated sarcomeric units. It is during this interim period that disruption of Fhos activity first leads to alteration of the monomer incorporation pattern, in what we interpret to be a telling fashion, as it retains an underlying, highly regular pattern of monomer incorporation at the pointed-ends of the thin filament arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref>). This observation constitutes a direct demonstration that IFM arrays elongate from their pointed-ends, contrary to the conventional barbed end-biased growth of microfilaments, and in keeping with previous findings based on studies of the pointed-end capping protein Tropomodulin in both IFMs and vertebrate cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Littlefield et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, our investigation identifies the WH2-domain protein Sals as a major mediator of the pointed-end growth of IFM thin-filament arrays, similar to its function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval muscle sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, Leiomodin acts to mediate pointed-end elongation in vertebrate cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chereau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsukada et al., 2010</xref>), implying a conserved function for WH2-domain actin regulators in sarcomerogenesis.</p><p>Interfering with Fhos activity results in severe impairment of myofibril and sarcomere organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), raising the question of how to reconcile the strong mutant phenotypes with the limited degree of Fhos-dependent actin incorporation and array growth during the early and interim periods of pupal development. We suggest that, rather than participating directly in the process of actin polymerization, Fhos plays a key organizational role during this period, which leads to the initial structuring of thin-filament arrays, using microfilaments generated by other formins and actin regulators. FHOD-family formins are considered to be poor microfilament nucleators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schonichen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>), and are thought to act via alternative modes- such as microfilament bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kutscheidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schonichen et al., 2013</xref>)- to provide shape and structure to microfilament arrays. Our analysis is consistent with this notion, as we have demonstrated that FhosI966A, a Fhos variant presumably lacking barbed end associated activities, supports formation of small but properly organized sarcomeres, similar to the sarcomeres normally formed during the early and interim stages of pupal development. We suggest therefore, that Fhos plays a critical early role, coupling organization of pre-existing filaments into ordered arrays, with a secondary but important capacity to coordinate array size and structure through 'patchy' monomer incorporation.</p><p>3. Once the rudimentary sarcomere 'core' is assembled and defined Z-discs with fixed spacing are established, further extension and addition of actin filaments is dictated by the initial organization of the sarcomere. It is at this stage that Fhos assumes a striated localization pattern corresponding to thin-filament array ends, and where localization to the barbed end region becomes critical for Fhos function. We identified three different modes of actin incorporation which contribute to the nascent sarcomere maturation during the later stages of pupal development:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><underline>Elongation</underline>. Thin-filament arrays continue to extend laterally. Growth occurs from the pointed-ends and is mediated primarily by Sals. On the other hand, no evidence for extension at the barbed ends is evident from actin-GFP incorporation. We suggest that the reduced lateral size of arrays observed following late-stage <italic>Fhos</italic> knockdown may arise from the compromised protection of the barbed ends immediately adjacent to the Z-disc.</p></list-item><list-item><p><underline>Radial 'thickening'</underline>. The sarcomeres grow radially due to the circumferential addition of actin filaments at their periphery. The added filaments are predominantly synthesized at this later stage, since they are readily labeled by monomeric actin produced only at that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,E’</xref>). Radial growth requires Fhos, and therefore constitutes a second major contribution of this formin to thin-filament array assembly. Fhos may contribute to radial thickening by bundling and recruiting complete filaments to the periphery of the array core. The reliance on localization to the vicinity of the Z-discs and the arrest in growth of FhosI966A sarcomeres prior to radial thickening strongly imply that this activity depends on association of Fhos with the barbed ends of the thin-filament arrays.</p></list-item><list-item><p><underline>Barbed-end turnover</underline>. An unexpected finding was the identification of rapid actin turnover that is highly restricted to the barbed ends of the thin-filament arrays. The barbed-end turnover persists throughout the late phase of pupariation, and does not contribute to filament elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>). Interestingly, barbed-end turnover could be detected with the GFP-tagged form of the ubiquitous actin isoform actin5C, but not with the IFM-specific isoform GFP-actin88F. This may reflect a structural constraint that underlies the use of distinct actin isoforms for different aspects of array growth and maintenance.</p></list-item></list><p>The contribution of barbed-end turnover to thin-filament array organization is not readily apparent. Turnover may be part of a mechanism that maintains the filament integrity by a continuous process of elongation and disassembly within the dynamic environment of the maturing Z-disc. Turnover does not require Fhos, and its molecular basis is currently unknown. It will be interesting to examine if a similar process is operating in adult muscles, to maintain their integrity in the face of extensive contraction activity during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perkins and Tanentzapf, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis of IFM sarcomeres implies that the assembly of the highly structured thin-filament array is an elaborate, stepwise process involving diverse aspects and machineries of microfilament nucleation, growth and organization. The formin protein Fhos plays a central role, contributing to array assembly at several stages of the process. Fhos acts initially to mediate the assembly of thin-filament arrays within discrete sarcomeric units. Fhos localization to the Z-disc region, an apparently conserved feature among FHOD-family formins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosado et al., 2014</xref>), becomes essential for function during the later stages of IFM development, where Fhos plays an essential role in sarcomere radial growth. Interestingly, it has been suggested that localization of FHOD3 to the Z-lines of murine cardiomyocytes is a regulated process, relying on phosphorylation of a short domain encoded by an alternatively-spliced exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iskratsch and Ehler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>), echoing the importance of Fhos Z-disc localization described here.</p><p>While this study has elucidated specific roles for a FHOD-family formin in a model system of skeletal muscle sarcomerogenesis, key issues remain open. The precise molecular nature of the microfilament-associated activities of Fhos, the mechanistic significance of its spatial localization patterns, regulation of its sarcomeric activities and their coordination with other functional elements of the actin-based cytoskeleton, all await further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics</title><p>GAL4 drivers included <italic>mef2</italic>-GAL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ranganayakulu et al., 1996</xref>) and <italic>act88F</italic>-GAL4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gajewski and Schulz, 2010</xref>], BDSC 38461).

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, indirect flight musculature (IFM) is a well-established skeletal muscle model system for studying assembly and maturation of thin-filament arrays. This study (Arkadi Shwartz et al.) described the role of Fhos, the single <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the FHOD sub-family of formins, as a primary mediator of indirect flight musculature (IFM) thin filament organization. The authors also identified several phases in the dynamic construction of thin-filament arrays: intensive microfilament synthesis -&gt; assembly of nascent arrays -&gt; elongation primarily from filament pointed-ends -&gt; radial growth of the arrays via recruitment of peripheral filaments -&gt; continuous barbed-end turnover.

Other formin proteins such as Diaphanous has already been studied in skeletal muscle model and this manuscript on Fhos, another formin, does not provide significant mechanistic insight into actin-based thin filaments formation in sarcomere. Given that Sals was previously known to contribute to pointed-send filament elongation, the data on Sals in this manuscript also lacks novelty.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting study of the role of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fhod subfamily formins (Fhos) in thin filament assembly into myofibrils in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscle (IFM). The IFM is a great model for sarcomere and thin filament assembly, and the authors take advantage of the fly genetics as well as the ability to express 'pulses' of GFP-actin during IFM myofibril assembly to evaluate the role of the Fhos proteins in actin incorporation/assembly at the barbed vs pointed ends of the thin filaments, as well as assembly of new peripheral thin filaments during stages of myofibril growth. This is an important area in which relatively few careful studies combining genetic deletion or knockdown with tests of actin incorporation have been undertaken. The key findings are that the long isoform of Fhos (Fhos-PH) is required for actin assembly at barbed ends and peripheral thin filament addition during myofibril growth, and that the nucleation activity of Fhos is not essential for this function. In addition, data is presented suggesting that the SALS protein is important for pointed end actin addition and thin filament elongation. The data is of high quality and interesting and reinforce and extend substantially the earlier findings from Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler (2001) that thin filament elongation during myofibril assembly takes place at their pointed but not barbed ends, and from Bai et al. (2007) that SALS is important for thin filament elongation at pointed ends. There are a few areas that require clarification and extension to solidify the conclusions.</p><p>1) The image of the thin myofibrils in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> showing partial rescue of the Fhos MI01421 with the GFP-Fhos-PA (short Fhos) is described as having &quot;only weak corrective influence on the disrupted microfilament organization and other sarcomeric defects in myofibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>)&quot;. However, to my eye this image shows thin myofibrils but with clearly demarcated and short sarcomeres, quite similar to the image of the myofibrils for the point mutant Fhos I966A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-A</xref>', which is described as having &quot;an organized structure of repeated sarcomeric units, with clear demarcation of the Z-discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-A</xref>'), suggesting an arrest in sarcomere growth following proper initial assembly and organization.&quot; Thus, it appears to me that the rescue with the short GFP-Fhos-PA should be reinterpreted, and the text rewritten. See next point also.</p><p>2) The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that the Fhos-i knockdown (which reduces long Fhos isoforms specifically) reduces GFP-actin incorporation at Z lines and at the myofibril periphery, but does not affect the GFP-actin incorporation at the M line. This is a very nice experiment. However, since the short Fhos-PA localizes to the M lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 H-H</xref>'), and the Fhos-PA does rescue the myofibril disruption phenotype to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), this could mean that the short Fhos-PA functions at M lines to promote GFP-actin incorporation. However, this was not tested. Depending on the results, the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> may need to be modified.</p><p>3) The GFP-actin (act88F) incorporation in the sals RNAi experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-E</xref>') is not convincingly qualitatively different from the control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-D</xref>'. I can see both M and Z line incorporation, just that some M lines appear fainter than others, and overall the image appears to have reduced/fuzzier GFP-actin incorporation. (Note that the shorter sarcomeres due to reduction of sals are convincing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and repeat the previous study from Bai et al.) However, I wonder whether the sals is actually affecting pointed end actin elongation directly. Do the authors have stronger data for the GFP-actin incorporation locations? Can the relative M and Z line incorporation be quantified by line scans to compare the WT and the knockdown?</p><p>4) Along these same lines, the study of Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler implied that Tmod reduces actin pointed end incorporation and thus prevents elongation. However, these authors never tested a Tmod knockdown or deletion, or actin incorporation. Can the authors perform a knockdown of fly Tmod in the IFM to determine whether this affects GFP-actin incorporation at the pointed end? This would fill in the picture, and strengthen the unique role(s) of the Fhos isoforms.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the overall thin/thick filament organization appears normal by TEM of cross sections in the small myofibrils that form in the Fhos I966A point mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, I noticed a few areas of discontinuity in the lattice (upper left of myofibril) in which there are missing or extra thin filament surrounding the thick filament. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, there is an impression that the M line is not perfectly straight and that H zone is not perfectly even, so that some thin filaments may be shorter and some longer. I wonder whether there may be some subtle thin filament length or organization defects. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, can higher magnification images of the GFP-actin88F for the 45 h incorporation be shown to help identify the location of the actin &quot;patches&quot;? It appears that they do not colocalize with the Z line marker, Zasp. Do they colocalize with the pointed end marker, Tmod? Similarly, in the FhosMI-GFP experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 F-F</xref>', where are the FhosMI-GFP patches? The colocalization with α-actinin is not shown at high magnification. (The regular sarcomeres at later times make it easier to figure out what is going on).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The study describes 3 stages of actin monomer incorporation during <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscle differentiation. Initial bulk polymerisation is followed by ordering into units, which are then elongated and widened to match the uniform sarcomere size. The formin FHOD is implicated in organising and thickening the sarcomere, which requires its long isoforms with N-terminal Z-disk localisation domain. Sals is required for pointed end elongation (as had been shown previously). In both these areas actin88F is incorporated, while at the barbed end, a different actin isoform, actin5c is being built in in a FHOD independent manner.</p><p>FHOD seems not to require its barbed-end association (and any associated nucleation, elongation and capping function) until about 60h APF as a conserved mutation I966A can still form organised sarcomeres. Thus the authors argue that FHOD might use its bundling activity during the early stages. However, such a bundling activity is neither shown for FHOD in the present study, nor in the two cited papers.</p><p>It is slightly puzzling why FHOD needs to localise to the barbed end, but doesn't need to actually bind to the barbed end. Any mechanistic explanations provided are speculative as no data as to the activity of the mutant or mechanistic action of FHOD or Sals itself are contained in the paper. Thus interpretations rest on the assumption that these would function as other formins. Interestingly, FHOD3, the closest mammalian homologue of FHOD inhibits barbed end elongation, rather than accelerating it (Taniguchi 2009) – a fact that seems not to be discussed in this study.</p><p>While the N-terminal extension of the longer FHOD isoforms seem to be of functional importance to organise sarcomeres and the longer isoforms localise specifically to the Z-disk, a causal relationship cannot be drawn, i.e. it is not clear that the localisation itself is required or that the localisation is sufficient to enable the canonical elements of FHOD to fully function. This would need to be tested with more subtle mutations that affect localisation (rather than the removal of 120kD!) and/or using means to bypass the requirement for the N-terminal domain by a more direct recruitment of the shorter FHOD isoforms to Z-disks. In the absence of such mechanistic experiments, the observations are difficult to interpret and some of the statements would need to be altered or stated as being purely speculative.</p><p>To my understanding, no data show that radial size increase occurs through recruitment of peripheral filaments – instead incorporation of actin monomers suggest their new synthesis. Also, the barbed end-binding activity of FHOD seems to be required for this step, whether nucleating or inhibitory.</p><p>Overall a beautifully illustrated descriptive story identifying temporal and spatial patterns of actin incorporation and formin activity. However, the authors have over-interpreted their findings and make mechanistic claims that are not substantiated by data in the study (or elsewhere).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The <italic>Drosophila</italic> formin Fhos is a primary mediator of sarcomeric thin-filament array assembly&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Your appeal has been reviewed by an additional peer reviewer, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor.

You already have the comments of reviewer# 1, 2 and 3, and below are the comments of reviewer #4</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>Arkadi Shwartz et al. present a study on <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscle actin assembly during the various stages of development and observe the incorporation of different actin isoforms (act88F, act5c) into specific locations of the sarcomere. The authors find that Fhos the single <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of the mammalian FHOD subfamily, which has a documented role in sarcomere assembly and/or maturation, is crucially required for IFM integrity. Knockdown and a previously described mutation lead to thin and randomly oriented myofibrils, with defects appearing after 50hs APF, suggesting an involvement at early stages of sarcomere formation. They further analyze the involvement of different isoforms as well as SALS in the regulation of actin assembly and find that the long isoform is targeted to the Z-disc, where it assembles and bundles the actin, while the short isoform is localized to the pointed ends and dispensable for myofibril formation. SALS, in contrast, as previously demonstrated (Bai et al., 2007) is needed to regulate the thin filament length at the pointed end. The article provides an unprecedented level of detail regarding the different stages of actin assembly during myofibrillogenesis and the involvement of FHOD proteins therein. There are however several points that need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The data presented regarding the unsuccessful rescue of the Fhos deletion phenotype by FHOS-PA is not entirely convincing. While there is an apparent lack of rescue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,A</xref>', the stronger overexpression of Fhos-PA results in clearly thicker and more organized sarcomeres in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, suggesting that the short isoform can, at least at high expression levels take over the function and even localize to the Z-disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,C</xref>'). The data from targeting the 5'coding exon provides further evidence for the involvement of the large isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 E,E</xref>'), however, the authors should perform rescue experiments with the PH isform as well, to show that it can fully restore the myofibril integrity.</p><p>2) Further, regarding the isoforms and the conclusions that the authors draw from their data:</p><p>a) The authors suggest that PA and PH are the main isoforms, but no data (qPCR or similar) is presented, or studies cited, to this regards.</p><p>b) Disregarding the expression levels, a rescue with the π isoform and localization of the π isoform should be tested as well to exclude major involvement of this isoform.</p><p>3) The authors state that the short isoform is inactive, due to its localization to the vicinity of the M-band (3H,H'). This is however not supported by the presented data since the authors find 1) addition of actin to M-Bands, and thickening of myofibrils at late stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>); 2) the authors argue, referencing the data from Schoenichen et al. for FHOD1, that Fhos has an important actin bundling activity, which requires filament side binding, however not necessary barbed end binding. 3) stage specific localization changes have been reported for FHOD3 as well, with early localization to the vicinity of the M-Band (Iskratsch et al., 2013). 4) the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-G</xref> demonstrates a patchy incorporation of actin at 60hrs, not only at the Z-disc, which is lost after knockdown of Fhos. This demonstrates that localization to the Z-disc is not necessarily the single determinant of actin assembly activity actin filament turnover could be contributing to differing localization, especially since it was shown in living zebrafish that YFP-actin is incorporated all along the I-Band(Sanger et al., 2009). The authors could test this by performing FRAP experiments to investigate Actin turnover at the Z-disc, around the M-Band and the periphery of the sarcomeres in presence or absence of the various isoforms.</p><p>4) Several of the images comparing the control and Fhos deletion/knock downs are difficult to compare due to varying quality, with fuzzier staining also present in the other channels (especially F-actin and zasp in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 H</xref> vs I and J vs K, and F-actin vs Obscurin <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 D</xref> vs E). The authors should provide better comparable images (or if not possible, discuss the reason for this difference). Also the authors should provide quantifications of the intensities (e.g. of the M and Z-band intensities normalized to the background).</p><p>5) The GFP-act88F localization around the M-bands is narrower in the sals-i, but still present. The authors should provide quantifications for the width (i.e. does this account for the difference in thin filament length) and test or at least discuss what other proteins could be responsible for the ongoing pointed end assembly in absence of sals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16540.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The organization of actin-based filaments is central to function of sarcomere, the basic functional units of muscle fibres.

Our study couples a detailed analysis of the dynamics of thin-filament array assembly, at high spatial and temporal resolution, with assignment of distinct functional roles to a single Formin sub-family (FHOD/Fhos). We are unaware of similar comprehensive studies, or of such clear demonstrations of sarcomeric Formin function, and believe that we have provided considerable novel insight, using state-of-the-art tools, to a fundamental and somewhat neglected aspect of skeletal muscle biology. Our analysis of Sals function complements the assignment of functional roles to Fhos, and generalizes the significance of this element to sarcomere formation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is an interesting study of the role of Drosophila Fhod subfamily formins (Fhos) in thin filament assembly into myofibrils in the Drosophila indirect flight muscle (IFM).

However, to my eye this image shows thin myofibrils but with clearly demarcated and short sarcomeres, quite similar to the image of the myofibrils for the point mutant Fhos I966A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-A</xref>', which is described as having &quot;an organized structure of repeated sarcomeric units, with clear demarcation of the Z-discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-A</xref>'), suggesting an arrest in sarcomere growth following proper initial assembly and organization.&quot; Thus, it appears to me that the rescue with the short GFP-Fhos-PA should be reinterpreted, and the text rewritten. See next point also.</italic> </p><p>These points are well taken, and we have now added new observations and have substantially revised our presentation of rescue and localization data, and our discussion of their significance. A key new experiment is specific disruption of the short Fhos isoforms (via CRISPR-based indels- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this approach we can now state with confidence that the short isoforms are dispensable and the long isoforms are sufficient for full sarcomeric function. The inability of the short forms to provide significant function when expressed at physiological levels is demonstrated both by the severe phenotypes resulting from specifically disrupting the long isoforms, and by the lack of rescue of null alleles by UAS-Fhos-PA, when driven by <italic>armadillo</italic>-GAL4. We now show this result in figure panels 3D-D’, as was our original intention. We fully agree with the reviewer that over-expression of the short form results in partial rescue- as we show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-B</xref>”), such rescue is likely the result of “ectopic” localization of the short form to the Z-disc, and, in fact, corresponds to our view that Z-disc localization is critical for Fhos function.</p><p><italic>2) The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that the Fhos-i knockdown (which reduces long Fhos isoforms specifically) reduces GFP-actin incorporation at Z lines and at the myofibril periphery, but does not affect the GFP-actin incorporation at the M line. This is a very nice experiment. However, since the short Fhos-PA localizes to the M lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 H-H</xref>'), and the Fhos-PA does rescue the myofibril disruption phenotype to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), this could mean that the short Fhos-PA functions at M lines to promote GFP-actin incorporation. However, this was not tested. Depending on the results, the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> may need to be modified.</italic> </p><p>The Fhos-i knockdown in this figure was based on an siRNA construct targeting ALL isoforms. In any case, we now find (upon specific elimination of the short forms) that the fully functional (endogenous) long isoforms localize to both the Z-disc and M-line regions, while Fhos-PH, an isoform that localizes strictly to the Z-disc and contains only part of the large N-terminal region, provides only partial rescue of null alleles. All this leads us to conclude that Fhos may well function at sites other than the Z-disc (where it is essential), including the M-line. While the nature of these non-Z disc roles is currently unknown, we have modified the text to reflect this notion.</p><p><italic>3) The GFP-actin (act88F) incorporation in the sals RNAi experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-E</xref>') is not convincingly qualitatively different from the control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-D</xref>'. I can see both M and Z line incorporation, just that some M lines appear fainter than others, and overall the image appears to have reduced/fuzzier GFP-actin incorporation. (Note that the shorter sarcomeres due to reduction of sals are convincing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and repeat the previous study from Bai et al.) However, I wonder whether the sals is actually affecting pointed end actin elongation directly. Do the authors have stronger data for the GFP-actin incorporation locations? Can the relative M and Z line incorporation be quantified by line scans to compare the WT and the knockdown?</italic> </p><p>We now use fluorescence intensity measurements to provide quantification of both the sarcomere shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and reduced M/Z incorporation ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) phenotypes associated with <italic>sals</italic> knockdown.</p><p><italic>4) Along these same lines, the study of Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler implied that Tmod reduces actin pointed end incorporation and thus prevents elongation. However, these authors never tested a Tmod knockdown or deletion, or actin incorporation. Can the authors perform a knockdown of fly Tmod in the IFM to determine whether this affects GFP-actin incorporation at the pointed end? This would fill in the picture, and strengthen the unique role(s) of the Fhos isoforms.</italic> </p><p>Tmod is indeed a logical candidate for an element involved in pointed end elongation. As recommended by the reviewer, we assessed and analyzed the effects of knockdown in similar fashion to the study of <italic>sals</italic>. In general the <italic>tmod</italic> knockdown phenotypes are quite mild, and possibly indicate an early role for Tmod in thin-filament array assembly. The relevant observations are shown in Figure S5.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the overall thin/thick filament organization appears normal by TEM of cross sections in the small myofibrils that form in the Fhos I966A point mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, I noticed a few areas of discontinuity in the lattice (upper left of myofibril) in which there are missing or extra thin filament surrounding the thick filament. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, there is an impression that the M line is not perfectly straight and that H zone is not perfectly even, so that some thin filaments may be shorter and some longer. I wonder whether there may be some subtle thin filament length or organization defects. Can the authors comment on this?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these imperfections in the Fhos I966A mutant arrays. However, given that these were obtained from 1 day old adult flies, following several days of IFM growth arrest, they may well be the result of secondary effects. We therefore prefer not to speculate about their significance, and to limit our interpretation to the general resemblance they bear to intermediate stage IFMs.</p><p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, can higher magnification images of the GFP-actin88F for the 45 h incorporation be shown to help identify the location of the actin &quot;patches&quot;? It appears that they do not colocalize with the Z line marker, Zasp. Do they colocalize with the pointed end marker, Tmod? Similarly, in the FhosMI-GFP experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 F-F</xref>', where are the FhosMI-GFP patches? The colocalization with α-actinin is not shown at high magnification. (The regular sarcomeres at later times make it easier to figure out what is going on).</italic> </p><p>Following these comments, we have extended our analysis of the actin “patches”, by adding magnified panels and fluorescence intensity profiles for 45 hr IFMs stained for GFP-actin, phalloidin and the Z-disc and M-like markers Zasp and Obscurin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-E</xref>).

In both these areas actin88F is incorporated, while at the barbed end, a different actin isoform, actin5c is being built in in a FHOD independent manner.</italic> </p><p><italic>FHOD seems not to require its barbed-end association (and any associated nucleation, elongation and capping function) until about 60h APF as a conserved mutation I966A can still form organised sarcomeres. Thus the authors argue that FHOD might use its bundling activity during the early stages. However, such a bundling activity is neither shown for FHOD in the present study, nor in the two cited papers.</italic></p><p>We feel that our study covers considerable ground in breaking down the process of thin-filament array assembly into a discrete series of continuous events, some of which overlap temporally, and in assigning functional roles to several key elements that mediate these processes. Admittedly, we do not provide biochemical data that tests the actin-associated activities of Fhos (not for lack of trying- Fhos expression at useful levels has proven to be very difficult). However, we feel compelled to use the ample descriptive and genetic data provided to speculate on molecular mechanisms, bearing in mind established molecular capacities of the proteins involved. That said, we respect the reviewer’s expert assessment that some of the statements come across as over-interpretation of the data, and have tried to reorganize the text and “tone down” the language (in the main text and the relevant mention in the abstract) accordingly.</p><p>With regard to FHOD formins acting as microfilament bundling proteins- here we feel fully justified in building upon this notion, which was clearly demonstrated by Schonichen et al. (JCS 2013) using a number of assays, and is treated as an established capacity of FHOD proteins in various papers including the study from Kutscheidt et al. (NCB 2014) which we cite. However, we agree that initial mention of this specific activity was granted excessive prominence, and has now been moved from the Results section to the Discussion. Further mention of a bundling capacity and its significance are now phrased in a less dogmatic fashion.</p><p><italic>It is slightly puzzling why FHOD needs to localise to the barbed end, but doesn't need to actually bind to the barbed end. Any mechanistic explanations provided are speculative as no data as to the activity of the mutant or mechanistic action of FHOD or Sals itself are contained in the paper. Thus interpretations rest on the assumption that these would function as other formins. Interestingly, FHOD3, the closest mammalian homologue of FHOD inhibits barbed end elongation, rather than accelerating it (Taniguchi 2009) – a fact that seems not to be discussed in this study.</italic> </p><p>We fully agree that the critical nature of Fhos localization to the Z-disc region does not readily correspond with its presumed molecular capacities. As brought up in the Discussion, Z-disc region localization appears to be a general feature of FHOD proteins in striated muscle, and resolving this matter is a priority for future studies on sarcomeric FHOD/Fhos function. Clearly, determination of the microfilament-regulating properties of Fhos should be a central aspect of such investigations. Our data only allows us to speculate regarding possible mechanisms, but we feel compelled to do so. Again, we have revised the tone of our discussion to properly reflect its speculative nature. The Taniguchi et al. study is now cited as a reference for the “poor nucleation” capacity of FHOD-family proteins.</p><p><italic>While the N-terminal extension of the longer FHOD isoforms seem to be of functional importance to organise sarcomeres and the longer isoforms localise specifically to the Z-disk, a causal relationship cannot be drawn, i.e. it is not clear that the localisation itself is required or that the localisation is sufficient to enable the canonical elements of FHOD to fully function. This would need to be tested with more subtle mutations that affect localisation (rather than the removal of 120kD!) and/or using means to bypass the requirement for the N-terminal domain by a more direct recruitment of the shorter FHOD isoforms to Z-disks. In the absence of such mechanistic experiments, the observations are difficult to interpret and some of the statements would need to be altered or stated as being purely speculative.</italic> </p><p>We think that we have provided a considerable body of data supporting the notion that Z-disk localization is critical nature:</p><p>a) The active long isoforms- which are absolutely necessary for sarcomeric Fhos fuction- localize to this site;</p><p>b) The short forms do not localize there under physiological conditions, and completely fail to provide function (although they are fully sufficient for Fhos fuction in all other tissues);</p><p>c) Partial rescue by the short form is provided by its ectopic localization to the Z-disc region, under circumstances of over-expression.</p><p>We believe that this set of results justifies our conclusions regarding the significance of Z-disc localization. We agree that identification and manipulation of a minimal localization sequence within the long isoform is warranted, and would serve as an important step in refining and understanding the nature of Fhos localization within the sarcomere, but this must be left to future studies.</p><p><italic>To my understanding, no data show that radial size increase occurs through recruitment of peripheral filaments – instead incorporation of actin monomers suggest their new synthesis. Also, the barbed end-binding activity of FHOD seems to be required for this step, whether nucleating or inhibitory.</italic> </p><p>We are in agreement with the reviewer on this point- namely, that newly-synthesized microfilaments constitute a major portion (all?) of the filaments added to the periphery of the sarcomere “core”, and stated as such in the Discussion text. We agree and similarly state that barbed-end binding by Fhos is required for its involvement in radial growth of the array. The question we try to grapple with is why a FHOD-type formin, unlikely to be responsible for synthesis, is still essential for radial growth. Bundling is suggested as a possible mechanism.</p><p><italic>Overall a beautifully illustrated descriptive story identifying temporal and spatial patterns of actin incorporation and formin activity. However, the authors have over-interpreted their findings and make mechanistic claims that are not substantiated by data in the study (or elsewhere).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer both for the positive assessment of our experimental work and for pointing out the shortcomings of our interpretation, which we have tried to revise accordingly.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The additional referee has kindly provided a detailed critique within a few days. While this referee sees the value of your description of actin polymerization and thin filament assembly in Drosophila IFM, the referee has raised a number of points, all of which seem very reasonable and geared towards tightening controls and improving imaging quality.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p><italic>Major points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The data presented regarding the unsuccessful rescue of the Fhos deletion phenotype by FHOS-PA is not entirely convincing. While there is an apparent lack of rescue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3 supplement 1A,A</xref>', the stronger overexpression of Fhos-PA results in clearly thicker and more organized sarcomeres in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, suggesting that the short isoform can, at least at high expression levels take over the function and even localize to the Z-disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,C</xref>'). The data from targeting the 5'coding exon provides further evidence for the involvement of the large isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 E,E</xref>'), however, the authors should perform rescue experiments with the PH isform as well, to show that it can fully restore the myofibril integrity.</italic> </p><p>These are all good points, some of which were raised by Reviewer #2 as well (please also see our answers there). With regard to the function of the short isoform- we agree, and now better present the data, which we believe to show that rescue by the short forms is possible, but requires localization to the Z-disc. As for the rescuing capacity of the long forms- the CRISPR-based mutation we have now generated, specifically disrupting the short forms, demonstrates that the long forms are both necessary (as shown before) and sufficient. Rescue by the PH form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-C</xref>’’’) is partial, but while this construct localizes strictly to the Z-disc region, rescue by the endogenous long isoforms is associated with localization to both the Z-disc and M-line regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We conclude and now state that while Z-disc localization is critical, M-line localization may be of functional importance as well.</p><p><italic>2) Further, regarding the isoforms and the conclusions that the authors draw from their data:</italic></p><p><italic>a) The authors suggest that PA and PH are the main isoforms, but no data (qPCR or similar) is presented, or studies cited, to this regards.</italic> </p><p>The use of the term “main” is in error- it has been changed to “representative”, and we thank the reviewer for pointing it out. Form PA is identical in coding sequence to most other short isoforms, and was used by Bogdan and colleagues in their study of Fhos function, to which we refer throughout. PH was used as a proxy for the long forms, since a corresponding cDNA was available to generate reagents.</p><p> <italic>b) Disregarding the expression levels, a rescue with the π isoform and localization of the π isoform should be tested as well to exclude major involvement of this isoform.</italic> </p><p>Our new results now suggest, in fact, that the longer forms (PI and PJ) are the ones to provide full functionality, but unfortunately, we were not successful in attempts to generate matching constructs.</p><p><italic>3) The authors state that the short isoform is inactive, due to its localization to the vicinity of the M-band (3H,H'). This is however not supported by the presented data since the authors find 1) addition of actin to M-Bands, and thickening of myofibrils at late stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>); 2) the authors argue, referencing the data from Schoenichen et al. for FHOD1, that Fhos has an important actin bundling activity, which requires filament side binding, however not necessary barbed end binding. 3) stage specific localization changes have been reported for FHOD3 as well, with early localization to the vicinity of the M-Band (Iskratsch et al., 2013). 4) the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-G</xref> demonstrates a patchy incorporation of actin at 60hr, not only at the Z-disc, which is lost after knockdown of Fhos. This demonstrates that localization to the Z-disc is not necessarily the single determinant of actin assembly activity actin filament turnover could be contributing to differing localization, especially since it was shown in living zebrafish that YFP-actin is incorporated all along the I-Band(Sanger et al., 2009). The authors could test this by performing FRAP experiments to investigate Actin turnover at the Z-disc, around the M-Band and the periphery of the sarcomeres in presence or absence of the various isoforms.</italic> </p><p>As noted above, our genetic data now supports the notion that Z-disc/barbed-end associated function is not the entire story. While we do not have solid ideas regarding M-line function of Fhos (pointed-end elongation appears to be Fhos-independent), we stress this additional layer of functional complexity in the text.</p><p><italic>4) Several of the images comparing the control and Fhos deletion/knock downs are difficult to compare due to varying quality, with fuzzier staining also present in the other channels (especially F-actin and zasp in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 H</xref> vs I and J vs K, and F-actin vs Obscurin <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 D</xref> vs E). The authors should provide better comparable images (or if not possible, discuss the reason for this difference). Also the authors should provide quantifications of the intensities (e.g. of the M and Z-band intensities normalized to the background).</italic> </p><p>We have now improved data presentation according to the reviewer’s comments:</p><p>a) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>’, I’ and J we quantified the distribution of actin intensity across the arrays, demonstrating enhanced wildtype incorporation at the periphery, which is gone following <italic>Fhos</italic> knockdown.</p><p>b) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref> we quantified the width of the incorporation band at the Z-disc, an analysis that demonstrates that this turnover is Fhos independent</p><p>In this context we wish to note that- as the reviewer observed- the GFP incorporation signal is generally “fuzzier” reviewer upon <italic>fhos</italic> knockdown, possibly due to accumulation of excess free GFP-tagged actin monomers in the array vicinity.</p><p><italic>5) The GFP-act88F localization around the M-bands is narrower in the sals-i, but still present. The authors should provide quantifications for the width (i.e. does this account for the difference in thin filament length) and test or at least discuss what other proteins could be responsible for the ongoing pointed end assembly in absence of sals.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we have added quantifications in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, and have examined the possible contribution of Tropomodulin to pointed end elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).
