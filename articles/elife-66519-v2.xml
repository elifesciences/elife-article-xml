However, direct mechanisms linking OPA1 to brown adipose tissue (BAT) physiology are incompletely understood. We utilized a mouse model of selective OPA1 deletion in BAT (OPA1 BAT KO) to investigate the role of OPA1 in thermogenesis. OPA1 is required for cold-induced activation of thermogenic genes in BAT. Unexpectedly, OPA1 deficiency induced fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a BATokine in an activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-dependent manner. BAT-derived FGF21 mediates an adaptive response by inducing browning of white adipose tissue, increasing resting metabolic rates, and improving thermoregulation. However, mechanisms independent of FGF21, but dependent on ATF4 induction, promote resistance to diet-induced obesity in OPA1 BAT KO mice. These findings uncover a homeostatic mechanism of BAT-mediated metabolic protection governed in part by an ATF4-FGF21 axis, which is activated independently of BAT thermogenic function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brown adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>thermogenesis</kwd><kwd>optic atrophy 1</kwd><kwd>fibroblast growth factor 21</kwd><kwd>activating transcription factor 4</kwd><kwd>browning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL127764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abel</surname><given-names>E Dale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL112413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abel</surname><given-names>E Dale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20SFRN35120123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abel</surname><given-names>E Dale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15SDG25710438</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>Renata O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK125405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>Renata O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DK112751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bjorkman</surname><given-names>Sarah Hartwick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R25GM116686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>García-Peña</surname><given-names>Luis Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lack of OPA1 in BAT impairs its thermogenic activation and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, while improving systemic metabolism and thermoregulation via ATF4-FGF21-dependent and -independent mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease, has increased dramatically in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo-Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hruby et al., 2015</xref>). Most currently available pharmacological approaches to combat obesity act by reducing caloric intake or impairing fat absorption. However, effective and safe therapies to increase energy expenditure are lacking. The discovery of active brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans has incited interest in exploring BAT activation as a potential strategy for increasing energy expenditure to mitigate obesity and its complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cypess et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruiz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finlin et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, BAT has been increasingly recognized as a secretory organ, promoting the release of endocrine factors, or BATokines, that may regulate systemic metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Villarroya et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, increased understanding of mechanisms regulating BAT thermogenesis and its secretory function could identify new therapeutic strategies for treating obesity and its comorbidities.</p><p>Recent studies demonstrated a critical role of mitochondrial dynamics for thermogenic activation of BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wikstrom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pisani et al., 2018</xref>). Mitochondrial dynamics describes the process by which mitochondria undergo repeated cycles of fusion and fission. It is mediated by several proteins, including the outer mitochondria membrane fusion proteins mitofusins 1 and 2 (Mfn1 and Mfn2), the inner mitochondrial membrane fusion protein optic atrophy 1 (Opa1), and the fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dorn, 2019</xref>). Norepinephrine treatment induces complete and rapid mitochondrial fragmentation in cultured brown adipocytes through protein kinase A (PKA)‐dependent Drp1 phosphorylation, which increases fatty acid oxidation and amplifies thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wikstrom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pisani et al., 2018</xref>). Mfn2 is also required for BAT thermogenesis, with its absence rendering mice cold-intolerant, but surprisingly resistant to diet-induced insulin resistance (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahdaviani et al., 2017</xref>). An earlier study demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of OPA1 in brown adipocytes resulted in a modest, but significant, reduction in palmitate oxidation, suggesting a potential role for OPA1 in regulating thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Quirós et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, indirect evidence in mice lacking the ATP-independent metalloprotease OMA1, which plays an essential role in the proteolytic inactivation of OPA1, supports the notion that OPA1 regulation of fission is important for thermogenesis. Germline OMA1-deficient mice exhibit increased adiposity, decreased energy expenditure, and impaired thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Quirós et al., 2012</xref>). However, given the ubiquitous expression of OPA1 and OMA1, it is impossible to determine from this model the specific contribution of OPA1 to BAT physiology.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the requirement of OPA1 for BAT’s adaptation to thermogenic stimuli in vivo by generating mice with BAT-specific ablation of the <italic>Opa1</italic> gene (OPA1 BAT KO mice). Our data demonstrated that lack of OPA1 reduced the activation of the thermogenic gene program in BAT, while surprisingly inducing the expression and secretion of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a BATokine, via an ATF4-dependent mechanism. BAT-derived FGF21 mediates an adaptive response characterized by increased browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), elevated resting metabolic rates, and improved thermoregulation. Nonetheless, FGF21 was dispensable for the resistance to diet-induced obesity (DIO) and IR observed in these mice, which were mediated by alternative mechanisms downstream of ATF4.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OPA1 deficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in BAT, while improving energy balance and thermoregulation in mice</title><p>To determine the role of OPA1 in BAT physiology, we examined changes in OPA1 levels in BAT in response to high-fat feeding or cold stress. Twelve weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) increased <italic>Opa1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and protein levels in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Three days of cold exposure (4°C) induced <italic>Opa1</italic> mRNA in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); however, OPA1 total protein levels were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Inner membrane-anchored long OPA1 (L-OPA1) undergoes proteolytic cleavage by OMA1, resulting in short OPA1 (S-OPA1), which promotes mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Cold temperatures reduced the ratio of L-OPA1 versus the S-OPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating increased proteolytic cleavage of OPA1. Mice deficient for OPA1 specifically in BAT (OPA1 BAT KO) were generated to further investigate the requirement of OPA1 for BAT function. <italic>Opa1</italic> mRNA and protein levels were reduced by 10-fold in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>), but were maintained in other tissues such as WAT, liver, and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) protein levels were unchanged in OPA1-deficient BAT under baseline conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Histological analysis revealed increased numbers of enlarged unilocular lipid droplets, suggesting whitening of BAT when OPA1 is deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Ultrastructurally, mitochondria appeared more fragmented and lamellar cristae structure was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Isolated mitochondria from OPA1-deficient BAT revealed impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, exemplified by reduced pyruvate-malate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), and palmitoyl-carnitine-dependent oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and ATP synthesis rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction in BAT has been associated with reduced metabolic rates and increased fat accumulation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015b</xref>). Although we observed no differences in body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), or lean mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) in 4-week-old KO female mice, oxygen consumption was increased at 7 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), before changes in body mass were detected. OPA1 BAT KO male mice exhibited a small, but significant, reduction in body mass, which became more striking with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Total fat mass was unchanged, and total lean mass was reduced in 8-week-old KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), whereas percent fat mass and lean mass relative to body weight were not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>). However, the expected age-dependent increase in total fat mass and lean mass was strikingly attenuated in 20-week-old KO mice, which had reduced total fat mass and lean mass, relative to wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Percent fat mass was reduced, while percent lean mass was increased in 20-week-old KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J, K</xref>). Although fat mass was unchanged in 8-week-old KO mice, BAT mass was significantly increased at this age, but significantly reduced by 20 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). In contrast, weight of inguinal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>) and gonadal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>) WAT depots (gonadal white adipose tissue [gWAT] and inguinal white adipose tissue [iWAT], respectively) were significantly reduced in KO mice at both 8 and 20 weeks of age. Despite these changes in body composition, glucose tolerance was unaffected in 8-week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L, M</xref>) and 20-week-old KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1N, O</xref>). The reduction in body weight and fat mass persisted in aging mice as 50-week-old female mice exhibited an approximate 40% reduction in body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1P</xref>), a threefold reduction in body fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Q</xref>), and a significant increase in lean mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1R</xref>), relative to body weight. At this age, glucose tolerance was significantly improved in KO mice relative to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1S, T</xref>). To further elucidate mechanisms responsible for the weight loss, 8-week-old mice were studied in metabolic chambers. At thermoneutrality (30°C), ANCOVA analysis indicated a leftward shift in the relationship between body weight and oxygen consumption in KO mice. Thus, relative to total body mass, KO mice have higher oxygen consumption rates versus WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>). This likely contributes to the lean phenotype in KO mice as no changes were detected in food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1U</xref>) or locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1V</xref>) between genotypes. Despite reduced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in BAT, core body temperature was significantly increased in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>), indicating increased thermogenesis, even at thermoneutrality (30°C). To determine if these phenotypic changes would persist in the absence of lifelong thermogenic activation, a separate cohort of mice was raised at 30°C. Body mass remained reduced in KO mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), while percent fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and lean mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) were unchanged between genotypes. As observed in mice raised at room temperature (22°C), BAT mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>) was increased, whereas gWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>) and iWAT mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>) were significantly reduced in KO mice reared at 30°C.

Because the specific <italic>Ucp1</italic> Cre mouse used in the present study has been shown to promote recombination of floxed alleles in both brown and beige adipocytes, particularly in response to cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kong et al., 2014</xref>), we examined <italic>Cre</italic> expression in iWAT of WT and KO mice, relative to BAT. <italic>Cre</italic> expression in the BAT of KO mice was ~300-fold higher than its expression in iWAT, which was not statistically increased from WT iWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Moreover, there were no statistically significant changes in oxygen consumption between DKO mice and their WT littermate controls at 4°C, as analyzed by ANCOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Core body temperature tended to be lower after 3 days of cold exposure but did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). However, the last temperature recorded by telemetry for each mouse was significantly reduced in DKO mice and better reflects the defect in thermoregulation observed in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). This was primarily due to a steep reduction in core body temperature in four out of seven DKO mice, which died of hypothermia before the end of the cold exposure studies (data not shown). Locomotor activity was unchanged between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), while food intake was significantly reduced in DKO mice during the dark cycle, likely due to hypothermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). FGF21 has been implicated in browning of WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>). We, therefore, measured browning markers in iWAT of DKO mice. UCP1 and OPA1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>) were unchanged in mitochondria isolated from iWAT of DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M, N</xref>). Of note, although tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels remained elevated in iWAT of DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O, P</xref>), the induction of thermogenic genes in iWAT observed in OPA1 BAT KO mice was absent in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>). Furthermore, pyruvate-malate- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R</xref>) and palmitoyl-carnitine-supported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S</xref>) state 2 and state 3 mitochondrial respirations were unchanged between mitochondria isolated from iWAT of WT and DKO mice. Thus, BAT-derived FGF21 is required for the compensatory browning of iWAT and for thermoregulation in OPA1 BAT KO mice fed isocaloric diet.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>OPA1 deletion in BAT prevents DIO and IR</title><p>Although impaired BAT thermogenesis is frequently associated with increased susceptibility to DIO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowell et al., 1993</xref>), we hypothesized that the increased resting metabolic rates could protect OPA1 BAT KO mice from DIO. Indeed, KO mice fed HFD for 12 weeks weighed the same as WT mice fed low-fat control diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). KO mice fed the control diet weighed significantly less than WT mice fed the same diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The reduction in body mass occurred at the expense of fat mass as percent fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) was significantly reduced and percent lean mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) was significantly increased in KO mice fed HFD. BAT mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), gWAT mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and iWAT mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) were also significantly reduced in HFD-fed KO mice. ANCOVA analysis revealed increased oxygen consumption in KO mice fed either control or HFD, relative to WT mice fed a control diet, when we controlled for changes in body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). However, no differences were detected between WT mice fed HFD and WT fed control diet. Food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) were unchanged between genotypes. Thus, increased metabolic rates likely contribute to leanness in these mice. Glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity were also improved in KO mice fed HFD relative to WT mice. As expected, glucose tolerance was impaired in HFD-fed WT mice, which was significantly attenuated in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J, K</xref>). Fasting glucose levels were increased in WT mice, but not in KO mice fed HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). Similarly, insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) revealed impaired insulin sensitivity in WT mice fed a HFD, which was prevented in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M, N</xref>).

Under control diet conditions, DKO mice lacked the reduction in body mass noted in OPA1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, when fed a HFD, the increase in total body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) observed in WT mice on a HFD was completely prevented in DKO mice. Furthermore, the percent lean mass relative to body mass was reduced in WT mice fed HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). BAT mass was reduced in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and the diet-induced increase in gonadal and inguinal WAT mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>) was completely prevented in DKO mice relative to WT controls. Indirect calorimetry confirmed that, in mice fed control diet, oxygen consumption was unchanged in DKO mice relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>); however, DKO, but not WT mice fed a HFD, had increased oxygen consumption relative to WT mice fed control diet when controlled for changes in body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This increase in metabolic rates likely contributed to their resistance to weight gain, as we observed no significant changes in food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) or locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) between genotypes, regardless of diet. Furthermore, liver triglyceride levels were significantly reduced in DKO mice relative to WT mice fed a HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), consistent with attenuation of diet-induced hepatic steatosis. BAT-derived FGF21 is also dispensable for the improvements in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in OPA1 BAT KO mice, as HFD-induced glucose intolerance was attenuated in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G, H</xref>), and fasting glucose levels were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).

We provide direct evidence that OPA1 maintains mitochondrial respiratory capacity and is required for cold-induced activation of the thermogenic gene program in BAT. Mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) is critical for maintaining the brown adipocyte phenotype both during times of activation and quiescence. FAO also fuels the increase in uncoupled mitochondrial respiration and contributes to inducing the expression of thermogenic genes such as <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Ppargc1a</italic>, and <italic>Dio2</italic> in response to adrenergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fedorenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonzalez-Hurtado et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, mice with adipose-specific deficits in FAO are severely cold-intolerant, demonstrating its role in cold-induced thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015b</xref>). Although not directly tested, it is likely that reduced FAO in OPA1 BAT KO mice (KO) contributed to the impaired thermogenic activation of BAT. However, in contrast to many models of mitochondrial dysfunction or FAO defects in BAT, KO mice displayed improved cold adaptation.</p><p>The increased core body temperatures at thermoneutrality and heightened tolerance to cold at 4°C correlated with a significant increase in compensatory browning of subcutaneous WAT in KO mice. Several studies reported increased browning of WAT following BAT impairment. Surgical removal of interscapular BAT (iBAT) enhanced WAT browning due to increased sympathetic input to WAT in mice, which was accompanied by reduced adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Piao et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, denervation of iBAT increased sympathetic input to subcutaneous fat to induce compensatory browning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulz et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic models of BAT paucity demonstrated a similar phenomenon. Ablation of type 1A BMP-receptor (<italic>Bmpr1A</italic>) in brown adipogenic progenitor cells induces a severe paucity of BAT, which increased sympathetic input to WAT, thereby promoting browning, and maintaining normal temperature homeostasis and resistance to DIO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulz et al., 2013</xref>). Lastly, ablating insulin receptor in the Myf5 lineage reduced iBAT mass in mice that maintained normal thermogenesis on the basis of compensatory browning of subcutaneous WAT and increased lipolytic activity in BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lynes et al., 2015</xref>). We, therefore, postulated that OPA1 deletion in BAT increased sympathetic input to WAT to promote compensatory browning. Indeed, we observed increased tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels and increased efferent SNA in WAT, even at room temperature conditions, suggesting increased sympathetic innervation of subcutaneous fat. This compensatory browning likely contributes to increased core body temperature at both 30°C and at 4°C.</p><p>The mechanisms linking browning of WAT when BAT function is impaired are incompletely understood. Our data in KO mice demonstrated that FGF21 secretion from BAT is independent of BAT thermogenic activation and mediates this adaptation. FGF21 release from activated BAT might contribute to many of the metabolic benefits associated with BAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giralt et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, FGF21 is a key regulator of WAT browning in mice, leading to increased thermogenesis and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>). Our data in mice lacking OPA1 and FGF21 in BAT (OPA1/FGF21 DKO) revealed that BAT-derived FGF21 is required for increased browning of WAT in KO mice under isocaloric conditions. These data support the idea that FGF21 is a potent inducer of WAT browning and demonstrates that BAT-derived FGF21 mediates compensatory browning of WAT following OPA1 deletion in BAT, which contributes to the metabolic phenotype of these mice, despite absence of BAT activation.</p><p>Pharmacological administration of FGF21 increases energy expenditure and thermogenic gene expression in BAT and WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emanuelli et al., 2014</xref>). However, the role of endogenous BAT-derived FGF21 upon cold exposure remains incompletely understood. In KO mice, BAT-derived FGF21 was required for the baseline increase in core body temperature and for the resistance to cold stress. This result contrasts with a recent report demonstrating that FGF21 plays a negligible role in the systemic adaptations to long-term cold exposure in mice, including browning of subcutaneous WAT, in a global FGF21 knockout model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keipert et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2012</xref> showed that whole-body ablation of FGF21 impaired the response to cold stress when placing mice from 27°C to 5°C for 3 days. These studies utilized global knockout models; thus, the source of FGF21 is unclear. Moreover, liver-derived, but not adipose tissue-derived, FGF21 was shown to enter the circulation within the first hours of cold exposure, contributing to thermoregulation, via its action in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ameka et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that BAT-derived FGF21 could be dispensable for thermoregulation during short- and long-term cold acclimation in WT mice. However, our data clearly demonstrates that BAT-derived FGF21 does mediate the compensatory response of mice lacking OPA1 in BAT after short-term cold exposure as OPA1/FGF21 DKO mice undergo a steep decline in core body temperature when exposed to cold. Our model results from constitutive deletion of the <italic>Opa1</italic> gene. Therefore, our phenotype could reflect the effects of long-term exposure to persistent mildly increased endogenous FGF21 circulating levels, leading to considerable browning of WAT even at ambient temperature conditions. This augmented thermogenic response in WAT could prime these animals to better adapt to cold temperatures and might also contribute to the increased resting metabolic rates and leanness in KO mice.</p><p>The mechanisms governing FGF21-mediated browning are incompletely understood. FGF21 may directly promote browning of WAT in part, by induction of <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>), and contributes to the induction of WAT browning during cold acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Piao et al., 2018</xref>). However, central or peripherally administered FGF21 failed to induce beige fat in mice lacking β-adrenoceptors, indicating the requirement for an intact adrenergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Owen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Douris et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, liver-derived FGF21 mediates thermoregulation via its action in the central nervous system, rather than in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ameka et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these data suggest that FGF21 might signal centrally to activate the sympathetic nervous system and promote browning in KO mice. However, we observed increased tyrosine hydroxylase levels in WAT of OPA1/FGF21 DKO mice, which lacked the compensatory browning of WAT. This suggests that, in our model, BAT-derived FGF21 does not mediate the increase in sympathetic innervation of WAT in KO mice, and that increased sympathetic input to WAT is not sufficient to promote browning in the absence of elevated circulating FGF21 levels in mice. Thus, FGF21-independent mechanisms may mediate the compensatory increase in sympathetic tone to WAT in KO mice. However, FGF21 and the sympathetic nervous system may act cooperatively to induce browning in KO mice fed isocaloric diet. Finally, tyrosine hydroxylase levels were reduced in iWAT of both KO and OPA1/FGF21 DKO mice fed HFD, while UCP1 levels were significantly elevated, suggesting that increased sympathetic innervation is dispensable for WAT browning and for the resistance to DIO in KO and DKO mice fed HFD. Although increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity correlated with direct measurements of increased SNA in BAT OPA1 KO mice on normal chow, we did not directly measure SNA in the DIO studies. This more robust measurement of SNA will be required to further elucidate the role, if any, of sympathetic nervous system activation in the resistance to DIO observed in KO and OPA1/FGF21 DKO mice.</p><p>FGF21 is strongly induced in BAT in response to thermogenic stimulation via mechanisms that involve β-adrenergic signaling activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>). Because BAT thermogenic function was impaired in KO mice, and FGF21 levels were elevated even at ambient temperatures conditions, we hypothesized that alternative signaling pathways regulated FGF21 induction in KO mice. We and others have shown that OPA1 deletion in muscle leads to <italic>Fgf21</italic> induction via activation of the ER stress pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pereira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tezze et al., 2017</xref>). ATF4, a transcription factor downstream of the unfolded protein response (UPR), has been proposed to induce transcriptional regulation of <italic>Fgf21</italic> in models of mitochondrial stress as part of the integrated stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee, 2015a</xref>). Our data in mice lacking both OPA1 and ATF4 selectively in BAT demonstrated that ATF4 is required for FGF21 induction in and secretion from BAT in response to OPA1 deletion. Accordingly, lack of ATF4 in BAT recapitulated the effects of FGF21 deficiency in OPA1 BAT KO mice, including lack of baseline browning, normalized metabolic rates, and impaired adaptive thermogenesis. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that ATF4, likely downstream of ER stress activation, is required for FGF21 induction in OPA1 BAT KO mice. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated induction of ER stress and ATF4 in BAT in response to cold stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flicker et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies focusing on the role of ATF4 in BAT thermogenesis and BATokine secretion might identify mechanisms for BAT-mediated metabolic adaptations that might be independent of β-adrenergic stimulation of BAT.</p><p>Surprisingly, BAT-derived FGF21 does not appear to mediate the resistance to DIO and IR in KO mice. These data suggest that factors other than FGF21 may contribute to the lean phenotype in these mice and may mediate the increase in metabolic rates and browning of WAT when mice are fed HFD. Indeed, the diet-induced increase in FGF21 circulating levels was completely blunted in OPA1 BAT KO mice. This finding further supports the conclusion that FGF21 is not required for the systemic adaptations observed when OPA1 BAT KO mice are fed an obesogenic diet. Nonetheless, ATF4 is required for the resistance to DIO as OPA1/ATF4 BAT DKO mice become as obese and insulin resistant as WT mice after high-fat feeding. Future studies investigating the BAT secretome in this mouse model might identify additional BAT-derived secreted factors, which could potentially mediate the resistance to DIO. It is also possible that alternative mechanisms downstream of ATF4 activation, independent of the BAT secretome, could mediate this metabolic protection in OPA1 BAT KO mice.</p><p>In conclusion, these studies reveal an important stress response pathway in BAT in the absence of OPA1, consisting of induction of FGF21 as a BATokine via ATF4-dependent mechanisms, which promote leanness and improve thermoregulation when BAT function is dampened. Although FGF21 seems dispensable for the resistance to DIO in OPA1 BAT KO mice, mechanisms downstream of ATF4 are required for this protection. Determining the relevance of this ATF4-FGF21 axis in BAT physiology and BAT-mediated metabolic adaptations may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to combat obesity and associated disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Mice were weaned at 3 weeks of age and were either kept on standard chow (2920X Harlan Teklad, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or were fed special diets. For DIO studies, 6-week-old mice were divided into a control diet group (Cont; 10% kcal from fat—Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA, D12450J) or a HFD group (60% kcal from fat—Research Diets D12492) and were kept on these respective diets for 12 weeks. For the cold exposure experiments, mice were acclimated to 30°C (thermoneutral temperature for mice) for 7 days prior to being cold-exposed. Unless otherwise noted, animals were housed at 22°C with a 12 hr light, 12 hr dark cycle with free access to water and standard chow or special diets. All mouse experiments presented in this study were conducted in accordance with the animal research guidelines from NIH and were approved by the University of Iowa IACUC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Methods details</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Studies with mice reared at thermoneutrality</title><p>A subset of OPA1 BAT KO female mice and their WT littermate controls were transferred to a rodent environmental chamber (Power Scientific) set at 30°C following weaning (~4 weeks of age) and were housed for the subsequent 4 weeks (until ~8 weeks of age). Body composition and indirect calorimetry were measured at the end of the 4 weeks. Mice were transferred to an OxyMax Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS, Columbus Instruments International), where oxygen consumption, food intake, and ambulatory activity were measured. Body composition was determined by NMR, and BAT, iWAT, and gWAT depots were weighed upon tissue harvest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Cold exposure experiments</title><p>Core body temperature telemeters (Respironics, G2 E-Mitter, Murrysville, PA, USA) were surgically implanted into the abdominal cavity of 8–10-week-old male mice, and mice were then allowed to recover for 6 days post-surgery, while individually housed in a rodent environmental chamber (Power Scientific) at 30°C. Mice were then transferred to an OxyMax Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS, Columbus Instruments International) at 30°C for 4 days, followed by 4°C for 3 days, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>). Core body temperature was recorded every 17 min throughout the experiment, along with O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> levels, food intake, and ambulatory activity, as estimated by photoelectric beam breaks in the X + Y plane. For the acute cold exposure experiments, 8-week-old mice were initially individually housed in the rodent environmental chamber at 30°C for 7 days. The initial temperature (t0) was recorded using a rectal probe (Fisher Scientific, Lenexa, KS, USA) at 7 am on day 8, after which the temperature was switched to 4°C. Once the desired temperature was reached, we recorded rectal temperatures hourly for up to 4 hr of cold exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Sympathetic nerve recording</title><p>Each mouse was anesthetized with intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (91 mg/kg BW (body weight)) and xylazine (9.1 mg/kg BW (body weight)). With the mouse in the dorsal position, a tracheotomy was performed and a PE-50 tubing was inserted to provide an unimpeded airway for the mouse to spontaneously breathe O<sub>2</sub>-enriched room air. Next, a tapered micro-renathane tubing (Braintree Scientific, MRE-40) was inserted into the right jugular vein for infusion of the sustaining anesthetic agent (α-chloralose: initial dose of 12 mg/kg, then sustaining dose of 6 mg/kg/hr). A second tapered MRE-40 catheter was inserted into the left common carotid artery that was attached to a pressure transducer (iWorx Systems, Inc, BP-100) for continuous measurement of arterial pressure and heart rate. Core body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained throughout the experiment with a temperature controller (Physitemp, Model TCAT2) set at 37.5°C.</p><p>To gain access to the nerve fascicle that innervates the inguinal white adipose fat, a small dermal incision was performed between the lower abdominal area and the right hindlimb. A single multi-fiber inguinal nerve was isolated from the nearby white fat deposit and placed on a bipolar platinum-iridium electrode (A-M Systems, 36-gauge), secured with silicone gel (WPI, Kwik-Sil). The nerve was carefully sectioned distal to the site of the recording. The electrode was attached to a high-impedance probe (Grass Instruments, HIP-511), and the nerve signal was filtered at a 100- and 1000 Hz cutoff and amplified by 10<sup>5</sup> times with a Grass P511 AC pre-amplifier. The nerve signal was routed to a speaker system and to an oscilloscope (Hewlett-Packard, model 54501A) to monitor the audio and visual quality of the nerve recording. The nerve signal was also directed to a resetting voltage integrator (University of Iowa Bioengineering, model B600c) to analyze the total activity (integrated voltage) and finally to a MacLab analog-digital converter (ADInstruments, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia, Model 8S) containing the software (MacLab Chart Pro; version 7.0) that utilizes a cursor to count the number of spikes/second that exceed the background noise threshold. Under a stable plane of anesthesia and strict isothermal conditions (37.5°C), continuous recording of baseline efferent inguinal WAT SNA was measured over a 30 min period. At the conclusion, the afferent end of the inguinal nerve-electrode complex was cut and the residual background noise measured, which was subtracted from the measurements to determine the real efferent inguinal SNA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>GTTs, ITTs, nuclear magnetic resonance, and serum analysis</title><p>GTTs were performed after a 6 hr fast, and mice were administered glucose intraperitoneally (2 g/kg body weight), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tabbi-Anneni et al., 2008</xref>). ITTs were performed after a 2 hr fast by injecting insulin intraperitoneally (0.75 U/kg body weight; Humulin, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Blood glucose was determined using a glucometer at regular time intervals (Glucometer Elite; Bayer, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Insulin solution was prepared in sterile 0.9% saline and dosed based on body weight. Plasma insulin was measured after a 6 hr fast using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer’s directions (Ultra-Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA Kit, Chrystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL, USA). Serum FGF21 (BioVendor ELISA kit, Asheville, NC, USA) was measured using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer’s directions.

The authors show that this may be due to release of FGF21 from the brown adipocytes. However, brown adipocyte-specific deletion of both OPA1 and FGF21 did not support this hypothesis. The authors propose that deletion of OPA1 leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress, which activates the transcriptional mediator ATF4. Deleting OPA1 and ATF4 in brown adipocytes largely phenocopies the phenotype seen with deletion of OPA1 and FGF21. The authors went on to perform sympathetic nerve recordings which support these observations. These studies provide novel insights into inter-tissue cross talk and metabolic homeostasis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;OPA1 Deletion in Brown Adipose Tissue Improves Thermoregulation and Systemic Metabolism via FGF21&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David James as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. In Figure 3I it is demonstrated that serum levels of FGF21 are induced in the BAT-OPA1 knockout animals. Close inspection of the data reveals some variability in the serum FGF21 levels within the KO animals. 4 animals have induced levels of serum FGF21 whereas ~12 animals have levels within the range found in control mice. The authors should discuss this. Does the level of compensatory FGF21 induction correlate with other parameters in individual mice?</p><p>2. The authors show whole-body energy expenditure data in several figures (Figure 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7). However, the VO2 data are distilled into bar graphs normalized to body mass. This means of displaying the data is not the standard in the field and has the potential to lead to erroneous interpretations. This is particularly the case when comparing animals of different body weight and body composition. The authors should refer to Tschop et al. (Nat Methods, 2012, 9: 57-63) and Mina et al. (Cell Metab, 2018, 28: 656-66) to ensure their data is analyzed and displayed in a standard fashion.</p><p>3.

Moreover, the authors make claims regarding possible mechanisms that are not well supported by the data. Specifically, in explaining the browning of white fat seen in their models, the authors rely on Western blots for TH in whole adipose tissue to argue for increased sympathetic innervation of iWAT. In addition to being generally unreliable (TH is also expressed in some sensory neurons), to justify this claim additional experiments would be needed, such as (a) morphology: immunohistochemistry and/or whole mount imaging, (b) function: sympathetic nerve recordings, mass spec or HPLC measurement of tissue catecholamines, and (c) downstream effects: assays of lipolysis and/or signaling mediators downstream of sympathetic activation, such as pHSL vs. total HSL. These issues and limitations should be discussed in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66519.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Unfortunately, because the serum was collected under ad libitum feeding conditions (between 8 am-12 pm), variability in the data depicted in Figure 3I (now Figure 3J of the revised manuscript) could reflect differences in feeding status in random-fed animals. To control for this possibility, we measured FGF21 levels in a separate cohort of animals after a 6-hour fast (Figure S3B). Although some variability remains, values for FGF21 in KO animals do not overlap with any values in control mice. These data confirm an almost 2-fold increase in FGF21 circulating levels in KO mice. Generally speaking, comparison of the data in Figure 3J and S3B indicate that FGF21 levels are lower in WT and KO mice in the random-fed state. Interestingly, the FGF21 levels in the 4 KO animals highlighted by the reviewers, are close to those of WT mice that were fasted for 6 hours, which supports the impact of the feeding state of animals to confound differences between genotypes. Importantly, even if the 4 animals with the greatest degree of FGF21 induction are removed from the analysis in Figure 3l, the increase in circulating FGF21 in the KO group, although attenuated remains statistically significantly increased. Therefore, we conclude that the variability in FGF21 circulating levels in random-fed animals is most likely related to differences in feeding status at the time of serum collection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

At this time point, we did not detect any changes in body mass or body composition. By 7 weeks, females have increased oxygen consumption, in the absence of significant differences in body mass. These additional data suggest that the earliest time-point reported in the main manuscript (8 weeks) likely represent a time point when most phenotypical changes emerge between genotypes. It also strengthens our conclusion that an increase in basal metabolic rates likely contributes to the lean phenotype in OPA1 BAT KO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

To provide additional mechanism to support increased sympathetic innervation of iWAT we performed sympathetic nerve (SNA) recordings for nerves that innervate iWAT of WT and KO mice (Figure 3H). These SNA recordings confirm increased sympathetic activity in iWAT of KO mice. We also discuss potential limitations of these data and additional confirmatory assays in our Discussion section, as we do not have nerve recordings for all the different mouse models included in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
