early reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, which regulates sensory neuron regeneration and tissue repair. How the initial type of tissue injury influences early damage signaling and regenerative growth of sensory axons remains unclear. Previously we reported that thermal injury triggers distinct early tissue responses in larval zebrafish. Here, we found that thermal but not mechanical injury impairs sensory axon regeneration and function. Real-time imaging revealed an immediate tissue response to thermal injury characterized by the rapid Arp2/3-dependent migration of keratinocytes, which was associated with tissue scale ROS production and sustained sensory axon damage. Isotonic treatment was sufficient to limit keratinocyte movement, spatially restrict ROS production, and rescue sensory neuron function. These results suggest that early keratinocyte dynamics regulate the spatial and temporal pattern of long-term signaling in the wound microenvironment during tissue repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>wound healing</kwd><kwd>sensory neuron</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>burn</kwd><kwd>epithelial migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 GM147303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horn</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttenlocher</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Isotonic treatment limits keratinocyte movement, spatially restricts reactive oxygen species production, and rescues sensory neuron function after thermal injury.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Restoration of tissue function following epithelial injury requires the regeneration and activity of peripheral sensory neurons, which innervate the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mullen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rabiller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simões et al., 2014</xref>). In response to tissue damage, axonal regeneration requires the clearance of axon fragments by phagocytes followed by new axonal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rasmussen et al., 2015</xref>). While peripheral sensory neurons maintain a cell-intrinsic ability to regenerate following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mahar and Cavalli, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>), local environmental cues also regulate the response of sensory neurons to tissue damage in vivo. Recent advances have identified the contribution of supporting cell populations, paracrine biochemical signaling, and biophysical interactions in regulating peripheral sensory axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avraham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Villegas et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these advances, we have limited understanding of how early collective signaling in the wound microenvironment is organized and leads to sensory axon regeneration and tissue repair.</p><p>Keratinocytes are a primary constituent of epithelial tissue and play a critical role in wound healing. In addition to mediating wound closure by actively migrating toward the site of injury, keratinocytes also generate pro-reparative signals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which coordinate longer-term repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunnill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Linley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Love et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mittal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Romero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sies and Jones, 2020</xref>). While transient and localized ROS production promotes regeneration and sensory axon regrowth, chronically elevated ROS is associated with neurodegeneration and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cobb and Cole, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rieger and Sagasti, 2011</xref>). Thus, precise temporal and spatial organization of tissue redox signaling is likely critical for efficient sensory neuron regeneration and tissue repair.</p><p>While epithelial tissue is well adapted to repair from mechanical damage, burn wounds heal poorly. Thermal injury results in chronic pain and lack of sensation in the affected tissue, suggesting that an abnormal sensory neuron response contributes to burn wound pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blais et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choinière et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pavoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tirado-Esteban et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsolakidis et al., 2022</xref>). Despite this, we lack an understanding of why sensory neuron function is impaired after burn. Our previous work has demonstrated persistent inflammation and a loss of an organized collagen matrix that impairs healing after thermal injury in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeBert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeBert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miskolci et al., 2019</xref>). These features recapitulate human burns and provide an in vivo model system to study the regeneration of sensory neurons in the wound microenvironment.</p><p>Using real-time imaging, we took advantage of the optical transparency of larval zebrafish to dissect dynamic cell-cell interactions in the wound microenvironment following injury. We found that localized thermal injury induced axonal damage in the tailfin. Live imaging revealed that sensory axons are physically displaced and experience damage associated with the rapid collective migration of basal keratinocytes following burn. This early keratinocyte migration also contributes to elevated ROS at the tissue scale. Keratinocyte migration was dependent on Arp2/3 signaling and treatment with the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666 dampened early wound-localized ROS production after burn, suggesting that dysregulated migration perturbs the temporal and spatial organization of ROS after tissue damage. Inhibiting keratinocyte migration via osmotic manipulation with isotonic solution spatially restricted ROS production and rescued sensory axon regrowth and function. Collectively, our results support the importance of regulated keratinocyte behavior for early temporal and spatial signal control that leads to sensory axon regeneration and tissue repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Burn injury induces peripheral sensory axon damage</title><p>To visualize sensory neurons responding to tissue injury, we used 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) <italic>Tg(Ngn1:GFP-Caax</italic>) larval zebrafish that express GFP in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andermann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blader et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGraw et al., 2008</xref>). Larvae were either mechanically injured by tailfin transection or burn as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miskolci et al., 2019</xref>). Intravital imaging of larvae beginning at 24 hr post-wound (hpw) revealed an abnormal axon morphology in burned larvae compared to mechanical transection, with axons showing fewer branch points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To evaluate sensory axons following injury, we assessed axon density in the wounded tissue posterior to the notochord 24 hpw. Larval zebrafish caudal fins can regenerate fully by 3 days post-transection, with 60% of fin regrowth occurring by day 1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lisse et al., 2015</xref>). Following transection, axon density was 89.5±0.02% of the density observed in age-matched uninjured larvae 24 hpw. In contrast, we found that burned larvae had significantly reduced sensory axon density, with an axon density of 63.7±0.02% compared to uninjured fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This relative decrease was sustained even 96 hpw with an axon density of only 65.1±0.04% compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To test whether this regenerative defect was associated with a defect in sensory neuron function, we assessed the touch responsiveness of wounded tissue. Light pressure was applied by an eyelash brush directly to the wound area, and sensory neuron function was scored by the presence of a tail flick reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granato et al., 1996</xref>). As expected, larvae wounded by transection had a nearly 100% response rate 24 hpw, indicating the rapid recovery of sensory neurons following mechanical injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, none of the burned larvae were sensitive to touch 24 hpw with resolution occurring by 96 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, all tested larvae exhibited a tail flick reflex when pressure was applied to the trunk, showing that the impaired sensation was limited to the damaged tissue.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Peripheral sensory axons have impaired regeneration after burn injury.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of larval zebrafish injury.

For this, we assessed wound-induced axonal damage using <italic>Tg(Elavl3:GCaMP5</italic>) zebrafish larvae that express the calcium probe GCaMP under the pan-neuronal Elavl3 promoter. Using these larvae, we observed no noticeable change in GCaMP intensity under homeostatic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While transient calcium increase following cell damage is required for immediate membrane repair and subsequent regeneration, chronically elevated cytosolic calcium is associated with cell degeneration and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaitin, 2021</xref>). GCaMP has previously been used as a marker of real-time axonal damage in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adalbert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Linsley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ziv and Spira, 1993</xref>). Therefore, GCaMP can be used for real-time labeling of axon damage in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adalbert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Linsley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ziv and Spira, 1993</xref>). Axon damage is characterized by the fragmenting of axons and the formation of small punctae, which are later cleared by phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reyes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Villegas et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, the neurotoxin sodium azide elicited widespread and long-lasting calcium-positive punctae, indicating sustained axonal damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Linsley et al., 2021</xref>). Unlike Ngn1, the Elavl3 promoter is expressed by both sensory and motor neurons. To ensure that the calcium increase in wounded tissue was specific to sensory axons, sensory neurons were depleted by injecting a morpholino targeting Ngn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cornell and Eisen, 2002</xref>). These larvae did not have any obvious developmental defects but lacked responsiveness to touch stimulation, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cornell and Eisen, 2002</xref>). As expected, no calcium increase was detected in Ngn1 depleted larvae following injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Time-lapse images were taken of Elavl3:GCaMP5 larvae to visually capture instances of axon damage indicated by calcium-positive punctae during the 30 min after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These images were compared to time-lapse images of sensory neuron-labeled larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In agreement with previous observations of axonal damage following mechanical injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arrázola et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rasmussen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rieger and Sagasti, 2011</xref>), tailfin transection resulted in spatially localized axonal damage that was almost completely resolved by 1 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, burn injury resulted in a distinct temporal and spatial profile of sensory axon damage. While initial wound-induced sensory neuron-specific calcium increase appeared to be localized to burned tissue, axonal damage continued to increase and spread across the tissue for approximately 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). This raised the question of whether axonal damage was restricted to epithelial tissue directly impacted by injury, as observed in transected larvae. To label wounded epithelium, we used the lipophilic dye FM 1–43, which is commonly used to label damaged cell membranes after wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Defour et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sønder et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McDade et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shannon et al., 2017</xref>). Immediately following either transection or thermal injury, axonal damage overlapped spatially with wounded epithelial tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). However, by 6 hr following burn injury, there was widespread damage to axons that extended beyond the initial wound area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). These findings suggest that burn injury induces axonal damage that accumulates over time and is spatially uncoupled from the surrounding epithelial damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The burn wound microenvironment contributes to defective axon regeneration and function</title><p>To determine if early wound signaling regulates sensory axon regeneration, we used a two-wound model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) to excise the burned tissue at different times post-wound. In this system, zebrafish were first injured by either a primary tailfin transection or burn, and then a secondary transection injury was carried out either early at 5 min post-wound (mpw) or late at 6 hpw. The secondary transection was performed so that all the burned tissue was excised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). As expected, larvae that underwent only transections at both time points had full sensory function by 24 hpw regardless of the timing of the second transection injury, showing that zebrafish efficiently heal after mechanical damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). In burned larvae, early transection after thermal injury (5 mpw) improved sensory axon regeneration and function to levels similar to transected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>), suggesting that burn injury does not immediately affect sensory axons differently than mechanical damage. However, when burned tissue was excised after 6 hr, significant defects were noted in both axon density and sensory function compared to larvae that either received two transection injuries or had burned tissue transected at 5 mpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). These findings suggest that the local wound environment modulates sensory axon outcomes following burn injury, and that events in the first 6 hr after injury impact longer-term sensory axon repair.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The burn wound microenvironment contributes to impaired sensory axon regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of two-wound experiment design.

Given the chaotic and sustained keratinocyte migration associated with burn injury, we next tested if sensory axons are displaced along with associated migrating keratinocytes.

To determine if damage was limited to axons, we imaged the cell bodies of peripheral sensory neurons. At 3 dpf, the skin is innervated by Rohon-Beard (RB) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons with cell bodies that reside within and just outside the spinal cord, respectively.

Treatment with the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666 limited keratinocyte lamellipodia formation and impaired early keratinocyte migration, indicating that the early keratinocyte movement is Arp2/3 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Although early migration was impaired, by 40 mpw the migration was not significantly different between control and CK666-treated larvae, suggesting that CK666 treatment only inhibits early keratinocyte migration. To determine if this early treatment altered signaling in wounded tissue, we probed the effects of CK666 treatment on the generation of ROS signaling at the burn wounds. It is known that efficient tissue repair after injury relies on coordinated ROS production by epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enyedi and Niethammer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jelcic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). Following mechanical injuries such as tailfin transection or laser ablation, transient and localized H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also promotes sensory axon regeneration and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cadiz Diaz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rieger and Sagasti, 2011</xref>). Because of this ROS requirement, we hypothesized that the robust keratinocyte movement and sustained damage in burned tissue may result in dysregulated ROS production. To test this, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level was determined using the fluorescent dye pentafluorobenzenesulfonyl fluorescein (Pfbsf), an established readout of ROS production that has previously been used in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maeda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niethammer et al., 2009</xref>). Early after burn wounding, there was robust generation of hydrogen peroxide in burned tissue that was dampened in CK666-treated larvae. In the presence of CK666, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was concentrated at the wound edge, similar to what has been reported with tail transection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). These findings suggest that early migration alters the temporal and spatial distribution of ROS after wounding. Interestingly, CK666-treated larvae had no significant difference in axon damage or regeneration 24 hr after burn compared to controls, although there was a trend toward improved sensory function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref>).

To determine if other treatments that affect keratinocyte migration also impact tissue scale ROS production after burn, we determined if altering osmotic balance impacts keratinocyte migration and the distribution of ROS signaling after burn. Under control conditions, zebrafish are maintained in hypotonic solution. Removing this osmotic gradient by wounding larvae in the presence of solution that is isotonic to the interstitial fluid has previously been shown to inhibit keratinocyte migration following mechanical injury and impair wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gault et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kennard and Theriot, 2020</xref>). We found that wounding in the presence of an isotonic solution prevented the rapid movement of keratinocytes in response to a burn. Within the first hour following burn injury, keratinocyte average speed was reduced from 0.059 µm/s in control medium to 0.003 µm/s in isotonic medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

Examining ROS production during the first hour post-burn revealed that control larvae had increased ROS throughout the fin tissue compared to isotonic-treated larvae, while both conditions had comparable levels of ROS at the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). At 6 hr post-burn, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was no longer localized to the wound edge in control burned larvae and had increased throughout the tailfin. By contrast, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> remained restricted to the wound edge in larvae burned in the presence of isotonic solution, displaying a similar localized pattern to that observed after mechanical injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jelcic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korte et al., 2022</xref>).

Collectively, these findings suggest that early keratinocyte movement after burn coordinates spatial redox signaling and impacts sensory axon regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tissue repair requires the coordination of signaling across spatial and temporal scales. Our prior work has shown that early ROS signaling immediately after mechanical damage is necessary for longer-term tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). Wound-induced ROS production is also required for leukocyte recruitment, ECM remodeling, and sensory axon regeneration in response to tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeBert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niethammer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rieger and Sagasti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yoo et al., 2011</xref>). While the requirement of ROS production following tissue injury is clear, we lack an understanding of how early redox signaling is coordinated temporally and spatially to mediate long-term tissue repair. We recently reported that burn injury induces a distinct repair response with impaired collagen remodeling and delayed healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeBert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miskolci et al., 2019</xref>). In light of the known defect in sensory function after burn injuries in humans, we sought to determine how the early epithelial response modulates sensory axon recovery. Our findings suggest that early damage-induced keratinocyte movement plays a role in the spatial patterning of ROS production in the wound microenvironment and impacts the ability of sensory axons to regenerate.</p><p>Collective keratinocyte migration is conserved across species and is required to mediate wound closure after tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirfel and Herzog, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mayor and Etienne-Manneville, 2016</xref>). While collective cell migration has been observed in larval zebrafish previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olson and Nechiporuk, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamaguchi et al., 2022</xref>), its contribution to tissue repair remains unclear. In comparison to the organized movement associated with keratinocyte response to mechanical injury, our observations here identify excessive keratinocyte migration as a defining feature of the response to burn injury. Basal keratinocyte migration following burn injury appeared to lack a stereotypical leader-follower dynamic, with cells instead moving independently of one another but as a collective group. This observation suggests that collective keratinocyte migration is a feature of tissue repair in larval zebrafish regardless of the mode of injury and that its regulation is required for the success of long-term healing. Indeed, we provide evidence that early migration and formation of lamellipodia in basal keratinocytes requires Arp2/3 signaling, and that this aberrant migration regulates the temporal and spatial distribution of early redox signaling in the wound tissue. However, Arp2/3 inhibition did not lead to sustained control of keratinocyte migration and production of ROS eventually increased throughout the tailfin. Accordingly, sensory function was not significantly improved at 24 hpw.</p><p>To further modulate keratinocyte movement, we took advantage of isotonic treatment that is known to affect keratinocyte migration after wounding by tailfin transection. Cell swelling is thought to induce migration by promoting branched actin polymerization and lamellipodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bera et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sforna et al., 2022</xref>), potentially through the activity of mechanically activated ion channels. Previous groups have shown that osmotic differences trigger both ATP release and lamellipodia formation in basal keratinocytes, which promote keratinocyte migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gault et al., 2014</xref>). Our results also show that osmotic modulation affects basal keratinocyte motility in response to burn injury. Interestingly, limiting keratinocyte motility by isotonic treatment is detrimental to tissue repair following mechanical injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gault et al., 2014</xref>), but isotonic treatment both rescues epithelial morphology and reduces axon damage following thermal injury. This suggests that there is an optimal amount of keratinocyte movement needed for efficient repair and long-term regeneration.</p><p>A conceptual challenge in wound repair has been understanding how early wound-induced events are linked to long-term repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sonnemann and Bement, 2011</xref>). ROS signaling provides a framework to understand this link due to its requirement for both early wound contraction and long-term regeneration. In zebrafish, the ROS H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is generated along a tissue scale gradient with the highest levels at the wound edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niethammer et al., 2009</xref>). While this spatial gradient undoubtedly directs cell function based on the position along the gradient, uncontrolled ROS production is damaging to tissues. Therefore, a mechanism must exist to control ROS such that it remains relatively localized to the site of damage and is controlled temporally and spatially. In addition to their early role in wound resealing, keratinocyte redox signaling is critical for long-term repair. Cell swelling induces cPLA2-dependent 5-oxoETE production and immune cell recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enyedi et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests the signals that control keratinocyte motility may simultaneously modify long-term keratinocyte signaling.</p><p>Our findings suggest that cell migration can modulate tissue scale signaling following injury. Importantly, isotonic treatment blocks keratinocyte movement and restores localized ROS signaling at the wound edge. The dependence on migration was supported both by the effects of Arp2/3 inhibition on early ROS signaling and by the finding that isotonic treatment started after migration was complete (1 hr after injury) did not rescue tissue scale ROS. This suggests that early keratinocyte migration patterns the tissue scale ROS distribution. Additionally, ROS inhibition with the drug DPI provided only slight benefits to axon regeneration. This could be due to treatment being sustained for only 1 hpw, but migration was also not inhibited which further points to the importance of migration in early wound signaling. The finding that isotonic treatment at the time of injury was sufficient to rescue sensory function but treatment after 1 hr did not rescue axon regeneration further highlights the importance of this early motile response for setting up the longer-term repair after damage.</p><p>The benefit of a system in which keratinocyte motility controls downstream signaling is twofold. First, it enables signaling to be scaled to the size of injury. If more cells migrate due to a larger injury, then production of ROS will likewise increase. Second, this system provides a mechanism to control the spatial localization of signaling. Keratinocyte migration requires transiently detaching from neighboring cells. Thus, the act of migrating induces a physical change in the tissue that demarcates the wound region from healthy tissue. It is known that production of ROS promotes keratinocyte motility, and that adhesion is linked to cellular redox state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunnill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendieta-Serrano et al., 2019</xref>). Given these observations, it seems plausible that ROS production in wounded tissue is linked to the biomechanical state of keratinocytes – with low ROS in static, adhered cells, and high ROS in loosely adhered or migrating cells. A conceptual framework such as this would explain excessive ROS production in burn wounded tissue. Early keratinocyte dynamics in burned tissue are associated with normal wound edge ROS production. However, lack of a migratory stop signal may result in excessive keratinocyte migration and subsequent epithelial damage associated with keratinocytes detaching from the basal lamina. Therefore, failure to restore epithelial homeostasis due to unabated keratinocyte movement may allow for ROS production to continue over time and spread further away from the wound site. Future studies will be aimed at identifying the molecular link between cell migration and tissue scale signaling during tissue repair.</p><p>In summary, we have identified early wound-induced keratinocyte migration as a mechanism that controls spatial patterning of long-term wound signaling. These findings highlight the ability of keratinocytes within the wound microenvironment to integrate early signaling and migratory functions that mediate initial wound closure and subsequently regulate spatial tissue signaling necessary for efficient repair of sensory neuron function. Further, our results not only highlight the utility of larval zebrafish for revealing new insights of the tissue response to injury in vivo, but also demonstrate the potential for these findings to inform new treatment strategies for wound healing more broadly.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Sensory neuron function was determined using a behavioral touch assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granato et al., 1996</xref>). 3 dpf larvae were wounded as described above. At the indicated time post-wound, larvae were briefly anesthetized for mounting into the zWEDGI restraining device, with only the head mounted in 2% low-melting point agarose. Fresh E3 was added, and larvae were allowed to rest for 1 hr. To assess sensory function, the wounded region of caudal fin was touched with the tip of an eyelash brush (No. 1 Superfine Eyelash, Ted Pella) and the presence or absence of a twitch reflex was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of axon damage</title><p>Maximum intensity z-projected confocal images of the caudal fin were generated using Fiji. For all experiments, the caudal fin area posterior to the notochord was outlined using the Polygon tool and measured to obtain a total surface area ROI. Axon fragments inside the outlined area were manually thresholded so all fragments posterior to the notochord were labeled and no saturated pixels were present, and an area measurement of these thresholded pixels was taken.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Visualization of sensory axon and tissue damage</title><p>To visualize damage to sensory axons, <italic>Tg(ElavI3:GCaMP5</italic>) larvae were used. Identical microscope settings (20× objective, 10% laser, 100 ms exposure, 2 µm step size) were used for all experiments to acquire images and movies. Representative images are maximum intensity z-projections of the caudal fin generated using Fiji. FM 1–43 dye (Life Technologies) was used to visualize tissue damage following transection and burn injury. For these experiments, larvae were incubated in 1 mg/mL FM 1–43 for 15 min prior to injury and through time at which they were imaged. Larvae were maintained at 28.5°C until imaging at the indicated time post-injury.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of hydrogen peroxide level</title><p>Hydrogen peroxide was quantified using Pfbsf (Santa Cruz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maeda et al., 2004</xref>). Larvae were incubated in 1 µM Pfbsf for 15 min prior to injury and maintained in dye solution for the duration of each experiment. Identical microscope settings (10× objective, 1% laser, 50 ms exposure, 3.7 µm step size) were used for all experiments to acquire images and movies. Pfbsf intensity was calculated by generating sum projections and measuring mean gray value of the fin and wound zone in Fiji. Wound zone Pfbsf quantifications were taken by measuring mean gray value of the area posterior to the notochord. For measurements of the fin, mean gray value of the trunk area 200 µm anterior to the tip of the notochord and excluding pigmented skin within the region was measured. Background signal was subtracted for each measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell tracking</title><p>Basal keratinocyte tracking following tissue injury was performed using <italic>Tg(Krtt1c19e:acGFP</italic>) larvae. Cell tracking was performed using the Spots module in Imaris version 9.8.2 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). For each larva, three representative cells were identified and manual tracking was performed, with the average of these cells being used to generate a single value for further analysis. To control for drift of the entire fin during imaging, non-moving pigment was manually tracked by Brightfield and track length was subtracted from basal keratinocyte movement. In all cases, larvae were imaged for 1 hr following injury at an interval of 30 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Morpholino injection</title><p>Ngn1 morpholino with the sequence 5’-ACG ATC TCC ATT GTT GAT AAC CTG G-3’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cornell and Eisen, 2002</xref>) was used to prevent sensory neuron formation in Elavl3-GCaMP5 larvae to confirm damage signals were constrained only to axons. 5 ng of Ngn1 morpholino was injected into the yolk of one- to two-cell stage zebrafish embryos. Larvae were incubated at 28.5°C until used for experiments at 3 dpf. Before use in experiments, larvae were screened by the sensory function assay described above to ensure that sensory neurons were depleted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Image processing</title><p>Images were processed and analyzed using Fiji and Imaris version 9.8.2 as indicated. Supplemental movies were generated in Fiji and edited using Adobe Premiere Pro (Adobe). In Adobe Premiere Pro, pseudocoloring of individual keratinocytes was done using the Color Effects module with manual tracking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Each experimental condition consists of at least three independent biological replicates, defined as three clutches of larvae spawned on 3 different days. Cell-tracking experiments were analyzed using non-parametric methods (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Quantification of axon density was analyzed using linear mixed-effect models in which biological replicate was treated as a random effect and experimental conditions (e.g. wound, time, or chemical treatment) treated as fixed factors. Experiments measuring fluorescence intensity (Pfbsf intensity) were analyzed in the same manner, except the response (fluorescence) was log-transformed prior to analysis. Means computed on the log scale estimate the median response when back-transformed to original units. At the same time, differences between means (of log-transformed data) become ratios of medians after back transformation to the original scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aitkin et al., 1989</xref>). Experiments involving the proportion of fish that responded to touch were analyzed using a general linear model that included replicate and experimental condition as fixed effects; standard errors used for estimation and testing were adjusted to correct for heteroscedasticity in the proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Long and Ervin, 2000</xref>). Graphing was performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). Sample size is reported for specific experiments in the Figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health.

We have tried many experiments to address this question. The data show that Arp 2/3 inhibition with CK666 is an effective way to inhibit initial keratinocyte migration. However, later migration still proceeds. What is interesting is that just inhibition of the early migration is sufficient to restore localized ROS production in the wound area in the first hour post-burn, even if this is not sufficient to prevent ROS accumulation over time. There is also a trend toward improved sensory neuron function late after this early treatment. However, this is not statistically significant. We think it is likely that both migration and tissue scale ROS influence the regeneration defect of sensory neurons after burn. The data using isotonic solution supports this conclusion. We have tried many other ways to limit keratinocyte migration including depletion of talin and expression of a dominant negative Rac in basal epithelial cells, but these treatments were not compatible with survival of the fish after burn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pharmacological or genetic approaches should be used to prove the role of ROS production by directly targeting the known H2O2 source in the system: DUOX.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that pharmacologic or genetic approaches to directly manipulate ROS production would provide substantial support to the hypothesis that ROS, along with keratinocyte migration, is a main factor contributing to poor burn outcomes. To address this, we first tried using a morpholino to deplete DUOX. However, the combination of DUOX morpholino and burn injury was lethal to larvae. We also used pharmacologic inhibition of ROS production using DPI (Diphenyleneiodonium). With this treatment, ROS is inhibited for only the first hour post-burn as treatment is lethal for longer periods of time. Burned larvae have marginally improved axon density and touch sensitivity, suggesting the importance of ROS in burn outcomes, however it was not statistically significant. It is likely that an increased effect would be observed with longer treatment, but treatment for more than 1 hour was toxic. We have added a supplemental figure with this new DPI data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors provide clear and compelling proof that osmotic responses lie at the heart of the burn-induced axonal damage responses, they did not consider the option of further exploring any biology related to osmotic cell swelling. Could osmotic ATP release maybe play a role through excitotoxicity? Could cPLA2 activation-dependent eicosanoid production relate to the process? Pharmacological tests using purinergic receptor inhibition or blockage of eicosanoid production could answer these questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the role of osmotic cell swelling in the burn response is an interesting avenue for future study. However, we make use of isotonic treatment in this study specifically for its effect on keratinocyte migration and broad-scale wound healing. As a result, we feel that pursuing the biology of this swelling phenomenon is outside the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors provide elegant experiments showing that early removal of the burnt tissue can rescue damage-induced axonal damage, which could also be interpreted in an osmotic manner: tail fin transections could close faster than burn wounds, allowing for lower hypotonic exposure time.

In these experiments, dye entry into wounded tissue is used as a readout of wound closure. Dye is only able to enter wounded tissue when the epithelial barrier is disrupted. Our data reveal that transections take approximately 10 minutes to fully close, while burns take approximately 20 minutes to close.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94995-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To test if this difference in wound closure time would have an effect on axon outcomes, we repeated, but slightly modified, the dual-wound experiment. We increased the amount of time the burn condition was exposed to hypotonic conditions by 10 additional minutes (by transecting burned tissue at 15 minutes post burn, shortly before closure) and compared axon outcomes to the 5 mpw control transection. These results show there was no difference in axon regeneration or function when secondary transection was performed at 5 or 15 minutes post burn, suggesting that increased exposure to hypotonic solution is not the reason for defects in axon outcomes after burn injury.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94995-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This is an interesting study in which the authors show that a thermal injury leads to extensive sensory axon damage and impaired regrowth compared to a mechanical transection injury. This correlates with increased keratinocyte migration. That migration is inhibited by CK666 drug treatment and isotonic medium. Both restrict ROS signalling to the wound edge. In addition, the isotonic medium also rescues the regrowth of sensory axons and recovery of sensory function. The findings may have implications for understanding non-optimal re-innervation of burn wounds in mammals.</p><p>The interpretation of results is generally cautious and controls are robust.</p><p>Here are some suggestions for additional discussion:</p><p>The study compares burn injury which produces a diffuse injury to a mechanical cut injury which produces focal damage. It would help the reader to give a definition of wound edge in the burn situation. Is the thermally injured tissue completely dead and is resorbed or do axons have to grow into damaged tissue? The two-cut model suggests the latter. Also giving timescales would help, e.g. when do axons grow in relation to keratinocyte movement? An introductory cartoon might help.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these insightful comments and questions. The burn wound is defined as the area that is directly damaged as a result of increased heat (labeled by FM dye entry), and the burn wound edge as the first line of healthy cells adjacent to the burned cells. These definitions have been added to the text to clarify the areas referenced. Recent experiments lead us to believe the wound area is composed almost completely of dead cells, but we are currently working to discover the fate of these dead cells as well as the wound adjacent cells that migrate to the wound edge after burn. As a result, we do not know whether axons grow into damaged tissue or if the damaged tissue is extruded, but we do see growth cone formation within a few hours after wounding suggesting the axons are actively trying to regenerate after a burn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could treatment with CK666 or isotonic solution influence sensory axons directly, or through other non-keratinocyte cell types, such as immune cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have done experiments looking at the density of caudal fin innervation in CK666, isotonic, or DPI treated fins. The axon density is unchanged in all these treatments compared to control treated larvae, so we do not believe these treatments affect axon health homeostatically. These data have been added to supplemental figure 3. Additionally, one of the benefits of the larval zebrafish burn model is the simplicity of the system – the epidermis is primarily composed of sensory axons, mesenchymal cells and keratinocytes. The burn environment is proinflammatory so it does promote immune cell recruitment, but we do not believe the immune cells are interacting directly with sensory axons besides clearing axonal debris. Previous papers by our lab have shown that peak immune cell recruitment occurs at 6 hpw, but they localize to the damaged tissue in the burn area and not the wound edge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Fister and colleagues use regeneration of the larval zebrafish caudal fin to compare the effects of two modes of tissue damage-transection and burn-on cutaneous sensory axon regeneration.

Basal epithelial migration is necessary for embryonic development.

The chimeric expression of the dominant negative Rac was either damaging to the larvae or the mosaicism was too low to observe any effects on migration phenotype.</p><p>We also attempted a genetic approach to manipulate ROS production, as discussed above. We found that the DUOX morpholino was lethal to burned larvae. Finally, we attempted pharmacological inhibition of ROS production using the inhibitor DPI (Diphenyleneiodonium).

Figure 3D is comprised of still images taken from supplemental movie 2, which is a timelapse of keratinocytes/axons moving together after a burn injury.

We have revised the text to say axon movement, not sensory neuron movement.</p><p>Over the time course of axonal movement (1 hour post-burn), it is not possible that neuronal growth cones contribute to movement, as this is too slow – previous work by other labs has shown that it takes several hours for axons to fully regenerate into amputated tissue, with movement not even noticeable until about 3 hours post-wound (Rieger and Sagasti, PLOS Biology, 2011).</p><p>Regarding the second point, “neuron” vs. “axon” is an inconsistency in the text that has been corrected. “Neuron” is used when referring to the cell as a whole, “axon” is used when referring to the processes that innervate the caudal fin. The axons are physically pulled along with keratinocytes as they migrate after burn application. From our observations, growth cones appear closer to the wound site after the movement has stopped.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4G It is surprising that the visual differences in the distribution of values are not statistically significant.</p></disp-quote><p>The distribution of values in 4G was large and that is why there is no statistically-significant difference – we were also surprised at this result. We did all statistics with a statistician and this included rigorous criteria for significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4H The images seem to show a difference, whereas the quantification does not. I suggest choosing more representative images.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4H has been updated to include a more representative image of axon patterning with CK666 treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6A The text states that axon damage in the control and isotonic condition is comparable, yet in the image, it appears that the damage in the isotonic treatment at 0 hpw is more distal.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good observation that we consistently see in isotonic-treated fish after burn. Axon damage localizes more proximally in isotonic-treated samples because the keratinocytes distal to the notochord are likely dead, and the axons innervating those cells are likely immediately destroyed upon burn application. As a result, the distal axons are not present to express GCaMP. We believe isotonic treatment allows keratinocytes to live slightly longer, so axon damage is therefore prevented for longer. This is also the focus of continuing work to further understand the burn microenvironment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the materials section could mention bias mitigation measures, e.g. withholding the treatment condition from the experimenter in the touch test.</p></disp-quote><p>We minimized bias in experiments whenever possible, and the conservative statistical measures that were applied to our data further reduce the likelihood of false significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- Line numbers would have facilitated reviewer feedback.</p><p>- Supplementary movies were missing in the submission.</p></disp-quote><p>The lack of supplementary movies upon submission was a mistake and the movies have been uploaded along with the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>- Pg. 3: &quot;In response to tissue damage, sensory neurons undergo rapid and localized axonal degeneration 4,5.&quot; Not sure reference 4 (Reyes et al) is appropriate here as this study was not in the context of tissue damage.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this section as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>- The expected expression pattern/localization of several transgenes was unclear. Please clearly state what cell type(s) each should label. For example, pg. 5 - &quot;We next sought to further investigate sensory neuron function in burned tissue. For this, we assessed wound-induced axonal damage using zebrafish larvae that express the calcium probe GCaMP.&quot; Where is GCaMP expressed?</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been updated to include expression patterns for the included transgenes – in this mentioned case, GCaMP is expressed in neurons under the pan-neuronal Elavl3 promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Introducing the GCaMP labeling could use some clarification. Pg. 5 - &quot;As shown previously by other groups, GCaMP labels degenerating neurons in real time35.&quot; This is confusing. Do the authors mean that GCaMP increases immediately prior to Wallerian degeneration as shown by Vargas et al. (PMID: 26558774)?</p></disp-quote><p>Sustained elevated calcium levels are associated with axon damage. Previous work from other labs has shown that calcium influx follows axon injury (Ziv and Spira, EJN 1993, Adalbert et al., Neuroscience 2012). In these experiments, whenever there are CGaMP-positive punctae, this indicates axon damage. We have revised the manuscript to address this critique.</p><p>The Elavl3-GCaMP5 transgenic line will label when calcium levels increase in neurons. However, given the parameters used for imaging in our study (20x magnification, 100 ms exposure, and collection speed every 30 seconds for timelapses), we believe that only sufficiently large increases in calcium that are indicative of cell damage, and not physiological function, are being visualized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1E - Are these panels images of the same fish? Please specify in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1E is comprised of one transected and one burned larva each, live-imaged over the course of six hours. The legend has been updated to include this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1F - How was the damage area measured? Consider doing this measurement over time to match Figure 1E.</p></disp-quote><p>Axon damage area measurements were performed similar to axon density measurements – maximum intensity z-projected confocal images of the caudal fin were generated using FIJI. For all experiments, the caudal fin area posterior to the notochord was outlined using the Polygon tool and measured to obtain a total surface area ROI. Axon fragments inside the outlined area were manually thresholded so all fragments posterior to the notochord were labeled and no saturated pixels were present, and an area measurement of these thresholded pixels was taken. We have added a section describing these measurements in the Methods section under “Axon damage quantification.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Pg. 5 - When introducing the ngn1 MO - please state the expected phenotype and cite the appropriate background literature_._</p></disp-quote><p>The ngn1 morpholino was cited in the Methods section with the appropriate literature (Cornell and Eisen, <italic>Development</italic>, 2002), from which we got the morpholino sequence. We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need for more introduction and clarification in the main text, so the ngn1 morpholino has been discussed in greater depth and cited in the main text as well using the same citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The two-wound model is an elegant approach but could be more clearly described in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>An improved explanation of the two-wound experiment has been added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- For Figure 3, it would be helpful to have a schematic of the anatomy illustrating the relative positions of axons and epidermal cell types.</p><p>- Figure 3C - should an additional control here be transected? Given that the krt4:lifeact transgene labels both layers of the epidermis, how were the superficial and basal keratinocytes separated? Interpretation of this section should be carefully worded. The authors state that &quot;...suggesting that the superficial keratinocytes are being pulled by the motile basal keratinocytes&quot; (pg.7) but isn't another possibility that the superficial cells are stationary?</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that the krt4:lifeact transgene labels both layers of keratinocytes, which together span 20-30 microns. These layers were separated from the same z-stack collected by confocal imaging. The first z-slice and last z-slice of the same stack were separated using FIJI and pseudocolored to appear as different colors. This clarification has been added to the Methods.</p><p>Prior observations with the krt4:lifeact and krt4:utrch (figure 3A) transgenic lines reveal that both keratinocyte layers will move distally after burn application.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Pg. 7 - &quot;The axons of sensory neurons are ensheathed within actin-rich channels running through basal keratinocytes 50,51.&quot; ref 51 is a <italic>C. elegans</italic> paper which does not have basal keratinocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>This was in error. The correct reference has replaced reference 51 (O’brien, <italic>J Comp. Neurol.</italic>, 2012), in which electron microscopy is used to document the development of two layers of epithelial cells that also ensheath sensory neurons in a protective manner similar to glial cells in the central nervous system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figures S1E and F - the authors state that RB and DRG soma don't move. However, it was unclear from the figure panels and legend whether the authors imaged neurons that actually innervate the caudal fin (rather than some other region of the animal). Please clarify. For comparison, Fig S1F needs a pre-injury image to be meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>The imaged cell bodies were those in the posterior trunk region, which are responsible for innervating the posterior sections of the fish including the caudal fin.

For example, would the addition of CK666 to the Isotonic +1 hpw treatment improve axon regeneration? Can the authors directly manipulate ROS signaling (e.g., through exogenous addition of H2O2 or duox1 MO) to alter regeneration outcomes in their wounding assays?</p></disp-quote><p>See the comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 6 title - consider removing or clarifying the word &quot;excessive&quot; here</p></disp-quote><p>The title has been revised according to the reviewer suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- hpw vs hpb were used inconsistently throughout the text</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been revised to use “hpw” when referring to the timeframe after injury application.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods:</p><p>- Zebrafish transgenics are missing allele names</p><p>References:</p><p>- Many mistakes were noted in this section e.g., journal names missing, wrong authors, typos, DOIs misformatted</p></disp-quote><p>The references section has been corrected to use formatting consistent with APA citation and eLife preferred guidelines.</p></body></sub-article></article>
