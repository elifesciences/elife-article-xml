How the stem cell activation is triggered by the rupture and promptly turns on proliferation is unclear. Our previous study has identified that Protein C Receptor (Procr) marks OSE progenitors. In this study, we observed decreased adherent junction and selective activation of YAP signaling in Procr progenitors at OSE rupture site. OSE repair is impeded upon deletion of Yap1 in these progenitors. Interestingly, Procr+ progenitors show lower expression of Vgll4, an antagonist of YAP signaling. Overexpression of Vgll4 in Procr+ cells hampers OSE repair and progenitor proliferation, indicating that selective low Vgll4 expression in Procr+ progenitors is critical for OSE repair. In addition, YAP activation promotes transcription of the OSE stemness gene <italic>Procr</italic>. The combination of increased cell division and Procr expression leads to expansion of Procr+ progenitors surrounding the rupture site. These results illustrate a YAP-dependent mechanism by which the stem/progenitor cells recognize the murine ovulatory rupture, and rapidly multiply their numbers, highlighting a YAP-induced stem cell expansion strategy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ovarian surface epithelium</kwd><kwd>ovulatory rupture repair</kwd><kwd>adult stem

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the adult reproductive cycles, the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) undergoes recurring ovulatory rupture and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaytán et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auersperg et al., 2001</xref>). After ovulation, to maintain the physiological function and morphology of the ovary, the wound is completely closed within 12 hr to 3 days following rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burdette et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ng and Barker, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tan and Fleming, 2004</xref>). Cells surrounding the damaged sites are required to respond to the wound by turning on cell proliferation to supply sufficient cells as building blocks for regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Our previous study has identified that Procr+ OSE stem/progenitor cells are the major contributor for ovulatory rupture repair. Targeted ablation of these cells hampers the repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that Procr+ cells expand instantly upon ovulation, reminiscent of a result of symmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). It remains unknown how the stem cell is triggered by the ovulation event, and what is the signal that links the rupture to the instant stem cell expansion.</p><p>The cue for this stem/progenitor cell amplification likely comes from a particular extracellular signal occurring upon ovulation. One possibility is that the follicular fluid expelled during ovulation consists of Wnts and other potential niche signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nilsson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parrott et al., 2000</xref>), which may regulate Procr+ stem/progenitor cell expansion. Another possibility is the involvement of mechanical force-induced signals, either through the change of adherent junctions or via a directed mechanism during ovulation, resulting in Procr+ stem/progenitor cell expansion.</p><p>YAP (Yes-associated protein, also known as YAP1) signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway and a master regulator of organ size and tissue growth during animal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moya and Halder, 2019</xref>). As a downstream effector, YAP is critical for regeneration in different organs, through triggering cell proliferation, cell survival, or expansion of stem and progenitor cell compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johnson and Halder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moya and Halder, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Panciera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang and Del Re, 2017</xref>). YAP is a transcriptional coactivator protein that shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, and regulates the expression of target genes, such as <italic>Ccn1</italic> and <italic>Birc5</italic>, through binding with TEAD transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Totaro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Vgll4, a member of Vestigial-like proteins, serves as a transcriptional repressor of YAP through direct interactions with TEADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). Previous studies from us and others have demonstrated the important roles of Vgll4 plays during development and regeneration in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Suo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Cell–cell junctions links cells to each other in epithelial tissues, and is an upstream negative regulator of YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ramos and Camargo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Mechanical forces regulate cell–cell adhesion stability, and cell–cell adhesion junctions may be intrinsically weak at high forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pinheiro and Bellaϊche, 2018</xref>). It has been shown that disruption of adherent junctions turns on YAP nuclear activities in lung stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether YAP signaling is implicated in ovulatory rupture repair is unknown.</p><p>In this study, we investigated how OSE stem/progenitor cells are triggered by the rupture postovulation and divide subsequently. We found that, in the proximity of rupture site, decreased adherent junction is associated with increased incidence of Yap1 nuclear localization in OSE cells. Interestingly, only Procr+ OSE cells displayed a low level of Vgll4, allowing YAP signaling activation, and conditional deletion of Yap1 in Procr+ cells hampers OSE repair. We generated a new <italic>TetO-Vgll4</italic> mouse. Ectopic expression of Vgll4 in the stem/progenitor cells using <italic>Procr-rtTA;TetO-Vgll4</italic> mice blocked OSE ovulatory repair. Moreover, we found that YAP signaling activation resulted in Procr+ cells expansion at the rupture site, through the combination of inducing cell division, and directly activating Protein C Receptor (Procr) transcription. The activation of Procr is essential, as when Procr was deleted, stemness property was lost and OSE repair was hindered.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Decreased E-cadherin expression at the rupture site and selective activation of YAP signaling in Procr+ cells</title><p>To investigate what could be the potential extracellular stimuli at the rupture site, we performed immunostaining of various adherent or tight junction components on ovarian sections. To increase rupture incidences, superovulation was induced by injection of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and the ovaries were harvested at 0.5 days after HCG injection when ovulation just occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that E-cadherin, α-catenin, and ZO-1 staining is markedly decreased at the proximal region of rupture (defined as within 20 cells on one side of the rupture in section) compared to other regions, that is, rupture distal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and nonrupture region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>). As adherent junction has been implicated as a modulator of YAP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schlegelmilch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Varelas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), we examined YAP activities at the rupture area by immunostaining. We observed an increased incidence of nuclear Yap1 at the proximal region of rupture compared to other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). These results suggest that compromised adherent junctions resulting from ovulatory rupture are associated with Yap1 nuclear localization in OSE cells surrounding the wound.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rupture-induced YAP signaling activation is preferentially activated in Procr+ progenitors at the rupture sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sections from wild-type ovaries at ovulation stage were stained with Krt8 (K8) and E-cadherin (E-cad).

Scale bar, 20 μm. (M) A proposed model of YAP activation in Procr+ cells promoting OSE progenitor cell expansion. Procr+ OSE progenitors have intrinsically lower level of Vgll4 compared to Procr− OSE cells. At ovulation, cell–cell junctions at rupture site were disrupted, which induces the possibility of YAP activation in all OSE cells surrounding the rupture. However, the lower expression of Vgll4 in Procr+ cells allowed YAP activation in the progenitor cells at this area. YAP activation in Procr+ cells promoted cell division, and importantly, it directly upregulates Procr expression in the dividing cells, resulting in expansion of Procr+ progenitors around the wound.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5sdata1"><label>Figure 5—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Numeric data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, H, K, L</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-75449-fig5-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75449-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we addressed the molecular mechanism which links the ovulatory rupture to OSE stem/progenitor cells activation, thus promptly turning on proliferation and repairing the wound. Our findings support the following model. Procr+ OSE progenitors have intrinsically lower levels of Vgll4. Upon ovulatory rupture, the decreased adherent junction at the proximity of the rupture site promotes Yap1 nuclear localization. These intrinsic and extrinsic factors together lead to YAP signaling activation in Procr+ progenitors around the wound, which sequentially stimulates the proliferation of the progenitors. Importantly, YAP activation directly upregulates Procr expression in the dividing cells, resulting in the expansion of Procr+ progenitors around the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). Blocking YAP signaling in the progenitors by Yap1-cKO or Vgll4-OE impairs the progenitors’ activities and hinders OSE repair. Furthermore, Procr function is essential for these progenitors. When Procr was deleted, stem cell property was lost hindering OSE repair.</p><p>While we uncovered the significance of selective activation of YAP in OSE progenitors, it is still unclear how ovarian rupture is sensed and how YAP signaling is induced by injury. We observed reduced cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin is lowered at the site of the ovarian rupture, and it is previously known that E-cadherin signals through the Hippo pathway to block YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). The current missing link is why and how E-cadherin would be reduced at the ovarian rupture site. We speculate that during the late stage of follicle development, the pre-ovulatory follicle forms a protrusion toward OSE. Subsequently, ovulation generates a rupture on OSE. These contiguous events likely induce the thinning of OSE surrounding the pre-ovulatory follicles and at the proximity of the rupture site, resulting in the reduced adherent junction proteins. Yet, there are other potentially more direct possibilities, i.e. mechanical stretching induces YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halder et al., 2012</xref>). First, the pre-ovulatory follicle protrusion or the release of oocytes induces a mechanical force on the OSE surrounding the wound, activating YAP signaling. Second, at the rupture site, epithelial cells no longer become packed together because the epithelium has been denuded, therefore potentially cells flanking the rupture site would become ‘stretched’, consequently actives YAP.</p><p>YAP signaling promotes Procr+ cell expansion at the rupture site through a combination of increased cell division and Procr expression. In the current study, YAP is particularly activated in Procr+ progenitor cells at the rupture site. We observed that at the rupture sites, Vgll4 is highly expressed in Procr− cells, preventing YAP pathway activation in those cells around the rupture sites. Our findings demonstrate that the reduced levels of Vgll4 in Procr+ progenitors likely contribute to the selective activation of YAP signaling in these cells. Further study should investigate what mechanism determines the lower expression of Vgll4 in Procr+ progenitor cells.</p><p>In the current study, we generated a new <italic>TetO-Vgll4</italic> mouse model that enables the overexpression of Vgll4 in a specific cell type. The overexpression of Vgll4 in the progenitor of OSE has been validated using <italic>Procr-rtTA</italic>. The advantages brought by our <italic>TetO-Vgll4</italic> reporter will be of broad value in studies of Hippo-Yap signaling across all tissues.</p><p>Procr expression is initially found on the surface of vascular cells exerting an anticoagulation role, by binding and activating protein C (PC) in the extracellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukudome et al., 1998</xref>). More recently, studies from us and others have identified Procr as a stem cell surface marker in multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), but less is known regarding the function of Procr in stem/progenitor cells. In the current study, we demonstrate that, Procr is essential for the proliferation of Procr+ progenitor cells and OSE repair upon rupture. Our previous report indicated that PROCR concomitantly activates multiple pathways including ERK, PI3K–Akt–mTOR, and RhoA–Rock–P38 signaling in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We speculate that similar intracellular pathways might be involved in the Procr+ OSE cells. Procr is regarded as a Wnt target gene from an in vitro screen in mammary stem cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we identify YAP as a novel upstream regulator of Procr. ChIP-qPCR and promoter luciferase experiments demonstrate that <italic>Procr</italic> transcription can be directly upregulated by YAP activation.</p><p>The phenomena of YAP promoting stem/progenitor cell expansion have been reported in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beverdam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camargo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ramos and Camargo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schlegelmilch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, in this process, less is known about how YAP maintains stem cell properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report illustrating a mechanism through which YAP promotes cell proliferation, and simultaneously upregulates the expression of an essential stemness gene to maintain cell fate, leading to a rapid expansion of stem cell numbers around the wound. In summary, our study provides new evidence and molecular insights into how ovulatory rupture triggers the activation of OSE stem cells, resulting inpromptly expanding their numbers for repair. This may have a broad implication to understand the action of tissue stem cells during would healing in other tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Lead contact and materials availability</title><p>Further information and requests for reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Yi Arial Zeng (yzeng@sibcb.ac.cn).

The ovary thus undergoes successive waves of injury. The mechanisms through which the ovary's surface epithelium is repaired remain incompletely understood. Multiple candidate stem and progenitor cells have been described for the ovarian surface epithelium (Ng and Barker, 2015; Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol), and the authors of the present report have previously demonstrated that Procr+ progenitors contribute to ovarian rupture repair (Wang et al., 2019; Nature Communications).</p><p>In the present report, the authors attempt to answer the fascinating question of how progenitors sense tissue injury in order to effect regeneration; broadly speaking, how tissues sense injury is one of the biggest questions in the field of stem cell biology. The authors show that the transcriptional coactivator Yap is expressed by Procr+ ovarian epithelial progenitors, and is necessary for rupture repair. This is demonstrated through two parallel methods: directly deleting Yap (Figure 2) or overexpressing Vgll4, which encodes a Yap antagonist (Figure 3). Both of these genetic manipulations are specifically conducted in Procr+ ovarian epithelial progenitors in vivo.</p><p>While the authors convincingly show that Yap is necessary for ovarian rupture repair, the biggest unanswered question in the paper is, mechanistically, how the rupture is actually sensed (i.e., what turns on Yap?) Yap is a transcriptional coactivator that is repressed by the Hippo mechanotransduction pathway, and there are multiple mechanical inputs (e.g., cell adhesion, cell stretching, extracellular matrix stiffness, and cell density) that can all regulate the Hippo pathway (Halder et al., 2012; Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol). The authors claim that the E-cadherin cell-adhesion protein is lowered at the site of the ovarian rupture (Figure 1), and it was previously known that E-cadherin signals through the Hippo pathway to block Yap (Yang et al., 2015; PNAS).</p><p>However the missing link in the paper is why E-cadherin would be reduced at the ovarian rupture site. There are other potentially more direct possibilities. For instance, it is known that mechanical stretching induces Yap (Halder et al., 2012; Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol). First, during the process of egg release, overlying epithelial cells will possibly become &quot;stretched&quot;, which would induce Yap? Second, at the rupture site, epithelial cells will no longer become packed together because the epithelium has been denuded: so potentially cells flanking the rupture site would become &quot;stretched&quot;, which would also activate Yap? These ideas are speculative, but are intended to try to assist the authors in formulating a mechanistic link between ovarian ruptures and Yap activation. For instance, the authors could consider looking at cell stretching/roundness/morphology by imaging.</p><p>In summary, the authors show that Yap is required for ovarian regeneration, consistent with the well-known roles of Yap in cell proliferation and tissue repair in other contexts (Ramos and Camargo, 2012; Trends in Cell Biology). However the authors may not have fully addressed the question they posed in the Introduction, namely how is ovarian rupture sensed and how is Yap itself induced by injury.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>There are multiple merits to this paper, including the demonstration that Yap is required in Procr+ ovarian progenitors to drive rupture repair. However the missing link in the manuscript is how tissue rupture is sensed and how Yap is turned on: something that the authors raised in the Introduction of their paper. The authors show E-cadherin is decreased at the rupture (Figure 1), but it is unclear why E-cadherin should be decreased.</p><p>An open question remains whether the authors need to find the &quot;rupture sensing mechanism&quot; (i.e., what is upstream of Yap) to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. It is also possible that without finding this mechanism that the manuscript could be published. But in that case, the authors may want to tone down their claims that they discovered how &quot;stem cell senses the rupture and promptly turns on proliferation&quot;.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. The ovary is an understudied organ, and this study sheds light onto its regenerative powers.</p><p>2. The authors specifically examine the role of Yap in a defined cell population (Procr+ progenitors), instead of perturbing Yap in the whole organ.</p><p>3. Two parallel approaches are used to block Yap: directly deleting Yap (Figure 2) or overexpressing Vgll4, which encodes a Yap antagonist (Figure 3). Both of these perturbations compromise effective rupture repair. Yap deletion also reduces the frequency of Procr+ progenitors (Figure 4).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. Why is E-cadherin decreased at rupture sites? (Figure 1a)</p><p>2. The authors suggest that nuclear Yap is induced in superficial epithelial cells nearby the rupture (Figure 1b). While the higher-magnification images are a bit easier to interpret, the zoomed-out image (leftmost image in Figure 1b) is not that clear. Yap seems to be expressed in many cells, including deeper cells (i.e., not superficial epithelial cells) and even some cells quite far away from the rupture.</p><p>3. The authors claim that reduced Vgll4 levels in Procr+ progenitors (as opposed to Procr- non-progenitors) renders Procr+ progenitors hyper-sensitive to Yap activation. However there is a fairly modest ~2-fold difference in Vgll4 mRNA between Procr+ vs. Procr- cells (Figure 3b) – is this enough to substantially change a cell's receptiveness to Yap signaling?</p><p>4. The notion that Procr itself is required for ovarian regeneration is potentially interesting (Figure 5). However, Procr is expressed in multiple cell-types within the ovary; the authors actually showed that vascular cells are a major population of Procr+ cells (Wang et al., 2019; Nature Communications). Is it possible that when Procr is deleted that the epithelial progenitors themselves are not significantly impacted, but rather the impaired regeneration can be ascribed to vascular (or other) defects? Procr-/- mice die of vascular defects (Gu et e al., 2002; J Biol Chem).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The wound healing process during the normal ovulation process is a very interesting but poorly understood process. Wang et al. intend to identify molecular mechanisms by which tissue-resident stem/progenitor cells engage in response to epithelium rupture. Wang et al. made use of a marker gene, Procr, to investigate stem/progenitor population in the ovarian epithelium that was described in their earlier publication. With the advantage of being able to isolate and characterize this population, strengths of the methods employed in the manuscript involves the usage of several novel mouse strains to perform lineage tracing or genetic ablation specifically in the Procr+ cells versus other epithelial cells that lack Procr expression. The strengths of the results in this study revealed compelling functional phenotypes in respect to loss of function (YAP, Procr) and gain of function (Vgll4) in the context of ovarian rupture repair process.</p><p>The weakness of the methods is the means of inducing ovarian epithelium rupture requires the usage of two hormones, which can also activate YAP pathway independently. Although this does not have a large impact on the conclusions, it is important to recognize the observation on YAP pathway is associated with this specific experimental method. However, multiple methods were used to identify functional consequences of ovarian rupture repair; the conclusions are well supported by the results. In addition, the authors generated several new transgenic mouse strains (Procr-rtTA, TetO-Vgll4, Procrflox) to address the functional relevance of cell type of origin as well as the roles of YAP signaling pathway. These strains will be useful resources for the community.</p><p>1. The title and main conclusion of the study on selective activation of the YAP pathway within Procr+ progenitors were supported by the detection of a single target Cyr61 examined by RNA in situ hybridization. If feasible, the authors are encouraged to examine additional target genes by the same or another independent method (such as qPCR), to strengthen their main conclusion.</p><p>2. In Line 115, the authors state &quot;various adherent or tight junction components&quot; were examined. However, the results showed the effect on E-cadherin only. Did the authors examine multiple components or just one? Additional adherens junction proteins besides E-cadherin (such as a-catenin) would be helpful to reinforce their conclusion.</p><p>3. Resolution of the images on YAP immunostaining (Figure 1d, 1e) was too poor to discriminate between nuclear or cytoplasmic staining patterns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75449.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were generally positive about this manuscript.
