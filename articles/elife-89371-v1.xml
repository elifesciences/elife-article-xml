that a massively parallel reporter assay, mSTARR-seq, could be used to simultaneously test for both enhancer-like activity and DNA methylation-dependent enhancer activity for millions of loci in a single experiment (Lea et al., 2018). Here, we apply mSTARR-seq to query nearly the entire human genome, including almost all CpG sites profiled either on the commonly used Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array or via reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. We show that fragments containing these sites are enriched for regulatory capacity, and that methylation-dependent regulatory activity is in turn sensitive to the cellular environment. In particular, regulatory responses to interferon alpha (IFNA) stimulation are strongly attenuated by methyl marks, indicating widespread DNA methylation-environment interactions. In agreement, methylation-dependent responses to IFNA identified via mSTARR-seq predict methylation-dependent transcriptional responses to challenge with influenza virus in human macrophages. Our observations support the idea that pre-existing DNA methylation patterns can influence the response to subsequent environmental exposures—one of the tenets of biological embedding. However, we also find that, on average, sites previously associated with early life adversity are not more likely to functionally influence gene regulation than expected by chance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenome</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>biological embedding</kwd><kwd>early life adversity</kwd><kwd>MPRA</kwd><kwd>IFNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD088558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tung</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32HD095616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>Rachel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007631</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institute for Advanced Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Child Brain and Development Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tung</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Sloan Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Career Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tung</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Foerster-Bernstein Postdoctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>Rachel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Consequently, it has received a high level of attention as a potential pathway linking environmental exposures to downstream trait variation, especially when these exposures are separated temporally, as proposed by the ‘biological embedding’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hertzman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hertzman, 2012</xref>). In a canonical example, gestational manipulation of methyl donors in mice is causally implicated in changes in DNA methylation and expression levels of the <italic>agouti</italic> gene, which in turn affects susceptibility to obesity and insulin resistance later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolinoy et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying the <italic>agouti</italic> case—’metastable’ methylation of an inserted intracisternal A particle [IAP] class retrovirus—is now thought to be unusual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear whether the many reports of environment-DNA methylation associations are likely to represent links along a causal pathway to phenotype, or are better viewed as passive biomarkers of exposure.</p><p>Experimental tests of the causal impact of DNA methylation on gene regulation indicate that both scenarios are possible. In vitro studies reveal that transcription factor binding is frequently (but not ubiquitously) sensitive to DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Malley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yin et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, epigenomic editing of DNA methylation marks has been shown to alter the activity of transcription factors important in disease and development in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenberg and Bourc’his, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yim et al., 2020</xref>), as well as the formation of CTCF-mediated gene loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lei et al., 2017</xref>). However, other epigenetic editing studies show that, even within the same regulatory element, changes in DNA methylation have functional consequences for gene expression at only a subset of sites (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, in the native genome, enhancer activity appears to be insensitive to DNA methylation levels in the majority of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kreibich et al., 2023</xref>). Time series analyses in human dendritic cells have also shown that, in response to a pathogen challenge, nearly all changes in gene expression precede changes in DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pacis et al., 2019</xref>). Such methylation changes may nevertheless be functionally relevant if they influence the speed and magnitude of subsequent challenges (e.g. by marking the accessibility of latent enhancers across cell divisions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun and Barreiro, 2020</xref>). This hypothesis may explain, for example, enhanced transcriptional responses to glucocorticoid stimulation in the descendants of hippocampal progenitor cells previously challenged with glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Provençal et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that environment-associated DNA methylation marks are mixed sets that include functionally silent sites, sites that are constitutively important for gene regulation, and sites in which DNA methylation levels affect gene regulation only under certain conditions. Disentangling which sites belong to which set is important for interpreting and prioritizing the results of a growing body of studies in the biological, social, and health sciences, especially those that test hypotheses that assume a functional role for DNA methylation, such as biological embedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hertzman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demetriou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aristizabal et al., 2020</xref>). To facilitate this process, we recently introduced a massively parallel reporter assay, mSTARR-seq, that is capable of testing the functional effects of DNA methylation on regulatory activity in high-throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lea et al., 2018</xref>). This method allowed us to test for methylation-dependent regulatory activity at millions of CpG sites in the human genome. However, our previous data set did not investigate how DNA methylation marks affect the response to environmental challenge. It also did not explicitly target the CpG sites that are the most commonly assayed in the human genome (i.e. those featured on the Illumina MethylationEPIC array).</p><p>Here, we address these gaps by using mSTARR-seq to construct a genome-wide map of DNA methylation-dependent enhancer activity for 27.3 million CpG sites in the human genome, accomplished by assessing 600 bp windows encompassing 93.5% of CpGs in the human genome as a whole. This set includes 99.3% of CpG sites present on the Illumina MethylationEPIC array, the most commonly used platform for profiling DNA methylation in humans, and 99.4% of CpG sites accessible via reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meissner et al., 2005</xref>). To evaluate the importance of DNA methylation in responses to environmental challenge, we performed mSTARR-seq under baseline conditions (i.e. no challenge) and following exposure to two physiologically relevant environmental challenges: dosage with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, which plays a central role in metabolic regulation and stress-related homeostasis, and interferon alpha (IFNA), a cytokine that elicits genomic and immunological responses associated with viral infection.</p><p>We used these data to pursue three goals. First, we describe overall patterns of regulatory activity and methylation-dependent regulatory activity across profiled sites, including how sites targeted by the EPIC array or by RRBS compare to the genome as a whole. The results of this analysis produce a new resource: a map of DNA methylation-dependent enhancer activity across the human genome. Second, we test the degree to which methylation-dependent regulatory activity is affected by exposure to steroid hormone or immune defense-related signaling molecules. Our results yield insight into the frequency of DNA methylation-environment interactions genome-wide, and provide support for the hypothesis that DNA methylation potentiates the cellular response to external stressors. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of this resource by testing two predictions of the biological embedding hypothesis: that pre-existing DNA methylation levels can affect the transcriptional response to subsequent environmental challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Provençal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun and Barreiro, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanucchi et al., 2021</xref>), and that sites linked to early life adversity (ELA) are likely to be functionally important for shaping gene expression. Our results suggest that mSTARR-seq can identify DNA methylation-environment interactions that also occur in vivo in human populations and can therefore help prioritize environment- and ELA-associated loci for future follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>mSTARR-seq captures enhancer activity and methylation-dependent enhancer activity genome-wide</title><p>We assessed regulatory activity and methylation-dependent regulatory activity for 4,558,475 600-base pair windows of the genome by pairing hybridization capture of targeted loci in the human genome with the massively parallel reporter assay, mSTARR-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lea et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, mSTARR-seq performs enzymatic manipulation of DNA methylation across hundreds of thousands to millions of reporter DNA fragments simultaneously. By measuring the ability of fragments to self-transcribe (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallego Romero and Lea, 2022</xref>), it generates estimates of the enhancer-like regulatory potential for each fragment when that fragment is in an unmethylated versus a methylated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Notably, results from the unmethylated condition are akin to those from a conventional STARR-seq experiment, in that they assess regulatory activity irrespective of CpG content or methylation status. To focus on the CpG sites most likely to be included in DNA methylation studies in humans, we performed custom capture with SeqCap EZ Prime Choice Probes (Roche), targeting all CpG sites on the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array and those likely to be profiled using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, which enriches for CpG sites near targets of <italic>MspI</italic> restriction enzyme digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because of substantial attention to potential environmental and early life effects on DNA methylation at the glucocorticoid receptor gene (<italic>NR3C1</italic>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Nusslock, 2018</xref>), we also targeted the 6.5 Mb in and flanking <italic>NR3C1</italic>. Finally, to assess background expectations for regulatory and methylation-dependent regulatory activity in the human genome, we targeted a control set of 100,000 loci for capture, chosen at random across the human genome after excluding centromeres, gaps, and uncalled bases in the hg38 genome.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study design and identification of enhancer activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sheared DNA from the GM12878 cell line was subjected to enrichment via capture with probes targeting loci selected in reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) workflows (<italic>MspI</italic> targets), CpG sites on the Infinium EPIC array, the gene <italic>NR3C1</italic> and flanking regions, and 100,000 randomly distributed control regions.

Based on our minimal criteria for assessment (600 basepair windows where at least half of the plasmid-derived DNA samples had non-zero reads covering the window; see Materials and methods), 90.2% of the human genome was included in the plasmid DNA library purified at the end of the mSTARR-seq experiment (mean sequencing depth per replicate = 30.4 million reads; mean read coverage per window = 12.723 ± 41.696 s.d.). Within this set, which also included off-target regions, windows were ~15 fold enriched for targeted regions in the genome (Fisher’s Exact Test log<sub>2</sub>(OR) 95% confidence interval (CI)=3.971 [3.934, 4.009], p&lt;1.0 x 10<sup>–300</sup>). Thus, in windows that passed our minimal assessment criteria, we successfully targeted 99.3% of CpG sites on the MethylationEPIC array and 99.4% of sites likely to be included in RRBS libraries. Across target sets, read depth was not predicted by CpG density, indicating no systematic power differences in assessing methylation-dependent activity due to differences in CpG number per window (R<sup>2</sup>=0.099, p=0.6852; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Our results are comparable to published fragment diversity levels achieved with this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lea et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because demethylation or remethylation of DNA fragments could occur within cells during the experiment, we performed bisulfite sequencing at the end of the experiment. We confirmed that DNA methylation levels were substantially higher in the methylated condition samples than in the unmethylated samples, where methylation levels were near zero (mean methylated = 0.885, mean unmethylated = 0.066, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; unpaired t-test: t=–14.66, df = 15,124, p=2.39 x 10<sup>–10</sup>). We note that the observed small deviations from 0% and 100% methylation would reduce our power to detect methylation-dependent activity, but should not incur false positive results.</p><p>To test for regulatory potential, we focused on those windows where at least three replicate samples produced non-zero RNA-seq reads in either the methylated condition or in the unmethylated condition (n=216,091 non-overlapping 600 bp windows, 4.3% of the human genome; mean DNA-seq read coverage per window = 93.907 ± 10.091 s.d.; mean RNA-seq read coverage per window = 165.093 ± 1008.816). These inclusion criteria focused our analysis on the subset of windows where we were able to detect minimal evidence of transcription from the plasmid. The proportion of the human genome showing evidence of regulatory activity in STARR-seq family assays is expected to be small based on previous work. For example, Johnson and colleagues estimated that 0.165% of the human genome had regulatory potential in unstimulated A549 cells in a genome-wide STARR-seq assay, based on the proportion of hg38 basepairs that fell in regions with regulatory activity in their assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). Among the regions analyzed here, 3721 windows (1.7%) showed evidence for regulatory activity, where the amount of RNA generated from a window significantly exceeded the amount of DNA input sequenced for the same window (FDR &lt;1%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref>; 0.082% of all windows where DNA reads were obtained in at least half of our replicate samples). Sequencing depth does not appear to constrain the ability to detect regulatory regions, as rarefaction analyses suggest that increasing sequencing depth of RNA or DNA libraries would add only a small number of additional regions with any evidence of transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Further, among analyzed windows, DNA coverage per fragment explains minimal variance in mSTARR-seq enhancer activity (R<sup>2</sup>=0.029, p&lt;1.0 x 10<sup>–300</sup>).</p><p>Regions with regulatory activity were enriched for enhancers and active promoters annotated by the ENCODE Consortium for the K562 cell line log<sub>2</sub>(OR)=0.584–3.337; all p&lt;1 x 10<sup>–3</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ernst and Kellis, 2012</xref>); note that previous research has found that many promoters can show enhancer-like activity in STARR-seq-type assays, although some promoters will be missed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2020</xref>).

This result is also concordant when we apply the current pipeline to previously published data from K562s and our new HepG2 data, which exhibit correlated effects of DNA methylation on regulatory activity in the windows examined in both cases (K562: R<sup>2</sup>=0.286 for 1250 regulatory windows with FDR &lt;1% in both data sets, p=3.19 x 10<sup>–93</sup>; HepG2: R<sup>2</sup>=0.277 for 511 regulatory windows with FDR &lt;1% in both data sets, p=8.87 x 10<sup>–38</sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>).

Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lea et al., 2018</xref>), regulatory regions with more CpGs are more likely to be repressed by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11</xref>; Spearman’s rho = 0.370, p=9.865 x 10<sup>–121</sup>; n=3,721 regions with mSTARR-seq regulatory activity).

Note that of 109 regulatory windows in the control set, 108 contain at least 1 CpG, so this difference is not because the control set is CpG-free (mean number CpGs per fragment in control set = 13.291 ± 11.179 s.d.; EPIC = 19.641 ± 14.471; RRBS = 20.870 ± 13.883; <italic>NR3C1</italic>=7.405 ± 9.409).

Consequently, differential methylation identified through RRBS is more likely to be capable of driving differences in gene regulation, as detectable by mSTARR-seq, than differential methylation elsewhere in the genome. We caution, however, that even among RRBS sites, 98.8% do not occur in regions of the genome with detectable regulatory activity in either the methylated or unmethylated conditions, at least in the K562 cell type, and 35.0% of those that fall in putative regulatory elements exhibit no evidence for methylation-dependent activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Environmental perturbation reveals cryptic regulatory elements and cryptic effects of DNA methylation</title><p>Enhancer activity can be cell type- or environment-dependent (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ostuni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaudhri et al., 2020</xref>).

These data showed that expressed genes located closest to mSTARR-seq-annotated, IFNA-specific enhancers were more strongly upregulated after IFNA stimulation than the set of expressed genes located closest to shared mSTARR-seq-annotated enhancers (i.e. those identified in both the IFNA and at least one other condition, considering genes within 100 kb maximum distance from each enhancer element; unpaired t-test; t=3.268, df = 601.88, p=1.15 x 10<sup>–3</sup>).

Nearly twice as many regulatory windows (81.4%; 1314 of 1614) exhibited methylation-dependent regulatory activity in the IFNA-specific condition than in the baseline or dex-specific condition (47.5% and 48.4% respectively; two-sided binomial test for IFNA compared to baseline: p=3.58 x 10<sup>–312</sup>). Further, regulatory regions that harbor TFBMs for TFs central to the interferon response (ISRE, IRF1, IRF2, IRF3, IRF4, IRF8; N=663 windows) strongly responded to IFNA challenge if in an unmethylated state, but mounted systematically attenuated responses if in a methylated state. As a result, 562 of these 663 windows (84.7%) exhibited significant methylation-dependent regulatory activity and 561 of them (99.8%) were more active in the IFN-challenged state when unmethylated. This pattern is recapitulated when focusing on analyzed windows with external experimental support for ISRE binding (n=1005 windows; ChIP-Seq data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>). These windows show no evidence for methylation-dependent regulatory activity in the baseline condition (paired t-test; t=–0.792, df = 1004, p=0.43), primarily because they show no regulatory activity at all without IFNA stimulation. After IFNA stimulation, though, they exhibit strong methylation-dependence. Specifically, only unmethylated windows are capable of a response (paired t-test; t=31.748, df = 1004, p=1.02 x 10<sup>–153</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Methylation levels at mSTARR-seq IFNA-specific enhancers predict the transcriptional response to influenza virus in human macrophages</title><p>Our findings show that, in the context of mSTARR-seq, pre-existing DNA methylation state can capacitate or constrain the regulatory response to IFNA stimulation.

Nevertheless, across 1382 testable loci (600 bp windows containing at least 1 CpG with interindividual variance &gt;0.01), we identified one IFNA-specific, methylation-dependent mSTARR-seq enhancer where endogenous variation in DNA methylation levels across individuals clearly predicts the response of the nearest gene’s transcriptional response to flu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>; p=6.05 x 10<sup>–5</sup>, q-value=0.0837; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp19">Supplementary file 19</xref>).

Compared to our previous work, we identify a higher rate of methylation-dependence in the present data set (47.5% of analyzed windows in the current data set versus 10% of analyzed windows from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lea et al., 2018</xref> when we apply the current pipeline to analyze both datasets; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp6">Supplementary files 3 and 6</xref>). This difference likely stems from lower variance between replicates in the present study, which increases power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Thus, our findings reveal that DNA methylation often significantly attenuates regulatory activity in K562 enhancer and promoter elements.</p><p>The results also support the idea that CpG sites identified by environment-DNA methylation association are a mixed bag. For example, despite the pervasive assumption in the literature and in popular science that early adversity causally impacts downstream outcomes through persistent epigenetic modification (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubois et al., 2019</xref>), 98% of CpG sites associated with early life adversity in the literature fell in windows with no discernable regulatory potential in K562 cells, irrespective of their methylation status or cellular state. Our findings suggest that many ELA-associated sites may be better treated as passive biomarkers of exposure rather than links on the causal pathway between early life disadvantage and later life health outcomes. However, other cell types and cellular contexts should be tested to further evaluate this hypothesis (we used the erythroleukemic K562 cell line, as ELA-associated sites are most commonly assessed in blood). For instance, while we included the dexamethasone condition here because glucocorticoid dysregulation is commonly invoked in association with the response to early life adversity, the relationship between glucocorticoid signaling and early life adversity is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eisenberger and Cole, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koss and Gunnar, 2018</xref>) and may not be well-modeled by acute glucocorticoid exposure. Given that the repertoire of poised and active enhancers often differs across cell types and cellular states, expanding experimental approaches like mSTARR-seq to other contexts can therefore serve a valuable role in prioritizing CpG sites identified in observational studies of differential methylation (e.g. CpG sites associated with disease).</p><p>Our results dovetail with work supporting the importance of CpG sites within enhancer elements in responding to environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pacis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Husquin et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, one of the most interesting findings from our analysis is the observation that DNA methylation-environment interactions are widespread in the human genome. Across thousands of genomic regions, both regulatory activity and methylation-dependent effects on regulatory activity were only detectable upon stimulation, consistent with a model in which DNA methylation contributes to epigenomic priming by modulating responsivity to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun and Barreiro, 2020</xref>). In support of this idea, IFNA-specific enhancers detected in mSTARR-seq are able to nonrandomly identify collections of loci in the genome where baseline DNA methylation also predicts the endogenous gene expression response to flu infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). This relationship is easier to discern in within-individual comparisons across loci than in locus-by-locus analyses of interindividual variation. However, we were also able to pinpoint one specific gene, <italic>ISG15</italic>, in which baseline DNA methylation explains a large fraction of population variation in the gene expression response to flu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). Notably, the effect size for <italic>ISG15</italic> is very large, accounting for over a third of total variance in the fold-change gene expression response to flu. Unfortunately, a comparable in vivo dataset for dex challenge was unavailable to conduct parallel validation studies. However, our results overall suggest that mSTARR-seq could help identify additional in vivo DNA methylation-environment interactions, given sufficiently large sample sizes and data on the environmental exposures of interest.</p><p>Applying mSTARR-seq in additional cell types may therefore help resolve whether DNA methylation is responsible for exaggerated transcriptional responses to repeated challenges, as previously suggested for glucocorticoid exposure in hippocampal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Provençal et al., 2020</xref>), or whether differential methylation after pathogen infection contributes to the emerging paradigm of ‘trained immunity’ in innate immune cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanucchi et al., 2021</xref>). More generally, while our findings agree with the idea that many differences in DNA methylation—even extreme ones (~0% versus ~100%) like those tested here—are silent with respect to transcription factor binding and gene expression (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kreibich et al., 2023</xref>), they also suggest that the functional importance of DNA methylation is likely to be underestimated without considering its interaction with the cellular environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SeqCap EZ Prime Choice XL Probes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #

Unlike in the real data, in which most windows show a strong bias towards more reads in the DNA condition (because most windows exhibit no regulatory activity, and therefore show many more input DNA reads than RNA reads), permuted data results in relatively balanced effect sizes. Using the overall distribution of p-values to construct the null therefore substantially inflates the number of significant windows, but specifically because most observed windows have systematically <italic>less</italic> activity in the RNA condition than the DNA condition, not more (the direction of interest). Thus, retaining all p-values to construct the null leads to highly miscalibrated false discovery rates because the distribution of observed values is skewed toward smaller values—because of windows with ‘significantly’ no regulatory activity—compared to the permuted data. To address this problem, for each permutation, we subsampled N windows with a positive sample type beta (corresponding to larger read counts in RNA samples versus DNA samples) in either the methylated condition, unmethylated condition, or both. Here, N is the number of windows with a positive sample type beta in the observed data (e.g. N=17,461 in the baseline dataset). The p-values from these windows were used to generate the empirical null. To define putative enhancer elements, we used an FDR cutoff of 1%.</p><p>To identify methylation-dependent enhancer activity, we focused on the windows that exhibited a positive sample type beta (i.e. exhibited more RNA reads than DNA reads) in either the methylated or unmethylated condition (or both) and tested for significant differences between <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> in the equation above (i.e. an interaction effect between RNA/DNA condition and the methylated/unmethylated condition). To estimate the false discovery rate for identifying methylation-dependent windows, we re-ran our main nested model on the same 100 sets of N windows each, in this case permuting methylation condition (unmethylated versus methylated) across sample pairs to generate the empirical null for the interaction effect of sample type (RNA versus DNA) * methylation condition (methylated or unmethylated). To define methylation-dependent regulatory elements, we again used an FDR cutoff of 1%.</p><p>To assess whether mSTARR RNA-seq and DNA-seq libraries were sequenced deeply enough to saturate detection of unique 600 bp windows included in the formal analyses, we used seqtk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lh3/seqtk">https://github.com/lh3/seqtk</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li, 2024</xref>) to randomly subset sequence reads from the raw fastq files for all RNA-seq or all DNA-seq replicates in the baseline dataset. We then applied to these data subsets the same filtering pipeline described above to generate a reduced data set of testable windows. The results of this rarefaction analysis (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) show that our sequencing depth is sufficient to capture all analyzable windows based on both the DNA read filter and the RNA read filter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs</title><p>To identify enrichment of potential transcription factor binding sites in the methylated condition, we used HOMER and motifs defined in the HOMER database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) and the baseline treatment dataset to compare motifs within regulatory regions in the methylated condition, relative to motifs across all regulatory regions.</p><p>To identify potential transcription factor binding sites in windows with condition-specific regulatory or methylation-dependent regulatory activity, we first identified regions showing regulatory activity uniquely in the dex or IFNA conditions relative to both other conditions (based on an FDR of 1% to define regulatory activity). We used HOMER and motifs defined in the HOMER database to test for enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs within windows showing condition-specific regulatory activity relative to all windows tested for regulatory activity in that condition. We set a threshold of Bonferroni-corrected p-value &lt;0.01 to identify significantly enriched binding motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Endogenous gene expression response of K562s to dex and IFNA</title><p>Endogenous RNA-seq libraries from K562 cells challenged with dex or IFNA were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S1 flow cell as 100 base pair, paired-end reads. Reads were trimmed with Trim Galore (Trim Galore version 0.6.4_dev; Cutadapt version 2.3) to remove basepairs with a Phred score less than 20, and end sequences that matched at least two basepairs of the adapter sequence. Only trimmed reads longer than 25 basepairs were retained. We used the STAR package (version 2.5.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) two-pass mapping to map the filtered reads to the hg38 genome. We retained uniquely mapped reads by filtering the output SAM file to keep reads with MAPQ = 255. We then used <italic>htseq</italic> (version 0.6.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) to quantify read counts per gene. We only retained genes that had TPM &gt;3 in at least three of six samples in at least one of the three conditions (baseline, IFNA, or dex). Only protein-coding genes were retained for final analysis, resulting in a total of 10,676 testable genes.</p><p>We performed differential expression analysis separately for IFNA and dex, by subsetting the data to the IFNA and baseline samples, or subsetting the data to the dex and baseline samples. For each subset, we <italic>voom</italic> normalized the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Law et al., 2014</xref>), and used the <italic>limma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smyth, 2005</xref>) function <italic>lmFit</italic> to model the normalized gene expression as a function of treatment, controlling for the percent of reads mapping to annotated features (to account for technical variation in the efficiency of RNA purification during library prep) and methylation condition for the associated sample. We calculated the FDR using the q-value approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>, based on an empirical null distribution that was derived from 100 permutations of treatment condition in the model.</p><p>To test whether genes were more responsive to IFNA stimulation if they were predicted targets of IFNA-specific ISRE enhancers, we first used the bedtools <italic>intersect</italic> function to identify the union set of ChIP-seq peaks for STAT1 and STAT2 (two of the three components of the ISGF3 transcription factor that binds ISRE motifs; ENCODE accession numbers ENCFF478XGE and ENCFF394KTR; ChIP-Seq data were not available for the third ISGF3 component, IRF9). We then reduced these regions to those showing significant, IFNA condition-specific regulatory activity in the mSTARR-seq dataset (FDR &lt;1%). We used K562 enhancer-gene links from EnhancerAtlas 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2016</xref>) to link the resulting IFNA-specific ISRE enhancers to their target genes. Finally, we performed a two-sided, unpaired t-test to compare the endogenous expression responses to IFNA for genes associated with putative IFNA-specific ISRE enhancers relative to genes that are not associated with IFNA-specific ISRE enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Endogenous gene expression and methylation in human macrophages</title><p>To assess effects of DNA methylation-environment interactions on gene expression in vivo, we evaluated endogenous methylation and gene expression from matched whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-seq data collected from human monocyte-derived macrophages (n=35 donors), with and without infection with the influenza A virus (IAV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aracena et al., 2024</xref>). Unsmoothed methylation counts were obtained for 19,492,906 loci in both non-infected and IAV-infected samples (total n=70) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aracena et al., 2024</xref>). We filtered loci to require coverage of ≥4 sequence reads in at least half of the non-infected or IAV-infected samples. In the RNA-seq dataset for the same 35 individuals, we excluded any genes that did not have an average RPKM &gt;2 in non-infected or IAV-infected samples. This resulted in a total of 19,041,420 CpG sites and 14,122 genes used in downstream analyses.</p><p>We calculated normalization factors using calcNormFactors in edgeR (v 3.28.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) to scale the raw library sizes. We then used the voom function in limma (v 3.42.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smyth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) to apply the normalization factors, estimate the mean-variance relationship, and convert raw read counts to log(CPM) values. Sequencing batches were regressed out using ComBat from the sva Bioconductor package (v 3.34.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leek et al., 2012</xref>), which fit a model that also included age (mean-centered) and admixture estimates. We subsequently regressed out age effects using limma. Individual-wise fold-change (FC) matrices were built by subtracting non-infected counts from IAV-infected counts for each individual using weights calculated as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aracena et al., 2024</xref>.</p><p>For comparison of the mSTARR-seq dataset to the dataset from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aracena et al., 2024</xref>, GrCh38/hg38 coordinates were lifted over to GRCh37/hg19 using the UCSC liftOver tool. We required a 0.95 minimum ratio of bases that remap, excluded loci that output multiple regions, set the minimum hit size in query to 0, and set the minimum chain size in the target to 0. The GRCh37/hg19 coordinates were used in the following analyses.</p><p>We first sought to assess, within each of the 35 individuals, the correlation between mSTARR-seq enhancer methylation levels at baseline (i.e. in non-infected cells) and transcriptional responses of their nearest genes to IAV. To find overlaps between enhancer regions and CpG loci, we used the <italic>bedtools</italic> intersect function (v2.29.1) with the ‘left outer join’ option. For each 600 bp mSTARR-seq enhancer region in each individual, we calculated the mean methylation level across all overlapping CpGs. Each enhancer was linked to its nearest gene, with a maximum distance of 100 kb, as described above. If an enhancer had multiple linked genes (e.g. an enhancer that overlapped more than one gene), we took the mean transcriptional response of all linked genes. For each individual, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between the DNA methylation levels within the mSTARR-seq-defined enhancer windows, in non-infected cells, and transcriptional responses of their linked genes to IAV infection. We also investigated the correlation between mean mSTARR-seq enhancer window methylation and gene expression <italic>within</italic> non-infected and flu-infected samples separately.</p><p>Finally, for each mSTARR-seq enhancer-gene pair, we sought to test the extent to which average methylation level in the enhancer in non-infected samples explained the gene’s transcriptional response to IAV, across individuals. Here, we calculated the average CpG methylation level for each 600 bp enhancer, after excluding CpGs with methylation variance less than 0.01 across individuals. Thus, enhancers that did not contain any CpGs with appreciable interindividual variation in DNA methylation levels were excluded from the analysis. This filtering step resulted in 1,382 enhancer-gene pairs for this analysis. For each enhancer-gene pair, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (and R<sup>2</sup>) between the average methylation level of the enhancer and the transcriptional response of the linked gene. p-values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the q-value method in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>CpG methylation associated with early life adversity</title><p>We performed a literature search to identify studies for which CpG methylation differences have been linked to adverse conditions during early life. We considered all journal articles that contained the words ‘early life adversity’ and ‘Infinium’ on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scholar.google.com">https://scholar.google.com</ext-link> on May 10, 2021, which produced 269 results. We required that the study evaluated CpG methylation using an Illumina Infinium array (27K, 450K, or EPIC), and that the article provided Infinium CpG probe IDs or CpG genomic coordinates of candidate CpGs. Articles that reported no significant CpG sites, but still reported ‘top’ CpG sites, were retained. Articles that performed analyses to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs; as opposed to CpG site-by-site analysis), and then reported individual CpG sites within the candidate DMRs, were retained. We considered early life adversity to encompass both social and nonsocial sources of environmental adversity (e.g. exposure to severe weather), any time from prenatal development to 18 years of age. We did not impose criteria for cell type or subject age at time of sampling.

This is a follow-up of their first paper from 2018 that describes this method for the first time. In addition to adding more in depth information on sequences that are explored by many researchers using two main methods, reduced bisulfite sequencing and sites represented on the Illumina EPIC array, they now show also that DNA methylation can influence changes in regulatory activity following a specific stimulation, even in absence of baseline effects of DNA methylation on activity. In this manuscript, the authors explore the effects of DNA methylation on the response to Interferon alpha (INFA) and a glucocorticoid receptor agonist (dexamethasone). The author validate their baseline findings using additional datasets, including RNAseq data and show convergences across two cell lines. The authors then map the methylation x environmental challenge (IFNA and dex) sequences identified in vitro to explore whether their methylation status is also predictive of regulatory activity in vivo. This is very convincingly shown for INFA response sequences, where baseline methylation is predictive of the transcriptional response to flu infection in human macrophages, an infection that triggers the INF pathways. The extension of the functional validity of the dex-response altering sequences is less convincing. Sequences altering the response to glucocorticoids, however, were not enriched in DNA methylation sites associated with exposure to early adversity which the authors interpret that &quot;they are not links on the causal pathway between early life disadvantage and later life health outcomes, but rather passive biomarkers. However, this approach does not seem an optimal model to explore this relationship in vivo. This is because exposure to early adversity and its consequences is not directly correlated with glucocorticoid release and changes in DNA methylation levels following early adversity could be related to many physiological mechanisms, and overall, large datasets and meta-analyses do not show robust associations of exposure to early adversity and DNA methylation changes.

To this end, the authors use mSTARR-seq, a high-throughput method, which they have previously developed, where sequences are tested for their regulatory activity in two conditions (methylated and unmethylated) using a reporter gene. The authors use these data to study two aspects of DNA methylation: 1. Its effect on expression, and 2. Its interaction with the environment. Overall, they identify a small number of 600 bp windows that show regulatory potential, and a relatively large fraction of these show an effect of methylation on expression. In addition, the authors find regions exhibiting methylation-dependent response to two environmental stimuli (interferon alpha and glucocorticoid dexamethasone).</p><p>The questions the authors address represent some of the most central in functional genomics, and the method utilized is currently the best method to do so. The scope of this study is very impressive and I am certain that these data will become an important resource for the community. The authors are also able to report several important findings, including that pre-existing DNA methylation patterns can influence the response to subsequent environmental exposures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89371.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>Rachel A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zoo New England; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; Duke University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge, MA</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Aracena</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Barreiro</surname><given-names>Luis B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago, IL</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lea</surname><given-names>Amanda J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Princeton University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Princeton</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tung</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Leipzig</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors explore the effects of DNA methylation on the strength of regulatory activity using massively parallel reporter assays in cell lines on a genome-wide level.

We note that genes close to dex-specific mSTARR-seq enhancers tend to be more strongly upregulated after dex stimulation than those near shared enhancers, which parallels our results for IFNA (lines 341-344). However, there is unfortunately no comparable data set to the human flu data set (i.e., with population-based whole genome-bisulfite sequencing data before and after dex challenge), so we could not perform a parallel in vivo validation step. We have added this caveat to the revised manuscript (lines 555-557).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sequences altering the response to glucocorticoids, however, were not enriched in DNA methylation sites associated with exposure to early adversity.

We have expanded the set of caveats regarding the lack of enrichment of early adversity-reported sites in the mSTARR-data set (lines 527-533). Specifically, we note that the relationship between early adversity and glucocorticoid physiology is complex (e.g., Eisenberger and Cole, 2012; Koss and Gunnar, 2018) and that dex challenge models one aspect of glucocorticoid signaling but not others (e.g., glucocorticoid resistance). Nevertheless, we also see little evidence for enrichment of early adversity-associated sites in the mSTARR data set at baseline, independently of the dex challenge experiment (lines 483-485; Figure 4).</p><p>We also agree that large data sets (e.g., Houtepen et al., 2018; Marzi et al., 2018) and reviews (e.g., Cecil et al., 2020) of early adversity and DNA methylation in humans show limited evidence of associations between early adversity and DNA methylation levels. However, the idea that early adversity impacts downstream outcomes remains pervasive in the literature and popular science (see Dubois et al., 2019), which we believe makes tests like ours important to pursue. We also hope that our data set (and others generated through these methods) will be useful in interpreting other settings in which differential methylation is of interest as well—in line with your comment below. We have clarified both of these points in the revised manuscript (lines 520-522; 536-539).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the authors provide a great resource of DNA methylation-sensitive enhancers that can now be used for functional interpretation of large-scale datasets (that are widely generated in the research community), given the focus on sites included in RBSS and the Illumina EPIC array.

The conclusions related to the early adversity data should be reconsidered in light of the comments above.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you! And yes, we have revised our discussion of early life adversity effects as discussed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>While the paper has a lot of strengths and provides new insight into the epigenomic regulation of enhancers as well as being a great resource, there are some aspects that would benefit from clarification.</p><p>a. It would be great to have a clearer description of how many sequences are actually passing QC in the different datasets and what the respective overlaps are in bps or 600bp windows. Now often only % are given. Maybe a table/Venn diagram for overview of the experiments and assessed sequences would help here. This concern the different experiments in the K652, A549, and Hep2G cell lines, including stimulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a supplementary figure and supplementary table providing, for each dataset, the number of 600 bp windows passing each filter (Figure 2-figure supplement 1; Supplementary File 9), as well as a supplementary figure providing an upset plot to show the number of assessed sequences shared across the experiments (Figure 2-figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. It would also be helpful to have a brief description of the main differences in assessed sequences and their coverage of the old (2018) and new libraries in the main text to be able better interpret the validation experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide information on the following characteristics for the 2018 data set versus the data set presented for the first time here: mean (± SD) number of CpGs per fragment; mean (± SD) DNA sequencing depth; and mean (± SD) RNA sequencing depth (lines 169-170 provide values for the new data set; in line 194, we reference Supplementary File 5, which provides the same values for the old data set). Notably, the coverage characteristics of analyzed windows in both data sets are quite high (mean DNA-seq read coverage = 94x and mean RNA-seq read coverage = 165x in the new data set at baseline; mean DNA-seq read coverage = 22x and mean RNA-seq read coverage = 54x in Lea et al. 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Statements of genome-wide analyses in the abstract and discussion should be a bit tempered, as quite a number of tested sites do not pass QC and do not enter the analysis. From the results it seems like from over 4.5 million sequences, only 200,000 are entering the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason why many of the windows are not taken forward into our formal modeling analysis is that they fail our filter for RNA reads because they are never (or almost never) transcribed—not because there was no opportunity for transcription (i.e., the region was indeed assessed in our DNA library, and did not show output transcription, as now shown in Figure 2-figure supplement 1). We have added a rarefaction analysis (lines 715-722 in Materials and Methods) of the DNA fragment reads to the revised manuscript which supports this point. Specifically, it shows that we are saturated for representation of unique genomic windows (i.e., we are above the stage in the curve where the proportion of active windows would increase with more sequencing: Figure 1figure supplement 4). Similarly, a parallel rarefaction curve for the mSTARR-seq RNA-seq data (Figure 1-figure supplement 4) shows that we would gain minimal additional evidence for regulatory activity with more sequencing depth. We now reference these analyses in revised lines 179-184 and point to the supporting figure in line 182.</p><p>In other words, our analysis is truly genome-wide, based on the input sequences we tested. Most of the genome just doesn’t have regulatory activity in this assay, despite the potential for it to be detected given that the relevant sequences were successfully transfected into the cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Could the authors comment on the validity of the analysis if only one copy is present (cut-off for QC)?</p></disp-quote><p>We think this question reflects a misunderstanding of our filtering criteria due to lack of clarity on our part, which we have modified in the revision. We now specify that the mean DNA-seq sequencing depth per sample for the windows we subjected to formal modeling was quite high:</p><p>93.91 ± 10.09 SD (range = 74.5 – 113.5x) (see revised lines 169-170). In other words, we never analyze windows in which there is scant evidence that plasmids containing the relevant sequence were successfully transfected (lines 170-172).</p><p>Our minimal RNA-seq criteria require non-zero counts in at least 3 replicate samples within either the methylated condition or the unmethylated condition, or both (lines 166-168). Because we know that multiple plasmids containing the corresponding sequence are present for all of these windows—even those that just cross the minimal RNA-seq filtering threshold—we believe our results provide valid evidence that all analyzed windows present the opportunity to detect enhancer activity, but many do not act as enhancers (i.e., do not result in transcribed RNA). Notably, we observe a negligible correlation between DNA sequencing depth for a fragment, among analyzed windows, and mSTARR-seq enhancer activity (R2 = 0.029; now reported in lines 183-184). We also now report reproducibility between replicates, in which all replicate pairs have r &gt; 0.89, on par with previously published STARR-seq datasets (e.g., Klein et al., 2020; Figure 1-figure supplement 6, pointed to in line 193).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. While the authors state that almost all of the control sequences contain CpGs sites, could the authors also give information on the total number of CpG sites in the different subsets? Was the number of CpGs in a 600 bp window related to the effects of DNA methylation on enhancer activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide the number of CpG sites per window in the different subsets in lines 282-284. As expected, they are higher for EPIC array sites and for RRBS sites because the EPIC array is biased towards CpG-rich promoter regions, and the enzyme typically used in the starting step of RRBS digests DNA at CpG motifs (but control sequences still contain an average of ~13 CpG sites per fragment). We also now model the magnitude of the effects of DNA methylation on regulatory activity as a function of number of CpG sites within the 600 bp windows. Consistent with our previous work in Lea et al., 2018, we find that mSTARR-seq enhancers with more CpGs tend to be repressed by DNA methylation (now reported in lines 216-219 and Figure 1figure supplement 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. In the discussion, a statement on the underrepresented regions, likely regulatory elements with lower CG content, that nonetheless can be highly relevant for gene regulation would be important to put the data in perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We agree that regulatory regions, independent of CpG methylation, can be highly relevant, and now clarify in the main text that the “unmethylated” condition of mSTARR-seq is essentially akin to a conventional STARR-seq experiment, in that it assesses regulatory activity regardless of CpG content or methylation status (lines 128-130).</p><p>Consequently, our study is well-designed to detect enhancer-like activity, even in windows with low GC content. We now show with additional analyses that we generated adequate DNA-seq coverage on the transfected plasmids to analyze 90.2% of the human genome, including target regions with no or low CpG content (lines 148-149; 153-156; Supplementary file 2). As noted above, we also now clarify that regions dropped out of our formal analysis because we had little to no evidence that any transcription was occurring at those loci, not because sequences for those regions were not successfully transfected into cells (see responses above and new Figure 1-figure supplement 4 and Figure 2-figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g. To control for differences in methylation of the two libraries, the authors sequence a single CpGs in the vector. Could the authors look at DNA methylation of the 600 bp windows at the end of the experiment, could DNA methylation of these windows be differently affected according to sequence? 48 hours could be enough for de-methylation or re-methylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that variation in demethylation or remethylation depending on fragment sequence is possible. We now state this caveat in the main text (lines 158-159), and specify that genomic coverage of our bisulfite sequencing data across replicates are (unfortunately) too variable to perform reliable site-by-site analysis of DNA methylation levels before and after the 48 hour experiment (lines 1182-1185). Instead, we focus on a CpG site contained in the adapter sequence (and thus included in all plasmids) to generate a global estimate of per replicate methylation levels. We also now note that any de-methylation or re-methylation would reduce our power to detect methylation-dependent activity, rather than leading to false positives (lines 163-165).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h. The section on the method for correction for multiple testing should be more detailed as it is very difficult to follow. Why were only 100 permutations used, the empirical p-value could then only be &lt;0.01? The description of a subsample of the N windows with positive Betas is unclear, should the permutation not include the actual values and thus all windows - or were the no negative Betas? Was FDR accounting for all elements and pairs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded the text in the Materials and Methods section to clarify the FDR calculation (lines 691, 695-699, 702, 706). We clarify that the 100 permutations were used to generate a null distribution of p-values for the data set (e.g., 100 x 17,461 p-values for the baseline data set), which we used to derive a false discovery rate. Because we base our evidence on FDRs, we therefore compare the distribution of observed p-values to the distribution of pvalues obtained via permutation; we do not calculate individual p-values by comparing an observed test statistic against the test statistics for permuted data for that individual window.</p><p>We compare the data to permutations with only positive betas because in the observed data, we observe many negative betas. These correspond to windows which have no regulatory activity (i.e., they have many more input DNA reads than RNA-seq reads) and thus have very small pvalues in a model testing for DNA-RNA abundance differences. However, we are interested in controlling the false discovery rate of windows that do have regulatory activity (positive betas). In the permuted data, by contrast and because of the randomization we impose, test statistics are centered around 0 and essentially symmetrical (approximately equally likely to be positive or negative). Retaining all p-values to construct the null therefore leads to highly miscalibrated false discovery rates because the distribution of observed values is skewed towards smaller values— because of windows with “significantly” no regulatory activity—compared to the permuted data. We address that problem by using only positive betas from the permutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i. The interpretation of the overlap of Dex-response windows with CpGs sites associated with early adversity should be revisited according to the points also mentioned in the public review and the authors may want to consider exploring additional datasets with other challenges.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, see our responses to the public review above and our revisions in lines (lines 555559). We agree that comparisons with more data sets and generation of more mSTARR-seq data in other challenge conditions would be of interest. While beyond the scope of this manuscript, we hope the resource we have developed and our methods set the stage for just such analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This work presents a remarkably extensive set of experiments, assaying the interaction between methylation and expression across most CpG positions in the genome in two cell types. To this end, the authors use mSTARR-seq, a high-throughput method, which they have previously developed, where sequences are tested for their regulatory activity in two conditions (methylated and unmethylated) using a reporter gene. The authors use these data to study two aspects of DNA methylation:</p><p>1. Its effect on expression, and 2. Its interaction with the environment. Overall, they identify a small number of 600 bp windows that show regulatory potential, and a relatively large fraction of these show an effect of methylation on expression. In addition, the authors find regions exhibiting methylation-dependent responses to two environmental stimuli (interferon alpha and glucocorticoid dexamethasone).</p><p>The questions the authors address represent some of the most central in functional genomics, and the method utilized is currently the best method to do so. The scope of this study is very impressive and I am certain that these data will become an important resource for the community. The authors are also able to report several important findings, including that pre-existing DNA methylation patterns can influence the response to subsequent environmental exposures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this generous summary!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main weaknesses of the study are: 1. The large number of regions tested seems to have come at the expense of the depth of coverage per region (1 DNA read per region per replicate). I have not been convinced that the study has sufficient statistical power to detect regulatory activity, and differential regulatory activity to the extent needed. This is likely reflected in the extremely low number of regions showing significant activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity in the previous version of the manuscript. Nonzero coverage for half the plasmid-derived DNA-seq replicates is a minimum criterion, but for the baseline dataset, the mean depth of DNA coverage per replicate for windows passing the DNA filter is quite high: 12.723 ± 41.696 s.d. overall, and 93.907 ± 10.091 s.d. in the windows we subjected to full analysis (i.e., windows that also passed the RNA read filter). We now provide these summary statistics in lines 148-149 and 169-170 and Supplementary file 5 (see also our responses to Reviewer 1 above). We also now show, using a rarefaction analysis, that our data set saturates the ability to detect regulatory windows based on DNA and RNA sequencing depth (new Figure 1-figure supplement 4; lines 179-184; 715-722).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Due to the position of the tested sequence at the 3' end of the construct, the mSTARR-seq approach cannot detect the effect of methylation on promoter activity, which is perhaps the most central role of methylation in gene regulation, and where the link between methylation and expression is the strongest. This limitation is evident in Fig. 1C and Figure 1-figure supplement 5C, where even active promoters have activity lower than 1. Considering these two points, I suspect that most effects of methylation on expression have been missed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We agree that we have not exhaustively detected methylationdependent activity in all promoter regions, given that not all promoter regions are active in STARR-seq. However, there is good evidence that some promoter regions can function like enhancers and thus be detected in STARR-seq-type assays (Klein et al., 2020). This important point is now noted in lines 187-189; an example promoter showing methylation-dependent regulatory activity in our dataset is shown in Figure 3E.</p><p>We also now clarify that Figure 1C shows significant enrichment of regulatory activity in windows that overlap promoter sequence (line 239). The y-axis is not a measure of activity, but rather the log-transformed odds ratio, with positive values corresponding to overrepresentation of promoter sequences in regions of mSTARR-seq regulatory activity. Active promoters are 1.640 times more likely to be detected with regulatory activity than expected by chance (p = 1.560 x 10-18), which we now report in a table that presents enrichment statistics for all ENCODE elements shown in Figure 1C for clarity (Supplementary file 4). Moreover, 74.1% of active promoters that show regulatory activity have methylation-dependent activity, also now reported in Supplementary file 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the combination of an extensive resource addressing key questions in functional genomics, together with the findings regarding the relationship between methylation and environmental stimuli makes this a key study in the field of DNA methylation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you again for the positive assessment!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I suggest the authors conduct several tests to estimate and/or increase the power of the study:</p><p>1. To estimate the potential contribution of additional sequencing depth, I suggest the authors conduct a downsampling analysis. If the results are not saturated (e.g., the number of active windows is not saturated or the number of differentially active windows is not saturated), then additional sequencing is called for.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion. We have now performed a downsampling/rarefaction curve analysis in which we downsampled the number of DNA reads, and separately, the number of RNA reads. We show that for both DNA-seq depth and RNA-seq depth, we are within the range of sequencing depth in which additional sequencing would add minimal new analysis windows in the dataset (Figure 1-figure supplement 4; lines 179-184; 715-722).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Correlation between replicates should be reported and displayed in a figure because low correlations might also point to too few reads. The authors mention: &quot;This difference likely stems from lower variance between replicates in the present study, which increases power&quot;, but I couldn't find the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We now report the correlations between RNA and DNA replicates within the current dataset and within the Lea et al., 2018 dataset (Figure 1-figure supplement 6). The between-replicate correlations in both our RNA libraries and DNA libraries are consistently high (r ≥ 0.89).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The correlation between the previous and current K562 datasets is surprisingly low. Given that these datasets were generated in the same cell type, in the same lab, and using the same protocol, I expected a higher correlation, as seen in other massively parallel reporter assays. The fact that the correlations are almost identical for a comparison of the same cell and a comparison of very different cell types is also suspicious.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this point. We think it is in reference to our original Figure 1-Figure supplement 6, for which we now provide Pearson correlations in addition to R2 values (now Figure 1-Figure supplement 8). We note that this is not a correlation in raw data, but rather the correlation in estimated effect sizes from a statistical model for methylation-dependent activity. We now provide Pearson correlations for the raw data between replicates within each dataset (Figure 1-Figure supplement 6), which for the baseline dataset are all r &gt; 0.89 for RNA replicates and r &gt; 0.98 for DNA replicates, showing that replicate reproducibility in this study is on par with other published studies (e.g., Klein et al., 2020 report r &gt; 0.89 for RNA replicates and r &gt; 0.91 for DNA replicates).</p><p>We do not know of any comparable reports in other MPRAs for effect size correlations between two separately constructed libraries, so it’s unclear to us what the expectation should be. However, we note that all effect sizes are estimated with uncertainty, so it would be surprising to us to observe a very high correlation for effect sizes in two experiments, with two independently constructed libraries (i.e., with different DNA fragments), run several years apart—especially given the importance of winner’s curse effects and other phenomena that affect point estimates of effect sizes. Nevertheless, we find that regions we identify as regulatory elements in this study are 74-fold more likely to have been identified as regulatory elements in Lea et al., 2018 (p &lt; 1 x10-300).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors cite Johnson et al. 2018 to support their finding that merely 0.073% of the human genome shows activity (1.7% of 4.3%), but:</p><p>a. the percent cited is incorrect: this study found that 27,498 out of 560 million regions (0.005%) were active, and not 0.165% as the authors report.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to clarify the numerator and denominator used for the 0.165% estimate from Johnson et al 2018 (lines 175-176). The numerator is their union set of all basepairs showing regulatory activity in unstimulated cells, which is 5,547,090 basepairs. The denominator is the total length of the hg38 human genome, which is 3,298,912,062 basepairs.</p><p>Notably, the denominator (the total human genome) is not 560 million—while Johnson et al (2018) tested 560 million unique ~400 basepair fragments, these fragments were overlapping, such that the 560 million fragments covered the human genome 59 times (i.e., 59x coverage).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. other studies that used massively parallel reporter assays report substantially higher percentages, suggesting that the current study is possibly underpowered. Indeed, the previous mSTARR-seq found a substantially larger percentage of regions showing regulatory activity (8%). The current study should be compared against other studies (preferably those that did not filter for putatively active sequences, or at least to the random genomic sequences used in these studies).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have double checked comparisons to Johnson et al., 2018 and Lea et al., 2018. Our numbers are not unusual relative to Johnson et al., 2018 (0.165%), which surveyed the whole genome. Also, in comparing to the data from Lea et al., 2018, when processed in an identical manner (our criteria are more stringent here), our values of the percent of the tested genome showing significant regulatory activity are also similar: 0.108% in the Lea et al., 2018 dataset versus 0.082% in the baseline dataset. Finally, our rarefaction analyses (see our responses above) indicate that we are not underpowered based on sequencing depth for RNA or DNA samples. We also note that there are several differences in our analysis pipeline from other studies: we use more technical replicates than is typical (compare to 2-5 replicates in Arnold et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2018; Muerdter et al., 2018), we measure DNA library composition based on DNA extracted from each replicate post-transfection as opposed to basing it on the pre-transfection library: [Johnson et al., 2018], and we use linear mixed models to identify regulatory activity as opposed to binomial tests [Johnson et al., 2018; Arnold et al., 2013; Muerdter et al., 2018].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I find it confusing that the four sets of CpG positions used: EPIC, RRBS, NR3C1, and random control loci, add up together to 27.3M CpG positions. Do the 600 bp windows around each of these positions sufficient to result in whole-genome coverage? If so, a clear explanation of how this is achieved should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment. Although our sequencing data are enriched for reads that cover these targeted sites, the original capture to create the input library included some off target reads (as is typical of most capture experiments, which are rarely 100% efficient). We then sequenced at such high depth that we ultimately obtained sequencing coverage that encompassed nearly the whole genome. We now clarify in the main text that our protocol assesses 27.3 million CpG sites by assessing 600 bp windows encompassing 93.5% of all genomic CpG sites (line 89), which includes off-target sites (line 149).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A scatter plot showing the RNA to DNA ratios of the methylated (x-axis) vs unmethylated (y-axis) library would be informative.

They show the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression at mSTARR-seq-identified enhancers in individuals before and after IAV stimulation, separately for enhancers that are shared between conditions (left) versus those that are IFNAspecific (right). The two plots therefore do show two different sets of regions, which we have depicted to visualize the contrast in the effect of stimulation on the correlation on IFNA-specific enhancers versus shared enhancers. We have revised the figure legend to clarify these points (line 458-460).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L235-242 are unclear. Specifically - isn't the same filter mentioned in L241-242 applied to all regions?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the same filter for minimal RNA transcription was applied to all regions. We have modified the text (lines 264-265, 271, 275-277) to clarify that the enrichment analyses were performed twice, to test whether the target types were: (1) enriched in the dataset passing the RNA filter (i.e., the dataset showing plasmid-derived RNA reads in at least half the sham or methylated replicates; n = 216,091 windows) and (2) enriched in the set of windows showing significant regulatory activity (at FDR &lt; 1%; n = 3,721 windows).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To improve cohesiveness, the section about most CpG sites associated with early life adversity not showing regulatory activity in K562s can be moved to the supplementary in my opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Because ELA and the biological embedding hypothesis (via DNA methylation) were major motivations for our analysis (see Introduction lines 42-48; 75-79), and we also discuss these results in the Discussion (lines 518-520), we have respectfully elected to retain this section in the main manuscript. We have added text in the Discussion explaining why we think experimental tests of methylation effects on regulation are relevant to the literature on early life adversity (lines 520-522), and have added discussion on limits to these analyses (lines 527-533).</p><p>References:</p><p>Arnold CD, Gerlach D, Stelzer C, Boryń ŁM, Rath M, Stark A (2013) Genome-wide quantitative enhancer activity maps identified by STARR-seq.
