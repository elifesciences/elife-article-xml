To overcome this, we performed an enhancer screen for developmental defects caused by compromising both global miRISC function and individual genes in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Among 126 interactors with miRNAs, we surprisingly found the CED-3 caspase that has only been well studied for its role in promoting apoptosis, mostly through protein activation. We provide evidence for a non-apoptotic function of CED-3 caspase that regulates multiple developmental events through proteolytic inactivation. Specifically, LIN-14, LIN-28, and DISL-2 proteins are known miRNA targets, key regulators of developmental timing, and/or stem cell pluripotency factors involved in miRNA processing. We show CED-3 cleaves these proteins in vitro. We also show CED-3 down-regulates LIN-28 in vivo, possibly rendering it more susceptible to proteasomal degradation. This mechanism may critically contribute to the robustness of gene expression dynamics governing proper developmental control.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04265.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04265.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04265.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For an organism to develop from a single cell into a collection of many different, specialized cells, different genes must be switched on or off at particular times. However, some of these genes involved in development are ‘redundant’ and carry out the same or similar tasks. This acts like a backup system, so if one of the genes is unable to complete a task, the others can compensate and the organism will still develop correctly.</p><p>To produce a protein from a gene, the DNA sequence that makes up the gene is used as a template to create another molecule called messenger RNA. Genes can also be ‘silenced’—prevented from making proteins—by small molecules called microRNAs, which bind to messenger RNA molecules and mark them for destruction. MicroRNA molecules therefore play an important role in controlling development. However, as many microRNA molecules often work together, and as many genes are redundant, it can be difficult to discover the effects of specific microRNAs. It is also difficult to discover whether any other mechanisms work alongside the microRNAs to control development.</p><p>Weaver, Zabinsky et al. used mutant forms of the nematode worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, in which microRNA gene regulation did not work correctly, to investigate the mechanisms that work alongside microRNAs to control development. Genes in these worms were silenced; those silenced genes that caused additional developmental defects were considered likely to work ‘redundantly’ in the same role as a microRNA molecule. This revealed over one hundred genes that were previously unknown to work with microRNA molecules.</p><p>Weaver, Zabinsky et al. focused on one of these genes, called <italic>ced-3</italic>. The CED-3 protein produced from this gene is known to execute programmed cell death, a carefully controlled process also known as apoptosis, but was not known to have other developmental functions. However, the worms with mutant forms of the <italic>ced-3</italic> gene already have problems performing apoptosis but are otherwise relatively normal, so Weaver, Zabinsky et al. reasoned that the CED-3 protein must also have another role in development.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that <italic>ced-3</italic> mutations most severely disrupt development when they are combined with mutations in one particular family of microRNAs. These microRNAs are particularly important for controlling both when cells specialize into a particular type of cell, and the timing of when certain stages of development happen. Experiments using purified proteins showed that CED-3 breaks down three proteins that are produced from genes controlled by this family of microRNA molecules, and one of these proteins was also broken down by CED-3 in experiments with mutant worms. Weaver, Zabinsky et al. therefore propose that CED-3 is part of a semi-redundant system that ensures the proteins are produced at the right level and at the right time even if the microRNAs insufficiently regulate them. This finding demonstrated both a specific role and specific targets for the CED-3 protein during development, entirely distinct from its role in apoptosis.</p><p>Although Weaver, Zabinsky et al. have identified a large number of genes that work alongside microRNAs to control development, these are only the genes that cause obvious developmental defects in healthy worms. Further experiments using similar techniques performed on worms under stress may reveal yet more such genes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04265.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04265.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>GW182</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>caspase</kwd><kwd>DIS3L2</kwd><kwd>LIN28</kwd><kwd>heterochronic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>121631-PF-12-088-01-RMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weaver</surname><given-names>Benjamin P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2T32GM008759-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zabinsky</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM047869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM059083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Eui Seung</given-names></name><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Ding</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A broadly used gene expression regulatory mechanism inactivates targets by CED-3-caspase-mediated proteolysis and works in parallel to miRNAs for diverse non-apoptotic developmental functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The robustness of animal development is ensured by multiple regulatory mechanisms with overlapping roles acting on specific cellular processes, often manifested as genetic redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kitano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felix and Wagner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammell et al., 2009</xref>). miRNAs mostly exert repression of gene expression by blocking target mRNA translation and/or through mRNA decay as part of the miRNA-induced-silencing complex (miRISC), which includes GW182 and argonaute proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding and Han, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fabian and Sonenberg, 2012</xref>). miRNA-mediated gene silencing is a critical regulatory mechanism that ensures dynamic changes in gene expression during animal development or other physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ambros, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartel and Chen, 2004</xref>). However, specific physiological roles of individual miRNAs are often executed through the combinatory effects of multi-miRNA, multi-target mRNA networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kudlow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miska et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Than et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Saavedra and Horvitz, 2010</xref>). Moreover, these miRNA–mRNA interaction networks may act in concert, and often semi-redundantly, with other regulatory mechanisms to limit the expression of many genes involved in animal development or other physiological functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Among a large number of interactors identified from the screen is the <italic>ced-3</italic> gene that encodes a caspase, well-characterized as a key component of the apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conradt and Xue, 2005</xref>). While <italic>ced-3</italic> is absolutely required for the apoptotic process, null mutations of the gene are not associated with obvious developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hengartner, 1997</xref>). However, two recent studies have reported different non-apoptotic roles of the <italic>ced-3</italic> pathway, namely in stress-related neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pinan-Lucarre et al., 2012</xref>) and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yee et al., 2014</xref>). Because no specific downstream targets of CED-3 were found in these studies, the mechanistic detail of such non-apoptotic functions of CED-3 remains unclear. Moreover, whether the CED-3 system is widely utilized to regulate animal development and other functions is a question of high significance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genome-wide enhancer screen to identify factors that act with miRISCs to ensure robust development</title><p>To uncover specific physiological functions of miRNAs and other regulatory mechanisms acting with miRNAs during development, we performed a genetic enhancer screen for developmental defects that manifested only when miRISC function and another regulatory mechanism were both compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We chose to use loss-of-function <italic>(lf)</italic> mutations of the <italic>ain-1</italic> and <italic>ain-2</italic> genes (GW182 orthologs) that each alone significantly compromises but does not eliminate global miRISC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2009</xref>). While the <italic>ain-1(lf)</italic> mutant has a mild heterochronic phenotype and the <italic>ain-2(lf)</italic> mutant is superficially wild-type, loss of both genes results in severe pleiotropic defects including alteration in temporal cell fate patterning. Therefore, an enhancer screen using the <italic>ain-1(lf)</italic> or <italic>ain-2(lf)</italic> mutant can potentially detect functions associated with most miRNAs.</p><p>Using the entire <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> ORFeome RNAi feeding library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rual et al., 2004</xref>), we performed a double-blind screen that identified 126 genetic interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data SD9-data">Supplementary files 1,2</xref>), of which only eight have been reported to interact with miRNA regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parry et al., 2007</xref>). Many interactions were confirmed by testing candidate mutants for phenotypes when treated with <italic>ain-1</italic> and <italic>ain-2</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Nearly two-thirds of the 126 genetic interactors were found to interact with both <italic>ain-1</italic> and <italic>ain-2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Gene ontology analysis revealed that these genes belong to a broad range of functional groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Over-representation of genes associated with protein stability is consistent with the hypothesis that miRNAs act in concert with other repressive mechanisms to limit gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). We found that <italic>ain-1(lf)</italic> displayed more pronounced pleiotropism with its interactors than <italic>ain-2(lf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and that the two GW182 homologs have distinct frequencies of phenotypes with their interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), arguing against general sickness being the cause for the enhancement (further elaborated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The pleiotropic nature of <italic>ain-1</italic> interactions is consistent with the diverse physiological functions associated with AIN-1 or possibly its expression patterns or levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cooperation between the CED-3 pathway and miRISC on multiple aspects of development</title><p>We were most surprised to identify the <italic>C. elegans</italic> cell-killing caspase, <italic>ced-3,</italic> as an interactor of the miRISC GW182 homolog, <italic>ain-1</italic>. Using multiple alleles of each gene, we found that <italic>ced-3(lf);ain-1(lf)</italic> double mutants have pleiotropic developmental phenotypes including delays in larval growth rate, smaller brood size, abnormal adult body morphology, egg-laying defect (accumulation of eggs inside the animal), sluggish movement, embryonic lethality, and laid oocytes (failure to fertilize) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). The penetrance of abnormal phenotypes increased as the adults continued to age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and was therefore best quantified in a synchronized population. Combining mutations of miRISC components such as <italic>ain-1(GW182)(lf)</italic> or <italic>alg-1(argonaute)(lf)</italic> with the cell death pathway factors <italic>ced-3(caspase)(lf)</italic> or its upstream activator, <italic>ced-4(apaf-like)(lf),</italic> results in abnormal adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) but <italic>ced-3(lf);ain-2(lf)</italic> animals did not show a significant defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

LIN-14 is highly expressed during L1 to promote L1-specific developmental programs, whereas LIN-28 is highly expressed from late embryonic to L2 stages and acts to promote the L2-specific programs including the only normal symmetric division of V1–V4 and V6 seam cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ambros and Horvitz, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambros, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruvkun and Giusto, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moss et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rougvie and Moss, 2013</xref>) (Diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

As a caspase, we thought that CED-3 may directly repress the expression of these genes through proteolytic cleavage, which is consistent with our observation that LIN-14, LIN-28, and DISL-2 contain multiple consensus CED-3 cleavage sites that consist of a tetra-peptide sequence usually ending in an aspartic acid residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xue et al., 1996</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we performed an in vitro CED-3 cleavage assay as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xue et al., 1996</xref>). We found that the DIS3L2 ribonuclease homolog, DISL-2, was robustly cleaved by the CED-3 caspase while LIN-14 and LIN-28 were partially cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The multiple cleavage products generated by CED-3 cleavage of DISL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) suggest a clear role for CED-3-mediated inactivation of this target protein. We further tested the specificity of the partial LIN-28 cleavage by CED-3 and found that it was completely blocked by addition of the caspase-specific-inhibitor zDEVD-fmk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We then determined the proteolytic cleavage site for LIN-28 by mutagenesis and identified the CED-3-specific recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Numerous possible cleavage sites were found for LIN-14 and DISL-2 but were not pursued further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The identified sequence DVVD fits the canonical CED-3 recognition motif (DxxD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xue et al., 1996</xref>) and mutating the second aspartic acid residue to an alanine (D31A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) entirely eliminated CED-3 cleavage.

Specifically, we made the point mutation in the previously published <italic>lin-28(+)::gfp</italic> fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moss et al., 1997</xref>). To ensure that the LIN-28(D31A) mutation did not disrupt the global function of the protein, we tested its ability to overcome the highly penetrant protruding vulva (Pvl) phenotype in <italic>lin-28(n719,lf)</italic> animals and found that it was able to rescue the Pvl phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Following integration and outcrossing, we found the copy number of the <italic>lin-28(D31A)::gfp</italic> transgene to be slightly lower than that of the non-mutated <italic>lin-28(+)::gfp</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then examined the developmental profile and found that the <italic>lin-28(D31A)::gfp</italic> transgene alone caused a delay in larval development similar to that caused by the combination of the <italic>lin-28(+)::gfp</italic> transgene with <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Western blot analysis showed that the <italic>lin-28(D31A)::gfp</italic> integration had less basal expression than the non-mutated <italic>lin-28(+)::gfp</italic> integration, consistent with the lower copy number estimate. We observed a quantifiable difference in the down-regulation of the <italic>lin-28(D31A)::gfp</italic> transgene compared to the <italic>lin-28(+)::gfp</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>). This finding provides evidence that a failure in CED-3 cleavage of LIN-28 leads to slower degradation of LIN-28 and is one of the causes of slower development, since the D31A point mutation alone resulted in both a slower growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and delayed LIN-28 down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>). Additionally, in this Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>), down-regulation of the wild-type LIN-28 transgene in <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> worms seems to be delayed more than LIN-28(D31A) in wild-type worms.

To further test the functional outcome of both the LIN-28(D31A) transgene and the LIN-28(+) transgene combined with <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic>, we examined the adult-specific alae and found significant defects including low quality and gapped alae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is consistent with the data described above that <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> enhances adult-specific alae defect of let-7-family miRNA mutants and <italic>ain-1(lf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). We should note that the original report of the LIN-28(+) transgene indicated that some of the adults were observed to have gapped alae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moss et al., 1997</xref>). Though we did observe rough and very thin sections of alae for this strain (scored as low quality alae), we did not observe any gapped adult alae. This subtle difference is likely explained by a different threshold since we scored alae using a sensitive camera (See ‘Materials and methods’). Nonetheless, the relative enhancement of <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> with this transgene is quite obvious and similar to that of the caspase-cleavage resistant LIN-28(D31A) point mutant transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Altogether, our data support a causal role for CED-3 cleavage of LIN-28 in the regulation of temporal cell fate patterning. CED-3 appears to facilitate the stereotypical transition of LIN-28 to enhance the robustness of the L2 to L3 developmental transition.</p><p>Consistent with LIN-14 being modestly cleaved by CED-3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), we found that the LIN-14::GFP level was modestly increased in <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> mutants in vivo at the L1 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4</xref>). This result may not be explained by slower growth rate since these animals were obtained as synchronous L1s without food. Our attempts to monitor DISL-2 protein levels including developing an antibody to endogenous DISL-2 were impeded by technical difficulties. Moreover, N- and C-terminal GFP fusions to DISL-2 had exceedingly low levels of expression beyond detection by common methods suggesting that DISL-2 protein levels are kept exquisitely low for physiological significance.</p><p>Therefore, our in vitro and in vivo data show that developmental timing regulators are proteolytic targets of the CED-3 caspase, likely resulting in their inactivation. This role of CED-3 cleavage is in contrast to known apoptotic functions of CED-3 caspase activity in two major aspects: CED-3 inactivates its targets rather than activates them as in its apoptotic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conradt and Xue, 2005</xref>); and it acts with other regulatory systems, including miRNAs and possibly the N-end rule proteasomal system, to maintain robust developmental functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of non-apoptotic CED-3 activity in enhancing the robustness of dynamic changes in gene expression for development</title><p>We report the discovery of a new gene expression regulatory mechanism whereby a non-apoptotic activity of the CED-3 caspase functions to inactivate and repress the expression of key developmental regulators, significantly contributing to the robustness of gene expression dynamics and animal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Consistent with this, a previous report showed that CED-3 is capable of cleaving more than 22 <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins in an in vitro proteomics survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>) and two recent genetics-based findings showed that <italic>ced-3</italic> may play important roles in neural regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pinan-Lucarre et al., 2012</xref>) and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yee et al., 2014</xref>). Second, the described CED-3 function in repressing gene expression is likely in contrast to the role of CED-3 in promoting apoptosis through activation of protein targets by cleavage at specific sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakagawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Here, the CED-3 cleavage alone may already destroy the target protein activity. Additionally, the cleavage products may be further degraded by other degradation systems notably via N-terminal destabilizing residues which may make the target more susceptible to additional degradation mechanisms, such as proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sriram et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). We hypothesize that this function operates continually during development to facilitate rapid turnover of these regulatory proteins at the post-translational level and in cooperation with other regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). We should note that it is curious that only the LIN-28A isoform was found to be cleaved by CED-3 in vitro yet expression of both LIN-28A and LIN-28B isoforms was altered by <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> in vivo. This may imply that <italic>ced-3</italic> has potential indirect effects on other factors within the heterochronic pathway that could alter LIN-28 isoform expression but further experiments are required to satisfactorily explain this.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04265.035</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for CED-3 function in temporal cell fate patterning regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of CED-3 collaborating with miRNAs to repress the expression of LIN-14, LIN-28, and DISL-2.

Both <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-246</italic> are predicted to target <italic>lin-14</italic> mRNA (See ‘Materials and methods’) but have not been experimentally demonstrated to do so here. They failed to show enhanced specific developmental timing defects and were not pursued further. Dashed arrows and blocks are intended to indicate a combination of complex direct and indirect effects ultimately affecting developmental fate and timing. ** Previous works have indicated DAF-12 functions on several components of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rougvie and Moss, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hochbaum et al., 2011</xref>), providing the basis for us to have observed the enhanced developmental defects associated with <italic>ain-1(lf)</italic> and <italic>daf-12(RNAi)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The exact mechanism of LIN-66 function is still unclear (dashed block) though it is able to negatively regulate LIN-28 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morita and Han, 2006</xref>). MSI-1 (Musashi-1) was identified as an RNA-binding protein that may be important for LIN-28-mediated regulation of pre-miRNA processing as well as translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sakakibara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawahara et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, we also identified the <italic>C. elegans</italic> musashi-1 ortholog, <italic>msi-1</italic>, as an enhancer in our screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Following binding by LIN-28, pre-<italic>let-7</italic> is poly-uridylated by a TUTase (poly-U-polymerase) to mark it for destruction. PUP-2 is indicated here as a <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog for TUTase and it was also identified in our screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Recently, the RNAse, Dis3l2 (Dis-3-like RNAse gene 2), was identified as the 3′-5′ exonuclease that degrades poly-uridylated-pre-<italic>let-7</italic> miRNA and is the RNAse mutated in Perlman syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawahara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ustianenko et al., 2013</xref>).

The physiological effect of this subtle regulation is clearly seen in seam cell temporal patterning when miRNA function is compromised in the <italic>ain-1(lf)</italic> mutant background. This prominent enhancement indicates that <italic>ced-3</italic> has an important role in supporting the robustness of the larval transitions. Based on the pleiotropic phenotypes associated with <italic>ced-3(lf);ain-1(lf)</italic>, such roles may potentially extend to a broad range of cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cooperative gene regulation revealed by our genome-scale screen</title><p>Previous studies using model organisms, including our own, have indicated that genetic redundancy by structurally unrelated genes is commonly associated with genes with regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferguson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki and Han, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costanzo et al., 2011</xref>). Asking the same question for the global miRISC function, our screen, by identifying 118 previously unknown miRISC interactors, thus identified new roles for miRISC in normal developmental processes that are otherwise masked by redundancy and/or pleiotropism, as well as identifying other regulatory mechanisms that collaborate with miRNAs. Examples we found for the latter in this study include genes encoding the POU-homeodomain protein (<italic>ceh-18</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), the histone acetyltransferase <italic>(pcaf-1</italic>), the ras-related GTPase homolog (<italic>ral-1)</italic>, the homeodomain transcription factor (<italic>unc-39</italic>), and the cell-killing <italic>ced-3</italic> caspase (the majority of this study) (and others listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). However, the interactions identified in this study most likely reflect only a small portion of miRNA functions because screening for obvious developmental defects under well-fed conditions only permitted us to identify limited physiological functions. Applying various assays, including behavioural assays or animals under various growth or stress conditions, is expected to identify many more miRNA functions. Furthermore, although feeding RNAi has important advantages for such a screen, it is not effective for many genes especially for genes functioning in certain tissues such as neurons. Therefore, genetic screens or analyses under sensitized backgrounds will continue to play a major role in identifying miRNA functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 4</xref> for the list of all strains used in this study<bold>.</bold></p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Rationale of phenotypes scored in this screen</title><p>In this screen, we wanted to identify genetic pathways that may redundantly cooperate with the miRISC in development.

Here, double blind means that no identities for interactors were revealed to anyone setting up the plates, anyone phenotyping the plates, nor anyone processing the scored data until all candidate interactors were confirmed in a secondary screen performed in quadruplicate (see below). Similar to a previously reported method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lehner et al., 2006</xref>), a 2 day set up for each screening session was employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>For each scoring session, <italic>rrf-3(pk1426,lf), ain-1(ku322,lf);rrf-3(pk1426,lf)</italic>, and <italic>ain-2(tm2432,lf);rrf-3(pk1426,lf)</italic> were each fed with mock, <italic>ain-1</italic>, and <italic>ain-2</italic> RNAi cultures in parallel which served as the experimental controls.

The reviewers feel that this caveat could be addressed as you will see in the more detailed comments below. It would also be important to provide a clear definition of what is being phenotypically assayed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Summary: While the authors outline a nice genetic strategy to identify components that function with or in parallel to genes involved in general miRNA regulation and also clearly demonstrate that <italic>ced-3</italic> functions in this capacity and outside its role in cell death, the experiments that demonstrate LIN-28 regulatory defects in <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants are need expansion. The <italic>in vitro</italic> and genetic data are solid. Unfortunately, the phenotypes the statement that <italic>ced-3</italic> contributes to the post-translational regulation of various miRNA targets is not complete. The authors have all of the reagents to prove this assertion follow-up experiments are outlined below.</p><p>Genetic screen and strategy: The authors present the findings of a genome-wide RNAi screen designed to identify factors that work together or in parallel to essential components of the miRNA machinery that regulates developmental gene expression. The basis for this screen relies on the fact that <italic>ain-1</italic>, encoding the <italic>C. elegans</italic> miRISC component/GW Protein homolog, is non-essential (due to a redundancy with the <italic>C. elegans ain-2</italic> gene), displays a variety of pleiotropic phenotypes that can serve as the starting point for an enhancer screen. To identify genetic interactors, the authors systematically depleted each protein-coding gene individually by RNAi and scored for a wide range of general phenotypes. This resulted in the identification of 126 genes, that when depleted, result in a reproducibly synergistic enhancement of <italic>ain-1</italic> and <italic>ain-2</italic> mutant phenotypes. This list is composed of genes that function in a wide array of cellular and development functions and is interesting in itself with regard to the many functions for miRNAs in normal development.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Weaver et al. presents the data from a carefully controlled genome-wide RNAi screen to search for genes whose depletion enhances phenotypes of animals compromised for miRISC function. This data set is likely to be of broad interest to the scientific community. A significant and somewhat surprising finding from this screen is the discovery that the CED-3 caspase has non-apoptotic roles in multiple developmental processes. Other recent studies have implicated <italic>ced-3</italic> in similar such functions, but did not pursue <italic>ced-3</italic> involvement to the level of protein targets. One key aspect of this paper is the identification of candidate <italic>ced-3</italic> target proteins with bearing on the synthetic phenotype. However, the experiments to demonstrate the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of these targets need to be strengthened.</p><p>Ced-3 mediated cleavage of LIN-28, LIN-14, and DISL-2 is an attractive hypothesis that is nicely supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. What is most important is to substantiate this with <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, which the authors attempt using developmental westerns and transgene expression studies. As is, these experiments are weak. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> should ultimately have quantitation of LIN-28 signals vs actin, but the more problematic issue is that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors demonstrate that ced-3 animals have a developmental delay. Is it fair to compare animals at the same timepoint for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>? E.g. at 24 hours wt are L3s but <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants are mostly L2s. Could the apparent persistence of LIN-28 in <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants be an indirect result? I.e. LIN-28 levels appear higher because the population is developmentally younger rather than lack of LIN-28 cleavage by CED-3?</p><p>To clarify the issue of the cleavage product not being detectable on westerns, is it possible to inactivate the N-end rule pathway to show the cleavage product is present in wt but not <italic>ced-3</italic> mutants?</p><p>Demonstration of physiological relevance is also important. The authors attempt this by engineering a mutation in the CED-3 cleavage site in a <italic>lin-28::gfp</italic> transgene and compare it to a similar strain with wild-type <italic>lin-28::gfp</italic> made years ago. They compare these strains using qPCR to indicate that copy number is similar. This is not terribly satisfying, as integrated arrays can be silenced to different degrees. At minimum, how does expression compare between these strains? A perhaps better experiment would be to integrate the constructs in single copy at the same locus or engineer the mutation into the endogenous <italic>lin-28</italic> locus.</p><p>The manuscript could also benefit from revision of the text. The presentation of data is sometimes hard to follow and suffers from some paragraphs that read as strings of facts without input of the authors' interpretations. There is also a tendency to throw in gene names without introduction or explanation of relevance. Both of these weaknesses make the paper less accessible to non-specialists. One example of an issue that warrants clarification is the description of phenotypes.</p><p>There are various places where phenotypes are referred to as “adult onset” or “more severe as animals progressed into adulthood”, but there isn't data that demonstrate these aspects of the phenotypes. A related issue is the use of “superficially wt adults”. For example, the rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) are difficult to interpret when the measurement is “superficially wt adults”. Does hypodermal or gut expression of <italic>ain-1</italic> rescue multiple phenes, restoring pleiotropic defects to superficially wild-type? Or does hyp expression only rescue hypodermal phenotypes? More explanation of the phenotype, perhaps in the methods, would help. Do the various aspects of the pleiotropic phenotype track together? Or do some animals have subsets? The multi-colored bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> help some, but it is not completely clear how separable are the phenes.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were requested, as shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Non-apoptotic CED-3 activity regulates LIN-28 pluripotency pathway and others for robust development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and the original two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In your revised manuscript entitled “Non-apoptotic CED-3 activity regulates LIN-28 pluripotency pathway and others for robust development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>,” you addressed most of the main concerns that the reviewers were concerned about. The assertions made in the current version of the manuscript are much more strongly supported than the previous version. The manuscript is more appropriately specific about phenotypes, having dispensed with “adult onset” and “superficially wild-type” in favor of more specific phenotypes. Additional data have been added to support your claim of LIN-28 as a proteolysis target of CED-3 and the conclusions have been toned down.</p><p>While the new experiments provide stronger evidence <italic>ced-3</italic> function in the regulation of miRNA targets, the text of the manuscript was difficult to read with regard to clarity and succinctness. In addition, the authors should also address the issues raised below in a corrected version:</p><p>1) Please provide an alternative title that would be understandable to a wider audience. ‘CED-3’ and ‘LIN-28’ may not be familiar to many people and some description might help.</p><p>2) The abstract should be clarified further as it implies that LIN-14, LIN-28, DISL-1 are all demonstrated in vivo targets.</p><p>3) It is appreciated that demonstration of CED-3-mediated proteolysis in vivo is challenging. The new data to support a role in proteolysis are helpful, but perhaps not definitive, a result that might be consistent with a mechanism that contributes to robustness of a developmental process. Analysis of <italic>lin-28::gfp</italic> in “age-matched” wt and <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> mutants is provided through a picture of a head together with quantitation that indicates a modest increase in number of GFP+ cells when ced-3 is missing. The data seem to support the claim, but additional experimental details could help. What is the definition of “age-matched” here? Are the animals scored simply somewhere within the L3 stage? Or were they selected at a specific point within the stage by cell division pattern? This is an issue because the wild-type transgene is not always off; are the animals all at the same point in the L3? Also, are the cell types in question consistent with LIN-28 function?</p><p>4) The authors should avoid using developmental delay when they are referring to heterochronic phenotypes. This is especially important because the authors do measure both the growth rates and temporal patterning of development. It may be easier to just use temporal patterning when they reference heterochronic phenotypes.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it is relevant to know when the additional seam cells arise. The Methods section on scoring has been elaborated, but this information still appears to be lacking. Are the animals born with the correct number of seam cells and it gradually increases through extra L2-type proliferative divisions or is it late onset? This issue should be easy to clarify. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> should include the quantification of Wild Type seam cell numbers.</p><p>6) The paragraph outlining LIN-28, LIN-14 and DIS-1 regulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> development should be more clearly written. This would include an outline of seam cell development, stage-specific expression of the genes and then the phenotypic consequences (with regard to seam cell number) associated with mutations in each of these genes. The impact of the synthetic interactions will be more impactful.</p><p>7) Regarding the text about the tetra-peptide sequence for CED-3 cleavage: these sites (numbers etc.) should be shown in each of the proteins. In addition, while true, the LIN-28 isoform lacks this putative site but is barely mentioned throughout the text. Its absence would have implications for future experiments and discussions.</p><p>8) Experiments outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> should be more clearly described in the text or in the Figure legend. Is it the case that the percentage of animals reaching adulthood actually means the percentage of animals reaching adulthood after a defined time interval? What is that time interval?</p><p>The authors argue that aspects of these experiments support their model and some do, but some of the comparisons involve two variables (two different transgenes and +/- <italic>ced-3</italic>) coupled to potential developmental delays, which continue to complicate interpretations. Perhaps the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> makes the best argument. Here, the animals are being assayed for adult cuticle, so must have reach a particular stage. And one can compare the effect of each transgene on the phenotype: if D31A starts out with lower expression than the wild-type transgene, one might expect it to have a weaker phenotype than the wild-type, yet it appears stronger, consistent with LIN-28 staying high longer. (It is a bit puzzling that the wt transgene does not cause gaps in alae, as this was indicated in Moss et al. '97.)</p><p>Since the LIN-28(D31A)::GFP transgene outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> produces a ced-3(lf)-like phenotype (a slowing of animal growth), one would expect that the expression of LIN-28(D31A)::GFP would maintain inappropriate expression pattern to a similar amount/time (if not more than) the wild-type LIN-28::GFP reporter exhibits in ced-3(lf) animals. Why was this not done? It seems so obvious and so easy to do.</p><p>9) It seems incredibly surprising that the additional expression of LIN-28::GFP in ced-3 mutant backgrounds (increased expression in a very small number of cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) reflects the dramatic differences in the expression of the endogenous LIN-28 at a similar time point/developmental stage described in the experiments outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>. While the perdurance of LIN-28::GFP expression in <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> mutants is supported by the in vivo evidence, these dramatic differences in scale of the phenotype should be addressed in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04265.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>We are in principle interested in the work, because it potentially reveals a new and exciting mechanism for CED-3 action.

These data for <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> suggest that the Western blot data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> cannot mainly be explained by a younger cohort.</p><p>We have added new data showing that the CED-3-cleavage-resistant mutant form of LIN-28 [<italic>i.e.</italic> LIN-28(D31A)::GFP] in a <italic>ced-3(wild-type)</italic> background has a delayed down-regulation of LIN-28 relative to the wild-type LIN-28::GFP using Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B-C</xref>). Because this CED-3-cleavage-resistant LIN-28 mutation also causes a slight delay in development of <italic>ced-3(wild type)</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), it provides a strong piece of evidence that lack of LIN-28 cleavage by CED-3 is one of the causes of the delayed developmental progression.</p><p>In this new Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B-C</xref>), down-regulation of the wild-type LIN-28 transgene in <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> worms seems to be delayed more than LIN-28(D31A) in wild type worms. Such a difference could be due to roles of CED-3 on other targets such as LIN-14 and DISL-2, which may cause a stronger developmental delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><p>We added new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), as requested by reviewer 1, showing that the CED-3-cleavage-resistant mutant of LIN-28 [<italic>i.e.</italic> LIN-28(D31A)::GFP] in a <italic>ced-3(wild-type)</italic> background and the wild-type LIN-28::GFP reporter in a <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> mutant background both have defective adult alae. These data support a clear function for CED-3-directed proteolysis of the LIN-28 protein in the heterochronic pathway.</p><p>Furthermore, we added new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-D</xref>), as requested by reviewer 1, showing that <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> mutation enhances specific heterochronic phenotypes of <italic>let-7-</italic>family miRNA mutants and <italic>ain-1(lf)</italic> mutants, resulting in a significant number of animals with gapped adult alae.</p><p>Demonstrating <italic>in vivo</italic> protease activity of CED-3 on specific targets has always been difficult in the <italic>ced-3</italic> field. In our case, the challenge also lies on the fact that the CED-3-mediated repression of individual targets is subtle, as it works in concert with miRNAs and other proteolytic mechanisms, which is an important concept we try to deliver in this paper. We hope our new data and explanation here would be sufficient to address this issue.</p><p>In addition, we have modified the wording in the abstract and text to soften the conclusion regarding LIN-28 stability.</p><p><italic>It would also be important to provide a clear definition of what is being phenotypically assayed</italic>.</p><p>We agree that clarity is important, as the editor/reviewers have suggested, and we have now revised all of the Figure panels in question to show all phenotypic details.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>Summary: While the authors outline a nice genetic strategy to identify components that function with or in parallel to genes involved in general miRNA regulation and also clearly demonstrate that</italic> ced-3 <italic>functions in this capacity and outside its role in cell death, the experiments that demonstrate LIN-28 regulatory defects in</italic> ced-3 <italic>mutants are need expansion. The in vitro and genetic data are solid. Unfortunately, the phenotypes the statement that</italic> ced-3 <italic>contributes to the post-translational regulation of various miRNA targets is not complete. The authors have all of the reagents to prove this assertion follow-up experiments are outlined below.</italic></p><p><italic>Genetic screen and strategy: The authors present the findings of a genome-wide RNAi screen designed to identify factors that work together or in parallel to essential components of the miRNA machinery that regulates developmental gene expression. The basis for this screen relies on the fact that ain-1, encoding the C. elegans miRISC component/GW Protein homolog, is non-essential (due to a redundancy with the C. elegans ain-2 gene), displays a variety of pleiotropic phenotypes that can serve as the starting point for an enhancer screen. To identify genetic interactors, the authors systematically depleted each protein-coding gene individually by RNAi and scored for a wide range of general phenotypes. This resulted in the identification of 126 genes, that when depleted, result in a reproducibly synergistic enhancement of ain-1 and ain-2 mutant phenotypes. This list is composed of genes that function in a wide array of cellular and development functions and is interesting in itself with regard to the many functions for miRNAs in normal development</italic>.</p><p>The suggestion to move the two panels from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is a good idea. These suggestions have been followed.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The manuscript by Weaver et al. presents the data from a carefully controlled genome-wide RNAi screen to search for genes whose depletion enhances phenotypes of animals compromised for miRISC function. This data set is likely to be of broad interest to the scientific community. A significant and somewhat surprising finding from this screen is the discovery that the CED-3 caspase has non-apoptotic roles in multiple developmental processes. Other recent studies have implicated</italic> ced-3 <italic>in similar such functions, but did not pursue</italic> ced-3 <italic>involvement to the level of protein targets. One key aspect of this paper is the identification of candidate</italic> ced-3 <italic>target proteins with bearing on the synthetic phenotype. However, the experiments to demonstrate the in vivo relevance of these targets need to be strengthened.</italic></p><p>Ced-3 <italic>mediated cleavage of LIN-28, LIN-14, and DISL-2 is an attractive hypothesis that is nicely supported by in vitro studies. What is most important is to substantiate this with in vivo studies, which the authors attempt using developmental westerns and transgene expression studies. As is, these experiments are weak.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref> <italic>should ultimately have quantitation of LIN-28 signals vs actin, but the more problematic issue is that in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, the authors demonstrate that ced-3 animals have a developmental delay. Is it fair to compare animals at the same timepoint for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>? E.g. at 24 hours wt are L3s but</italic> ced-3 <italic>mutants are mostly L2s. Could the apparent persistence of LIN-28 in</italic> ced-3 <italic>mutants be an indirect result? I.e. LIN-28 levels appear higher because the population is developmentally younger rather than lack of LIN-28 cleavage by CED-3?</italic></p><p><italic>To clarify the issue of the cleavage product not being detectable on westerns, is it possible to inactivate the N-end rule pathway to show the cleavage product is present in wt but not</italic> ced-3 <italic>mutants?</italic></p><p>The reviewer raises some important concepts. First, we agree and have now added quantitation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> in the supplement. Second, regarding the “developmentally younger” concern, please see the accompanying response for new experimental data and explanations that address this point. Third, the reviewer brought up a very interesting question regarding whether we can test the interaction between <italic>ced-3</italic>, miRNA, and the N-end rule pathway. We have actually done several experiments addressing this issue and realized that it is not as simple in an animal system. To make a solid conclusion, we will need to treat this as a separate project showing both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data, as well as analyzing the functional interaction between the N-end rule pathway with <italic>ced-3</italic> and miRNAs. If successful, perhaps we could come back to add a short Research advance attached to this first paper. As for this paper, we have kept it as a hypothesis. We have modified the wording to soften the related statements.</p><p><italic>Demonstration of physiological relevance is also important. The authors attempt this by engineering a mutation in the CED-3 cleavage site in a</italic> lin-28::gfp <italic>transgene and compare it to a similar strain with wild-type</italic> lin-28::gfp <italic>made years ago. They compare these strains using qPCR to indicate that copy number is similar. This is not terribly satisfying, as integrated arrays can be silenced to different degrees. At minimum, how does expression compare between these strains? A perhaps better experiment would be to integrate the constructs in single copy at the same locus or engineer the mutation into the endogenous</italic> lin-28 <italic>locus.</italic></p><p>We appreciate this concern and have added quantified Western blot data from three independent replicates to show: 1) basal expression from the LIN-28(D31A)::GFP is somewhat less than the LIN-28::GFP alone which is consistent with the qPCR data measuring the transgene copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>), 2) the transgene with the point mutation alone had higher expression at 30 hours of feeding, suggesting that this mutation is sufficient to contribute to the developmental growth rate defect we observed.</p><p>Moreover, we agree that generating a single copy integration is ideal, which is now commonly practiced in our lab. Unfortunately, after many attempts, we were unable to generate such a line since the homologous rescue knock-in approach into either the endogenous locus or a Mos site requires high levels of the rescue construct that is unfortunately lethal. We are also aware of the two-step strategy of delivering constructs in sequential knock-in/replacement recombinations that could overcome lethality of the intact gene at high dosage. However, this would not only be time consuming but also low in feasibility because it requires that the first step creates a knock-out allele that would unfortunately generate the <italic>lin-28(lf)</italic> phenotype. This phenotype will render it unlikely for the second set of injections to generate transgenic F1s since <italic>lin-28(lf)</italic> animals would have a fully penetrant Pvl phenotype resulting in Egl with few progeny per adult. We have yet to reconcile this difficulty but feel that the transgenic lines we have used adequately test the concepts under consideration, including the new data assaying stage-matched animals, as well as observation of defects in adult-specific alae.</p><p><italic>The manuscript could also benefit from revision of the text. The presentation of data is sometimes hard to follow and suffers from some paragraphs that read as strings of facts without input of the authors' interpretations. There is also a tendency to throw in gene names without introduction or explanation of relevance. Both of these weaknesses make the paper less accessible to non-specialists. One example of an issue that warrants clarification is the description of phenotypes</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate these points and have made modifications to improve the writing.</p><p><italic>There are various places where phenotypes are referred to as “adult onset” or “more severe as animals progressed into adulthood”, but there isn't data that demonstrate these aspects of the phenotypes. A related issue is the use of “superficially wt adults”. For example, the rescue experiments (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref><italic>) are difficult to interpret when the measurement is “superficially wt adults”. Does hypodermal or gut expression of</italic> ain-1 <italic>rescue multiple phenes, restoring pleiotropic defects to superficially wild-type? Or does hyp expression only rescue hypodermal phenotypes? More explanation of the phenotype, perhaps in the methods, would help. Do the various aspects of the pleiotropic phenotype track together? Or do some animals have subsets? The multi-colored bar graphs in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>help some, but it is not completely clear how separable are the phenes.</italic></p><p>We apologize for the cumbersome display of our results. To clarify our meaning, we have revised these statements from “adult-onset defects” to simply “defects” and clarified to “the frequency of abnormal phenotypes increased as the adults continued to age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>)…” As stated above, we were originally hesitant to show too much phenotypic detail as we felt this was distracting. Both reviewers and the editor seemed to have disliked this presentation of the data and we now include all phenotypic details. Due to the pleiotropic nature of the genetic defects, the specific phenotypes do not have a strict correlation with tissue-specific rescue.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were requested, as shown below.]</p><p><italic>1) Please provide an alternative title that would be understandable to a wider audience. ‘CED-3’ and ‘LIN-28’ may not be familiar to many people and some description might help</italic>.</p><p>We have revised the title to: “CED-3 caspase acts with miRNAs to regulate non-apoptotic gene expression dynamics for robust development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>”.</p><p><italic>2) The abstract should be clarified further as it implies that LIN-14, LIN-28, DISL-1 are all demonstrated in vivo targets</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this valid point and have made the changes in the abstract to more accurately summarize the data.</p><p><italic>3) It is appreciated that demonstration of CED-3-mediated proteolysis in vivo is challenging. The new data to support a role in proteolysis are helpful, but perhaps not definitive, a result that might be consistent with a mechanism that contributes to robustness of a developmental process. Analysis of</italic> lin-28::gfp <italic>in “age-matched” wt and</italic> ced-3(lf) <italic>mutants is provided through a picture of a head together with quantitation that indicates a modest increase in number of GFP+ cells when</italic> ced-3 <italic>is missing. The data seem to support the claim, but additional experimental details could help. What is the definition of “age-matched” here? Are the animals scored simply somewhere within the L3 stage? Or were they selected at a specific point within the stage by cell division pattern? This is an issue because the wild-type transgene is not always off; are the animals all at the same point in the L3? Also, are the cell types in question consistent with LIN-28 function?</italic></p><p>We understand the reviewers’ two main concerns presented here and we apologize for our lack of sufficient methodological detail. We addressed these questions by doing new experiments and improving the description.</p><p>First, we performed a new set of experiments to examine hypodermal expression at the L3 stage (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B-D</xref>). We first picked similarly sized L3 stage animals in a “blinded” fashion on a non-fluorescent dissecting scope. Prior to fluorescent illumination (to avoid bias), we measured gonad length to ensure they were very comparable (no significant difference found between the two strains: new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). It is already known that LIN-14, LIN-28 and miRNA pathway defects (with the exception of DAF-12) have only minor effects on gonad development making it a reliable marker to stage match animals (Ambros, 1997, <italic>C. elegans</italic> II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moss <italic>et al.,</italic> 1997</xref>, Cell; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott, et al. 2005</xref>, Dev. Cell). Our method should thus provide a similar distribution of developmental sub-stages for both backgrounds within the L3 stage. We did not follow P cell division because we found that observation of P cell divisions was extremely difficult due to the roller phenotype of the animals. All animals were illuminated for 5 seconds for each picture by DIC optics. Multiple planes through the body were examined to ensure the brightest field of GFP positive cells was identified. Another person, who did not take the images, then quantified the GFP positive cells using Image J to obtain integrated values of GFP intensity. Data for all animals viewed by DIC were kept and reported.</p><p>Second, regarding the counting of GFP cells in the head for the data presented in the last revision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B-C</xref>), we did not sufficiently explain the method in the last version, which could have alleviated the concern. We selected animals in the blind and staged them as mentioned above. All animals were illuminated for 5 seconds for each picture by DIC optics. Multiple planes through the head were examined to ensure all GFP positive cells were identified. Another person, who did not take the images, then counted the number of GFP-positive cells. Data for all animals viewed by DIC were kept and reported. Those data were then presented in a way that we felt was most fair with respect to the null hypothesis (that “there was no difference between the two backgrounds”). However, analysis of the data showed that there was a significant difference in the number of cells still expressing GFP in the <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> background. To address this concern, we have added the above details to the Methods section (Scoring LIN-28::GFP positive cells by DIC optics).</p><p>Third, we agree with the reviewer that lin-28 expression in the hypodermis (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B-D</xref>) is more relevant to the phenotypes of interest. However, we still decided to keep the neuron data but moved it to supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8– figure supplement 2</xref>). The function of <italic>lin-28</italic> in head neurons is currently unclear but the data still reflects the role of <italic>ced-3</italic> on <italic>lin-28</italic> expression.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should avoid using developmental delay when they are referring to heterochronic phenotypes. This is especially important because the authors do measure both the growth rates and temporal patterning of development. It may be easier to just use temporal patterning when they reference heterochronic phenotypes</italic>.</p><p>We highly appreciate the suggestion including the helpful examples from the reviewer. We have modified the wording following the suggestions.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>, it is relevant to know when the additional seam cells arise. The Methods section on scoring has been elaborated, but this information still appears to be lacking. Are the animals born with the correct number of seam cells and it gradually increases through extra L2-type proliferative divisions or is it late onset? This issue should be easy to clarify.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref> <italic>should include the quantification of Wild Type seam cell numbers</italic>.</p><p>This is a valid question and we have addressed it by doing additional experiments examining seam cells at three different stages. We find that the <italic>ced-3(lf);ain-1(lf)</italic> double mutant animals are born with the proper number of seam cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1A</xref>). Analysis of third and fourth larval stages of the <italic>ced-3(lf);ain-1(lf)</italic> double mutant animals suggests that the supernumerary seam cells continue to develop during late larval stages (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1B</xref>) though we cannot rule out earlier reiterations with an incompletely penetrant phenotype. We have also included the data for wild type animals (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) The paragraph outlining LIN-28, LIN-14 and DIS-1 regulation in</italic> C. elegans <italic>development should be more clearly written. This would include an outline of seam cell development, stage-specific expression of the genes and then the phenotypic consequences (with regard to seam cell number) associated with mutations in each of these genes. The impact of the synthetic interactions will be more impactful.</italic></p><p>We have modified the writing following this helpful suggestion.</p><p><italic>7) Regarding the text about the tetra-peptide sequence for CED-3 cleavage: these sites (numbers etc.) should be shown in each of the proteins. In addition, while true, the LIN-28 isoform lacks this putative site but is barely mentioned throughout the text. Its absence would have implications for future experiments and discussions</italic>.</p><p>We agree with these comments and have made the recommended changes. The putative cleavage sites for LIN-14 and DISL-2 are now added to the supplement. We have also added a discussion regarding the LIN-28B isoform.</p><p><italic>8) Experiments outlined in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref> <italic>should be more clearly described in the text or in the Figure legend. Is it the case that the percentage of animals reaching adulthood actually means the percentage of animals reaching adulthood after a defined time interval? What is that time interval</italic>?</p><p>We apologize for our vague presentation of these data. We scored for the percentage of animals reaching adulthood by 96 hours after being added to OP50 food following synchronization in M9. We have now added these necessary details to the legend.</p><p><italic>The authors argue that aspects of these experiments support their model and some do, but some of the comparisons involve two variables (two different transgenes and +/- ced-3) coupled to potential developmental delays, which continue to complicate interpretations. Perhaps the new</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9D</italic></xref> <italic>makes the best argument. Here, the animals are being assayed for adult cuticle, so must have reach a particular stage. And one can compare the effect of each transgene on the phenotype: if D31A starts out with lower expression than the wild-type transgene, one might expect it to have a weaker phenotype than the wild-type, yet it appears stronger, consistent with LIN-28 staying high longer. (It is a bit puzzling that the wt transgene does not cause gaps in alae, as this was indicated in Moss et al. '97</italic>.<italic>)</italic></p><p>We understand the reviewers’ concern regarding the apparent inconsistency in not finding gapped adult alae in the wild-type LIN-28::GFP transgene. We feel the most likely explanation is simply an advance in camera technology. We only scored gaps that could be photographed by our camera (Zeiss Axiocam MRm). We have added the following statements to the Methods section: “Any thin region of alae that appeared as a gap through the oculars was imaged by the camera and evaluated on a large screen. Only alae observed as truly discontinuous by aid of the camera were scored as gapped. This method was applied equally to all strains throughout the study.” We have also added a note about the original phenotype (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moss, <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>) to the Results section to help the reader. We would like to make note that the relative enhancement by <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> or the D31A mutation alone is most significant.</p><p><italic>Since the LIN-28(D31A)::GFP transgene outlined in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref> <italic>produces a</italic> ced-3(lf)<italic>-like phenotype (a slowing of animal growth), one would expect that the expression of LIN-28(D31A)::GFP would maintain inappropriate expression pattern to a similar amount/time (if not more than) the wild-type LIN-28::GFP reporter exhibits in</italic> ced-3(lf) <italic>animals. Why was this not done? It seems so obvious and so easy to do.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion of examining the number of GFP positive cells in the D31A mutant by DIC optics, which we also initially set out to do. However, careful examination of the Western blot data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> reveals that the basal expression level of the LIN-28(D31A)::GFP reporter is obviously lower than the wild-type transgene (quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> 0hr). Thus, a direct comparison of these lines by DIC microscopy would effectively be an uncontrolled experiment since there is no satisfactory way to control for exposure time between the two transgenic lines with differing basal expression. This is unlike the wild-type transgene compared in two genetic backgrounds: <italic>ced-3(lf)</italic> versus <italic>ced-3(wt)</italic> discussed above. Though not asked for here, we would like to state, as mentioned in the previous review rebuttal, that the toxicity of a lin-28-Cas9 rescue construct has prevented us from making single copy transgenes (which is not itself guaranteed to have the same level of expression). Moreover, we feel that examination of the adult-specific alae gaps is a more meaningful experiment (as suggested by the reviewers in the first review) since it is such a well-established phenotype linking persistent LIN-28 levels to defects in temporal cell fate patterning. This phenotype also considers the entire life history of the animal and thus any perdurance.</p><p>We added a paragraph to the Discussion to consider these concepts.</p><p><italic>9) It seems incredibly surprising that the additional expression of LIN-28::GFP in</italic> ced-3 <italic>mutant backgrounds (increased expression in a very small number of cells;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8B</italic></xref><italic>) reflects the dramatic differences in the expression of the endogenous LIN-28 at a similar time point/developmental stage described in the experiments outlined in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8A</italic></xref><italic>. While the perdurance of LIN-28::GFP expression in</italic> ced-3(lf) <italic>mutants is supported by the in vivo evidence, these dramatic differences in scale of the phenotype should be addressed in the text.</italic></p><p>We understand the reviewers’ concern about the difference in magnitude seen by the two methods. This difference may suggest that the observed fluorescence levels do not linearly reflect the protein levels. We have made note of it in the text. We would suggest that one should not expect that the dynamic range seen by Western blot is equal to that seen for direct fluorescence microscopy. Again, as noted by the reviewer, the <italic>in vivo</italic> defects in seam cell patterning and adult alae show that whatever the true alteration in expression level, it is sufficient to result in the observed defects. This has been emphasized in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
