cells (HSPCs) arise from ventral aortic endothelium in all vertebrate animals studied. Work in zebrafish has demonstrated that arterial and venous endothelial precursors arise from distinct subsets of lateral plate mesoderm. Here, we profile the transcriptome of the earliest detectable endothelial cells (ECs) during zebrafish embryogenesis to demonstrate that tissue-specific EC programs initiate much earlier than previously appreciated, by the end of gastrulation. Classic studies in the chick embryo showed that paraxial mesoderm generates a subset of somite-derived endothelial cells (SDECs) that incorporate into the dorsal aorta to replace HSPCs as they exit the aorta and enter circulation. We describe a conserved program in the zebrafish, where a rare population of endothelial precursors delaminates from the dermomyotome to incorporate exclusively into the developing dorsal aorta. Although SDECs lack hematopoietic potential, they act as a local niche to support the emergence of HSPCs from neighboring hemogenic endothelium. Thus, at least three subsets of ECs contribute to the developing dorsal aorta: vascular ECs, hemogenic ECs, and SDECs. Taken together, our findings indicate that the distinct spatial origins of endothelial precursors dictate different cellular potentials within the developing dorsal aorta.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>somite derived endothelium</kwd><kwd>bipotent muscle progenitor</kwd><kwd>hemogenic endothelium</kwd><kwd>dorsal aorta</kwd><kwd>paraxial mesoderm</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK074482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Traver</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Sahai-Hernandez</surname><given-names>Pankaj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR01-OD026219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Traver</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-HL086344</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sahai-Hernandez</surname><given-names>Pankaj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EDUC4-12804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eyal</surname><given-names>Shai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19POST34380328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Svoboda</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001823</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RVO: 68378050-KAV-NPUI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Svoboda</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A rare population of endothelial cells emerges from a bipotent muscle progenitor population in the paraxial mesoderm and provides niche support to induce hematopoietic stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The primitive vascular network, which integrates into all organ systems in the developing organism, arises from endothelial precursors termed angioblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Risau and Flamme, 1995</xref>). To form a functional vascular network, angioblasts must first differentiate into a variety of distinct arterial and venous endothelial cell (EC) types, including hemogenic, endocardial, and blood brain barrier ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aird, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herbert and Stainier, 2011</xref>). EC differentiation is thought to initiate midway through somitogenesis, during the migration of angioblasts to the embryonic midline, where they coalesce to form the vascular tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herbert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isogai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2005</xref>). The current view is that angioblasts are initially equipotent and undergo successive steps of differentiation that, along with cues from local microenvironments, give rise to specialized subsets of ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marcelo et al., 2013</xref>). This view, however, does not consider possible differences in EC function due to different developmental origins. Instead, exposure to embryonic signaling cascades mediated via Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hübner et al., 2017</xref>), Hedgehog (Hh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gering and Patient, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vokes and McMahon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilkinson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2010</xref>), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casie Chetty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lawson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lawson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wythe et al., 2013</xref>), and Notch molecules are thought to differentially instruct equipotent angioblasts to each distinct endothelial cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lawson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhong et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) is known to be the primary source of ECs across vertebrate phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Potente and Mäkinen, 2017</xref>). However, recent findings suggest that ECs can arise from distinct mesodermal derivatives, including extraembryonic-derived erythromyeloid progenitors (EMPs) that contribute extensively to the murine kidney vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Plein et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, lineage tracing studies in zebrafish have demonstrated that ECs supportive of hematopoiesis can derive from endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakajima et al., 2023</xref>). To better understand the development of EC subsets, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of ECs purified by flow cytometry over a range of time points during zebrafish embryogenesis. Following the end of gastrulation, the earliest developmental timepoint that nascent ECs can be identified, a variety of distinct molecular signatures were present, including those similar to kidney-specific ECs, brain-specific ECs, and paraxial mesoderm-derived ECs. These data suggest that specific EC fates may be specified much earlier than previously appreciated and that embryonic origins may dictate the development of tissue-specific EC subsets.</p><p>Within these datasets, we detected a signature indicative of paraxial mesoderm (PM) origins; we thus further explored this possibility since previous findings suggested that somite-derived ECs (SDECs) are intimately involved with both the development of the dorsal aorta and the emergence of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pouget et al., 2006</xref>). There is evidence in rodents and other amniotes that PM generates a contingent of ECs that contribute to embryonic vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Esner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Noden, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pardanaud et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pouget et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pouget et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wilting et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yvernogeau et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, these ECs arise from a transient somitic compartment known as the dermomyotome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eichmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ema et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pouget et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yvernogeau et al., 2012</xref>), where skeletal hypaxial muscle progenitors (skMPs) reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tozer et al., 2007</xref>). In the chick embryo, SDECs migrate to the dorsal aorta to replace hemogenic endothelium that exits the ventral aorta as emerging HSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pouget et al., 2006</xref>). A recent report in zebrafish has also suggested the existence of an endothelial-producing compartment (termed ‘endotome’) within the central somite that generates SDECs that migrate to the dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). Whereas experiments in birds have suggested that SDECs only replace hemogenic endothelium, the experiments in zebrafish by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref> suggested that SDECs may help induce the HSPC program. However, the genetic profile of SDECs and their possible role in HSPC induction remain poorly understood.</p><p>Here, using a combination of molecular, genetic, and computational approaches, we characterize a rare population of SDECs in zebrafish that emerges from the trunk dermomyotome. Trunk SDECs migrate and contribute exclusively to rostral regions in the dorsal aorta. Within the somite, EC-fate acquisition occurs sequentially, concomitant with the epithelialization of each somite and the migration of angioblasts toward the midline of the embryo. We show that Wnt signaling is a key regulator of the distribution of ECs within the somite, whereas Notch signaling is necessary for skeletal muscle progenitor cell maintenance. Finally, epistasis experiments indicate that SDECs arise from bipotent precursors within the somite, with skMPs showing competency to become ECs in a <italic>meox1</italic>- and <italic>npas4l</italic> (<italic>cloche</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stainier et al., 1995</xref>) – dependent manner. While SDECs integrate into the dorsal aorta, indelible lineage tracing demonstrates that they do not harbor hematopoietic potential. Instead, they appear to act at least in part as a developmental niche to facilitate HSPC emergence. Collectively, our findings indicate that distinct EC subsets are molecularly and functionally distinct as early as the end of gastrulation and describe a cellular mechanism by which the somite regulates the production of hematopoietic precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular differences in endothelial cells underlie cellular diversity within the vasculature</title><p>In zebrafish, most ECs originate from the LPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2005</xref>). However, recent studies have suggested that somites also produce ECs that integrate into the vascular cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>), but the role and nature of these ECs remain incompletely defined. To better understand how different ECs are specified in the zebrafish embryo, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on a collection of purified ECs from distinct vascular transgenic animals to represent diverse endothelial cohorts. Specifically, we purified cells via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from <italic>TgBAC(etv2:Kaede)<sup>ci6</sup>, Tg(fli1:DsRed)<sup>um13</sup>; Tg(tp1:GFP)<sup>um14</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tg(drl:H2B-dendra</italic>) (hereafter termed mixed-vasculature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kohli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mosimann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Parsons et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Villefranc et al., 2007</xref>) between 22 and 24 hpf, and performed scRNA-seq on each sample. Following quality control (QC), we merged the individual datasets. Altogether, we obtained 1994 single cells that belonged to the endothelial lineage and an additional 5446 erythroid and myeloid cells, which we omitted from our analyses as our focus was on the EC subsets. Following unsupervised clustering of single-cell transcriptomes, we identified erythroid cells, myeloid cells, and eight distinct endothelial cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), which we named based on known marker genes within established tissue lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We identified a smaller EC cluster corresponding to pre-HSCs based on expression of genes such as <italic>cmyb, cebpa,</italic> and <italic>gfi1aa</italic>. We found two clusters, brain vascular endothelial cells 1 and 2 (BVECs-I and BVECs-II), that co-expressed brain and neuronal-associated genes, including <italic>tncb, elavl3,</italic> and <italic>fmoda</italic>. Another cluster likely represents endocardial EC (EEC) based upon co-expression of canonical heart genes, including <italic>gata5, hand2,</italic> and <italic>spock3</italic>. A kidney vascular EC (KVECs) cluster co-expressed kidney-associated genes, such as <italic>pax2a, ap1m2,</italic> and <italic>myh9a</italic>. Finally, we identified an EC cluster that contained the expression of paraxial mesoderm (PM) signature genes, including <italic>igf2a, fbn2b,</italic> and <italic>fn1a</italic>. This PM signature suggested that this population may represent somite-derived endothelial cells (SDECs).

Through single-cell analysis, we identify unique molecular signatures sufficient to identify subsets of ECs, including somite-derived endothelial cells (SDECs), brain endothelial cells (BVECs), kidney endothelial cells (KVECs), and endocardium as early as the tailbud stage. Together, these results indicate that cell fate restriction of EC subsets occurs earlier than previously thought. Our results show that SDECs emerge from the trunk dermomyotome during somitogenesis and contribute to the dorsal aorta of the zebrafish embryo. We show that modulators of muscle differentiation, such as <italic>meox1</italic>, <italic>notch</italic>, and <italic>wnt</italic>, regulate SDEC number and the timeframe of SDEC differentiation. Furthermore, our findings elucidate how SDECs are needed to support the hemogenic program required for the formation of HSPCs.</p><p>Avian and murine studies have previously identified a population of endothelial cells that arise from the somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Esner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kardon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mayeuf-Louchart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mayeuf-Louchart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pardanaud et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pouget et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wilting et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yvernogeau et al., 2012</xref>). Previously, the common belief was that in zebrafish, all endothelial and blood cells arise exclusively from the LPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Childs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kohli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lawson and Weinstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang and Rodaway, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, angioblasts are thought to be specified as an equipotent population that undergoes progressive cell-fate restriction only upon migration to the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lawson et al., 2001</xref>). To our knowledge, only two studies have shown that paraxial mesoderm can generate endothelial cells in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). The first noted that presomitic mesoderm could generate ECs that incorporate into caudal blood vessels following early inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway after gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</xref>). The second study highlighted a rare population of ECs generated in the somite that migrated to the developing dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). Each of these studies was based on retrospective analyses, making it difficult to ascertain precisely when and where SDECs arise and the extent of their contribution. In addition, studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murayama et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Murayama et al., 2015</xref> have shown that a population of stromal cells important in the maintenance of zebrafish HSPCs derive from the sclerotome, the ventrolateral domain of the somite. These do not appear to give rise to ECs but rather to stromal cells that reside adjacent to blood vessels. As we have occasionally observed rare cells outside of the vasculature in our lineage-tracing studies, some of our marked cells may include this stromal cell subset. Further studies are required to ascertain how this population of somite-derived cells compares to SDECs in the trophic support of hematopoietic precursors.</p><p>Labeling individual somite pairs using <italic>Tg(actb2:nls-Eos</italic>), a pan-nuclear photoconvertible transgenic line, allowed us to quantify the contribution of SDECs from trunk somites. Using <italic>Tg(etv2.1:eGFP)<sup>zf372</sup></italic>, with <italic>etv2</italic> as one of the earliest markers of endothelial cell fate acquisition, allowed us to visualize precisely when and where SDECs emerge. Lastly, we could permanently and differentially mark ECs from the LPM or PM using an endothelial-specific switch transgene and follow their respective contributions to the vasculature. Together, both temporal and indelible lineage tracing approaches showed that somites 5–18 have potential to generate SDECs. Emergence of SDECs initiated at the 12-somite stage, concomitant with the epithelization of the somite and the migration of LPM-derived ECs to the midline. Notably, contribution of SDECs to adult hematopoietic tissues was not observed, consistent with many previous studies concluding that the adult hematopoietic program is LPM-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henninger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murayama et al., 2006</xref>). These results are consistent with a previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref> that identified a rare population of EC precursors born in a central location within somite, which they termed the ‘endotome’, that incorporated into the axial vessels but did not appear to generate blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, in our study, we observed that somite-derived <italic>etv2</italic><sup>+</sup> ECs arise from the hypaxial dermomyotome, which is consistent with earlier observations in avian and mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eichmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ema et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pouget et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tozer et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, the hypaxial dermomyotome comprises bipotent-skeletal muscle progenitors that generate ECs or myoblasts upon local cues. Since these bipotent progenitors are present in the territory where the hypaxial muscle precursors originate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Christ and Ordahl, 1995</xref>), we believe a more appropriate term for this somitic compartment would be the ‘myo-endotome’.</p><p>To better understand the signaling pathways regulating SDEC emergence, we tested the roles of <italic>notch</italic>, <italic>wnt</italic>, and <italic>npas4l</italic>. We find that Notch signaling is essential for the maintenance of muscle progenitors, as previously shown in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuster-Gossler et al., 2007</xref>). Loss of the Notch signaling components <italic>mib</italic> or <italic>notch3</italic> resulted in a premature depletion of skeletal muscle progenitor markers and a concomitant increase of differentiated muscle and endothelial cell gene expression. Our results thus suggest that Notch signaling is required to maintain muscle progenitors rather than determining cell fate choice between muscle and endothelium. However, further work is needed to investigate whether the reduced expression of skeletal muscle progenitor markers results from progenitor cell depletion or simply reflects lower expression levels within these cells. In addition, Wnt signaling is necessary for the regionalization of muscle and endothelial cells within the somite, in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</xref>). We find that during homeostasis, a few <italic>etv2:eGFP<sup>+</sup></italic> delaminate from the hypaxial dermomyotome. However, combined loss of Notch signaling and <italic>meox1</italic> shows that EC competence within the somite encompasses a much larger territory, extending as far as the median dermomyotome. Interestingly, we find that endothelial potential within bipotent skeletal muscle progenitors is <italic>npas4l</italic>-dependent. These results are surprising since <italic>npas4l</italic> has been shown to be the earliest gene required for EC specification and was thought to be restricted to the LPM starting at the tailbud stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reischauer et al., 2016</xref>). Equally surprising, a recent paper demonstrated that ECs populating the zebrafish caudal hematopoietic tissue are endoderm-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakajima et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to SDECs, this novel population is likewise dependent upon <italic>npas4l</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakajima et al., 2023</xref>). Together, these results suggest that <italic>npas4l</italic> is required to generate endothelial cell fate regardless of tissue origins.</p><p>Recent studies have elucidated a role for non-hemogenic ECs in supporting the hemogenic program and in amplifying HSPC number in various systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butler and Rafii, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hadland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kobayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Raynaud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sandler et al., 2014</xref>).

This finding and evidence that SDECs lack hemogenic potential suggest that SDECs are important as niche support cells to induce HSPC formation. Future work will elucidate the molecular nature of this interaction and will forward efforts to instruct HSPC fate from human pluripotent precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p>Wild-type AB* and transgenic <italic>TgBAC(etv2:Kaede)<sup>ci6</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kohli et al., 2013</xref>) referred to as <italic>etv2:Kaede</italic>, <italic>Tg(fli1:DsRed)<sup>um13</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Villefranc et al., 2007</xref>) referred to as <italic>fli1:DsRed</italic>, <italic>Tg(tp1:GFP)<sup>um14</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Parsons et al., 2009</xref>) referred to as <italic>tp1:GFP</italic>, <italic>Tg(drl:H2B-dendra</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mosimann et al., 2015</xref>) referred to as <italic>drl:H2B-dendra</italic>, <italic>Tg(actb2:nls-Eos</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cruz et al., 2015</xref>) referred to as <italic>actb2:nls-Eos</italic>, <italic>Tg(fli1:eGFP)<sup>y1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isogai et al., 2003</xref>) referred to as <italic>fli1:eGFP</italic>, <italic>Tg(etv2.1:eGFP)<sup>zf372</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Veldman and Lin, 2012</xref>) referred to as <italic>etv2:eGFP</italic>, <italic>Tg(phlbd1:Gal4-mCherry</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Distel et al., 2009</xref>) referred to as <italic>phlbd1:mCherry</italic>, <italic>notch3<sup>fh332/fh332</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alunni et al., 2013</xref>) referred to as <italic>notch3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Clo<sup>s9/s9</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reischauer et al., 2016</xref>) referred to as <italic>npas4l<sup>-/-</sup> (cloche</italic>), <italic>Tg(7xTCF<bold>-</bold>Xla.Siam:GFP)<sup>ia4</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moro et al., 2012</xref>) referred to as <italic>TCF:d2GFP</italic>, <italic>Tg(tbx6:Gal4FF:GFP-nls</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yabe et al., 2016</xref>) referred to as <italic>tbx6:Gal4; Tg(UAS-Cre</italic>)* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butko et al., 2015</xref>) referred to as <italic>UAS-Cre</italic>, <italic>Tg(actb2:loxP-BFP-loxP-DsRed)<sup>sd27</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>) referred to as A2BD, <italic>TgBAC(kdrl:LOXP-AmCyan-LOXP-ZsYellow</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>) referred to as <italic>kdrl:CSY</italic>, <italic>Tg(drl:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henninger et al., 2017</xref>) referred to as <italic>drl:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tg(kdrl:Cre)<sup>s898</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 2010</xref>) referred to as <italic>kdrl:Cre</italic>.

We expect a revision plan that under normal circumstances can be accomplished within two months, although we understand that in reality revisions will take longer at the moment. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then advise further with a formal decision.</p><p>In particular, the reviewers had concerns regarding the novelty of some of the major points of the manuscript, such as the derivation and contribution of somite-derived endothelial cells to hematopoietic stem cell development, in light of recent high profile publications. However, they also mentioned several interesting aspects of the work that might be developed further to enhance the suitability for publication. These include but are not limited to further understanding of the role of Notch signaling in the development, migration and function of the cell type of interest, additional transcriptomics profiling at earlier timepoints, as well as the use of alternative lines for expanded lineage tracing studies to further document the functional potential and role of the somite-derived endothelial population. If after reading the comments and suggestions below, you feel that these points can be sufficiently addressed in a reasonable timeframe, we look forward to receipt of a revision plan detailing your plans for the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled: Dermomyotome-derived endothelial cells migrate to the dorsal aorta to support hematopoietic stem cell emergence, by Sahai-Hernandez et al. aims to explore the contribution of somite-derived endothelial cells (SDECs) to hematopoietic competence in the embryonic dorsal aorta. This study builds on and significantly extends recent work identifying a paraxial mesoderm derived endothelial population under the regulation of Meox that contributes to hemogenic fate in the dorsal aorta. Here, the authors have examined the interplay of several pathways, including Wnt and Notch, in regard to their contribution to the generation of these somite-derived endothelial cells (SDECs) from specific skeletal muscle progenitors and their subsequent role in HSC formation. The authors find that this population of SDECs, marked by ETV2-reporter expression, is derived specifically from the dermomyotome, in balance with the production of muscle cell types. Consistent with early studies in the chick, they describe integration of the SDEC population into the dorsal aorta itself, and then provide novel insight into their preferential localization as well as an unexpected role in paracrine BMP4 mediated HSC regulation. Interestingly, the authors also show, using the reporter line, that the SDEC population is missing in cloche embryos. Through elegant scRNA-seq analysis and lineage trajectory studies, they identified several transcriptionally distinct endothelial populations in the early embryo, prior to HSC specification and vascular maturation, and show how modulation of Notch signaling, known to be essential for hemogenic fate, does or does not impact their development. Finally, the authors investigate the role of ID1 in Notch associated regulation of HSC development. There are several important novel insights provided by the study, however the flow of the report, and strong initial emphasis on the SDEC population, masks some of the other key observations uncovered regarding endothelial biology and hematopoietic fate in the early vertebrate embryo.</p><p>1. The flow of the manuscript is somewhat problematic. The authors perform a very elegant unbiased profiling study which identifies several distinct endothelial populations in the embryo, including the SDECs, at a much earlier timepoint than previously anticipated. Given recent publications, rather than starting with characterization of the SDEC population, and evaluating their production and function with additional precision, the authors might consider inverting the study to describe and then validate the relationships and regulation of the formation of each distinct subset, at least in regard to those impacting blood formation. In essence they end up doing this for SDECs, arterial and hemogenic endothelium already in the later figures, but altering the flow may help to highlight distinctions from prior work, as well as alleviate some of confusion/ redundancy regarding the multiple roles/timing of Notch signaling, and differing mechanistic influences hemogenic fate.</p><p>2. With the current layout of the manuscript, the very intriguing studies at the end of the paper regarding ID1 seem disconnected from the main focus on the SDECs. If the authors tell a more generalized story about establishing several distinct populations of endothelial cells that influence HSC formation (it would be fine to almost ignore the few that don't impact HSCs if that is the intended focus), then the ID1 data being associated with LPM-derived endothelium, but not PM-derived cells (in contrast to BMP signaling) is more logical.</p><p>3. The authors use an ETV2-reporter to follow the onset of SDEC production as well as their later integration in the aorta.

Given those caveats, it would be helpful to find another marker (from the RNAseq?) that could be used to verify some of the data presented. As an earlier study also showed localization of a similar population of somite-associated cells in the dorsal aorta, this conclusion not in doubt, but the reporter could be inclusive of more than one endothelial cell type, impacting specificity of the BMP analysis and/or loss of function/epistasis studies; use of a second marker may help solidify the novel insights.</p><p>4.

The DA is the site of the hemogenic endothelium that produces definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The prevailing model is that a subset of lateral plate mesoderm is fated for the dorsal aorta. These cells are further segregated into cells that make up the aortic endothelium, and those with hemogenic potential. In this study the authors identify an additional source of DA endothelium derived from the somites, which are conventionally thought of as defined blocks of skeletal muscle. These cells in the dermamyotome are positive for etv2:gfp+ cells and are proposed as bipotential precursors that can give rise to endothelium or muscle. The authors conclude that these cells are supportive of HSC emergence, but do not themselves produce HSCs. This is a novel concept in the ontogeny of hemogenic endothelium.</p><p>1. In Figure 1, it would be clearer if the etv2:gfp line was crossed to a red endothelial-specific line (e.g. flk:mCherry). Without additional landmarks in S1 it is unclear if these cells are continuously migrating towards the midline and becoming incorporated in the DA, or if they are moving out of the focal plane but are still part of the somite. Additionally, the movies S1 and S2 need to have features of interest labeled including boundaries between different tissue types.</p><p>2. Following the point above, the migration between etv2:gfp+ cells in the dermamyotome and the DA needs to be better defined. There should be more discrete lineage tracing, such as a photoactivatable marker, or time-lapse live imaging to show incorporation of these cells in the DA. The existing time-lapse shows delamination of etv2:gfp+ cells from the dermamyotome, but not migration and incorporation into the DA.</p><p>3. A key conclusion of the study is that SDEC cells are integrated into the DA are supportive of HSCs. If that is the case, the authors could perform time-lapse of tbx6:Cre;kdrl:CSY or some other reporter line combination to observe where budding HSCs are emerging relative to SDECs. This would capture the spatial relationships between the proposed supportive SDECs and HSCs.</p><p>4. Does meox1 knockdown result in enhanced proliferation of etv2+ cells in the dermamyotome, or do more cells emerge de novo?

In Figures 2O and 3O the change in expression levels from bulk mRNA of pooled whole embryos does not necessarily mean that there is a change in the numbers of specific cell types. This result could also occur if there are similar cell types present that have altered expression profiles. These results could be clarified by FACS analysis of different populations to detect a change in ratios.</p><p>6. The authors do not go back further in ontogeny to explore possible heterogeneity within the dermamyotome. For example, how early do the etv2:gfp cells arise from the PSM and can be distinguished as a bipotential dermamyotome precursor?</p><p>7. What is the significance or conclusions drawn from the regional anterior-trunk-posterior observations presented in Figure 5?</p><p>8. The rationale for choosing lines for scRNA-seq (Etv2:kaede, Fli1:dsRed; Tp1:GFP, and Draculin:Dendra:H2B) is not clear because these lines are not specific to ECs and are known collectively to mark blood, endocardium, and other cell types. How do the authors distinguish between subtypes of ECs versus other cell types altogether?</p><p>9. The authors could show in Figure 6 where etv2:kaede and the other sorted reporter lines map onto these clusters. The authors could also provide scRNA-seq data for the same etv2:gfp+ cells that were presented in previous figures to confirm the presence of SDECs.</p><p>10. A recent paper comparing a new etv2 knock-in line with existing transgenic lines shows differences in expression patterns (Chestnut &amp; Sumanas Dev Dyn 2020). Although data is presented in this study that shows endogenous expression of etv2 using FISH, it is possible that expression and conclusions drawn from the etv2:gfp line does not precisely follow endogenous cell types. This caveat should be considered and discussed within the larger context of the study.</p><p>11. It is unclear from the FISH images if the etv2+ cells are in fact double positive with meox1, or if etv2+ cells are intercalated between meox1 cells. The green meox1 signal appears low within the boundaries of etv2+ cells. Could this be resolved by crossing the etv2:gfp line with a red muscle progenitor reporter line, if available?</p><p>12. The authors do not discuss the paper by Murayama et al. (Nat. Comm. 2015) that shows stromal cells in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) directly delaminate from the somites. There are important similarities between this manuscript and the previous study that are not explored or referenced. For example, in Figure 5G, what are the round cells in the CHT that have switched? Could these be the stromal cells observed by Murayama et al? The switched cells in Figure 5J have endothelial morphology, but not the cells in Figure 5G.</p><p>13. The authors say that lineage tracing of tbx6:cre cells in the DA are consistent between multiple embryos over different stages, however this should be better quantified with more of the data represented in the analysis. It would be informative to show data before the 90 hpf timepoint in Figure 5E-J.</p><p>14. Are the Cre reporter lines single insertions? It appears from the FACs plots in S3 there are a range of signal intensities, and that some cells may express both colors, suggesting incomplete recombination of multiple insertions. This is possible too in Figure 5G that shows cell that appear double positive. Are there additional controls that could be presented?</p><p>15. The draculin-cre result is not surprising as the line markers endothelial and blood precursors that, as expected, are labeled in this experiment. These results are independent of SDEC ontogeny.

This study builds on and significantly extends recent work identifying a paraxial mesoderm derived endothelial population under the regulation of Meox that contributes to hemogenic fate in the dorsal aorta. Here, the authors have examined the interplay of several pathways, including Wnt and Notch, in regard to their contribution to the generation of these somite-derived endothelial cells (SDECs) from specific skeletal muscle progenitors and their subsequent role in HSC formation. The authors find that this population of SDECs, marked by ETV2-reporter expression, is derived specifically from the dermomyotome, in balance with the production of muscle cell types. Consistent with early studies in the chick, they describe integration of the SDEC population into the dorsal aorta itself, and then provide novel insight into their preferential localization as well as an unexpected role in paracrine BMP4 mediated HSC regulation. Interestingly, the authors also show, using the reporter line, that the SDEC population is missing in cloche embryos. Through elegant scRNA-seq analysis and lineage trajectory studies, they identified several transcriptionally distinct endothelial populations in the early embryo, prior to HSC specification and vascular maturation, and show how modulation of Notch signaling, known to be essential for hemogenic fate, does or does not impact their development. Finally, the authors investigate the role of ID1 in Notch associated regulation of HSC development. There are several important novel insights provided by the study, however the flow of the report, and strong initial emphasis on the SDEC population, masks some of the other key observations uncovered regarding endothelial biology and hematopoietic fate in the early vertebrate embryo.</p><p>1. The flow of the manuscript is somewhat problematic. The authors perform a very elegant unbiased profiling study which identifies several distinct endothelial populations in the embryo, including the SDECs, at a much earlier timepoint than previously anticipated. Given recent publications, rather than starting with characterization of the SDEC population, and evaluating their production and function with additional precision, the authors might consider inverting the study to describe and then validate the relationships and regulation of the formation of each distinct subset, at least in regard to those impacting blood formation. In essence they end up doing this for SDECs, arterial and hemogenic endothelium already in the later figures, but altering the flow may help to highlight distinctions from prior work, as well as alleviate some of confusion/ redundancy regarding the multiple roles/timing of Notch signaling, and differing mechanistic influences hemogenic fate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank our reviewer for this excellent suggestion and agree that restructuring the manuscript has provided an emphasis on novelty, a more logical progression, and improved clarity. As suggested, we have now structured the paper to lead with the divergence of the endothelial lineages and the early onset of their specification, as highlighted by the single-cell work. We then focus upon the uniqueness of the somite-derived endothelial cell (SDEC) population and characterize their cellular and molecular nature. We now quantify SDEC formation per somite pair, better characterize their cellular emergence from the somites, characterize the molecular regulation of their emergence, and focus upon their role as niche support cells within the dorsal aorta to regulate the emergence of HSPCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. With the current layout of the manuscript, the very intriguing studies at the end of the paper regarding ID1 seem disconnected from the main focus on the SDECs.

It thus is certainly not a specific marker of SDECs. To specifically mark SDECs, we used a PM-specific lineage tracer, <italic>tbx6:Cre</italic>, and two “switch” lines. In the first combination, <italic>tbx6:Gal4; Tg(UAS-Cre); A2BD</italic> animals show switching of PM-derived lineages from BFP<sup>+</sup> to dsRed<sup>+</sup> cells, allowing SDECs to be followed upon leaving the somite and integrating into the DA. In the second combination, <italic>tbx6:Gal4; Tg(UAS-Cre); kdrl:CSY</italic> animals will switch out a CFP cassette to YFP in PM-derived cells. Because this switched transgene will only be expressed in endothelial cells due to the <italic>kdrl</italic> driver, only SDECs will be marked with YFP, whereas all other ECs will remain CFP<sup>+</sup> due to derivation from non-PM-derived precursors. In both lineage tracing lines, we show PM-derived ECs lodged within the floor of the DA (Figure 8). In addition, we have added a meticulously performed analysis of the migration and localization of SDECs to the DA by using a photoconvertible <italic>Tg(actb2:nls-Eos); Tg(fli1:eGFP)<sup>y1</sup></italic> transgenic line. By applying precise photoconversion of single somite pairs and following their trajectories into the DA, we further support SDEC contribution to the DA, provide a detailed map of the somites involved (trunk somites), and quantify the number of SDECs contributed by each somite pair (Figure 3). We believe that these additional observations provide further evidence of SDEC emergence, migration, and contribution to the DA. We have not yet identified a single gene product that can be used to specifically identify SDECs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Surprisingly, the tissue-specific signatures we detected at 22 hpf can be traced backward in developmental time. We identified EC clusters with distinct transcriptomes as early as the tailbud stage, suggesting that EC specification starts by the end of gastrulation and the initiation of somitogenesis. While the EC clusters were still heterogeneous prior to the 12 ss stage, we could identify most EC subsets, including HE, pre-HSC, KVECs, BVECs, and SDECs, after the 15 ss when their transcriptomes became more defined.

We also confirmed this observation by FISH, where we observed <italic>etv2<sup>+</sup> / meox1<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>etv2<sup>+</sup> / pax3<sup>+</sup></italic> cells at 12 ss. Furthermore, when we knocked down <italic>meox1</italic>, we observed ectopic formation of <italic>m</italic>eox1<sup>+</sup> / <italic>etv2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells. Together, these data indicate that SDECs arise from a bipotent progenitor population as early as the 12ss.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. What is the significance or conclusions drawn from the regional anterior-trunk-posterior observations presented in Figure 5?</p></disp-quote><p>That, relative to cells marked by a <italic>drl:Cre</italic><sup>ERT2</sup> lineage tracer that labels all ECs, a <italic>tbx6:Cre</italic> driver specifically targeting SDECs generates ECs that traffic only to the anterior / trunk portions of the aorta. We have clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The rationale for choosing lines for scRNA-seq (Etv2:kaede, Fli1:dsRed; Tp1:GFP, and Draculin:Dendra:H2B) is not clear because these lines are not specific to ECs and are known collectively to mark blood, endocardium, and other cell types. How do the authors distinguish between subtypes of ECs versus other cell types altogether?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose a variety of lines to ensure we would mark all EC subsets and have reference populations built into our data sets. For example, <italic>etv2:Kaede</italic> is a general marker of endothelium, <italic>fli1:DsRed/tp1:GFP</italic> marks arterial endothelium, and <italic>draculin</italic> (<italic>drl</italic>) labels LPM, ECs, and HECs depending upon the developmental timepoint. Having distinct overlapping and nonoverlapping populations allowed us to validate our results via the presence or absence of the respective populations of interest. For example, SDECs do not appear in <italic>drl</italic>-marked cells as this line marks LPM descendants. Following unbiased clustering of all ECs, we used the coexpression of landmark genes to assign ECs with different tissue origins (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 and source data 1). We have clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The authors could show in Figure 6 where etv2:kaede and the other sorted reporter lines map onto these clusters. The authors could also provide scRNA-seq data for the same etv2:gfp+ cells that were presented in previous figures to confirm the presence of SDECs.</p></disp-quote><p>Good ideas. We have revised Figure 6 (now Figure 1) to include a UMAP and heatmap with EC cluster identity and differentially expressed genes used to help identify each cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. A recent paper comparing a new etv2 knock-in line with existing transgenic lines shows differences in expression patterns (Chestnut &amp; Sumanas Dev Dyn 2020). Although data is presented in this study that shows endogenous expression of etv2 using FISH, it is possible that expression and conclusions drawn from the etv2:gfp line does not precisely follow endogenous cell types. This caveat should be considered and discussed within the larger context of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to comment 8. Because each EC marker captures only a subset of the total EC populations, we used a broader strategy to capture and analyze ECs, by sorting ECs not only from <italic>TgBAC(etv2:Kaede)<sup>ci6</sup> embryos</italic> but also from <italic>Tg(fli1:eGFP)<sup>y1</sup>; Tg(tp1:GFP)<sup>um14</sup>, and Tg(drl:H2B-dendra).</italic> For imaging and lineage-based experiments, we have used a validated version of <italic>etv2</italic> reporter line, <italic>Tg(etv2.1:eGFP)<sup>zf372</sup></italic> (Veldman and Lin, 2012) that, was shown to be more precise than the previous BAC-based <italic>etv2</italic> reporter line. In addition, most of our major conclusions based upon the <italic>Tg(etv2.1:eGFP)<sup>zf372</sup></italic> reporter lines are complemented by our FISH studies for endogenous <italic>etv2</italic> expression; we observed close correlations with the transgenic pattern in all cases analyzed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. It is unclear from the FISH images if the etv2+ cells are in fact double positive with meox1, or if etv2+ cells are intercalated between meox1 cells. The green meox1 signal appears low within the boundaries of etv2+ cells. Could this be resolved by crossing the etv2:gfp line with a red muscle progenitor reporter line, if available?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have a red reporter line for muscle cells available. However, our results show coexpression of <italic>etv2</italic> with <italic>pax3a</italic> (Figure 4F); thus, both experiments support that SDECs are derived from shared progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors do not discuss the paper by Murayama et al. (Nat. Comm. 2015) that shows stromal cells in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) directly delaminate from the somites. There are important similarities between this manuscript and the previous study that are not explored or referenced. For example, in Figure 5G, what are the round cells in the CHT that have switched? Could these be the stromal cells observed by Murayama et al? The switched cells in Figure 5J have endothelial morphology, but not the cells in Figure 5G.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the cells under study in the Murayama paper are vascular smooth muscle cells or stromal cells based upon their morphology and lineal origin from the sclerotome. We thus did not think the papers were directly comparable. That said, on some rare occasions, we occasionally detected lineage-traced cells in the posterior caudal vein, intersomitic vessels or extravascular space. We now discuss these findings and the possibility of having labeled some of the stromal cells identified by Murayama and colleagues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The authors say that lineage tracing of tbx6:cre cells in the DA are consistent between multiple embryos over different stages, however this should be better quantified with more of the data represented in the analysis. It would be informative to show data before the 90 hpf timepoint in Figure 5E-J.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have now included photoconvertible <italic>Tg(actb2:nls-Eos); Tg(fli1:eGFP)<sup>y1</sup></italic> transgenic animals that describe the migration of the SDECs with greater precision and show their contribution to the DA at 36 hpf (Figure 3). In addition, our imaging experiments using <italic>tbx6:Gal4; Tg(UAS-Cre); A2BD</italic> show PM-derived SDECs incorporated into the floor of the DA at 48 hpf (Figure 8A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Are the Cre reporter lines single insertions? It appears from the FACs plots in S3 there are a range of signal intensities, and that some cells may express both colors, suggesting incomplete recombination of multiple insertions. This is possible too in Figure 5G that shows cell that appear double positive. Are there additional controls that could be presented?</p></disp-quote><p>We found that all <italic>cre</italic> lines utilized segregated in mendelian ratios, consistent with only single insertions. In addition, we found that the range of signal intensities in the switched RFP<sup>+</sup> (Figure 8 —figure supplement 1A) is mirrored by the range of intensities observed in the unswitched BFP<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 8 —figure supplement 1B). Therefore, we believe that fluorophore expression levels are based on the hematopoietic cell type in which they are expressed and not on transgene copy number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. The draculin-cre result is not surprising as the line markers endothelial and blood precursors that, as expected, are labeled in this experiment. These results are independent of SDEC ontogeny. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>drl:Cre</italic><sup>ERT2</sup> results were added as a control / contrast to those obtained with <italic>tbx6:Cre</italic>. We have clarified this information in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. In Figure 7A, bmp4 only appears upregulated in a small number of SDECs, and yet the conclusion is made that this is an important factor produced by SDECs.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that <italic>bmp4</italic> is only expressed in a few SDECs. However, we observe no <italic>bmp4</italic> expression in endothelial cells from the LPM and believe that this difference could be due to heterogeneity within SDECs and/or resolution of the scRNA-Seq datasets. That said, we also felt the <italic>bmp4</italic> results should be further investigated and reported in future work. We have removed the results on <italic>bmp4</italic> and <italic>id1</italic> from this manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers are very enthusiastic about the revised manuscript.

Need more detail about microscopy that allowed resolution of CFP and YFP from kdrl:CSY line in Figure 8E-J.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his comment. We added the following description of the imaging settings and filters used to distinguish between CFP and YFP in the material and methods sections. “Since the emission spectra of CFP and YFP overlap, images were captured in two separate sequences to filter overlapping signals by limiting the PMT detection. For CFP a 476nm laser was used, and the PMT detector was set to collect signals ranging between 480nm and 505nm. For YFP, a 514nm laser was used, and the PMT detector was set to collect signals ranging between 520nm and 570nm.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The drl:Cre-ERT2 data in Figure 8H-K is not clearly convincing and could be removed. The tbx6:Cre data makes the point well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his comment. Draculin is an early broad marker gene for the lateral plate mesoderm. Therefore using the drl:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup> as a driver for converting endothelial cells is a good control to show the potential of these cells to convert, hence, the efficiency of the reporter line. Thus, the data in Figure 8 serves not only to show that most cells in the DA are descendants of LPM but also as control for our kdrl:CFP to YFP reporter fish line.</p></body></sub-article></article>
