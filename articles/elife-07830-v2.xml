In particular, type I SGNs must precisely connect with inner HCs (IHCs) while avoiding connections with nearby outer HCs (OHCs). The factors that mediate these patterning events are largely unknown. Using sparse-labeling and time-lapse imaging, we visualized for the first time the behaviors of developing SGNs including active retraction of processes from OHCs, suggesting that some type I SGNs contact OHCs before forming synapses with IHCs. In addition, we demonstrate that expression of Semaphorin-3F in the OHC region inhibits type I SGN process extension by activating Neuropilin-2 receptors expressed on SGNs. These results suggest a model in which cochlear innervation patterns by type I SGNs are determined, at least in part, through a Semaphorin-3F-mediated inhibitory signal that impedes processes from extending beyond the IHC region.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07830.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07830.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07830.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The process of hearing begins when sound waves enter the outer ear, causing the eardrum to vibrate. The three small bones of the middle ear pass these vibrations on to the cochlea, a fluid-filled structure shaped like a spiral. Tiny hair cells inside the cochlea move in response to the vibrations and convert them into electrical signals, which are transmitted by cells called spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) to the brain.</p><p>Hair cells can be divided into ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ hair cells. Inner hair cells transmit most of the information about a sound to the brain, via connections with type I SGNs. Outer hair cells are thought to amplify sound and connect to type II SGNs. How the type I and II SGNs connect to the correct type of hair cell as the ear develops is not well understood, despite these connections being essential for hearing.</p><p>Coate et al. have now used time-lapse imaging and fixed specimens to follow individually labeled SGNs as they establish these connections within the cochlea of a mouse embryo. Although the type I SGNs ultimately formed connections with inner hair cells, many of them made contact with outer hair cells first. These contacts were short-lived thanks to a protein found near the outer hair cells, named Semaphorin-3F. This protein repels the type I SGNs by activating a receptor on their surface called Neuropilin-2, and so directs the type I SGNs towards the inner hair cells.</p><p>One of the mysteries that remains to be solved is how type II SGNs are ‘permitted’ to extend into the outer hair cell region, even though they are also confronted by Semaphorin-3F. In addition, it will also be important to determine how SGNs adapt to cues from different Semaphorins from different parts of the cochlea as they navigate into different hair cell regions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07830.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07830.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>spiral ganglion neurons</kwd><kwd>Semaphorin</kwd><kwd>Neuropilin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC13107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coate</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC000059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelley</surname><given-names>Matthew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The development of the mammalian cochlea undergoes a period of embryonic refinement in which the outer hair cell region repels incoming type I spiral ganglion neurons, thus ensuring these neurons instead form connections with inner hair cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The perception of sound in mammals depends on appropriate connectivity between spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and hair cells (HCs) in the cochlea. SGNs are bipolar afferents linking the peripheral and central auditory systems by projecting peripheral axons that form ribbon-type synapses with cochlear HCs, and central axons that synapse with neurons in the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nayagam et al., 2011</xref>). It is known that SGN loss is a key aspect of congenital or noise-induced hearing loss, but only a small handful of mechanisms controlling the formation of this part of the auditory system have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritzsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appler and Goodrich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coate and Kelley, 2013</xref>). During mouse development, otic neuroblasts delaminate from the otocyst around embryonic day 8.5 and then differentiate into either vestibular or auditory (spiral ganglion [SG]) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appler and Goodrich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coate and Kelley, 2013</xref>). Subsequently, the SGN somata extend in a spiral that mirrors the adjacent developing cochlear duct (∼E11.5-P0) while projecting peripheral processes (sometimes termed ‘peripheral axons’ or ‘dendrites’) into the sensory epithelium and central axons into the brainstem. The dependence of neurotrophins for the survival and viability of SGNs during these stages has been documented extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritzsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Green et al., 2012</xref>), but relatively little is known about the mechanisms controlling SGN diversification and wiring with specific cochlear HC regions during development.</p><p>Although SGNs show little morphological variability, they are clearly diverse in several ways. First, SGNs are divided into two broad categories: type I and type II. Type I SGNs represent 90–95% of the total SGN population, form monosynaptic contacts with individual inner HCs (IHCs), and facilitate the majority of all hearing function. Type II SGNs comprise the remaining 5–10% of the SGN population, and, in contrast with Type I SGNs, bypass the IHCs to form <italic>en passant</italic> synapses with up to 10 outer HCs (OHCs) per individual SGN fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, type II SGNs are not myelinated by the neural crest derived-Schwann cells that myelinate type I SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carney and Silver, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breuskin et al., 2010</xref>). Although their function is not well understood, recent landmark studies have suggested that type II SGNs may facilitate responses to very loud or painful sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weisz et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2014</xref>). SGNs also show differences in protein expression and firing rates that correlate with their location along the tonotopic axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores-Otero et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, type I fibers can be sub-divided into two groups based on spontaneous firing rates and synaptic location at the base of individual IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liberman, 1982</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07830.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of SGN innervation patterns.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the innervation pattern of inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) by type I and II spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs).

One of the most basic issues has been the question of whether individual SGN fibers are specified as either type I or type II prior to the arrival of their peripheral processes in the cochlear duct or if phenotype is established based on interactions within the target environment. Echteler used horse radish peroxidase staining to provide evidence that, in the postnatal gerbil cochlea, immature SGNs show unbiased innervation to both HC regions and are subsequently retained in either the IHC or OHC region likely through a process of selective pruning and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Echteler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Echteler et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, rhodamine-dextran dye-labeling of type I SGNs in mouse suggested that HC innervation was non-specific until about postnatal day 3 when refinement events seemed to commence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). However, genetic-labeling experiments in which sparse numbers of SGNs expressed alkaline phosphatase under the control of Cre recombinase (driven by <italic>Neurogenin-1</italic> promoter elements; <italic>Neurog1</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup>) suggested that ‘mature’ SGN innervation patterns are present by birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koundakjian et al., 2007</xref>). These results provide conflicting conclusions regarding the timing and determination of type I and type II SGNs. We sought to gain clarity on this issue by combining the same <italic>Neurog1</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup> allele with a tdTomato reporter in order to characterize the timeline of IHC and OHC innervation by the SGNs. In addition, we designed experiments to investigate potential molecular mechanisms controlling the differential innervation of IHCs and OHCs and discovered a prominent chemorepulsive role for Neuropilin-2 and its ligand, Semaphorin-3F.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of type I and type II SGN morphologies occurs prior to birth in mice</title><p>Because existing data were somewhat unclear regarding the developmental timing of type I and type II SGN projection patterns, SGN processes and nascent HCs were visualized in cochlear cross sections from different developmental time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Driver et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–H</xref>). At embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), prior to detectable expression of Atoh1, SGN processes are present outside of the duct, but do not yet project into the cochlear epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By one day later (E14.5), processes have entered the epithelium at the more mature base of the cochlea while remaining outside in less mature, more mid-modiolar regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Neurite entry correlates with the onset of Atoh1 expression in developing HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; arrow). At E15.5, the ratio of SGN processes projecting towards the emerging OHC region appears to be closer to 50:50 than to the mature ratio of 5:95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>; see arrowheads). However, at E16.5, a noticeably higher concentration of processes appears around the IHC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; see arrowheads). These data suggest that the SGNs may assume a type I- or type II-like morphology as early as E16.5, which is both consistent with the time period of hair and supporting cell maturation and earlier than previously suggested. Consequently, we focused on these earlier time points in subsequent investigations into the cellular and molecular nature of IHC and OHC innervation.</p><p>Approximately, 10–15 individual SGN peripheral axons project to each IHC, making analysis of changes in individual fibers difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). To circumvent this problem, mice carrying an inducible <italic>Neurog1</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup> BAC transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koundakjian et al., 2007</xref>) were crossed with an <italic>R26R</italic><sup><italic>tdTomato</italic></sup> reporter line (referred to as N<sup>Cre</sup>R<sup>Tom</sup>). By limiting recombination to a small number of SGNs, individual fibers with type I- and type II-like morphologies can be clearly visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>). The intensity of the tdTomato fluorophore also permitted the resolution of small exploratory protrusions on individual SGN processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Maturing SGNs extend and then retract projections from the OHC region</title><p>To better understand the temporal and spatial dynamics of SGN process development, we visualized sparsely labeled individual SGNs (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details) in whole-mount preparations of cochleae from N<sup>Cre</sup>R<sup>Tom</sup> mice at different developmental time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The mice also carried the <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup><italic>nGFP</italic></sup> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lumpkin et al., 2003</xref>), which allows for easy identification of IHCs and OHCs. At the mid-point along the cochlea at E15.5, approximately 60% of individual SGN fibers terminated in the IHC region while the remaining 40% extended into the OHC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,E</xref>). However, in a more basal region of the same cochlea, the number of fibers terminating in the IHC and OHC regions was roughly equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results were comparable to the distribution of total fibers that was observed in cross-sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). In contrast, at E17.5 or 18.5, between 70 to 80% of all labeled processes were apposed to IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>), suggesting that a progressive transition to the mature innervation pattern begins shortly after E15.5. Consistent with this trend, at P0 and through P3, approximately 90–95% of all labeled SGNs fibers terminated in the IHC region with the remaining 5–10% extending into the OHC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>). Previously, studies using the postnatal gerbil showed that programmed cell death may contribute to the final distribution of type I and II SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Echteler et al., 2005</xref>). To determine if apoptosis could play a role in SGN innervation patterns during embryonic mouse development, we examined cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) immunostaining at E16.5 and E17.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). In the basal half of the cochlea at these stages, where most of our neuronal-tracing experiments were performed, we detected between 4 and 19 CC3-positive SGNs per cochlea. At the apex, between 18 and 50 CC3-positive SGNs were observed per cochlea. Given that the number of SGNs is estimated to be greater than twenty thousand at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richter et al., 2011</xref>), a role for apopotic cell death in SGN innervation at this stage seems unlikely.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07830.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sparse SGN labeling reveals retraction of processes from the OHC region during embryonic development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Fixed whole-mount cochleae from <italic>Neurog1</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup><italic>;R26R</italic><sup><italic>tdTomato</italic></sup>; <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup><italic>nGFP</italic></sup> mice at E15.5 (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) and E18.5 (<bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>).

Analysis of time-lapse videos indicated numerous instances of SGN processes that extended into the OHC region and then retracted back into the IHC region or that were present in the OHC region at the beginning of the experiment and then retracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We quantified this effect for axons in four independent time-lapse experiments and found that 10–60% of the axons that started in the OHC region had retracted by the end of the acquisition period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Because of the thickness of the tissue, we were not able to resolve the final location of each process that retracted from the OHC region; however, many of them appeared to aggregate around the IHCs (white arrowheads; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In addition, although we cannot rule out that it occurs at all, we never identified new SGNs approaching the IHCs in these experiments. Overall, these data indicate that many SGN peripheral axons initially extend into the OHC region but subsequently retract to form connections with IHCs. Moreover, these results suggest that most SGNs have determined their phenotype (type I vs type II) by the late embryonic period or just shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video1" mime-subtype="m4v" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-07830-media1-v2.m4v"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07830.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>A cochlea from a mouse carrying the <italic>Neurog1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic>; Rosa-tdTomato; Atoh1-nGFP alleles that was imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy for approximately 20 hr.</title><p>The orange dots mark SGN processes that can be seen projecting into the OHC region and then falling back to the IHC region.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07830.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07830.006</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nrp2 is expressed in SGNs and is required for a normal pattern of innervation</title><p>The results described above suggest that development of SGN innervation patterns may be influenced by environmental cues within the developing organ of Corti.

Moreover, our previous unpublished studies using RT-PCR demonstrated that <italic>Neuropilin-2</italic> (<italic>Nrp2</italic>) is expressed in whole cochleae at E16.5. Therefore, to determine the temporal and spatial distribution of Nrp2, we localized Nrp2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giger et al., 2000</xref>) on cross-sections of developing cochleae and counterstained with Tuj1 to mark SGN somata and their processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–H</xref>). For the cross-sections shown here, identical fixation, immunostaining, and imaging parameters were used throughout. At E14.5, Nrp2 was detectable in the SGNs, but not in surrounding mesenchyme or epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). At E16.5, when SGNs develop region-specific innervation patterns, Nrp2 is clearly detectable in the somata and peripheral axons of the SGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The Nrp2 antibody labeled all of the SGN cell bodies, which suggests Nrp2 is expressed by all SGNs. Consistent with this conclusion, Nrp2 was visible along all putative type I and II SGN endings in cross-sections at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>) and in whole-mount preparations at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>).

To test this, we analyzed SGN process extensions in cochleae from <italic>Nrp2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giger et al., 2000</xref>). As expected, in wild type (WT) cochleae at E15.5, SGN processes are nearly evenly distributed between the IHC and OHC regions of the organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>Nrp2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cochleae at E15.5, there were large bundles of SGN processes that extended into the OHC region, with far fewer processes terminating near the IHC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L–N</xref>). These changes were not a result of a decrease in the total number of SGNs, as quantifying SGN somata density indicated no differences between WT and <italic>Nrp2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cochleae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). In order to quantify changes in SGN patterning in <italic>Nrp2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutants, it was necessary to discriminate SGNs from associated olivocochlear efferent fibers. Since both are labeled by pan-neuronal markers such as neurofilament or beta-III-tubulin (Tuj1), we screened over a dozen antibodies against known neuronal factors and found that synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1) antibodies label the SGN afferent axons but do not mark olivocochlear efferents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P–T</xref>). Triple labeling with Tuj1 (all neurons, blue), Syt-1 (SGN afferent axons, red), and GAP-43 (olivocochlear efferents, green; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simmons et al., 1996</xref>) in an E17.5 cochlea demonstrates the specificity of the Syt-1 antibody for afferent SGN axons.

Moreover, in order to unambiguously visualize potential changes in axonal morphology or path finding, the <italic>Nrp2</italic> mutant strain was bred onto the N<sup>Cre</sup>;R<sup>Tom</sup> line. This allowed visualization of a limited number of SGN axons in animals with significantly decreased Nrp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>).

At E14.5 (not shown) and E16.5, <italic>Sema3f</italic> transcripts were detectable in the apical, middle, and basal turns of the cochlea in a pattern that is distinct from the other <italic>Sema3s</italic> we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Expression of <italic>Sema3f</italic> is present in two regions of the duct: an extreme medial region near the junction with Reissner's membrane and in a lateral domain that correlates with the developing sensory epithelium. At higher magnification, <italic>Sema3f</italic> appears to be expressed in a domain of cells that includes OHCs, pillar cells (PCs), Dieters' cells, and Henson's cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Moreover, the domain has a sharp medial boundary that appears to correlate with the junction between the IHC and OHC regions. To better resolve the spatial distribution of <italic>Sema3f</italic> mRNA, we post-stained samples with antibodies against myosin VI and Neurofilament light chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J–L</xref>). The merged image demonstrates that <italic>Sema3f</italic> expression clearly overlaps with the OHC region and is completely absent from the IHC region. In addition, the sharp medial boundary appears to precisely correlate with the limiting extension of developing SGN processes. At postnatal day 0 (P0), <italic>Sema3f</italic> expression in the cochlea is diminished and the distribution pattern has changed. At the apex, <italic>Sema3f</italic> is detectable in the PCs and faintly present in nearby supporting cells, while at the cochlear base, <italic>Sema3f</italic> expression is limited to just the outer PCs. At P5, <italic>Sema3f</italic> was not detectable in the cochlear epithelium (not shown).

Despite initial descriptions dating back more than 100 years, our understanding of the development and organization of this structure remains limited. A particularly intriguing issue has been the question of whether type I and type II SGNs are determined as a result of the expression of distinct transcriptional networks, as a result of interactions between peripheral axons and target HCs, or a combination of both. Classic studies of developing SGNs by Echteler and others indicated the presence of individual fibers in contact with both IHCs and OHCs, supporting the possibility of target-mediated determination of SGN cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Echteler, 1992</xref>). However, more recent work using genetic labeling provides strong evidence for the presence of committed type I and type II SGN fibers in the mouse inner ear even at embryonic ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koundakjian et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, detailed morphological and cellular analyses by N Druckenbroad and L Goodrich (personal communication) revealed that both type I and II SGNs show stereotyped path-finding behaviors, supporting the idea that each SGN subtype may be predetermined to an extent. The results presented here (and by Druckenbroad and Goodrich) show that cochlear innervation normally involves the transient extension of SGN fibers into the OHC region between E15.5 and E16.5. After this brief period and continuing through P0, the majority of SGN processes converge on the IHC region. This occurs through both the arrival of new fibers and the retraction of existing processes from the OHC region. Labeling of future type I fibers with transient OHC extensions could appear as individual neurons with indeterminate phenotypes. Moreover, considering that the cells within the cochlear epithelium are in the process of both differentiation and active extension between E15.5 and E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Kelley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coate and Kelley, 2013</xref>), it is not surprising that SGN processes might also be highly dynamic during this time period. Nrp2-mediated repulsion in response to Sema3F was identified many years ago and has been documented in multiple events ranging from axon guidance to synaptic pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demyanenko et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, there is strong precedent for Sema3F-Nrp2 interactions serving a repulsive role in SGN-HC connectivity.</p><p>The observation of active extension and retraction of SGN processes into and out of the OHC region is consistent with the presence of inhibitory signals acting on those processes. In these studies, we demonstrate that repulsive signaling mediated by Sema3F in the OHC region and Nrp2 in SGNs controls, at least in part, the number of SGN fibers that terminate on OHCs. Our findings support a model in which the embryonic OHC region maintains a compartment of Sema3F protein expression, which activates Nrp2 receptors expressed on SGNs leading to retraction of processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Since this inhibitory signal is restricted to the OHC domain, this interaction would enforce contacts between SGN fibers and IHCs.</p><p>Type I SGNs were still observed even in the complete absence of either <italic>Nrp2</italic> or <italic>Sema3f</italic>. There are several possible explanations for this phenotype. First, it is reasonable to assume that compensatory guidance mechanisms are in place to ensure that most type I SGNs terminate on IHCs. For example, there are a variety of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) expressed in the cochlea such as the immunoglobulin superfamily of CAMs (like NCAM), cadherins (E-cad and N-Cad), and integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelley, 2003</xref>), all of which may help attract type I SGNs to the IHC region. In addition, it was recently shown that ephrin-A5/Epha4 signaling may also act to repel type I SGNs from OHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Defourny et al., 2013</xref>). These studies, however, were limited to early postnatal and adult cochlear samples, thus, the extent to which these factors are involved in targeting events during embryonic development remains uncertain. Finally, it is also possible that the developing SGN population is heterogeneous with some neurons demonstrating more dynamic exploratory behavior than others. Therefore, some fibers may be less inclined to extend into the OHC region even in the absence of inhibitory signals. This hypothesis might be consistent with the idea that some SGNs are initially committed to a type I fate while others rely on target-based interactions to determine their phenotype.</p><p>As discussed, despite the presence of additional type II-like processes in <italic>Nrp2</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> cochleae at birth, analysis of adult animals indicated a normal number of type II SGNs and hearing sensitivity. These results suggest that the additional type II-like fibers observed at birth are most likely eliminated over time and the factors that mediate this recovery are unknown. Given that ‘mature’ type I/type II SGN patterns are established by P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and that HC ribbon synapses are visible by P0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2012</xref>), it could be that Eph/ephrin signaling might be involved in synaptic pruning-based refinements postnatally. In addition, programmed cell death may also contribute to the final innervation pattern, as apoptosis in SGNs has been reported in the postnatal gerbil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Echteler et al., 2005</xref>). However, we did not detect any appreciable SGN fragmentation or apoptosis in our experiments here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) or in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coate et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, while we cannot rule it out entirely, we would not predict that apoptosis plays a significant role in shaping cochlear innervation during development.</p><p>Finally, this study also raises several intriguing questions to be addressed in the future. First, since Sema3F acts as a repulsive signal for SGN processes, how are type II SGNs, which appear to express Nrp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), able to project into the OHC region (see ‘?’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>)? We did not detect differences in Nrp2 levels between putative type I and type II SGNs, which could have accounted possibly for differences in responsiveness to Sema3F. We are currently in favor of the model that type I and type II SGNs differentially express or target Plexin-A co-receptors, as the absence of these obligatory co-receptors could effectively inactive the Sema3F-Nrp2 inhibitory interaction. Plexin-A1 and Plexin-A3 proteins were localized to the SGNs previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katayama et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we found <italic>Plxna3</italic> mRNA broadly expressed by the SGNs and Plexin-A3 protein enriched in putative type I SGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). While these data suggest that where type I or II SGNs ultimately terminate may depend on Plexin-A3 protein levels, a more careful analysis of the Plexin-A3 distribution and function is needed. A second question relates to the remarkably different patterns of expression exhibited by the different <italic>Sema3s</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). What factor(s) control these discrete <italic>Sema3</italic> domains? GATA transcription factors have been shown previously to regulate <italic>Sema</italic> expression and are known players in inner ear morphogenesis and wiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lepore et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kodo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appler and Lu, 2013</xref>), so perhaps one role of GATAs in the inner ear is to regulate <italic>Sema3</italic> levels. Other clues related to this matter may come from previous findings where either the loss of Prox1 or Fgfr3 signaling led to increases in OHC innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Puligilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fritzsch et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible, therefore, that Prox1 controls the expression of factors such as <italic>Sema3f</italic> or that the local distribution of the different <italic>Sema3s</italic> is controlled by morphogens such as Fgfs. Overall, it will be important in future studies to investigate upstream activators of <italic>Sema3</italic> expression and mechanisms that ultimately distinguish the morphological differentiation of type I and type II SGNs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines and tissue preparation</title><p>All animals used in this study were maintained in accordance with the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee.

An SGN was considered ‘in the OHC region’ if the most prominent part of the axon (barrel) clearly crossed the plane of the medial edge of the first OHC. Conversely, an SGN was considered ‘in the IHC region’ if it stopped at the IHC region. To quantify the number of Syt+ axons that had crossed into the OHC region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, confocal Z-stacks were acquired at positions corresponding to 50% of the cochlear length. The number of Syt+ fibers that crossed into the OHC region were counted and normalized to the length of the region; the length of the region was determined by drawing a line along the medial side of the IHCs. For quantifications using the sparse SGN-labeling model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig8">Figures 4, 8</xref>), a series of high-resolution confocal Z-stacks were acquired along the length of each specimen using an automated-scanning stage. The files were subsequently imported to Volocity for quantification of IHC vs OHC position and branching morphometrics. To quantify ribbon synapses, cochleae were stained with anti-CtBP2 antibodies and photographed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). To quantify E15.5 SGN density in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, Tuj1-stained whole-mount cochleae were imaged by confocal z-stack and the spherical nuclei within each stack were counted manually. For the SGN counts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, similar methods were used, but we were only able to reliably quantify the first few cell layers because of limited tissue penetration by the mouse-anti-Tuj1 antibody at this older stage (P0). For consistency across the P0 samples, we limited our counts to only 10 μm of z depth. To quantify HC density in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, myosin VI-positive HCs at the base of P0 cochleae were imaged by confocal microscopy. For each sample, we acquired 5 confocal z-stacks at 63× in non-overlapping regions along the first 1 mm of cochlear length (starting from the base). HCs were counted manually.</p><p>To quantify apoptosis in E16.5 and E17.5 SGNs, we stained cochleae in whole mount with anti-cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) and Tuj1 antibodies. Cells were counted as SGNs undergoing apoptosis if they were (1) CC3 positive, (2) within the Tuj1-positive SGN cell body region, and (3) bipolar cells (7–8 μm wide) with peripheral and central projections. We could not rely on Tuj1 co-staining because the Tuj1 antibody did not show identical levels of tissue penetration compared to the CC3 antibodies. Other cells (glial cells, blood vessel cells, mesenchyme cells) or fragmented debris were not counted. Low-magnification views were used to measure cochlear length in order to determine the basal and apical halves. Two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests were used throughout.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work investigates the selective innervation by type I spinal ganglion neurons (SGNs) of inner hair cells in the developing murine cochlea, demonstrating selective retraction of SGNs from outer hair cells prior to the likely formation of synapses with inner hair cells (IHCs). In addition to observing SGN innervation of both IHCs and OHCs, these experiments suggest that SGNs ultimately innervating IHCs appear to prune back contacts with OHCs. Determination of the number of SGCs innervating OHCs and IHCs, coupled with time-lapse imaging of SGN innervation, provide support this model. To understand the molecular basis for selective SGN CE innervation, the authors address the significance of neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) expression they observe in SGN neurons, apparently in all type 1 and II SGNs, during the developmental time window when projections are segregated. In Nrp2 mutants (both -/- and +/-) a general increase in CE innervation in the OHC region is observed, and using Syt-1 as an SGN-specific marker this hyper-innervation is shown to be due to SGN axons. More detailed genetic labeling in Nrp2-/+ mutants leads to a similar conclusion, and it also allows for observations of increased filopodial extensions from SGNs in the IHC CE. Surprisingly, both ribbon synapse number in cochleae (OHC and IHC), and the overall percentage of type II SGNs as determined morphologically by genetic labeling, are unchanged in adult Nrp2-/+ animals. Sema3F expression by in situ analysis correlates very nicely with this cue playing a role in constraining type I SGN extension to the IHC region. In vitro cochlea organotypic cultures are used to show that treatment with exogenous Sema3F can affect the extension and branching of SGN neurons, consistent with the proposed role for Sema3F in SGN connectivity. Finally, assessment using sparse genetic labeling of SGN innervation in a Sema3F null mutant shows photocopies the SGN targeting defects observed in Nrp2-/+ mutants.</p><p>There are, however, weaknesses that should be straightforward to address and doing so would significantly strengthen support for the proposed models. These weaknesses include reliance on the Nrp2/+animals, limited analyses of the role of Sema3F and a need to evaluate the role of A-type plexins, which could be differentially expressed on type I and II SGN axons. Specific comments are detailed below:</p><p>Major criticisms:</p><p>1) The apparent expression of Nrp2 in all SGN neurons presents a challenge to understanding the selective guidance of Type I SGN afferents by Sema3F as described here. The Nrp2 IHC presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not as convincing with respect to process distribution as it might be, and it would be helpful to complement these data with Alkaline-phosphatase::Sema3F ligand-binding to similar preparations at multiple states of cochlear development. This is a very sensitive assay, and it would indicate whether there is distinct subcellular localization of Nrp2 in type 2 as compared to type 1 SGN axons. If this is not possible, or lacks sufficient resolution in the hands of the authors, then analysis in flat mount tissue at higher magnification should be performed.</p><p>2) Neuropilin-2 staining should also be done on whole mount cochlea (not only sections) and on Ngn1-CreERT2;Rosatomato. This point is very important as a major problem with the proposed model is the presence of neuropilin-2 on both type I and type II SGN axons.</p><p>3) The authors should assess PlexA3 mRNA expression in SGN cell bodies throughout cochlear development since this is another potential determinant of Sema3F-selective guidance of SGN afferents.</p><p>4) The phenotypic analysis of the Sema3f KO is a bit too short (the age is mentioned neither in the legend nor on the figure). The authors should determine:</p><p>A) Is the defect is also transient in the Sema3f KO ?</p><p>B) Is the number of SGN neurons or IHCs/OHCs normal in the KO?</p><p>C) Do axons that remain in the OHCs region express neuropilin-2?</p><p>D) Can the authors clarify if there is any cell death that occurs in SGN neurons during the normal developmental intervals under investigation here?</p><p>E) Is SGN cell number affected at all in Nrp2-/-, Nrp2+/- and, importantly, in Sema3F-/- mutants?</p><p>5) Throughout this manuscript the authors refer to type I and II neuronal morphologies observed using their sparse labeling approach in terms of “numbers” of these two neuronal classes. However, the figures and methods make clear that this is not an absolute determination of cell number, but the % of sparsely labeled cells with these morphological characteristics that is presented. This should be changed throughout the text for experimental clarity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07830.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The apparent expression of Nrp2 in all SGN neurons presents a challenge to understanding the selective guidance of Type I SGN afferents by Sema3F as described here.

We were concerned that the colorimetric reaction used to detect AP-tagged fusion proteins would not provide the optical resolution necessary to identify different SGN or hair cell subpopulations. As an alternative, we used Fc-tagged fusion proteins and detected them by anti-Fc immunostaining and confocal microscopy. We were able to detect Sema-3F-Fc on both type I and II SGNs, similar to what was evident by the anti-Nrp2 antibody staining. The data appears now as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>. Text additions for these experiments can be found in the Results section (subsection “Nrp2 is expressed in SGNs and is required for a normal pattern of innervation”), the Materials and Methods (subsection “Binding assays with Fc conjugated probes”), and there is a new figure legend that can be found at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. The results support our original conclusion, that Nrp2 is expressed on both type I and type II SGNs.</p><p>However, as is described below in response to Major Criticism 3, we demonstrate that Plexin-A3 is differentially expressed between type I and type II SGNs. Therefore, it seems likely that it is the lack of Plexin-A3, rather than Nrp2, that mediates the differential responses of type I and type II SGNs to Sema-3F.</p><p><italic>2) Neuropilin-2 staining should also be done on whole mount cochlea (not only sections) and on Ngn1-CreERT2;Rosatomato. This point is very important as a major problem with the proposed model is the presence of neuropilin-2 on both type I and type II SGN axons.</italic></p><p>This was completed and appears now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In this new version, we have removed the P0 cross-section that appeared in the original figure and replaced it with the micrograph illustrating the SGN peripheral processes in whole mount. The original P0 sample was used to document our observation that Nrp2 levels in the SGN cell bodies begin to diminish around the time of birth. We have left this note in the text. Nrp2 immunoreactivity is still clearly evident in the SGN processes at this time point, however. P0 is the ideal time to show this, as type I and type II SGNs have been fully segregated by this stage (as documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>). During the time frame for submission of revisions, we were not able to collect enough <italic>Neurog1</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup><italic>; tdTomato</italic>-positive tissue to complement the whole mount preparations done with WT tissue. However, in our view, the Nrp2 staining in WT samples is entirely consistent with the position of type II SGNs and the results presented in response to Criticism 1. Text additions for this experiment can be found in the Results section (subsection “Nrp2 is expressed in SGNs and is required for a normal pattern of innervation”), in the Materials and methods (subsection “Antibodies, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization”) and changes were made to the existing figure legend.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should assess PlexA3 mRNA expression in SGN cell bodies throughout cochlear development since this is another potential determinant of Sema3F-selective guidance of SGN afferents</italic>.</p><p><italic>Plxna3</italic> mRNA expression data for several embryonic stages of mouse development is already available on the Allen Brain Atlas website. <italic>Plxna3</italic> mRNA is clearly visible in neurons of the cochleovestibular ganglion (SGN precursors) at E11.5 and in SGNs at E13.5 and E15.5. It is the generous policy of the Allen Brain Atlas that data from their website can be used and displayed in publications provided appropriate citations are made. The policy can be viewed here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alleninstitute.org/citation-policy/">http://www.alleninstitute.org/citation-policy/</ext-link>. Therefore, we have elected to cite these data and display example images as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>. In addition, to confirm their results, we generated our own <italic>Plxna3</italic>-specific riboprobe and found that it labels all of the SGN cell bodies at E16.5. These data were added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. In addition, we also show Plexin-A3 antibody staining. The antibody staining is very intriguing, as Plexin-A3 is apparently not expressed on type II SGNs. Therefore, it may be the distribution of Plexin-A3 that accounts for the selective guidance of type I and type II SGNs. These data are described in the Results section (subsection “Plexin-A3 is expressed by the SGNs during development”), the Materials and methods section (subsection “Antibodies, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization”), in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> legend and in the Discussion (fifth paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) The phenotypic analysis of the Sema3f KO is a bit too short (the age is mentioned neither in the legend nor on the figure)</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for pointing out that we failed to include the age (P0). This was added to the figure and legend.</p><p><italic>The authors should determine</italic>:</p><p><italic>A) Is the defect is also transient in the Sema3f KO ?</italic></p><p>Yes, as shown in new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, we found the defect is also transient in the <italic>Sema3f ko</italic> mice. Because of the time period provided for revisions and several cannibalized litters, we were only able to generate 4 <italic>Sema3f ko</italic> cochleae and 6 controls. These 6 controls consisted of 2 WT cochleae and 4 <italic>Sema3f</italic> heterozygous cochleae. No differences were observed between <italic>Sema3f hets</italic> and WT, so these animals were pooled as controls. There were no significant differences between the mutant and control cells and as is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>, standard deviations were very small, suggesting that the results are consistent despite the limited sample size. These data are described in the Results section (subsection “Deletion of Sema3f leads to increased SGNs in the OHC region”) and in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> legend.</p><p><italic>B) Is the number of SGN neurons or IHCs/OHCs normal in the KO?</italic></p><p>Yes, SGN and IHC/OHC numbers are normal in the KO. We have added these results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Text associated with these experiments can be found in the Results section (subsection “Deletion of Sema3fleads to increased SGNs in the OHC region”), the Materials and methods section (subsection “Quantification methods”), and to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> legend.</p><p><italic>C) Do axons that remain in the OHCs region express neuropilin-2?</italic></p><p>This is an excellent question, but one that is unfortunately impossible for us to address. The tdTomato reporter labels all SGNs uniformly; therefore, we do not have any way to determine which SGNs in the OHC region are extra remaining SGNs vs. those that would constitute the normal population.</p><p><italic>D) Can the authors clarify if there is any cell death that occurs in SGN neurons during the normal developmental intervals under investigation here?</italic></p><p>We appreciate this request, as we agree that clarifying this issue helps strengthen the manuscript. We had previously examined apoptosis in cochleae by cross-section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coate et al., 2012</xref>, Neuron), but with a focus on otic mesenchyme cells, not neurons. So, we elected here to repeat these studies using whole-mount E16.5 and E17.5 cochleae and with a focus on the SGNs. These data can be found as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. Overall, there were very few apoptotic neurons observed, thus it seems unlikely that neuronal cell death plays a significant role in SGN development at these stages. In the text, this is addressed in the Results section (subsection “Maturing SGNs extend and then retract projections from the OHC region”), the Materials and methods section (subsection “Quantification methods”) and in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> legend. We also included some brief changes to the Discussion section (fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>E) Is SGN cell number affected at all in Nrp2-/-, Nrp2+/- and, importantly</italic>, <italic>in Sema3F-/- mutants?</italic></p><p>Data for SGN cell numbers (as density measurements) in WT and <italic>Sema3f</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cochleae has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. No changes in SGN density were observed in <italic>Sema3f</italic> mutants. These new data are described in the Results section (subsection “Deletion of Sema3f leads to increased SGNs in the OHC region”) in the Materials and methods (subsection “Quantification methods”) and in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>Analysis of SGN cell number for the <italic>Nrp2</italic> mutant mice appeared in the original submission in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and is described in the Results section. We apologize for not making this more conspicuous. For better clarity, we altered the y axis label on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref> to read “SGN somata density.” We did not have suitable numbers of E15.5 <italic>Nrp2</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cochleae to add to the data so we have left this data in the form that was originally submitted. However, given that there are no differences between WT and <italic>Nrp2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cochleae in terms of SGNs numbers, it seems very unlikely that the results for <italic>Nrp2</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> cochleae would differ from either of these two groups.</p><p><italic>5) Throughout this manuscript the authors refer to type I and II neuronal morphologies observed using their sparse labeling approach in terms of “numbers” of these two neuronal classes. However, the figures and methods make clear that this is not an absolute determination of cell number, but the % of sparsely labeled cells with these morphological characteristics that is presented. This should be changed throughout the text for experimental clarity</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have now attempted to add as much clarity to the language in the text and made sure the term “percentage” was used when appropriate.</p></body></sub-article></article>
