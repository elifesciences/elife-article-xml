disease, and previously we showed that activated LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases (Steger et al., 2017). Moreover, Golgi-associated Rab29 can recruit LRRK2 to the surface of the Golgi and activate it there for both auto- and Rab substrate phosphorylation. Here, we define the precise Rab29 binding region of the LRRK2 Armadillo domain between residues 360–450 and show that this domain, termed ‘site #1,’ can also bind additional LRRK2 substrates, Rab8A and Rab10. Moreover, we identify a distinct, N-terminal, higher-affinity interaction interface between LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab8 and Rab10 termed ‘site #2’ that can retain LRRK2 on membranes in cells to catalyze multiple, subsequent phosphorylation events. Kinase inhibitor washout experiments demonstrate that rapid recovery of kinase activity in cells depends on the ability of LRRK2 to associate with phosphorylated Rab proteins, and phosphorylated Rab8A stimulates LRRK2 phosphorylation of Rab10 in vitro. Reconstitution of purified LRRK2 recruitment onto planar lipid bilayers decorated with Rab10 protein demonstrates cooperative association of only active LRRK2 with phospho-Rab10-containing membrane surfaces. These experiments reveal a feed-forward pathway that provides spatial control and membrane activation of LRRK2 kinase activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LRRK2 kinase</kwd><kwd>Rab GTPase</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>membrane microdomain</kwd><kwd>feed-forward pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson's Disease</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ASAP-000463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alessi</surname><given-names>Dario R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000864</institution-id><institution>Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17298</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alessi</surname><given-names>Dario R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000864</institution-id><institution>Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>6986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alessi</surname><given-names>Dario R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_00018/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alessi</surname><given-names>Dario R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parkinson’s disease-associated LRRK2 kinase is recruited to membranes by its Rab GTPase substrates, and LRRK2 is both retained on membranes and further activated there by cooperative interaction with the phosphorylated Rab proteins that it generates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activating mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause inherited Parkinson’s disease and lead to the phosphorylation of a subset of Rab GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alessi and Sammler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pfeffer, 2022</xref>), in particular, Rab8A, Rab10, and Rab29 within a conserved residue of the Switch II effector-binding motif. Rab GTPases are master regulators of membrane trafficking and are thought to serve as identity determinants of membrane-bound compartments of the secretory and endocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfeffer, 2017</xref>). In their GTP-bound forms, Rabs are best known for their roles in linking motor proteins to transport vesicles and facilitating the process of transport vesicle docking.</p><p>Our previous work showed that Rab phosphorylation blocks the ability of Rab proteins to be activated by their cognate guanine nucleotide exchange factors or to bind to the GDI proteins that recycle GDP-bearing Rabs from target membranes to their membranes of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steger et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, phosphorylation of Rab8A and Rab10 blocks their ability to bind known effector proteins and enhances binding to a novel set of effectors that includes RILPL1, RILPL2, JIP3, JIP4, and MyoVa proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waschbüsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhekne et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, Rab phosphorylation flips a switch on Rab effector selectivity that can drive dominant physiological changes, including blocking primary cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sobu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khan et al., 2021</xref>) and autophagosome motility in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boecker et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Most LRRK2 is found in the cell cytosol where it appears to be inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biskup et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Purlyte et al., 2018</xref>). Recent structural analysis of the catalytic, C-terminal half of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deniston et al., 2020</xref>) and full-length human LRRK2 protein yielded structures of both monomeric and dimeric, inactive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>). Several groups have reported that active LRRK2 is a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greggio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Civiero et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guaitoli et al., 2016</xref>), and higher-order forms were detected on membranes upon crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schapansky et al., 2014</xref>) and upon Rab29 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, LRRK2 membrane association is associated with kinase activation; however, the molecular basis for this activation is not yet known.</p><p>Exogenously expressed, Golgi-localized Rab29 protein can recruit LRRK2 onto membranes and activate it there for both auto- and Rab substrate phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuwahara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Purlyte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Madero-Pérez et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, even Rab29 artificially anchored on mitochondria can activate LRRK2 and drive its membrane recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomez et al., 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGrath et al., 2021</xref> implicated LRRK2 residues 386–392 as being important for the interaction of Rab29/32/38 family members with the LRRK2 kinase Armadillo domain. However, the LRRK2 Armadillo domain is located at some distance from the kinase domain, at least in the current structure models for LRRK2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, how Rab29 binding might activate LRRK2 kinase activity is not at all clear. In addition, because Rab29 is not needed for LRRK2 action on Rab8A or Rab10 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalogeropulou et al., 2020</xref>), other pathways for LRRK2 activation must exist.</p><p>In this study, we define a specific patch (‘site #1’) of the LRRK2 Armadillo domain that binds to Rab8A, Rab10, and Rab29 protein with affinities similar to those reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGrath et al., 2021</xref>). More importantly, we identify a distinct region of LRRK2 Armadillo domain (‘site #2’) that binds specifically to LRRK2-<italic>phosphorylated</italic> Rab8A and Rab10 proteins, to establish a feed-forward activation mechanism for membrane-associated LRRK2 kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rab29 binds to the C-terminal portion of the LRRK2 Armadillo domain</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGrath et al., 2021</xref> showed that the LRRK2 Armadillo domain residues 1–552 contain a binding site that interacts specifically with purified Rab29, 32, and 38 in vitro with affinities of 2.7, 1.2, and 1.2–2.4 µM, respectively. We used microscale thermophoresis to determine the affinity of other Rab GTPase substrates with this portion of LRRK2 kinase. For these experiments, portions of the LRRK2 Armadillo domain were fluorescently labeled and incubated with Rab GTPases in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-GTP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows binding curves for Rab29 with full-length Armadillo domain (residues 1–552, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as well as sub-fragments composed of LRRK2 residues 1–159 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or 350–550 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Rab29 showed specific binding to the full-length 1–552 Armadillo fragment with a K<sub>D</sub> of 1.6 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), comparable to that reported previously using other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGrath et al., 2021</xref>). Under these conditions, the non-LRRK2 substrate Rab7 protein failed to bind to the Armadillo 1–552 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

This work identified four key mutations of highly conserved residues (R361E, R399E, L403A, and K439E) that blocked both the co-localization of LRRK2 and Rab29 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, red), as well as activation of LRRK2 upon overexpression of Rab29 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, red). In experiments undertaken with pathogenic R1441G LRRK2 that is more potently activated by Rab29, the K439E LRRK2 mutation completely blocked LRRK2 kinase activation; R399E showed weak activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Some of the other mutants blocked co-localization with Rab29 in HeLa cells without completely suppressing LRRK2 activation following overexpression of Rab29. We therefore recommend using the site#1 K439E LRRK2 mutation to block Rab29 interaction and activation in future work (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>) as it shows the lowest amount of Rab29 activation with pathogenic R1441G LRRK2.

We recently established a facile method that enables us to monitor phosphoRab binding to proteins of interest in conjunction with microscale thermophoresis binding assays. Briefly, Rab proteins are phosphorylated &gt;90% in vitro by MST3 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhekne et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vides and Pfeffer, 2021</xref>) that phosphorylates Rab proteins at the same position as LRRK2 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vieweg et al., 2020</xref>). Recombinant MST3 is much easier to purify in large amounts for biochemical experiments than LRRK2. We used this assay to monitor the possible interaction of phosphorylated LRRK2 substrates to the LRRK2 Armadillo domain and were delighted to discover that pRab8A and pRab10 proteins bind with high affinity to a site distinct from that used by non-phosphorylated Rab proteins that we term site #2.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, phosphoRab8A and phosphoRab10 bound with K<sub>D</sub>s of ~900 nM and 1 µM to the full Armadillo domain 1–552 fragment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and D</xref>); this binding reflected interaction with N-terminal LRRK2 residues 1–159 as this fragment was sufficient to yield essentially the same K<sub>D</sub>s of 1 µM and 700 nM, respectively, for phosphoRab8A and phosphoRab10 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and E</xref>). Furthermore, no binding was detected for phosphoRab8A or phosphoRab10 with LRRK2 residues 350–550 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>). These data demonstrate that Rab8A and Rab10 GTPases, phosphorylated at the same residues modified by LRRK2 kinase, bind very tightly to the LRRK2 N-terminus but no longer interact with the 350–550 region that interacts with dephosphorylated Rab proteins.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>PhosphoRab8A and phosphoRab10 bind with high affinity to the N-terminal portion of the LRRK2 Armadillo domain.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Microscale thermophoresis of labeled, indicated, LRRK2 Armadillo fragments with His-phosphoRab8A Q67L (<bold>A–C</bold>) or with His phosphoRab10 Q68L 1–181 (pRab10; <bold>D–F</bold>).

Moreover, as discussed below, these K<sub>D</sub> values may be higher than the concentrations of these Rab GTPases in cells, thus it seems unlikely that non-phosphoRabs interact with site #2 under normal physiological conditions.

Note that we routinely utilize R1441G LRRK2 because it is a highly active kinase in cells, although in vitro, R1441G LRRK2 displays the same level of Rab kinase activity as wild-type LRRK2 (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steger et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> (red dots), fluorescent R1441G LRRK2 bound efficiently to lipid bilayers only in the presence of pre-anchored Rab10 protein (compare with purple dots in 8B) and not when Rab11 protein was instead employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, green dots; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>).

This indicates that at least Rab10 GTPase binding to site #1 residues 361–451 results in a low-affinity interaction that is not sufficient to retain this inactive LRRK2 protein on the bilayer under these conditions (7 nM LRRK2, 2.5 µM Rab10). Reactions containing the type I MLi-2 inhibitor showed aggregation of the fluorescent LRRK2 protein, as has been seen in cells. Incubations containing the type 2 inhibitor, GZD-824 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tasegian et al., 2021</xref>), showed weak binding, consistent with a requirement for phosphoRab10 generation to support LRRK2 binding to site #2’s K17 and K18; however, under these conditions, LRRK2 was not monodisperse and could not be analyzed further. Importantly, R1441G LRRK2 mutated at lysines 17 and 18 bound to a lower extent than R1441G LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, blue dots; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>), confirming their important role in binding to phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10. It is noteworthy that the K17/K18 mutant protein showed higher binding than the D2017A mutant, suggesting that a non-phosphoRab-binding site may be more accessible for binding in an active versus inactive LRRK2 protein conformation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Feed-forward pathway for Rab10 phosphorylation is dependent on LRRK2 kinase activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence intensity traces of individual, single molecules of 7 nM CF633-labeled FLAG-LRRK2 R1441G on a substrate-supported lipid bilayer decorated with lipid-anchored GFP-Rab10 Q68L-His across 600 s of live total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy.

Nevertheless, analysis of the distribution of single-molecule fluorescence intensity of our CF633-labeled LRRK2 preparation revealed a sharp peak, whether the preparation was evaluated immediately upon binding to Rab10 on bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,B, and D</xref>) or when spotted onto poly-lysine-coated glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>, far-right column). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B</xref> show the intensity at time t for large numbers of fluorescent molecules, either over 500 s (A) or 30 s (B). The intensity shift over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) may imply that the molecules slowly dimerize with a half-time of 100–200 s, but additional work would be needed to confirm this. Continuous traces of the 30 longest lived spots showed that for some events this increase occurs even more quickly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The fluorescent molecules remain on the bilayers for a significant period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>); moreover, when the molecules first bind to the surface, the single-peak distribution of intensity does not change, irrespective of the time during the experiment that it actually binds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This gives us confidence that any changes observed were not occurring in solution and require Rab engagement. Note that we detect a minor species at log<sub>2</sub> = 2.5 that constitutes between 2 and 6% of the molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D and F</xref>); this may represent dual-labeled proteins and/or rare tetrameric complexes.</p><p>To confirm that LRRK2 Armadillo domain can bind both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated Rabs simultaneously, GST-Rab8A was immobilized on glutathione agarose and Armadillo domain (1–552) protein pre-bound.

It was formally possible, however, that phosphoRab binding actually activates the kinase itself. To test this, we monitored the generation of phosphoRab10 using a highly specific anti-phosphoRab10 monoclonal antibody in conjunction with immunoblotting. Rab10 protein was then phosphorylated by purified, full-length LRRK2 kinase in vitro, with and without addition of pre-phosphorylated Rab8A protein.

We have confirmed here that LRRK2 kinase relies upon substrate Rab GTPases to achieve membrane association and revealed that LRRK2 utilizes two distinct Rab-binding sites within its N-terminal Armadillo domain for this purpose. Site #1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) binds multiple, non-phosphorylated Rab substrates including Rab8A, Rab10, and Rab29, as well as the highly tissue-specific and non-substrate, Rab29-related, Rab32 and Rab38 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waschbüsch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGrath et al., 2021</xref>). The second site (#2) is located at LRRK2’s absolute N-terminus at a significant distance from the kinase active site; this site shows strong preference for phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10 proteins. Our data show that both sites can be occupied simultaneously.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> shows our current model for LRRK2 membrane recruitment. LRRK2 will interact reversibly with any one of the subset of Rab proteins that can bind to site #1. Rab29 shows the highest affinity for this site, but Rab8A can also bind with physiologically relevant affinity and is much more abundant in cells. Rab GTPases cluster in microdomains on distinct membrane surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfeffer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sönnichsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Renzis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbero et al., 2002</xref>), thus this initial LRRK2 membrane association will bring the kinase in contact with other copies of the same substrate Rab proteins for phosphorylation. After an initial phosphorylation event, LRRK2 will then be held in place by bivalent association with one phosphorylated and one non-phosphorylated Rab protein. By binding to the kinase reaction product, LRRK2 enhances its effective, local activity by increasing the probability with which it will encounter another substrate Rab protein.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A model for LRRK2 membrane recruitment.</title><p>LRRK2 can interact with non-phosphorylated Rab GTPases via site #1. Once membrane bound, it can generate phosphoRabs that can now engage site #2. Rab binding to both sites increases the avidity of LRRK2 for membranes and retains LRRK2 on the membrane surface to phosphorylate more Rab substrates. We have shown that LRRK2 binding to phosphoRabs also activates the kinase, likely by altering its oligomeric state.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79771-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Despite relatively similar affinities for their respective Rab-binding partners, the phosphoRab-specific site appears to drive stable LRRK2 membrane association as mutation of two key lysine residues strongly impacts co-localization of LRRK2 protein with phosphoRabs in cells. In addition, kinase activity leads to a much higher degree of LRRK2 association with planar lipid bilayers despite the presence of binding site #1 for non-phosphorylated Rabs. Finally, K17/K18A LRRK2 that cannot bind to phosphorylated Rab proteins showed lower bilayer association in comparison with native LRRK2, confirming the importance of this interaction. LRRK2 phosphorylation of Rab GTPases is therefore required to form a new, additional interaction interface that greatly enhances the overall avidity of LRRK2 membrane association.</p><p>We also discovered that phosphoRab8A stimulates LRRK2 kinase action on Rab10 protein. We were not able to test the reverse scenario as the phosphoRab8A antibody is not adequately specific and cross-reacts with phosphoRab10 protein. Nevertheless, it seems very likely that phosphoRab10 will also activate LRRK2 for other substrate phosphorylation events. The most likely explanation is that phosphoRab binding to the LRRK2 N-terminus encourages an overall enzyme architecture that favors the active conformation. LRRK2 assumes multiple oligomeric states, and phosphoRab engagement and/or dual Rab engagement of the Armadillo domain likely influences the overall architecture of the enzyme.</p><p>It is important to note that quantitative mass spectrometry indicates that Rab10 is present at ~600 times the copy number as LRRK2 in MEF cells and brain tissue (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://copica.proteo.info/#/copybrowse">https://copica.proteo.info/#/copybrowse</ext-link>). Thus, if Rab10 is assumed to exist in cells at ~2–5 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>), LRRK2 will be present overall at about 3–8 nM. These are very close to the concentrations used in our in vitro reconstitution experiments. Future experiments will be needed to elucidate the precise molecular state of LRRK2 upon engagement with Rab GTPases at sites #1 and #2.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nichols et al., 2007</xref> reported a single family with two affected siblings harboring LRRK2 E10K mutations. These patients presented with classic Parkinson’s disease symptoms at age 57 including bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, postural instability, and resting tremor. Compared with 46 G2019S LRRK2 patients in that study whose disease onset was on average, 63.5 years, the two siblings had a more severely disabling disease, as indicated by a higher Hoehn and Yahr assessment score (4 vs. 2.5, where 5 represents confinement to bed or wheelchair unless aided). Our study provides a molecular explanation for how a mutation located far from the kinase or ROC-COR domains may cause Parkinson’s disease. We predict that the E10K mutation increases LRRK2 phosphoRab binding and membrane association and may display an even higher apparent activity than the most common pathogenic G2019S mutation. This distinction would need to be evaluated under conditions of MLi-2 washout as exogenous expression would mask this subtle mechanistic feature.</p><p>The ability of multiple Rab-binding sites to anchor LRRK2 on membranes will make the kinase appear more active than the pool of cytosolic LRRK2 protein. Rab binding may also increase access of LRRK2 to other kinases that stabilize it in a more active conformation. Anchoring LRRK2’s N-terminus may also influence autophosphorylation, which could also drive LRRK2 towards a more catalytically active conformation. Future structural studies of membrane-anchored LRRK2 will provide important, additional information related to all of these possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

examines the interesting question of whether LRRK2 recruitment to membranes may regulate its activity. Membrane association involves binding to membrane-tethered Rab GTPases via LRRK2's Armadillo domain, and the authors provide an exciting and elegant feed-forward mechanism to describe how recruitment of phospho-RAB8 can promote phosphorylation of RAB10.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79771.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>Wade</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.04.25.489459">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.25.489459v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Overall, the reviewers were positive about the overall results and were intrigued by the feed-forward model put forward. The reviewers made numerous suggestions in terms of relatively small revisions that will improve the paper (see detailed reviews). The main shortcoming is the absence of data directly addressing two important features of the feed-forward model: (1) The proposal that the increased activity of LRRK2 upon recruitment to membranes is only the result of its increased local concentration (without any contributions from a potential Rab-dependent activation); and (2) the ability of LRRK2 to simultaneously bind Rab and pRab.</p><p>2) In order to address these concerns, reviewer 2 suggests performing an experiment using the D2017A mutant together with Rab10(T73A) plus pRab10. This could both test the local concentration idea and also provide evidence, albeit indirect, of simultaneous binding to site 1 and site 2.</p><p>3) Given that reagents seem to be at hand, you should compare the kinase activity in vitro of LRRK2 WT and K17/18A, either by themselves or in the presence of pRab8/10.

The authors may consider revising the figure, accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As mentioned in the Public Review, the main shortcoming in the manuscript is the absence of experiments testing two important components of the feed-forward model: (1) The idea that the increased activity of LRRK2 upon recruitment to membranes is only the result of its increased local concentration. The authors have not ruled out a contribution from a Rab-dependent activation of LRRK2; and (2) The ability of LRRK2 to simultaneously bind Rab and pRab. This was not tested directly, either. These two points are raised below, along with other, lesser issues that should also be addressed to strengthen the manuscript. For simplicity, the comments are organized according to the sections in the Results.</p><p>Rab29 binds to the C-terminal portion of the LRRK2 Armadillo domain</p><p>– Mg++ is not a conventional notion of valency. Please change to Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>– I suggest reordering the panels in Figure 1 as 1A, 1C, 1D, and 1B. Rab7, the negative control, is only mentioned in the text after panels 1A, 1C, and 1D.</p><p>Rab8A and Rab10 bind to the LRRK2 Armadillo domain</p><p>– The authors claim that their data &quot;indicate that Rab8A binds to the same site as Rab29&quot;. The fragment they worked with is 200 amino acids long. Given that, the language should be toned down, either to say that the data suggest that the binding sites may be the same, or that the Rabs bind to the same region of the protein.</p><p>– The affinities reported for Rab8A and Rab10 in Figure 2 are surprising. Why are the differences in affinity for Rab8A between the fragment that is proposed to contain the binding site (350-550) and the one that is not (1-159) only ~2-fold? Why does Rab10 have a higher affinity for the full fragment (1-552) than for the 350-550 fragment that is supposed to contain the binding site? This was not the case with Rab29, where the difference between the two non-overlapping fragments was ~20-fold (Figure 1). Are the binding sites different for the different Rabs? The authors should discuss this and propose some explanations.</p><p>Residues critical for Rab GTPase binding to LRRK2 residues 350-550, Site #1</p><p>– Figure 3: Please mark the Switch II region on Rab in your AF model. This will be helpful for those readers less familiar with Rabs.</p><p>– 'Intimate' is not a technical way of referring to contacts. The authors should describe how contacts are measured and then define &quot;close&quot; contacts as those below whatever distance threshold they choose.</p><p>– Figure 3D is missing a description in the figure legend. The legend is also missing an explanation of what the red and grey boxes represent in panels C and D.</p><p>– Figure 3C, D: Please explain the red asterisk in the figure legend. They are useful information but I was confused by them until I reached the explanation in the main text.</p><p>– Figure 3-Figure Supp.1: I would suggest making the grey bars representing the different constructs lighter to increase the contrast with the green ones.</p><p>– In Figure 3-Figure Supp4 (page 41): The contrast of the bottom row in each gel [&quot;HA (Rab29)&quot;] is much higher than in the others. What is the reason for this difference?</p><p>– Do these residues affect binding to Rab8A and/or 10?</p><p>PhosphoRab binding to LRRK2, Site #2</p><p>– The authors should provide some indication of the extent to which Rabs were phosphorylated by MST3.</p><p>PhosphoRab-LRRK2 interaction increases rates of kinase recovery</p><p>– How was the re-phosphorylation quantified? Based on the gels it looks as though all variants did a similarly good job at re-phosphorylating Rab10. It would be important to quantify the levels of LRRK2 throughout the experiment as well. The bands at 120 min for both LRRK2 R1441G K17/18A and LRRK2 appear weaker; the authors need to show that changes in the recovery from MLi-2 cannot simply be explained by differences in LRRK2 levels.</p><p>– An important component of the feed-forward mechanism proposed is the increase in local LRRK2 concentration brought about by the higher affinity between phosphorylated Rab8/10 and Site #2. While the model implies that the only role played by this interaction is to recruit LRRK2, this was not tested directly. Neither was the effect of the K17/18A mutations tested on LRRK2's activity. Given that reagents seem to be at hand, the authors should compare the kinase activity in vitro of LRRK2 WT and K17/18A, either by themselves or in the presence of pRab8/10. This would test directly whether the role played by the K17/18-pRab8/10 interaction is only a recruiting one.</p><p>Cooperative LRRK2 membrane recruitment on Rab-decorated planar lipid bilayers</p><p>– The wording &quot;Binding of phosphoRab reaction products…&quot; is a bit confusing. Presumably, phosphoRab is the reaction product of the phosphorylation reaction, but there is no &quot;phosphoRab reaction&quot;.</p><p>– There is a reference to Figure 3B (&quot;This indicates that at least Rab10…&quot;) that seems incorrect.</p><p>– The significant reduction in membrane binding by LRRK2(D2017A) relative to R1441G and K17A/K18A/R1441G is an interesting observation, but I am not sure the interpretation suggested by the authors--that binding Site #1 may be more accessible in an active LRRK2 conformation--is the only, or even more likely one. I am assuming that the experimental setup makes it possible for LRRK2 to phosphorylate the membrane-bound Rab10, thus triggering the feed-forward loop. (If that is not the case, it would be useful to explain why in the main text so other readers do not make the same assumption.) In my assumption is correct, LRRK2(D2017A) could have two different (and co-existing) effects: (1) It would prevent the formation of pRab10 and thus the higher affinity pRab10-Site #2 interaction; and (2) It will affect LRRK2's conformation. It seems to me that the proposed model could be strengthened by a few additional experiments. These would involve repeating the membrane recruitment assay with Rab10 variants. Using pRab10 would bypass LRRK2(D2017A)'s inability to generate pRab10 and thus test whether LRRK2's conformation plays a role in recruitment via Site #2. An even more informative experiment would involve using a combination of pRab10 and Rab10(T73A) as this would both bypass D2017A's lack of activity, but it would also allow for engagement of both Site #1 and Site #2 without allowing for an increased in the density of pRab10 on the membrane. Comparing the results of this experiment with one using only pRab10 (but with the same total Rab10 density on the membrane) could also provide evidence for LRRK2's ability to bind two Rab's (Rab and pRab) at the same time (one of the issues raised in the Public Review and at the beginning of these comments).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79771.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Overall, the reviewers were positive about the overall results and were intrigued by the feed-forward model put forward.

Lack of cilia phenotype rescue holds true for the equivalent Rab8 mutant. Nevertheless, we used another strategy to show that LRRK2 Arm domain can simultaneously bind to pRab and non-phosphoRab at Sites 1 and 2 (see below): GST-immobilized Rab8A can bind Arm domain and pRab10 can bind this Arm domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given that reagents seem to be at hand, you should compare the kinase activity in vitro of LRRK2 WT and K17/18A, either by themselves or in the presence of pRab8/10.

The good news is that thanks to the reviewer comments, we have been able to show that phosphorylated Rab8 stimulates the in vitro kinase activity of LRRK2 on Rab10 by 4 fold, and this requires the presence of Lysine 18. Thus, we have changed the title and text to remove, “apparent” activation as we can now state that it is bona fide enzymatic activation.

It seems to me that the proposed model could be strengthened by a few additional experiments. These would involve repeating the membrane recruitment assay with Rab10 variants. Using pRab10 would bypass LRRK2(D2017A)'s inability to generate pRab10 and thus test whether LRRK2's conformation plays a role in recruitment via Site #2. An even more informative experiment would involve using a combination of pRab10 and Rab10(T73A) as this would both bypass D2017A's lack of activity, but it would also allow for engagement of both Site #1 and Site #2 without allowing for an increased in the density of pRab10 on the membrane. Comparing the results of this experiment with one using only pRab10 (but with the same total Rab10 density on the membrane) could also provide evidence for LRRK2's ability to bind two Rab's (Rab and pRab) at the same time (one of the issues raised in the Public Review and at the beginning of these comments).</p></disp-quote><p>The non-phosphorylatable Rab8A and Rab10 mutants fail to reverse their respective ciliation phenotypes observed in Rab knockout cells and are poor substrates for Rab geranylgeranyl transferase. Moreover, unlike the native phosphorylated Rab8A or Rab10 proteins, Rab8A-TE and Rab10-TE fail to show enhanced interaction with their RILPL1 effector. Thus, TA and TE mutants do not reflect the desired states of Rab8A or Rab10 and cannot be used. Other experiments have been added to demonstrate that two Rabs can simultaneously bind to Site #1 and Site #2. Future work will continue to investigate the molecular events detected.</p><p>In summary, thanks to the reviewers for really thoughtful and helpful comments!</p></body></sub-article></article>
