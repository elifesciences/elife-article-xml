embryogenesis and is increasingly applied to model human disease. In these contexts, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) provides mechanistic insights by identifying transcriptome changes between experimental conditions. Application of RNA-seq relies on accurate transcript annotation for a genome of interest. Here, we find discrepancies in analysis from RNA-seq datasets quantified using Ensembl and RefSeq zebrafish annotations. These issues were due, in part, to variably annotated 3' untranslated regions and thousands of gene models missing from each annotation. Since these discrepancies could compromise downstream analyses and biological reproducibility, we built a more comprehensive zebrafish transcriptome annotation that addresses these deficiencies. Our annotation improves detection of cell type-specific genes in both bulk and single cell RNA-seq datasets, where it also improves resolution of cell clustering. Thus, we demonstrate that our new transcriptome annotation can outperform existing annotations, providing an important resource for zebrafish researchers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>annotation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35HL140017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lawson</surname><given-names>Nathan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01HG007910</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yukselen</surname><given-names>Onur</given-names></name><name><surname>Kucukural</surname><given-names>Alper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR001453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yukselen</surname><given-names>Onur</given-names></name><name><surname>Kucukural</surname><given-names>Alper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS105654</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lawson</surname><given-names>Nathan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational efforts yield a zebrafish transcriptome annotation that provides more sensitive and comprehensive gene detection over existing annotations when used for bulk or single-cell RNA-seq.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The zebrafish has become an ideal animal model for studying processes related to developmental biology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilkinson and van Eeden, 2014</xref>). Due to its hardy nature and fecundity, it is highly amenable to a variety of manipulations, including both forward and reverse genetic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lawson and Wolfe, 2011</xref>). The power of these applications is enhanced by the unique characteristics of the zebrafish embryo. Most notably, zebrafish embryos are transparent and develop externally, allowing direct observation and facile technical manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beis and Stainier, 2006</xref>). Moreover, the initial steps of zebrafish development are very rapid, with gastrulation completed by 24 hr post-fertilization (hpf) and a complete circulatory system online just 12 hr later. By 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), most organ systems are fully functional. Together, these characteristics of zebrafish life history have contributed to its establishment as a leading model to study developmental biology, while expanding its utility to the modeling of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lam and Peterson, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In most model systems, a common analytical approach is to profile changes in gene expression following a particular experimental manipulation, or in comparison between wild type and mutant siblings. With the initial advent of microarrays and, more recently, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), this approach can be applied at a transcriptome-wide level, enabling researchers to gain crucial insights into molecular defects associated with a particular experimental condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Such analysis can reveal important effectors for signaling pathways, downstream targets for transcription factors, or identify changes in cellular composition in a complex tissue. More recently, several groups have adapted RNA-seq to allow molecular profiling of transcriptomes from single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>). Regarding zebrafish, this powerful method has been applied in a number of novel ways. Initial efforts integrated single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) with a publicly available expression pattern database to provide a predictive spatial gene map for early stage zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Satija et al., 2015</xref>). Recent application of scRNA-seq at successive developmental stages has allowed unprecedented molecular insights into lineage relationships during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farrell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>). More advanced applications have combined scRNA-seq with cas9-induced ‘scars’ to allow molecular lineage tracing and define cellular hierarchies in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKenna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raj et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these studies demonstrate the power of combining the unique benefits of zebrafish embryogenesis with scRNA-seq to gain new insights into vertebrate development.</p><p>The application of RNA-seq relies on the ability to accurately and reliably process large datasets consisting of millions of short fragment reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). This approach usually relies on the availability of a genomic sequence to which reads are initially mapped. Subsequently, the positions of mapped reads matching a corresponding transcriptome annotation are used for gene assignment and quantification across different experimental conditions. For most commonly used model systems, gene models and transcriptome annotations are now generally robust, allowing the universal application of RNA-seq-based analysis with a variety of standardized computational pipelines. However, in this study, we have found several deficiencies in current transcriptome annotations for the zebrafish genome that can negatively impact RNA-seq analyses. To address these issues, we have generated a new zebrafish transcriptome annotation, and demonstrated its improved performance over existing annotations in several contexts, including analysis of bulk and scRNA-seq datasets from multiple cell types. Together, our results demonstrate that this annotation will be a valuable resource for the zebrafish community.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Discrepancies in RNA-seq analysis between zebrafish Ensembl and RefSeq annotations</title><p>We have previously used RNA-seq to profile endothelial cell gene expression in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quillien et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whitesell et al., 2019</xref>). In unpublished observations from those studies, we noted discrepancies between identical datasets separately quantified using Ensembl (version 95, hereafter referred to as Ens95) and RefSeq (GCF_000002035.6_GRCz11) transcriptome annotations. For example, we performed RNA-seq on mCherry-positive (<italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic>) and -negative (<italic>kdrl<sup>neg</sup></italic>) cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from <italic>Tg(kdrl:HRAS-mCherry)<sup>s896</sup></italic> embryos, which express membrane-localized red fluorescence protein in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whitesell et al., 2019</xref>). Use of the RefSeq annotation to quantify gene expression led to the identification of 1780 genes enriched in <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> compared to <italic>kdrl<sup>neg</sup></italic> cells, while Ens95 identified 1632 genes (log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt;1, padj &lt;0.05, n = 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The intersection of <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched genes from each dataset using NCBI ID as a common identifier yielded 132 and 222 genes that were identified only by Ens95 or RefSeq, respectively, while 1407 were commonly identified as such in both annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Notably, common IDs were lacking for a sizable proportion of genes in both datasets (for example, 4215 out of 25704 in Ens95 lacked a matching NCBI ID; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), suggesting that each annotation may be missing genes. Importantly, genes detected as enriched only by Ens95 or RefSeq included those with previously known functional relevance. Among these were the artery-specific gene, <italic>ephrin-B2a</italic> (<italic>efnb2a</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lawson et al., 2001</xref>), and the <italic>SRY-box transcription factor 17</italic> (<italic>sox17;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2011</xref>), which were only identified as differential by Ens95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). By contrast, <italic>slc2a1b</italic>, one of two duplicated zebrafish genes that encodes the GLUT1 glucose transporter, as well as other blood-brain barrier markers, such as <italic>solute carrier family 7 member 5</italic> (<italic>slc7a5</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boado et al., 1999</xref>), were significantly enriched in <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> cells using RefSeq, but not Ens95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>slc2a1a</italic>, a second duplicate GLUT1 ortholog (previously referred to as ‘<italic>glut1b</italic>’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tseng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Umans et al., 2017</xref>) was not identified as differential by either annotation, despite previous reports of its endothelial expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Umans et al., 2017</xref>).

However, this was not the case for many of the genes identified selectively by either annotation. For example, 58 out of 132 commonly annotated <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> genes enriched only in Ens95 showed an adjusted p-value over 5-fold greater than the standard cutoff (0.05) when quantified using RefSeq (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).

As above, most <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched genes with a common NCBI identifier (1905) were differentially expressed compared to negative (<italic>pdgfrb<sup>neg</sup></italic>) cells using both annotations, while 172 and 248 genes were selectively identified as such by only Ens95 or RefSeq, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source datas 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Similar to <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched genes, 80 out of 172 of <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched genes identified using Ens95 showed padj values for matched RefSeq genes at least 5-fold over the statistical cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata2">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>). Likewise, expression levels for genes selectively enriched using Ens95 or RefSeq showed poor correlation between annotations and higher expression levels in the respective annotation in which it was detected as differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata2">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>). By contrast, the expression of <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched genes identified by both annotations displayed a high degree of correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest underlying differences in zebrafish Ensembl and RefSeq annotations that contribute to inconsistencies in differential gene analysis from RNA-seq data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Incomplete 3' UTRs models influence RNA-seq quantification using existing annotations</title><p>Since we constructed the RNA-seq libraries in the experiments noted above using oligo-dT priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quillien et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whitesell et al., 2019</xref>), they would yield reads with a bias to the 3' end of transcripts. Therefore, we investigated whether discrepancies noted above were due to differences between 3' untranslated region (UTR) annotations in Ens95 and RefSeq. For this purpose, we sought to assemble a reference set of transcripts with annotated 3' UTRs from Ens95 and RefSeq. Strikingly, in the process of assembling this reference panel, we found that nearly 20% of all coding genes in Ens95 lacked any transcript with an annotated 3' UTR, while a smaller proportion also lacked a stop codon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). By contrast, only about 6% of RefSeq genes lacked a 3' UTR, and 1% lack a stop codon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Importantly, missing 3' UTRs appeared to contribute to the discrepancies observed in our RNA-seq analyses. For example, 64 of the 217 <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched genes identified only using RefSeq lacked an Ens95 3' UTR, and these were detected at significantly lower levels in Ens95 compared to RefSeq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Similar results were found for <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched genes, where 94 out of 248 genes identified only using RefSeq lacked a 3' UTR annotation in Ens95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Among the discrepant <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched genes was the previously noted blood brain barrier (BBB) marker <italic>slc7a5</italic>, where lack of a 3' UTR in Ens95 resulted in an approximately ten-fold difference in detected expression between the two annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; N.B.: unless otherwise indicated UCSC browser images show a single representative transcript bearing the longest 3' UTR for a given gene; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Interestingly, the location of mapped reads from a publicly available RNA-seq dataset (referred to as GSE32900), as well the genomic position of <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> reads, suggested an even longer <italic>slc7a5</italic> 3' UTR than that annotated in RefSeq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A putative longer 3' UTR would also be concordant with a ‘3P-seq’ feature on the same strand, which we annotated using a public dataset that defines genomic locations for 3' transcript ends based on a biochemically stringent technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ulitsky et al., 2012</xref>).

For this purpose, we generated a reference set of transcripts for 16,558 genes (see Materials and methods for details; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). In our reference panel, just over one-half of genes exhibited the same length 3' UTR in both annotations (9077 out of 16558), while 4923 and 2558 genes showed longer 3' UTRs in Ens95 or RefSeq, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>; ‘longer’ is defined as more than 50 nucleotides). Similar to genes with missing 3' UTRs, a large proportion of discrepant <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic>- and <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched genes identified only in Ens95 or RefSeq also had a longer 3' UTR in the respective annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, these 3' UTRs were, on average, five times longer when comparing annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Consistent with an effect on detection, levels of reference genes in <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> and <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic> datasets quantified by Ens95 or RefSeq tended to be higher in the respective annotation predicting a longer 3' UTR and showed a lower correlation between annotations than those with the same 3' UTR length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Among these genes were several noted above as discrepant between Ens95 and RefSeq annotations when quantifying <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> and <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic> datasets. For example, <italic>sox17</italic> exhibits a longer 3' UTR in Ens95, leading to improved detection at severalfold higher levels in <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). We also noted additional cases where an accurate 3' UTR model is likely missing from both annotations. For example, the pericyte marker <italic>cspg4</italic> has a slightly longer 3' UTR in the RefSeq annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), where it is also detected as significantly enriched in <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). However, as noted above with <italic>slc7a5</italic>, the location of mapped reads from GSE32900 and our <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic> data, as well as a 3P-Seq feature on the same strand, suggest a much longer 3' UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that a large proportion of genes in current zebrafish transcriptome annotations do not have accurate 3' models, which can affect the interpretation of RNA-seq analysis.</p><p>Our discovery of 3' UTR discrepancies between Ens95 and RefSeq was likely facilitated by the 3' end-bias inherent in our RNA-Seq libraries. Therefore, we compared annotation performance using RNA-seq data from a random-primed library. In this case, we performed RNA-Seq on endothelial cells positive for the vein-specific transcription factor, Nr2f2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 2), versus those positive for the <italic>Tg(fli1a:egfp)<sup>y1</sup></italic> transgene (see Materials and methods).

We also noted a poor correlation in detection levels for Nr2f2<sup>pos</sup>-enriched genes selectively identified by either Ens95 or RefSeq compared to commonly identified genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In addition, we detected higher expression for discrepant genes in the annotation where the gene was significantly enriched, although the magnitude of difference in these cases was less than that of the 3' biased data (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,G</xref>). Accordingly, many of the discrepant Nr2f2<sup>pos</sup>-enriched genes were associated with small shifts in adjusted p-values or log<sub>2</sub> fold change values. For example, only 10 out of 59 Nr2f2<sup>pos</sup>-enriched genes identified by only Ens95 showed a greater than 5-fold padj compared to RefSeq values for the same genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). Furthermore, a comparison between discrepant reference Nr2f2<sup>pos</sup> genes did not show the same trend noted with <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> and <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic> analysis regarding 3' UTR differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We noted a high degree of correlation between expression levels detected in each annotation regardless of differences in 3' UTR lengths, although we still noted a slight trend of longer 3'UTRs displaying slightly higher expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). These results suggest that differences in 3' UTR annotations between Ensembl and RefSeq may be somewhat mitigated when analyzing RNA-seq data from libraries constructed using random priming.</p><p>As noted above, nearly 20% of Ens95 genes lack a 3' UTR annotation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). For these Nr2f2<sup>pos</sup>-enriched genes, we did detect significant differences in expression levels between Ens95 and RefSeq annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Notably, among these discrepant genes was the essential endothelial Ets transcription factor, <italic>erg</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vijayaraj et al., 2012</xref>), which lacks any UTR annotations in Ens95 compared to RefSeq, resulting in undersampling in Nr2f2<sup>pos</sup> cells when using Ens95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2J</xref>). As a result, <italic>erg</italic> is identified as differentially enriched when using RefSeq, but not Ens95 for quantification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). Thus, the analysis of RNA-seq data obtained from random-primed libraries is less dependent on 3' UTR annotation in existing Ensembl and RefSeq transcriptome annotations than when using 3' biased data. However, relevant functional genes may still be missed when using Ensembl for quantification due to the complete absence of 3' UTR annotations for many genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ensembl and RefSeq annotations are missing genes</title><p>During the analysis above, we noted that Ens95 and RefSeq zebrafish annotations lacked common identifiers for a sizable proportion of genes. Moreover, relevant lineage markers, such as the smooth muscle-specific gene <italic>myocd</italic>, were among genes missing from either annotation (see above and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To further investigate this issue, we performed a coordinate-based transcript-level comparison between Ens95 and RefSeq (see Materials and methods). This analysis revealed 3165 genes annotated by RefSeq that were missing from Ens95 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). More than half of these missing genes encoded proteins and several hundred were curated in the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). Conversely, 2116 Ens95 genes were missing from RefSeq (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>), including 670 protein-coding genes, 141 T-cell receptor genes, and 546 genes curated by ZFIN (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). These discrepancies may have been due to the older version of Ensembl that we used at the start of our studies. However, a comparison of Ens95 to a more current version (Ensembl, version 99; referred to as Ens99), revealed identical transcript models and no new genes that have been annotated in the intervening versions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>), although some nomenclature has changed (data not shown). Thus, current zebrafish transcript annotations from RefSeq and Ensembl have considerable gaps that preclude a comprehensive assessment of gene expression and that may constrain follow-up studies when used for RNA-seq, or analyses focused on 3' UTR sequences (e.g. miRNA target searches).</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Coordinate-based transcriptome comparisons.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Annotation</th><th valign="top">Ensembl 95</th><th valign="top">RefSeq</th><th valign="top">V4.2</th><th valign="top">V4.3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"># genes</td><td valign="top">32520</td><td valign="top">30445</td><td valign="top">39988</td><td valign="top">36351</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"># transcripts</td><td valign="top">59876</td><td valign="top">55182</td><td valign="top">115496</td><td valign="top">111842</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"># exons</td><td valign="top">335075</td><td valign="top">307538</td><td valign="top">414404</td><td valign="top">411330</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"># RefSeq genes missing</td><td valign="top">3165</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">173</td><td valign="top">7<sup>c</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"># Ensembl genes missing<sup>a</sup></td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">2116</td><td valign="top">1133<sup>b</sup></td><td valign="top">957<sup>d</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>a –RefSeq comparison with Ens95, V4 comparison with Ens99.</p><p>b – 956/1133 classified as rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA or sRNA.</p></fn><fn><p>c – left out from V4.2 add-back; see main text.</p><p>d – 956/957 are rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, sRNA, or miscRNA; remaining protein coding gene is a sequence duplicate.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Assembly of an improved zebrafish transcriptome annotation</title><p>Our analyses above demonstrated two major issues with existing zebrafish transcriptome annotations. First, 3' UTR annotations are incomplete and differ between Ensembl and RefSeq. Second, each annotation is missing a sizable number of genes. To address these issues, we sought to construct a more complete zebrafish transcriptome annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For this purpose, we used the GSE32900 RNA-seq datasets, which comprise libraries from zebrafish embryos at dome, bud, and shield stages, as well as 28 hr post-fertilization (hpf) and 2- and 5 days, post-fertilization (dpf). From these stages, we combined over 600 million paired-end, strand-specific reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) and mapped them to GRCz11. We generated transcript and gene models using Cufflinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>) and applied Cuffmerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>) to combine them with Ens95 and RefSeq. With this approach, the naming conventions from the Ens95 annotation were applied to all gene models and remaining known genes named with RefSeq nomenclature. Initial transcriptome versions (versions 1 through 3; V1-V3) were generated to test and identify optimal parameters for transcript assembly (data not shown and see Materials and methods for details). During this process, we noted several nomenclature conflicts that arose due to spurious fusion transcripts. These were identified and removed through automated and manual annotation (see Materials and methods for details). These fusion transcripts led to misassignment of gene information in Ensembl and resulted in incorrect RNA-seq quantification, leading to shifts in detected gene expression (for examples, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). We also chose to remove ribosomal and small nuclear RNAs (but not miRNAs), which are present in Ensembl, but not in RefSeq.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The V4.2 annotation improves detection of cell-type-specific genes from bulk RNA-seq data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic outline for generating a new zebrafish transcriptome annotation.

A coordinate-based transcript comparison with RefSeq showed good coverage by V4.2 with only 173 RefSeq genes missing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). Comparison with a more recent Ensembl transcriptome annotation (Ensembl 99, released January 2020) shows nearly 1200 genes missing from V4.2, although the majority of these (957/1133) are ribosomal or small nuclear RNAs, which we had removed from our annotations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>) and which are also absent from RefSeq. Over 6000 gene models in V4.2 did not overlap with existing annotations and are referred to using arbitrary ‘XLOC’ numbers assigned by Cufflinks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>). Of these, approximately 1300 are transcripts that encode amino acid homology to zebrafish or human proteins, suggesting that these are previously unidentified paralogs or orthologs, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may be pseudogenes. Of the XLOC genes, we also identified 45 that match previously annotated long non-coding RNAs not present in Ensembl or RefSeq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>).</p><p>We subsequently added annotations for the missing Ens99 and RefSeq genes noted above from V4.2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>) to yield a V4.3 annotation. We also limited inclusion in V4.3 of XLOC genes to those that were supported by secondary analyses (see Materials and methods for details; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>). For end users concerned with potential mapping or quantification issues arising from novel gene annotations (e.g. due to the presence of pseudogenes, or repeat elements), XLOC genes can be easily removed from the annotation. Except for the cases noted above, V4.3 is missing only a single Ens99 gene (exclusive of small RNAs noted above) and 7 RefSeq genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The single Ens99 gene is an exactly duplicated sequence while missing RefSeq genes are those whose annotations are split between multiple chromosomes, with most cases having just a single or partial 5' exon as the second annotation (data not shown; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). In these cases, we kept the larger annotation, which had been present in V4.2, that included the 3' UTR. The V4.3 annotation contains 111,842 transcripts from over 400,000 unique exons that comprise 36351 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The transcript number in V4.3 is nearly double that in Ensembl or RefSeq and is accompanied by a considerable increase in the number of transcripts per gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting increased transcript isoform diversity. For example, Ensembl and RefSeq each predict a single transcript for the <italic>erg</italic> gene, each of which differs in intron-exon structure, as well as both 5' and 3' UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The V4.3 annotation predicts four transcripts for <italic>erg,</italic> including the Ensembl and RefSeq transcripts, as well as new additional isoforms with alternative promoter or exon usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>To facilitate the use of V4.3 by researchers, we have made Gene Transfer Format (.gtf) files with exon, transcript, and gene-level coordinate annotations for both V4.2 and V4.3 available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zf-transcriptome.umassmed.edu">zf-transcriptome.umassmed.edu</ext-link>. These files can be used for standard bulk or single-cell RNA-seq pipelines, with appropriate modification. We recommend that users apply the V4.3 annotation for their studies, given that it is more complete, although we include both for those interested in replicating studies described below. We have also compiled a gene information table containing matching Ensembl and RefSeq gene identifiers, along with ZFIN gene IDs, and chromosomal coordinates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5</xref>). As described above, we noted some nomenclature conflicts between Ensembl and RefSeq, and there are likely to be more. Therefore, we also include comments in the information table regarding how Ensembl and RefSeq gene assignments were made. We recommend that users consider these when performing follow-up analyses to confirm that matching data imported from other sources is accurate. Since our annotation comprises genes missing from Ensembl or RefSeq, as well as potentially novel genes (e.g. those identified with ‘XLOC’ assignments), and would lack a corresponding identifier from those annotations, we also assigned a unique arbitrary gene identifier to every gene (referred to as an ‘LL’ ID number). The LL ID number is also assigned to entries annotated in the GTF allowing easy integration of information from this table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5</xref>) with RNA-seq outputs following analysis.

In total, we identified 3129 genes out of the reference gene set (16558 total genes), where V4.3 predicted a longer 3' UTR than previously found in Ens95 or RefSeq for matching genes.</p><p>To determine how these extended annotations affect RNA-seq analysis, we quantified the 3' biased <italic>kdrl:mcherry</italic> and <italic>pdgfrb:citrine</italic> datasets using V4.3 and compared the output to that obtained from Ens95 and RefSeq.

As noted above, there were discrepancies between differentially called reference genes between Ens95 and RefSeq for the <italic>kdrl:mcherry</italic> and <italic>pdgfrb:citrine</italic> datasets (108 Ens95 only, 139 RefSeq only for <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched; 123 Ens95 only and 114 RefSeq only for <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched). Importantly, the majority of these discrepancies were eliminated by using V4.3. For example, 77 out of 108 genes identified as enriched only by Ens95 in <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> cells were now called as significant using V4.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Similar results were observed with <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched genes, where 110 out of 139 genes detected in Ens95 only were also now detected as significant with V4.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). In both cases, these genes were detected at significantly higher levels using the V4.3 annotation compared to RefSeq and exhibited much longer 3' UTR annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). We also noted that approximately 10% of all differentially called <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> (153) and <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic> (189) genes found in our reference gene set were uniquely identified using V4.3, but not Ens95 or RefSeq, despite their presence in all three annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source datas 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">7</xref>). As above, these genes were detected at significantly higher levels and displayed much longer 3' UTRs in the V4.3 annotation, compared to Ens95 or RefSeq, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Although we noted similar discrepancies between Ens95 and RefSeq annotations in the Nr2f2<sup>pos</sup> datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8</xref>), many of these were not resolved using V4.3, with most discrepant genes found just below statistical thresholds used to call Nr2f2<sup>pos</sup>-enriched genes (for example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8</xref>). However, we did note a number of cases where longer 3' UTR annotations in V4.3 helped to identify genes not otherwise detected as Nr2f2<sup>pos</sup>-enriched by one of the other annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata8">Figure 3—source data 8</xref>).</p><p>Among the genes identified as significantly enriched by V4.3 were all of the individual examples noted above as discrepancies between Ens95 and RefSeq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). These included endothelial genes such as <italic>slc7a5</italic>, which possessed a longer 3' UTR in RefSeq and was initially identified as <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic>-enriched only in that annotation. In V4.3, <italic>slc7a5</italic> has a 3' UTR approximately 5 kb longer than Ens95 or RefSeq and is detected at much higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Consequently, it is detected as significantly enriched in <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> cells when using V4.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also identified genes expected to be in endothelial cells but missed as significantly enriched by both Ens95 and RefSeq. This included <italic>slc2a1a</italic>, which has a 3' UTR approximately 3 kb longer in V4.3 than Ens95 and RefSeq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Accordingly, we detected <italic>slc2a1a</italic> at significantly higher levels in V4.3 than the other annotations and as significantly enriched in <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> cells when using V4.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,D</xref>). We noted similar improvements with discrepant <italic>pdgfrb<sup>pos</sup></italic> genes, such as <italic>cspg4</italic>, which has a longer 3' UTR in V4.3 when compared to Ens95 and RefSeq, concomitant with much higher levels of expression detected by V4.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,E</xref>). Notably, in each of these cases, the longer 3' UTRs identified by V4.3 were supported by the presence of a 3P-seq feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that analysis of bulk RNA-seq data using the V4.3 annotation can provide a more comprehensive and consistent output than Ensembl or RefSeq annotations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>V4.2 improves analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in zebrafish</title><p>Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is increasingly being applied to zebrafish to address relevant developmental questions. In most cases, scRNA-seq relies on 3' end-sequencing to identify and count transcripts in each cell. Based on the increased 3' UTR coverage in our V4 annotations, we reasoned that they could provide improvements for analyzing scRNA-seq data. To determine if this was the case, we used a publicly available 3' scRNA-seq dataset obtained from zebrafish embryos at five dpf using the 10x Genomics platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farnsworth et al., 2020</xref>). In this case, we separately quantified mapped reads from this dataset to Ens95 and V4.2 annotations using the CellRanger pipeline followed by filtering, clustering, and differential expression analysis using Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). For cell clustering, we utilized the first 75 principal components, which contributes to a comparable amount of the cumulative variation in both cases (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>After initial mapping with Cell Ranger, we observed an increase in the number of genes and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) captured per cell, along with an increase in total genes detected when using V4.2 compared to Ens95 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Most other standard metrics were comparable between the two annotations. We subsequently identified 54 cell clusters from a total of 9373 cells when using Ens95-quantified data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). With V4.2, both the number of cells (11630) and the number of clusters (62) was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggested that the increased 3' UTR coverage in V4.2 allowed more reads to be captured and used for quantification, thereby increasing the number of gene and cell calls used for clustering. Accordingly, we observed notable increases in the number of cluster-specific genes per cluster and numbers of cells per cluster when comparing Ens95- and V4.2-quantified data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The V4.2 annotation increases the number of cells and clusters detected in single cellingle-cell RNA-seq analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) tSNE plots of cells from 5 day post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish embryos from the same mapped scRNA-seq reads quantified with (<bold>A</bold>) Ens95 or (<bold>B</bold>) V4.2.

Both of these genes have been previously found in cartilage cells or their progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Askary et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2018</xref>) and were readily detected as significantly enriched in the cartilage cluster from V4.2-quantified data, but not Ens95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Accordingly, both <italic>sox9a</italic> and <italic>fzd9b</italic> showed longer 3' UTR annotations in V4.2 compared to Ens95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Similar results were noted for selected genes in the V4.2 epidermis cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). In all of these examples, the extended 3' UTR annotations in V4.2 were supported by 3P-seq features and would be expected to capture the majority of reads from scRNA-seq. Notably, the 3' UTR annotated in V4.2 for <italic>fzd9b</italic>, which is also supported by a 3P-Seq feature, is only 350 bp longer than that in Ens95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, even a modest increase in 3' UTR length can have a significant impact on gene detection, especially in the case for 10x Genomics libraries where short reads are anchored at the 3' end.</p><p>We also noted cases where use of the V4.2 annotation could improve clustering resolution over Ens95-quantified scRNA-seq data. For example, we identified several groups of blood cells, which included cells within two clusters expressing leukocyte-specific genes (e.g. <italic>coronin, actin-binding protein, 1A</italic> [<italic>coro1a</italic>] and <italic>Rac family small GTPase 2</italic> [<italic>rac2</italic>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) and erythroid cells expressing hemoglobin (<italic>hbae1.1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galloway et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oates et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). The two leukocyte clusters could be further distinguished by expression of <italic>src-like adapter 2</italic> (<italic>sla2</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), which is expressed in T and B cells in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pandey et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>sla2</italic>-positive (<italic>sla2<sup>pos</sup></italic>) leukocyte cluster was split on the tSNE plot when using Ens95-quantified reads, such that some cells were more closely associated with the erythroid cluster (denoted by two circles connected by a line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B and G</xref>). Despite their assignment to the <italic>sla2<sup>pos</sup></italic> leukocyte cluster, these separate cells failed to express <italic>sla2</italic> and distinctly expressed <italic>hbae1.1</italic>, similar to cells in the adjacent erythroid cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). This subset of <italic>sla2<sup>pos</sup></italic> cells also did not express leukocyte-specific genes, but shared expression of <italic>v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog</italic> (<italic>myb</italic>) and <italic>proliferating cell nuclear antigen</italic> (<italic>pcna</italic>), suggestive of a common proliferative or progenitor-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Soza-Ried et al., 2010</xref>). Using reads quantified with the V4.2 annotation, we identified a group of cells that were similarly located adjacent to, but separate from an erythroid cluster. However, in this case, the erythroid-adjacent cells were also classified as separate from <italic>sla2<sup>pos</sup></italic>-leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Mapping of cell barcodes from this V4.2 cluster onto cells clustered using Ens95-quantified reads revealed that these are the same cells clustered with, but split from, <italic>sla2<sup>pos</sup></italic> leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). This suggested that these cells were mis-classified during clustering using Ens95-quantified data.

We document several discrepancies and deficiencies in the existing Ensembl and RefSeq annotations, including incomplete 3' UTR annotations and missing gene models. Our new transcriptome annotation addresses many of these issues and performs better than existing annotations for the analysis of both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets, especially in cases where RNA-seq libraries exhibit reads biased toward the 3' ends of transcripts. Annotation discrepancies proved to be less noticeable when analyzing RNA-seq libraries constructed using a random primed method. However, we noted failure to detect important functional genes and well-known lineage markers even in this case. This issue was especially noticeable in the Ensembl transcriptome annotation, where nearly 20% of all coding genes lack an annotated 3' UTR. Moreover, we also show that integration of bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq from common cell types is more consistent when both datasets are mapped to the same annotation. Thus, similar approaches to integrate bulk RNA-Seq from random-primed libraries with scRNA-seq would still benefit from mapping both datasets on an annotation with more accurate 3' UTR models. For these reasons, we believe that our improved annotation will be a valuable tool for zebrafish researchers to apply in the context of their ongoing and planned RNA-seq experiments.</p><p>In the course of our previous efforts in applying RNA-seq, we had generated a custom annotation by simply extending the existing Ensembl UTR annotations by 5 kb (previously only described as a ‘custom’ annotation in the Materials and methods section of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quillien et al., 2017</xref>). However, we found that this could lead to several secondary issues regarding RNA-seq read and gene assignment, especially in cases where an extension merged with an adjacent gene on the same strand. Indeed, as we find in this study, this is currently an issue with several loci in the recent Ensembl annotations, leading to mis-quantification of RNA-seq data, aberrant assignment of gene information, and apparent loss of genes (for examples see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). We have also found that some Ensembl genes are missing terminal exons, such that a simple 3' extension could lead to quantification of otherwise spurious intronic RNA-seq reads from pre-mRNA (data not shown). In addition, several hundred genes from the reference gene set we generated here possess 3' UTRs in the V4 annotation that are more than 5 kb longer than existing Ensembl or RefSeq annotations. Therefore, we reasoned that the incorporation of existing high-quality RNA-seq datasets would provide an evidence-guided approach to extend 3' UTR annotations. Indeed, our new annotation exhibits extended 3' UTR models for a large proportion of existing genes and improves performance for RNA-seq analysis. Moreover, transcript diversity is drastically increased in our annotation, with evidence of many more splice isoforms not evident in Ensembl or RefSeq. While we have not comprehensively addressed the depth of isoform diversity in this study, we believe that our improved annotation will prove useful for better characterizing splice isoform and differential 3' UTR usage in the zebrafish. Future studies that take advantage of long-read sequencing, along with additional 5' and 3' anchored sequencing, will prove helpful at further verifying and improving the transcript models predicted in our annotation.</p><p>The increased application of scRNA-seq for molecular analysis in the zebrafish model underscores the need for a transcriptome annotation with accurate 3' UTR annotations. This is especially important given the reliance on 3' end sequencing in most scRNA-seq studies. As we show, a 3' UTR annotation missing just a few hundred nucleotides can lead to drastic differences in gene expression. With the limited sequence space captured in most scRNA-seq libraries, along with the large proportion of incomplete 3' UTRs in existing zebrafish annotations, many previous studies may be missing a large number of cell type-specific genes. This issue subsequently has a direct impact on cell clustering. In our example, we show how improvements in 3' UTR annotation lead to a detection of important erythroid-specific genes that guide more accurate assignment of distinct, but related, cell types. Indeed, scRNA-seq analysis with the V4.2 annotation increased the number of clusters called by Ens95 by fifteen percent, suggesting there are numerous examples where improved gene quantification likely led to more refined cell clustering. Whether the V4.2 annotation might also provide similar improvements with scRNA-seq libraries anchored at the 5' end is not known. Anecdotally, we have noted several genes where V4.2 shows an extended 5' UTR annotation when compared to RefSeq and Ensembl (e.g. <italic>fzd9b</italic>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). However, we have not quantified whether this observation holds across most of the transcriptome. With the availability of cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) datasets that define the transcriptional start sites of genes in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haberle et al., 2014</xref>), it would be possible in future studies to assess how complete the 5' ends of gene models might be across the different transcriptome annotations.</p><p>The use of our annotation for read quantification can improve RNA-seq interpretation through a more accurate estimation of gene expression. However, there remain issues to be improved addressed in future versions. Despite improvements, our annotation is likely limited by the use of short-read sequencing libraries. For example, in cases where genes encode multiple transcript isoforms with both variable 3' UTR length and exon usage, it is not possible to accurately assign which splice isoforms have particular 3' UTRs. We would note that this same deficiency applies to Ensembl and RefSeq annotations when quantifying data from RNA-seq libraries generated through short-read deep sequencing. We also noted that some predicted XLOC loci removed from V4.2 were located immediately adjacent and downstream of existing or extended 3' UTR annotations, suggesting that they were likely longer 3' UTRs (data not shown). The prevalence of repetitive elements in these 3' UTR sequences may preclude dense enough mapping of short-read sequences to connect these downstream annotations. As noted above, future integration of our annotation with long-read sequencing will likely further improve both isoform assignment and 3' UTR models. Likewise, 3'-anchored sequencing efforts, along with more rigorous computational analysis could also better define differential polyadenylation sites and allow improved characterization of differential 3' UTR usage. We would also point out that the RNA samples we used for reconstructing the V4 transcriptome were limited to embryonic and early larval stages. As such, genes restricted to late larval and adult stages may still have a preponderance of incomplete 3' UTRs. There are also likely to be some remaining nomenclature issues, particularly in the case of duplicated genes where official name designations have not yet been assigned, or in cases where a gene is split between remaining non-chromosomal contigs. Despite these remaining issues, the current iteration of our transcriptome annotation represents an improvement over existing annotations and will provide a valuable resource for the zebrafish community.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Tg(fli1a:egfp)<sup>y1</sup></italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lawson and Weinstein, 2002</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-011017-8">ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-011017-8</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>TgBAC(pdgfrb:citrine)<sup>s1010</sup></italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-150922-2">ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-150922-2</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-NR2F2 NR2F2 D16C4, rabbit monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat #6434;

Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in wash buffer. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed by the UMassMed Flow Cytometry Core to separately isolate Nr2f2/EGFP double-positive (red/green) and Nr2f2-negative/EGFP-positive (green) cells. Total RNA was purified from double- and single-positive cells using RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (AM1975, Ambion), then concentrated using RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit (11–325, Zymo Research). After the elimination of ribosomal RNAs using mammalian RiboGone Kit (634846, Clontech), RNAseq libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq Kit (634836, Clontech) and deep sequencing performed on a HiSeq2000 (UMass Med Deep Sequencing Core Facility). Libraries were constructed from Nr2f2/EGFP-positive and EGFP-positive cells isolated from clutches of embryos generated on three different days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Bulk RNA-seq analysis</title><p>We ran mapping and quantification pipelines described below in the DolphinNext environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/dolphinnext">https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/dolphinnext</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yukselen et al., 2020</xref>) using the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Cluster (GHPCC). Triplicate samples of paired-end reads from <italic>kdrl</italic>-positive and <italic>kdrl</italic>-negative cells were downloaded from GEO (GSE119718). For bulk RNA-seq we utilized a standardized pipeline in the DolphinNext environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/rnaseq">https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/rnaseq, </ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yukselen et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, reads were mapped to GRCz11 using STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) with default parameters to generate BAM files, which were subsequently used for transcript quantification with RSEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) using Ensembl, version 95, RefSeq (GCF_000002035.6_GRCz11), or V4.3 transcript annotations. We identified differentially expressed genes using DESeq2 with gene-mapped expected count files from RSEM. DESeq2 was run using the DEBrowser interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kucukural et al., 2019</xref>). We applied the Low count filtering method to remove features with counts per million of less than 10 in at least three samples and median ratio normalization was applied in all cases. The dispersion was estimated using a parametric fit and hypothesis testing performed using the likelihood ratio test. p-values obtained by the Wald test were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Differentially expressed genes were defined as those with log<sub>2</sub> fold change less than −1 or greater than one and adjusted p-value less than 0.05. We ran the same pipeline with identical parameters for each annotation (RefSeq, Ens95, or V4.3). Volcano plots were generated using DESeq2 in the DEBrowser interface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Annotation comparisons</title><p>To compare RNA-seq analyses from Ens95 and RefSeq, we downloaded matching NCBI IDs for Ensembl-annotated genes using Biomart from the Ens95 archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jan2019.archive.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/Info/Index">http://jan2019.archive.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/Info/Index</ext-link>). Our gene-level DEbrowser output listed gene symbol with all associated transcripts. Since a number of Ens95 and RefSeq genes have identical gene symbol annotations, we incorporated matching Ens95 gene and NCBI IDs using a representative transcript ID for each gene to ensure correct matches. We then applied Intervene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khan and Mathelier, 2017</xref>) for intersections based on common NCBI ID and generation of Venn diagrams. Proportional Venn diagrams were generated using eulerr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larsson, 2020</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jolars/eulerr.co">https://github.com/jolars/eulerr.co</ext-link>). A similar approach was applied for comparison of RNA-seq outputs from V4.2 and V.3, except that LL gene ID was used. All corresponding NCBI, Ensembl, and LL gene IDs for RNA-seq output are included in the corresponding source data tables. To identify matching and missing genes between different annotations, we applied gffcompare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pertea and Pertea, 2020</xref>), which provides a coordinate-based comparison of transcript intron/exon structure using GTF files as input. A GTF for RefSeq (GCF_000002035.6_GRCz11) was downloaded from the UCSC Table browser, while Ens95 was downloaded from the Ensembl FTP site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org:21/pub/release-95/gtf/danio_rerio/Danio_rerio.GRCz11.95.gtf.gz">ftp.ensembl.org:21/pub/release-95/gtf/danio_rerio/Danio_rerio.GRCz11.95.gtf.gz</ext-link>). Before running gffcompare, Ensembl-annotated GTF files were modified to match UCSC-based chromosome annotation, while ‘alt’ chromosome variants in RefSeq were removed. Each pairwise comparison was run with default settings using each annotation as a reference to identify relative missing and matching transcript models. To confirm that missing transcripts represented actual missing genes, reference genomes in each case were subsequently re-searched for matching gene IDs corresponding to each missing transcript. We subsequently surveyed between 10 to 20 missing genes manually through individual visualization of their loci on the UCSC genome browser to confirm the results. Matched transcript outputs from gffcompare, along with missing gene lists can be found in the associated source data files.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Comparison of 3' UTR coverage between annotations</title><p>To assess the presence or absence of 3' UTR models in coding genes in Ens95 and RefSeq, we relied on the annotation of these features in column 3 of each respective gene transfer format file (GTF). Each feature was extracted from the respective GTF, collapsed to novel gene ID to avoid spuriously counting alternatively spliced multi-exon 3' UTRs, and counted. To compare 3' UTR length, we chose to generate a reference gene set with a single representative transcript per gene. This approach reduces the potential for spuriously matching or assigning differentially spliced or alternative 3' UTR isoforms across annotations. All 3' UTR lengths were obtained from each annotation by using GenomicFeatures in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>) with GTFs for each annotation containing only the 3' UTR annotated entries. We next extracted all terminal exons from the Ens95 GTF annotated as a 3' UTR. For each Ens95 gene, we then identified and chose a single transcript with the longest 3' UTR as representative. To accurately match a RefSeq transcript to each representative Ens95 transcript, we first identified and extracted the longest terminal 3' UTR exon for each RefSeq transcript. In cases where there were identical overlapping transcript coordinates, these were collapsed into a single entry and arbitrarily assigned one of the duplicate transcript IDs. Matching transcripts from RefSeq were integrated using bedtools by intersecting on the last exon start coordinates on the same strand (i.e. start coordinate on the positive stand, end coordinate on the minus strand). To incorporate V4.3 genes, we identified the longest terminal exon for each gene, collapsed duplicates, and assigned an arbitrary transcript ID as above for RefSeq entries. V4.3 transcripts matching the reference gene were then incorporated using bedtools to intersect on exon start coordinates on the same strand as above. V4.3 3' UTR lengths were then calculated based on the differences between RefSeq or Ens95 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). To visualize 3P-Seq location, we downloaded BED files from GEO (GSE37453, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ulitsky et al., 2012</xref>) and merged these into a single file after filtering for expression level. We then sequentially lifted these coordinates over from Zv9 to GRCz10 and then to GRCz11 using the UCSC browser interface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver</ext-link>). For comparison of gene-level expression between annotations, we imported values from DESeq2 output for indicated dataset mapped to each respective annotation using the appropriate matched ID. Further details are available upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Assembly of an improved zebrafish transcriptome annotation</title><p>We downloaded 75 bp Paired-end stranded RNA-seq reads from embryos staged at 28hpf, 2dpf, 5dpf, bud, dome, and shield from GEO (Accession no.: GSE32898, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pauli et al., 2012</xref>). Reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic (adaptor removal, headcrop, and crop to retain position 10–50 bp only along with default quality trimming) and reads shorter than 32 bp after trimming were discarded. Trimmed reads were aligned to <italic>Danio rerio</italic> genome GRCz11 with GSNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu and Nacu, 2010</xref>) allowing 5% mismatches. Our anecdotal observations suggested a prevalence of incomplete and spurious partial transcripts in Ensembl. Therefore, the alignment was guided by splicing sites extracted from refseq_mRNA (GCF_000002035.6_GRCz11). We filtered alignment results so that only properly paired reads with MQ ≥30 and more than 35 bp of mapped regions were retained. An in-house perl script was used to add strand information and format the filtered alignment results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode2">Source code 2</xref>). We used mapped reads to assemble transcript and gene models using Cufflinks and Cuffmerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>). Preliminary versions of our transcriptome annotation (v1, v2) were used to identify parameters that optimally captured isoform diversity and 3' UTR lengths. Version 3.1.2 (v3.1.2) used Cufflinks with the following parameters: -F 0.2 j 0.3 -a 0.0001 -A 0.4 --<monospace>min-frags-per-transfrag 20</monospace> --<monospace>overhang-tolerance 20</monospace> --<monospace>overlap-radius</monospace> 50 -−3-overhang-tolerance 50 to assemble transcripts for samples from each embryonic stage. Cufflinks assembly for v3.1.2 was guided (using the -g argument in Cufflinks) by the most recently available zebrafish RefSeq annotation (GCF_000002035.6_GRCz11). We next integrated trans-fragments assembled by Cufflinks for each stage using Cuffmerge. We chose to use Ensembl annotations (version 95) to guide the integration of the transcript models generated above using Cuffmerge. At this step, we allowed low abundance transcripts to be retained in the final annotation (‘--<monospace>min-isoform-fraction</monospace> 0.00’). Initial gene nomenclature assignments were made using v3.1.2. For this purpose, all relevant matching gene information was extracted from the GTF output from Cuffmerge for v3.1.2 and used to assign gene information to transcript ID (TCONS) generated by Cufflinks. At this point, over 1000 gene symbol conflicts were identified by comparing assigned gene names for comparing RefSeq and Ens95 transcript IDs to those assigned by Cufflinks. In many cases, these were due to spurious fusion transcripts linking adjacent genes. Therefore, we sought to remove these using a customized Python script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode3">Source code 3</xref>). We also manually removed non-miRNA small RNAs. Given the nomenclature conflicts noted above, we utilized gffcompare to accurately import matched gene identifiers from RefSeq and a more recent Ensembl annotation (version 99, released January 2020). In cases where a perfect transcript match was not available, we subsequently compared gene coordinates to further confirm overlap; we include a qualitative description for each entry in this case for RefSeq and Ens99 matches in the V4.3 gene information file. In the course of investigating the nature of the nomenclature conflicts noted above, we also manually corrected several incorrect gene names assigned by Ensembl that resulted from persistent overlapping transcripts between two separate genes that evaded filtering noted above, causing a single gene ID to be assigned to two genes (see main text and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). In these cases, spurious overlapping transcripts were removed to give V4.2. To identify any remaining Ensembl or RefSeq genes missing from V4.2, we performed pairwise comparisons with each annotation using gffcompare. The resulting missing genes were then manually added to give V4.3. Since our annotation comprises genes missing from both Ensembl and RefSeq annotations, as well as novel genes (see below), we assigned a unique identifier (prefix ‘LL’ followed by an arbitrary number) to each entry, which can be used as a common link for the relation between the gene information file and the resulting output from the GTF following its application in RNA-seq analysis. The GTF and gene information files for V4.2 and V4.3 are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zf-transcriptome.umassmed.edu">http://zf-transcriptome.umassmed.edu</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Annotation of novel loci</title><p>Our annotation yielded just over 6000 novel loci with no initial match to Ensembl or RefSeq genes. These are annotated using gene abbreviations with an ‘XLOC’ prefix assigned by cufflinks. To investigate whether these represent new genes, we took several steps. First, we used transcript sequences from each locus in blastx searches against zebrafish and human proteins. Second, we determined whether any overlapped previously long non-coding RNAs identified in previous studies. For this purpose, we used an integrated annotation published elsewhere that includes lincRNAs not found in Ensembl or RefSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). This annotation was converted to a standard BED format, lifted from Zv9 to GRCz10, then to GRCz11 and used to generate a GTF file. We used gffcompare with the lincRNA GTF file and a parallel file containing only XLOC V4.2 annotations to identify matching or overlapping transcripts. Finally, we determined exon numbers for each XLOC entry. In V4.2, all XLOC entries were maintained in the associated GTF and gene information files. For V4.3, we retained XLOCs that matched one of the following criteria: 1. exhibited exact, moderate, or high-confidence blast hits with a zebrafish or human protein, 2. exhibited matched or overlapping intron-exon structure with the lincRNAs noted above, or 3. comprised more than one exon. We also identified approximately 200 loci that exhibited complete overlap with existing RefSeq-annotated transcripts already present in V4.2. These redundant XLOC loci were also removed in the update to V4.3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq analysis</title><p>We downloaded scRNA-seq reads from whole zebrafish embryos at five dpf from the Sequence Read Archive (SRR10095965, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farnsworth et al., 2020</xref>).

mutually exclusive gene models that can affect the interpretation of transcriptional profiling datasets. Moreover, incomplete annotation of 3' untranslated regions impairs gene expression analysis of datasets from increasingly popular single cell RNA-seq techniques due to their inherent 3' bias. To address these problems the authors have produced a new zebrafish gene annotation that improves detection of cell-type specific transcripts.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;An improved zebrafish transcriptome annotation for sensitive and comprehensive detection of cell type-specific genes&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>In this manuscript, Lawson et al. observe that some 3' UTRs in the Ensembl and RefSeq zebrafish gene annotations seem incomplete and gene models are inconsistent between the two annotations. The incomplete 3' UTRs affect their ability to identify differentially expressed genes in an RNA-seq dataset from <italic>kdrl<sup>pos</sup></italic> and <italic>kdrl</italic><sup>neg</sup> cell populations. The authors speculate that this is due to the strong 3' bias in read distribution caused by oligo-dT priming. To remedy this, the authors use Cufflinks and Cuffmerge to produce transcript and gene models from a published RNA-seq dataset covering six developmental stages, guided by RefSeq splice sites, and Ensembl annotation. The resulting annotation (called V4.2) has longer 3' UTRs for a subset of genes. The authors show that this increases the number of genes detected as differentially expressed in their RNA-seq dataset. Similarly, mapping a published single cell 10x Genomics RNA-seq dataset against V4.2 moderately increases the number of detected genes and cell clusters in a tSNE plot. The authors conclude that these results demonstrate that their V4.2 annotation is superior to the Ensembl and RefSeq annotations and recommend using V4.2 for bulk and single cell RNA-seq analysis.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the current 3' UTR annotation of the zebrafish genome is incomplete and might affect the interpretation of 3' biased transcriptional profiling data. Therefore, an annotation with more accurate 3' UTRs would be a useful resource. However, as it stands, the annotation presented here would create different problems for anyone using it because of the additional (and in this manuscript undiscussed) gene and transcript models that are based solely on one RNA-seq dataset. A Cufflinks transcript model, even if it produces a BLAST hit, is insufficient evidence that it is a bona fide expressed transcript (see below for details). We would therefore ask that the manuscript focus on the improved 3' UTR annotation of Ensembl and/or RefSeq gene models and show that it provides a considerable advancement for RNA-seq analysis. This focus should also be reflected in the title.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The case for an improvement rests mostly on the fact that a few genes that the authors had expected to change expression in one of their datasets were only detected as differentially expressed (DE) when using their V4.2 annotation instead of Ensembl or RefSeq annotation. The other test case, a single cell RNA-seq re-analysis using V4.2, shows only minor changes. Crucially, there is no evaluation of the gene overlap with the Ensembl or RefSeq based analyses, so some genes might actually be lost. The bulk RNA-seq dataset in this manuscript is unusual as it uses oligo-dT priming instead of the more common random priming used in, for example, the TruSeq library preparation kits. The resulting 3' bias is extreme. For example, in Figure 1C the read depth drops by 99% from 2750 at the 3' UTR end of the gene to 28 in the coding part of that exon. To demonstrate that V4.2 represents a significant improvement over current annotation, an objective analysis of several datasets is required, including random-primed RNA-seq data. If the advantage is limited to 3' end biased data, this should be shown and discussed.</p><p>2) The authors state that new transcripts and genes are present in their V4.2 annotation that are missing in both Ensembl and RefSeq. This is based on transcript and gene model output from cufflinks. Some of these models have BLAST hits, which the authors interpret as evidence that these are bona fide expressed transcripts. This is incorrect. Reads can mis-map to processed pseudogenes and other gene remnants and thus look like separate expressed genes. It is therefore not surprising that some of those have BLAST hits. Of the 6562 genes with an XLOC name in v4.2.1.gtf, 4714 are single exon genes. This indicates that the vast majority are indeed likely to be processed pseudogenes. If these gene models were to be used to map against, they would mop up reads from coding genes and distort results. Taken together these models have not passed the many filtering and validation steps using additional evidence (cDNA, cross species comparisons etc) that Ensembl and RefSeq employ. To avoid over-interpretation of these unverified gene models they should be provided separately from those that have Ensembl and/or RefSeq identifiers. The text needs to acknowledge the limitation of these gene models. Claims of missing genes should be made much more cautiously unless independent evidence beyond BLAST hits is provided.</p><p>3) The annotation needs to include existing Ensembl and RefSeq identifiers. Gene symbols are notoriously unreliable and not suitable for comparative analyses.</p><p>4) The annotation uses one RNA-seq dataset derived from whole embryos and a limited set of developmental stages. It is possible that the modest improvement is partially due to missing tissue- or stage-specific transcripts and their 3' UTRs. The authors should compare the genes detected in a few tissue-specific datasets with V4.2 to demonstrate sufficient overlap or acknowledge the limitation if a substantial number of genes are absent from the used dataset. Alternatively, the authors could run Cufflinks without Ensembl and RefSeq annotation and then compare how many transcripts overlap Ensembl transcripts. Likewise, alternative polyadenylation and differential 3' end use will affect interpretation of gene expression. This should be discussed.</p><p>5) The authors need to provide statistics and numbers in the text instead of qualifiers such as &quot;much lower&quot;. For example, the authors state &quot;…the overall number of differentially-expressed transcripts identified when using Ensembl was much lower than that found with RefSeq.&quot; The difference is 7%. Another example is &quot;increase in the number of median genes&quot;. How many? (It's 842 vs. 761.) Likewise, the authors need to provide statistics of their annotation. How many genes are detected, what is the length/ exon number distribution of known transcripts vs. XLOC transcripts etc.</p><p>6) A lot of the analysis methodology is missing and no code is provided. &quot;In-house Perl scripts&quot; need to be made available. What were the criteria for &quot;hand-curation&quot;? The same is true for other methods. For example, the intersection analysis of RefSeq and Ens95 is not clear. What does intersection by gene coordinate mean? Is it exactly matching start/end positions or by interval overlap? The discrepancy of 3000 genes is improbably large.</p><p>Other required changes and clarifications:</p><p>1) In Figure 5A, there are 7 cartilage and 9 epidermis genes unique to Ens95 vs. V4.2. Could the authors comment on this? Are these genes bona fide markers of these cell types or false positives? Will the missing genes in V4.2 be incorporated?</p><p>2) Figure 1A, B should be -log.</p><p>3) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, the 6743 genes from RefSeq only in panel A does not correspond to the 6119 genes (2514+3605) analyzed in panel B. Likewise, the 2514 genes from panel B do not correspond to the 2549 genes (2035+514) in panel C. Please correct or explain these discrepancies in gene number.</p><p>4) &quot;Comparison of 3' UTRs for matching genes from the two annotations in those latter cases revealed that the overall differences in length were significant (Figure 2C).&quot; Why has a statistical test been performed here? The authors are not randomly sampling from an underlying population of gene models and then measuring the UTR length. They have selected for the ones that are either longer or shorter in Ensembl 95.</p><p>5) Figure 3B: If the Ensembl annotation was merged into V4.2, how can V4.2 have shorter UTRs than Ensembl?</p><p>6) The counting against the two annotations seems oddly inconsistent. For <italic>slc2a1a</italic> (Figure 1E and Figure 5D) the same exon portion gets 16 reads in Ens95, but only 4 reads in RefSeq.</p><p>7) It is not clear what is meant by this sentence in the legend for Figure 2—figure supplement 1: &quot;Total numbers of unique genes in each case are not equivalent due to cases there (&quot;where&quot; I assume?) multiple genes from either or both annotations may intersect within a single interval.&quot; How many genes does the overlap method fail to distinguish because of this?</p><p>8) &quot;…all of these genes appear preferentially expressed in the erythroid-2 cluster (Figure 7A)&quot;. <italic>slc25a37</italic> and <italic>tfr1a</italic> are expressed in more cells at higher levels in the erythroid cluster, not erythroid-2.</p><p>9) &quot;…mapped onto the RefSeq annotation&quot;. Mapping is to the assembly not the annotation, so it should either say &quot;mapped to GRCz11 and counted against the RefSeq annotation&quot; or just &quot;counted against the RefSeq annotation&quot;. Same at : &quot;to genome-mapped or ENSEMBL-mapped reads&quot;. The reads aren't mapped to the Ensembl annotation, they are counted against it. This needs changing throughout.</p><p>10) Figure 3 legend. What do the bars represent in Figure 3C, E and F, median or mean?</p><p>11) Legends for Figures 4-7. What do the colour bars in the t-SNE expression plots represent? It will be some kind of count, but what exactly?</p><p>12) It would be interesting to see what the RefSeq and Ensembl comparison looks like for other model organisms (not humans, which has MANE https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/MANE/).</p><p>13) Figure 5C: There are a lot fewer dots than the Venn diagram would suggest. Are they plotted on top of each other? Jitter might help. Also, what do the genes from the Ens95 counting that don't overlap with the V4.2 ones look like?</p><p>14) https://www.umassmed.edu/lawson-lab/transcriptome gives a 404 error.</p><p>15) Ensembl not ENSEMBL.</p><p>16) Median ration =&gt; Median ratio.</p><p>17) &quot;In this process, we also manually corrected several incorrect gene names assigned by ENSEMBL that resulted from transcripts overlapping two separate genes, causing a single gene ID to be assigned to two genes.&quot; Have these been reported to Ensembl?</p><p>18) tRNAscan is mentioned in the Materials and methods, but nowhere else.</p><p>19) It would be good if the GTF file contained CDS entries.</p><p>20) Figure 2: Venn diagram is incomplete, lacks the non-concordant population</p><p>21) Figure 2—figure supplement 1: the Venn diagrams should be size proportionate.</p><p>22) Figure 3 and text: reorder bud, shield and dome to dome, shield and bud so as to fully maintain sequence of stages</p><p>23) Figure 2B: caption should be V4.2</p><p>24) Figure 2C: scales of charts should be fixed to 15k for direct comparison and to demonstrate length difference of 3'UTR distribution between annotations</p><p>25) &quot;…only genes with matched gene symbols between ENSEMBL (v95) and RefSeq were maintained&quot; and &quot;only V4.2 genes that matched by gene symbol were incorporated into the reference set&quot;.

The other test case, a single cell RNA-seq re-analysis using V4.2, shows only minor changes. Crucially, there is no evaluation of the gene overlap with the Ensembl or RefSeq based analyses, so some genes might actually be lost. The bulk RNA-seq dataset in this manuscript is unusual as it uses oligo-dT priming instead of the more common random priming used in, for example, the TruSeq library preparation kits. The resulting 3' bias is extreme. For example, in Figure 1C the read depth drops by 99% from 2750 at the 3' UTR end of the gene to 28 in the coding part of that exon. To demonstrate that V4.2 represents a significant improvement over current annotation, an objective analysis of several datasets is required, including random-primed RNA-seq data. If the advantage is limited to 3' end biased data, this should be shown and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we now provide a more comprehensive analysis of differences between the RefSeq and Ensembl transcriptome annotations and the impact on RNA-seq interpretation. The new analyses include: (1) more detailed comparison of differences and overlap in gene calls across two additional bulk RNA-seq datasets (including one from a library generated through random-priming); (2) use of an improved reference geneset of over 16,000 genes to analyze 3' UTR annotation differences between the two annotations; and (3) a more direct and definitive transcript level comparison of RefSeq and Ensembl annotations, as well as comparison to the new annotations to identify genes from each annotation.</p><p>The results support our initial contention that the existing annotations are incomplete, especially regarding 3' UTR annotations. As the reviewer points out, this is most noticeable when using 3'-end biased data and we do not see as severe an issue when analyzing data from a library constructed using a random-primed approach. However, our expanded analyses also clearly point out that each annotation is indeed missing several thousand gene models – a point in the original manuscript that the reviewers regarded with some scepticism. This latter issue would affect RNA-seq analyses regardless of the method of library construction. We also include new data showing that nearly 20% of Ensembl-annotated coding genes completely lack a 3' UTR annotation, which can also affect interpretation from random-primed libraries (an example is given in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Our new annotation includes all of the missing genes, along with improved 3' UTR coverage. Our expanded analysis of bulk RNA-seq and integration with scRNA-seq analysis in the revised manuscript also highlights the benefit of having consistent gene calls across experiments. Such integration would be less consistent even with bulk RNA-seq from a random-primed library quantified on current annotations, given that scRNA-seq is typically reliant on accurate 3' UTR models. In addition, our analyses show that it is much more than a &quot;few&quot; genes or just &quot;minor changes&quot; – in nearly every case, we see that RefSeq or Ensembl misses hundreds of genes, many of which are canonical lineage markers, or have major functional relevance.</p><p>Finally, we also note a significant increase in the number of transcripts per gene in the new annotation. While a more thorough assessment of transcript diversity is beyond the scope of the current work, our anecdotal observations suggest that there are many more splice isoforms, alternative promoters, and alternative 3' UTRs present in our annotation. We provide some quantification of isoform diversity in the revised manuscript, along with discussion of how to better address this aspect of transcript annotation in future work. Thus, our improved annotation in not simply limited to extended 3' UTR models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state that new transcripts and genes are present in their V4.2 annotation that are missing in both Ensembl and RefSeq. This is based on transcript and gene model output from cufflinks. Some of these models have BLAST hits, which the authors interpret as evidence that these are bona fide expressed transcripts. This is incorrect. Reads can mis-map to processed pseudogenes and other gene remnants and thus look like separate expressed genes. It is therefore not surprising that some of those have BLAST hits. Of the 6562 genes with an XLOC name in v4.2.1.gtf, 4714 are single exon genes. This indicates that the vast majority are indeed likely to be processed pseudogenes. If these gene models were to be used to map against, they would mop up reads from coding genes and distort results. Taken together these models have not passed the many filtering and validation steps using additional evidence (cDNA, cross species comparisons etc) that Ensembl and RefSeq employ. To avoid over-interpretation of these unverified gene models they should be provided separately from those that have Ensembl and/or RefSeq identifiers. The text needs to acknowledge the limitation of these gene models. Claims of missing genes should be made much more cautiously unless independent evidence beyond BLAST hits is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers concerns in this regard and we have made efforts to address this issue. In the revised manuscript, we provide a better description and discussion of &quot;XLOC&quot; entries in the V4 annotations. We also generated an annotation (V4.3) that contains a reduced number of these entries, based on several criteria listed in the manuscript (e.g. high confidence blast hit in zebrafish and/or human; and/or multiple exons, etc). We also include a table with BLAST hits (zebrafish and human) and number of exons for the XLOC loci and whether they were maintained in V4.3. We also make note in the revised manuscript that users who may be concerned with issues regarding mapping and quantification can choose to completely remove these from the annotation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The annotation needs to include existing Ensembl and RefSeq identifiers. Gene symbols are notoriously unreliable and not suitable for comparative analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue has been addressed and both Ensembl and RefSeq identifiers have been added to the gene entries. We achieved this through a transcript-based match between the annotations using gffcompare, with subsequent assessment of gene symbols. In some cases, we noted discrepancies, particularly in Ensembl, due to incorrect gene assignments. In these cases, use of the Ensembl identifier would actually result in the wrong gene information being matched, although these cases may be rare. Nonetheless, we also provide a comment regarding heuristic classification for each match that provides a confidence metric regarding the accuracy of the associated Ensembl or RefSeq ID. We refer readers to this as it may lead to improper assignment when importing matched data from Ensembl. We have contacted ZFIN concerning these discrepancies and the cases we have noticed so far have been corrected or noted in the corresponding gene entries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The annotation uses one RNA-seq dataset derived from whole embryos and a limited set of developmental stages. It is possible that the modest improvement is partially due to missing tissue- or stage-specific transcripts and their 3' UTRs. The authors should compare the genes detected in a few tissue-specific datasets with V4.2 to demonstrate sufficient overlap or acknowledge the limitation if a substantial number of genes are absent from the used dataset. Alternatively, the authors could run Cufflinks without Ensembl and RefSeq annotation and then compare how many transcripts overlap Ensembl transcripts. Likewise, alternative polyadenylation and differential 3' end use will affect interpretation of gene expression. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in better detail in the revised manuscript, our approach utilized both an available RNA-seq dataset <italic>and</italic> integration with existing RefSeq and Ensembl annotations. In the revised manuscript we now provide a better description for comparing the resulting annotations and how they address apparent gaps in RefSeq and Ensembl. From these analyses, we show that the V4.3 annotation includes all instances of genes missing from either RefSeq or Ensembl, including any that may have been left out of V4.2. Therefore, there should be no known zebrafish gene annotations missing from V4.3. It is possible that there are additional novel isoforms and 3' UTRs that are present at later or adult stages and these may be missed. This is now mentioned in the Discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Technically, the comparison of &quot;genes detected in a few tissue-specific datasets with V4.2 to demonstrate sufficient overlap&quot; is essentially what the scRNA-seq experiment demonstrates. It is clear from those analyses on two distinct cell types (cartilage and epidermis) that V4 can capture all of the changes from Ens95 in addition to 20 to 30% more cluster-enriched genes. In the revised manuscript, we also provide additional data supporting increased gene calls across most scRNA-seq clusters when comparing Ens95 and V4.2 in this dataset. We also now provide bulk RNA-seq analysis of non-endothelial cells using a different transgenic line, as well as improved and expanded analysis of overlap between bulk RNA-seq datasets. These all show similar result across multiple diverse cell types (i.e. that V4 can provide more comprehensive detection of genes compared to Ens95 and RefSeq).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that &quot;alternative polyadenylation and differential 3' end use will affect interpretation of gene expression&quot;. If anything, transcriptome annotations with more accurate 3' UTR models, which we believe our annotation captures, will allow more accurate assessment of 3' usage. We would note that accurately capturing alternative polyadenylation and differential 3' UTR usage is highly dependent on stringent technical approaches that reliably capture 3' ends. In any case, given the complexity of this issue, and the increased size of the manuscript due to the need to address other pertinent issues, we have chosen not to extensively discuss this issue, though it is touched upon in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors need to provide statistics and numbers in the text instead of qualifiers such as &quot;much lower&quot;. For example, the authors state &quot;…the overall number of differentially-expressed transcripts identified when using Ensembl was much lower than that found with RefSeq.&quot; The difference is 7%. Another example is &quot;increase in the number of median genes&quot;. How many? (It's 842 vs. 761.) Likewise, the authors need to provide statistics of their annotation. How many genes are detected, what is the length/ exon number distribution of known transcripts vs. XLOC transcripts etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made an effort to provide more quantitative descriptors for this and other analyses in the revised manuscript. Although we would note that numbers and statistical analyses are clearly labeled in the figures and all source data is made available.</p><p>We also now include better metrics regarding gene, transcript and exon numbers for the V4 annotations, including more definitive comparisons with RefSeq and Ensembl, as well as other descriptors of Ens95 and RefSeq annotations (such as CDS, UTR, etc). These are now included in several new tables in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A lot of the analysis methodology is missing and no code is provided. &quot;In-house Perl scripts&quot; need to be made available. What were the criteria for &quot;hand-curation&quot;? The same is true for other methods. For example, the intersection analysis of RefSeq and Ens95 is not clear. What does intersection by gene coordinate mean? Is it exactly matching start/end positions or by interval overlap? The discrepancy of 3000 genes is improbably large.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding comparison between transcriptome annotations, we have revised this section considerably. We now provide a more straightforward analysis using gffcompare, a published approach, to perform transcript-level matching. Notably, this more definitive analysis yields a similar number of missing genes as our initial approach.</p><p>Therefore, our initial assessment was accurate – that each annotation is missing between 2000 to 3000 genes. We now also include perl and python scripts for custom steps in transcript assembly and an improved description of all computational approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other required changes and clarifications:</p><p>1) In Figure 5A, there are 7 cartilage and 9 epidermis genes unique to Ens95 vs. V4.2. Could the authors comment on this? Are these genes bona fide markers of these cell types or false positives? Will the missing genes in V4.2 be incorporated?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, these numbers have shifted slightly since we now utilize common gene identifiers rather than gene symbols. We have also provided potential reasons for the identification of genes specifically by Ens95. These are included in a comments column in Figure 5—source data 1, 2. There are a number of reasons these genes show up only in Ens95, including that they fall just on the cusp of statistical cut-offs or are split into 2 immediately adjacent genes in Ens95, but are a single gene (which is also detected in this cluster) in V4.2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1A, B should be -log.</p></disp-quote><p>The incorrect labeling in this case arose from an issue with the DEbrowser package used for analysis. We have now updated the DEbrowser code and corrected the axis labeling throughout the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, the 6743 genes from RefSeq only in panel A does not correspond to the 6119 genes (2514+3605) analyzed in panel B. Likewise, the 2514 genes from panel B do not correspond to the 2549 genes (2035+514) in panel C. Please correct or explain these discrepancies in gene number.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have replaced this analysis with a more definitive and straightforward transcript-matching approach using gffcompare.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;Comparison of 3' UTRs for matching genes from the two annotations in those latter cases revealed that the overall differences in length were significant (Figure 2C).&quot; Why has a statistical test been performed here? The authors are not randomly sampling from an underlying population of gene models and then measuring the UTR length. They have selected for the ones that are either longer or shorter in Ensembl 95.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has been changed significantly in the revised manuscript. Similar data are now presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. The purpose of these graphs is to illustrate the magnitude of difference between 3' UTR annotations in cases where genes from one or another annotation has a longer 3' UTR. The reviewer is correct in that these data point have already been heuristically classified as &quot;longer&quot; or &quot;shorter&quot; obviating the need for a statistical test for comparison. We have made a note to this effect in the corresponding figure legend and have removed the statistical analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3B: If the Ensembl annotation was merged into V4.2, how can V4.2 have shorter UTRs than Ensembl?</p></disp-quote><p>These are likely cases where there was not sufficient read depth to support inclusion of a longer 3' UTR model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The counting against the two annotations seems oddly inconsistent. For slc2a1a (Figure 1E and Figure 5D) the same exon portion gets 16 reads in Ens95, but only 4 reads in RefSeq.</p></disp-quote><p>The read count in this case is accurate. The actual read depth for <italic>slc2a1a</italic> when including the 3' UTR on V4.3 is &gt;1000. Thus, the level of detection by Ens95 and RefSeq is essentially at the level of noise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is not clear what is meant by this sentence in the legend for Figure 2—figure supplement 1: &quot;Total numbers of unique genes in each case are not equivalent due to cases there (&quot;where&quot; I assume?) multiple genes from either or both annotations may intersect within a single interval.&quot; How many genes does the overlap method fail to distinguish because of this?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, this analysis has been replaced with an improved method of comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) &quot;…all of these genes appear preferentially expressed in the erythroid-2 cluster (Figure 7A)&quot;. slc25a37 and tfr1a are expressed in more cells at higher levels in the erythroid cluster, not erythroid-2.</p></disp-quote><p>Cells positive for these markers are apparent in both clusters, though only a few cells appear to express in the erythroid cluster, while nearly all cells express in erythroid-2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) &quot;…mapped onto the RefSeq annotation&quot;. Mapping is to the assembly not the annotation, so it should either say &quot;mapped to GRCz11 and counted against the RefSeq annotation&quot; or just &quot;counted against the RefSeq annotation&quot;. Same at: &quot;to genome-mapped or ENSEMBL-mapped reads&quot;. The reads aren't mapped to the Ensembl annotation, they are counted against it. This needs changing throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected throughout the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 3 legend.

Are they plotted on top of each other? Jitter might help. Also, what do the genes from the Ens95 counting that don't overlap with the V4.2 ones look like?</p></disp-quote><p>For the measurement of UTR lengths, we only consider those genes that are included in the reference geneset, which is where the 3' UTR lengths are derived. Hence, the number is somewhat reduced from the total shown in the Venn. This was originally mentioned in the figure legend. The number of data points is higher in the revised manuscript due to the increased number of reference genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) https://www.umassmed.edu/lawson-lab/transcriptome gives a 404 error.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this issue.
