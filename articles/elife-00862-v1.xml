Whether distant relatives of the vertebrate TMEM16 families also form CaCCs is an intriguing open question. Here we report that a TMEM16 family member from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, Subdued (CG16718), is a CaCC. Amino acid substitutions of Subdued alter the ion selectivity and kinetic properties of the CaCC channels heterologously expressed in HEK 293T cells. This <italic>Drosophila</italic> channel displays characteristics of classic CaCCs, thereby providing evidence for evolutionarily conserved biophysical properties in the TMEM16 family. Additionally, we show that knockout flies lacking <italic>subdued</italic> gene activity more readily succumb to death caused by ingesting the pathogenic bacteria <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, suggesting that <italic>subdued</italic> has novel functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> host defense.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00862.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00862.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00862.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ions are at the root of most processes that occur in the body, so they must be able to move in and out of cells. However, because they have an electric charge, ions are not usually able to pass through the fatty membrane that encloses all cells. Instead, they must be imported or exported by a variety of dedicated proteins in the cell membrane. These include ion channels – proteins that, under certain conditions, open to form pores – and ion transporters.</p><p>Calcium-activated chloride channels are ion channels that permeate chloride ions when the concentration of calcium ions inside the cell increases. Two important calcium-activated chloride channels in mammals belong to the TMEM16 family of proteins, which is conserved in many organisms. However, to date all the examples of TMEM16 proteins forming calcium-activated chloride channels have been found in vertebrates. Moreover, it is not known how many members of the TMEM16 family can act as ion channels. Wong et al. have now isolated a protein belonging to the TMEM16 family from fruit flies and, in a series of experiments on human cells, showed that it acts as a calcium-activated chloride channel.</p><p>Previous work has shown that fruit flies lacking this protein, which is called Subdued, are more susceptible than wild-type flies to a pathogenic bacterium called <italic>Serratia marrescens</italic>, which implies that the Subdued ion channel might be involved in the immune system. Indeed, Wong et al. found that the mutant flies died more often than wild-type flies after eating these bacteria; the mutant files also had higher levels of the bacteria in their digestive tracts. These results will be of interest to researchers trying to understand how TMEM16 ion channels evolved to be involved in processes as diverse as vision, the secretion of bodily fluids and the immune system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00862.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00862.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>calcium-activated chloride channels</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic> host defense</kwd><kwd>TMEM16 family</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Xiu Ming</given-names></name><name><surname>Younger</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name><name><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>Christian J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Yuh Nung</given-names></name><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Lily Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS069229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Xiu Ming</given-names></name><name><surname>Younger</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name><name><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>Christian J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Yuh Nung</given-names></name><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Lily Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Xiu Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A newly characterized calcium-activated chloride channel has been implicated in the immune system of Drosophila, shedding light on an enigmatic family of transmembrane proteins that are ubiquitous in nature.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>TMEM16A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caputo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2008</xref>) and, a different family member, TMEM16B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pifferi et al., 2009</xref>) encode the classic calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) in various mammalian tissues.

This channel also modulates arterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manoury et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bulley et al., 2012</xref>), tracheal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2012a</xref>), and gastrointestinal smooth muscle tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hwang et al., 2009</xref>), and has been observed to play a role in noxious heat sensing in the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2012</xref>). TMEM16B is expressed in photoreceptor terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stohr et al., 2009</xref>), where CaCCs are hypothesized to stabilize presynaptic membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lalonde et al., 2008</xref>). This channel also gives rise to the majority of recorded CaCC current in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2012b</xref>) and olfactory sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Billig et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Besides TMEM16A and B, only one other mammalian family member, TMEM16F, has been biophysically characterized in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), which begs the question of whether or not the rest of the mammalian TMEM16 family encodes CaCCs (like TMEM16A and B) or small-conductance calcium-activated non-selective cation (SCAN) channels (like TMEM16F).</p><p>Outside of mammals, even less is known about the TMEM16 family. Ubiquitous in eukaryotes, TMEM16 family members regulate a bewildering variety of physiological functions. Ist2p, the single ortholog of the TMEM16 family in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, has been shown to function in endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wolf et al., 2012</xref>). A member of the TMEM16 family in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Axs, is found on the meiotic spindle and regulates meiotic chromosomal segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kramer and Hawley, 2003</xref>). <italic>Xenopus</italic> TMEM16A functions to block polyspermy in fertilized oocytes and is to date the only non-mammalian TMEM16 member described as a CaCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>). We thus have a limited understanding of both the biophysical and functional aspects of the TMEM16 family and whether these properties are evolutionarily conserved.</p><p>In an attempt to uncover TMEM16 family members with CaCC or SCAN channel activity, we cloned and heterologously expressed TMEM16 members from various genetically tractable organisms for electrophysiological inspection. A <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> TMEM16 ortholog, CG16718, was found to be a CaCC upon heterologous expression in HEK 293T cells. In addition, we observe that this channel plays a role in host defense in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a function that has not been previously reported in the TMEM16 family.

At 48 hr post-infection, whole flies were homogenized, and the homogenates were serially diluted and plated on LB agar plates with antibiotic selection. Colony forming units (CFU) were counted on each plate to estimate the number of Db11 bacteria present in the whole fly. Since only live flies were homogenized, this assay reports on the active host response the flies mount against Db11 infection. Significantly higher amounts of Db11 were isolated from knockout flies compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To control for the possibility that the higher titers of bacteria isolated from knockout flies could arise from increased feeding, we performed a feeding assay in which a food dye was introduced into the bacteria/sucrose solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ha et al., 2009</xref>). After 72 hr of feeding, flies were dissected to isolate the intact guts and crop, which were homogenized and analyzed for food dye content as a read-out for food consumption. Knockout fly guts did not contain more food dye and surprisingly, slightly but significantly less food dye was recovered from the guts of knockout compared to the wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, we surmised that the knockout flies are unlikely to consume more food than wild-type flies. Differences in whole animal bacterial titers are thus likely to result from disparities in host defense. To see if bacteria also accumulated more in the guts as well as the whole animal, homogenates obtained from the feeding assay described above were serially diluted and plated on LB agar plates with antibiotic selection. Knockout fly guts had a significantly higher number of CFU of Db11 than wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Since it was reported that injection of latex beads into the hemocoel of Db11-fed flies to impair hemocytic phagocytosis causes significant Db11 proliferation in the hemocoel and adherence of Db11 to the gut wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nehme et al., 2007</xref>), defective hemocoel defenses could also give rise to an apparent increase in the CFU counts from gut dissections. However, homogenate Db11 counts were greatly reduced upon feeding the flies with gentamicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This control reveals no significant contributions of hemocoel-resident Db11 to CFU counts from dissected guts. This result also rules out severe hemocoel defense impairment as an explanation for increased in vivo proliferation of Db11.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we report that Subdued (CG16718), an ortholog of the TMEM16 family in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, is a calcium-activated chloride channel with biophysical properties resembling those of classic CaCCs.</p><p>This channel is activated by internal calcium, with a lower bound of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> = 20 µM in whole cell patch clamp experiments in which current was observed. No significant currents were observed when an EGTA-buffered zero calcium solution was used as the internal solution. Relative to mammalian TMEM16A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), TMEM16B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pifferi et al., 2009</xref>) or <italic>Xenopus</italic> TMEM16A (H Yang, personal communication, March 2013), Subdued is one to two orders of magnitude less calcium sensitive in whole cell patch clamp experiments. This could either reflect a true biophysical property of the channel or could be an indication that the non-native HEK 293T expression system used in our experiments lacks auxiliary subunits required for higher calcium sensitivity. It would be interesting to test if directed mutagenesis of Subdued can tune its calcium sensitivity within the realm of its mammalian and <italic>Xenopus</italic> counterparts.</p><p>Subdued rectifies outwardly, passing larger currents at more positive voltages. The channel permeates mainly chloride with a P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> of 0.16, and preferentially permeates larger anions relative to smaller ones, giving the selectivity series SCN<sup>−</sup> &gt; I<sup>−</sup> &gt; Br<sup>−</sup> &gt; Cl<sup>−</sup>. A Y489H mutation affected the ionic selectivity of the channel, making it more permeable to Na<sup>+</sup>. This suggests that perhaps the Y489 residue is pore lining, or has an allosteric effect on the structure of the pore. The Y489H mutant also gave rise to smaller currents compared to the wild-type channel, a reflection of either decreased unitary channel conductance or decreased membrane expression. Additionally, a Q672K mutation produced a dramatic slowing of activation kinetics, a phenomenon also observed when mutating the corresponding residue in mammalian TMEM16F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). The observation that mutations to Subdued alter the properties of the currents strongly points to this protein as a pore-forming subunit of the recorded CaCCs.</p><p>Pharmacologically, Subdued is not blocked by the CaCC blockers NFA, FFA, NPPB or T16Ainh-A01. This might arise from structural differences in Subdued, perhaps in the pore, relative to its mammalian and <italic>Xenopus</italic> counterparts. However benzbromarone blocks Subdued significantly and could potentially be used to interrogate the location and properties of the channel pore. In conclusion, as a distantly related TMEM16 family member, Subdued will be useful as a tool in structure/function studies to parse out conserved or divergent biophysical properties such as calcium- and voltage-dependent gating, permeation and ion selectivity.</p><p>To study the function of the channel in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we generated <italic>subdued</italic> knockout strains. Confirming results from a previous genome-wide RNAi study, the knockout was found to be more susceptible to gut infection by a strain of <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, Db11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cronin et al., 2009</xref>). An earlier study proposed that the cause of lethality is bacterial proliferation leading to invasion of the gut tissue and subsequent gut distension and escape of bacteria into the hemolymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nehme et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In the case of the <italic>subdued</italic> knockout, susceptibility arises, at least in part, from deficient host defense, since in vivo proliferation of Db11 was higher in knockout fly guts as well as in the whole animal as compared to wild-type flies. Additionally, we observed that slightly but significantly less food dye was recovered from the guts of the knockout flies. This might arise from lower food consumption by knockout flies, but could also be an indication of increased gut tissue damage due to greater numbers of Db11 in the gut, leading to leakage and diffusion of food dye into the hemolymph. It remains to be determined if higher Db11 titers in the whole animal also result from defective immune responses within the hemolymph. Tissue-specific RNAi of <italic>subdued</italic> using gut or hemocytes drivers did not recapitulate the whole animal RNAi phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cronin et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that Subdued is likely to exert its protective function in a multitude of tissues.</p><p>One potential function for Subdued is in the regulation of the secretion of cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a process that occurs widely on epithelial surfaces and is known to play critical roles in host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). This hypothesis is consistent with the abundant mRNA expression of <italic>subdued</italic> in various epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chintapalli et al., 2007</xref>). The susceptibility observed in the <italic>subdued</italic> knockout flies could also be a consequence of a deficiency in dual oxidase (DUOX)–mediated immunity. The DUOX system is reported to be critical in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ha et al., 2005</xref>). This study reported that strong antimicrobial ROS species are generated by the peroxidase homology domain (PHD) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> DUOX in a chloride-dependent manner. These ROS species are likely to be the highly reactive hypohalites OCl or OSCN, the in vivo production of which requires trans-epithelial anion transport. Additionally, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> DUOX system has also been shown to mobilize downstream of the Gαq-coupled signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ha et al., 2009</xref>), implicating other calcium-dependent responses in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response. Following Db11 infection of <italic>subdued</italic> knockouts, it is possible that Gαq receptor stimulation fails to elicit sufficient amounts of halide transport onto gut epithelia due to a deficiency in CaCCs, reducing PHD-mediated generation of antimicrobial hypohalites and leading to increased bacterial proliferation and higher lethality.</p><p>There remains the possibility that subtle structural deficits also contribute to the susceptibility of <italic>subdued</italic> knockouts to Db11 infection. Developmental defects in gut epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonnay et al., 2013</xref>) or the peritrophic matrix lining the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuraishi et al., 2011</xref>) might result in the susceptibility phenotype. The <italic>subdued</italic> knockout flies did not have significant defects in gut epithelial polarity and integrity under basal conditions as assessed by immunostaining for Armadillo and Discs Large (Dlg) to observe adherens and septate junction structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tepass et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hortsch and Margolis, 2003</xref>) (data not shown). However, Subdued might function in gut epithelial or peritrophic matrix integrity only upon Db11 challenge to the gut, a possibility that will be explored in future study.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>CG16718 was subcloned from BDGP <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gene Collection cDNA clone LD10322, which yields the ORF of the RA splice variant of CG16718.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers find this work to be well performed and well written. In particular, the characterization of the gene product as a Ca-activated Chloride channel is very convincing. There are substantial issues raised with the immunity angle that need to be addressed through further experimentation for the paper to be acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>. The following is a summary of the reviewers’ concerns that need to be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) It is not fully clear whether this channel is involved in resistance or tolerance to infection. While the apparent increase in the gut microbial titer may suggest a resistance function in the gut, quite possibly through DUOX as discussed by the authors, a similar phenotype might be achieved by a defective cellular immune response. It could be that exponentially proliferating bacteria in the hemocoel stick to the outside of the gut and thus lead to the mistaken impression of an increased titer in the gut lumen (see Table S2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nehme et al., 2007</xref>). One easy control to test for this possibility would be to feed flies for 24 hr first with Serratia and then with gentamicin and thereafter determine the bacterial titer. If it drops to nil, then there is no systemic infection.</p><p>2) A recent publication in Cell from the group of Won-Jae Lee describes a HOCl-specific dye, R19S, to monitor DUOX induction. A simple staining experiment will allow the authors to test their hypothesis about a requirement for Subdued in DUOX function.</p><p>3) The authors need to show an important control for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> feeding flies with killed <italic>S. marcescens</italic> and monitoring survival.</p><p>4) It is unclear from the report where the site of action may be. Is the gene product expressed in the gut? An antibody is probably not available, but tissue specific FISH techniques are very sensitive with current technology and can easily demonstrate expression.</p><p>5) The authors mention in passing that an RNAi does not give a phenotype in a limited number of tissues tested. This needs to be settled better by A: demonstrating that the existing RNAi indeed functions.

A simple staining experiment will allow the authors to test their hypothesis about a requirement for Subdued in DUOX function</italic>.</p><p>The suggested DUOX induction experiment was performed as described in the above mentioned paper. Dissecting about 20 guts per experiment (n=3), we observed a statistically non-significant trend (p=0.07, unpaired t-test) of reduced DUOX induction in the knockout flies. A feeding assay showed a slight trend towards higher feeding for the knockout flies (5 guts, n=3) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref> below). Thus, even though the knockout flies may have consumed a greater amount of uracil, they appear to display less DUOX induction. However in our hands, high background fluorescence was observed from flies fed with only uracil and not the R19S dye. This occurred despite feeding the flies sucrose solution for a few days after eclosion and pre-starving them for 18 hr on water to reduce auto-fluorescence from normal food. Normalizing to this background, we were only able to observe less than half the number of ROS-positive guts as compared to what has been previously reported for the wildtype control (70%). This technical problem has rendered it difficult to ascertain a statistically significant reduction of DUOX induction by uracil in knockout flies. By retaining a discussion of the hypothesis of a requirement for Subdued in DUOX function, we hope to stimulate future studies that may yield more definitive assessments of this possibility.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-00862-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p><italic>3) The authors need to show an important control for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref> <italic>feeding flies with killed</italic> S. marcescens <italic>and monitoring survival</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the control experiment as suggested and added the data as Figure 5–figure supplement 1.</p><p><italic>4) It is unclear from the report where the site of action may be.

An antibody is probably not available, but tissue specific FISH techniques are very sensitive with current technology and can easily demonstrate expression</italic>.</p><p>We attempted to raise an antibody, but as the reviewers have anticipated, we could not establish the specificity of the antibody generated. One impediment we encountered while attempting antibody/fluorescence-based methods of establishing the expression pattern and level of <italic>subdued</italic> was the high autofluorescence in the gut, as well as the tendency for non-specific adherence of antibodies to the gut wall. These limitations apply equally to FISH-based methods. We decided to perform RT-PCR and quantitative PCR to show that the gene is indeed expressed in the gut and included the data as Figure 5–figure supplement 3.</p><p><italic>5) The authors mention in passing that an RNAi does not give a phenotype in a limited number of tissues tested. This needs to be settled better by A: demonstrating that the existing RNAi indeed functions. And B: using a more extensive tissue specific set of drivers to determine the site of action</italic>.</p><p>To validate the results from the genome-wide RNAi screen performed by Cronin et al., very early on in the project we performed RNAi with commercially available lines, prior to the generation of the CG16718 knockout flies. There were a few issues that were raised by the RNAi data.</p><p>Firstly, when we used a ubiquitous Gal4 driver (in this case tubulin-Gal4; Bloomington stock #5138) to drive RNAi we noticed a uniform and prominent curly wing phenotype not present in either parent stock. An actin-Gal4 driver also produced this wing phenotype, but in this case it became impossible to distinguish actin-Gal4/RNAi from actin-Gal4/CyO progeny. The curly wing phenotype was not present in flies bearing deletion of the CG16718 gene and the neighboring CG6231 gene that were generated by crossing two overlapping deficiency lines (Bloomington stocks #7663 and #27,379), nor was the curly wing phenotype observed in the FLP-recombinase generated knockout fly reported in the main manuscript. This raised concerns of either off-target effects of the RNAi construct, or background mutations in the RNAi stock (VDRC #v37472), casting doubt on the reliability of further RNAi experiments.</p><p>Secondly, our preliminary experiments showed that tissue-specific-Gal4/RNAi did not seem to have an effect. Gal4 drivers for fat body, hemocyte, gut and Malpighian tubules were used. In an attempt to maximize Gal4 activity, the experiment was repeated with different pre-assay incubation temperatures (25 or 29°C) and times (2 or 4 days) for the flies, but the observed trends were qualitatively the same (representative figure shown below: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>). Multiple enhancer trap lines for expression in different segments of the Malpighian tubules were used but none led to any significantly reduced survival, thus for simplicity a representative Gal4 line (that also drives gut expression) is shown in the figure below. The tubulin-Gal4/RNAi results showed consistent susceptibility relative to either tubulin-Gal4 or RNAi only control, indicating that we might be observing a true phenotype (hence we proceeded to generate a genetic knockout). From tissue-specific RNAi experiments, we surmised that either the gene exerts its protective function in a tissue type we did not anticipate, or that it functions in multiple sets of tissues with redundant functions in host defense, thus knocking it down in only one or two sets of tissues was insufficient to recapitulate the whole body phenotype.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-00862-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
