hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) found in a specialized microenvironment called the niche. Many different niche cell types support HSPCs, however how they interact and their ultrastructure has been difficult to define. Here, we show that single endogenous HSPCs can be tracked by light microscopy, then identified by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) at multiscale levels. Using the zebrafish larval kidney marrow (KM) niche as a model, we followed single fluorescently labeled HSPCs by light sheet microscopy, then confirmed their exact location in a 3D SBEM dataset. We found a variety of different configurations of HSPCs and surrounding niche cells, suggesting there could be functional heterogeneity in sites of HSPC lodgement. Our approach also allowed us to identify dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dbh) positive ganglion cells as a previously uncharacterized functional cell type in the HSPC niche. By integrating multiple imaging modalities, we could resolve the ultrastructure of single rare cells deep in live tissue and define all contacts between an HSPC and its surrounding niche cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hematopoietic stem cell</kwd><kwd>stem cell niche</kwd><kwd>microenvironment</kwd><kwd>light sheet microscopy</kwd><kwd>dopamine beta-hydroxylase</kwd><kwd>serial section block-face scanning electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>correlative light and electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>SBEM</kwd><kwd>CLEM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL142998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamplin</surname><given-names>Owen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01DK103908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamplin</surname><given-names>Owen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19POST34380221</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agarwala</surname><given-names>Sobhika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U24NS120055-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24 GM137200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Society of Hematology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Junior Faculty Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamplin</surname><given-names>Owen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multiple imaging modalities resolved the ultrastructure of single hematopoietic stem cells in their endogenous niche, allowing identification of dopamine beta-hydroxylase positive cells as a functional niche cell type.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) give rise to all blood cell types throughout the life of an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orkin and Zon, 2008</xref>). HSPCs reside in a complex microenvironment called the niche that is made up of many different kinds of support cells, including various types of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pinho and Frenette, 2019</xref>). However, our understanding of HSPC interactions with niche cells has been limited to low-resolution light microscopy. Recently developed transgenic reporter lines have allowed identification of well-defined endogenous HSPCs in both mouse and zebrafish model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christodoulou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>). The dynamic behavior of HSPCs in the niche of mouse and zebrafish can be observed using live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bixel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christodoulou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itkin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koechlein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lo Celso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spencer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, it remains challenging to observe HSPC-niche interactions at high resolution. Certain events during hematopoietic ontogeny, such as the colonization of the fetal bone marrow, have so far only been studied in fixed tissues because they are difficult to access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coşkun et al., 2014</xref>). Our goal is to better define the ultrastructure of single endogenous HSPCs deep in niche tissue.</p><p>We have taken advantage of the transparency and external development of the zebrafish larva to study the earliest migration events of HSPCs into the presumptive adult kidney marrow (KM) niche. We considered using two different correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karreman et al., 2016</xref>) to resolve the ultrastructure of HSPCs. For the first approach, to confirm cell identity we used a label-based approach similar to what was done using an APEX2-Venus-CAAX fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirabayashi et al., 2018</xref>) that could be visualized both with light microscopy and high contrast in EM imaging. A similar method was applied in zebrafish using an APEX-GBP (<underline>G</underline>FP <underline>B</underline>inding <underline>P</underline>rotein) fusion to resolve GFP<sup>+</sup> transgene expression on electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ariotti et al., 2015</xref>). Building on these previous studies, we used genetically encoded APEX2 engineered peroxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lam et al., 2015</xref>), together with a fluorescent protein, to track single HSPCs as they migrated into and lodged in the larval KM during the earliest colonization stages. For the second approach, we used improved software alignments to merge datasets across different imaging platforms and could correlate single cells without the need for endogenous labels. We found clusters of HSPCs around the glomerulus as previously described, as well as single HSPCs lodged in a perivascular niche. The heterogeneity between sites of HSPC lodgement and their surrounding niche cells supports the model that functionally distinct sites exist within the hematopoietic microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). These large 3D CLEM datasets also allowed us to identify previously uncharacterized dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dbh) positive ganglion-like cells in the larval kidney niche that were in direct contact with HSPCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Colonization of the larval kidney niche by circulating HSPCs</title><p>To characterize the larval kidney HSPC niche in the zebrafish, we first wanted to determine the location of all HSPCs in the anterior KM. We used HSPC-specific Runx:mCherry<sup>+</sup> transgenic zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>) that were fixed at 5 days post fertilization (dpf) for anti-mCherry immunofluorescence, then optically cleared using benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate (BABB). This technique allowed visualization and quantification of all mCherry<sup>+</sup> HSPCs in the larvae. We observed bilateral clusters of ~50 HSPCs, for a total of ~100 HSPCs, in the region of the anterior KM at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). During early HSPC colonization of the KM at 4 dpf we observed ~50 total HSPCs, which increased by ~100% from 4 to 5–6 dpf, and then again by ~50% from 5–6 to 7–8 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We performed phospho-histone H3 (PH3) antibody labeling to determine if HSPCs were highly proliferative. On average, we only found one to two mitotic HSPCs in the KM at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F-J</xref>). Previous studies of hematopoietic cells in the larval KM at 7 dpf also showed low levels of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Rooijen et al., 2009</xref>). These data suggest that the increase in HSPC numbers during the early stages of KM colonization results from arrival via circulation, that is HSPCs that originated in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) and dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murayama et al., 2006</xref>), and not extensive proliferation of resident HSPCs.</p><p>To follow the dynamics of HSPC colonization in the KM niche, we performed time-lapse live imaging at 4 and 5 dpf. Although the early zebrafish larva is transparent, imaging live KM using point scanning confocal microscopy is challenging due to the relatively slow acquisition time and depth of the tissue. To rapidly capture HSPC colonization events throughout the entire depth of the larval KM, we performed light sheet fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huisken and Stainier, 2009</xref>). Using this technique, we could rapidly acquire a Z stack through the entire KM in less than 30 s (&gt;200 slices with 1 μm spacing). Consistent with our observations of fixed embryos, a depth-coded projection of light sheet time-lapse images showed bilateral Runx:mCherry<sup>+</sup> HSPC clusters (‘green’ cells on left and ‘blue’ cells on right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Together with the cdh17:GFP reporter line for pronephric tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>), we localized Runx:mCherry<sup>+</sup> HSPCs within the anterior kidney region, mediolateral to the proximal pronephric tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To determine the location of these HSPC clusters relative to the vasculature, we imaged HSPC-specific Runx:mCherry together with the flk:ZsGreen vascular-specific transgenic reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cross et al., 2003</xref>). HSPC clusters were located between lateral dorsal aortae and cardinal veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Light sheet live imaging of the KM niche at 5 dpf allowed us to directly visualize the locations and dynamics of early HSPC niche colonization.</p><p>To observe the interaction between single HSPCs as they arrive in the larval KM niche, we imaged the Runx:GFP transgenic line together with flk:mCherry to label vessels (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). As previously described, Runx:GFP is a more restricted marker of HSPCs and is expressed in the cytoplasm, allowing cellular morphology to be resolved, while Runx:mCherry more broadly labels the progenitor pool and is only localized to the nucleus, making it more appropriate for quantifying single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Upon arrival within the anterior kidney region, rare circulating Runx:GFP<sup>+</sup> HSPCs were seen interacting with and lodging in the perivascular niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We resolved single lodged HSPCs surrounded by ECs in a pocket-like structure, as we observed previously in the zebrafish CHT and mouse fetal liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) lodge in a perivascular region of the larval kidney niche.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Snapshot of single optical sections (XY, XZ, YZ planes) from light sheet live image of a Runx:GFP;flk:mCherry double transgenic zebrafish larva.

One approach to analyze the ultrastructure of an entire region of tissue is serial section electron microscopy (EM), a technique that has been used to resolve the projectome of the complete zebrafish larval brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hildebrand et al., 2017</xref>). We previously used CLEM based on anatomical landmarks to match the position of fluorescently labeled HSPCs in the CHT niche between confocal and SBEM datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>). However, we found this approach was difficult to apply in the KM because the tissue is much larger and denser than the CHT (Cell Image Library [CIL] accession numbers CIL:54845 and CIL:54850). To confirm precise correlation of single cells between light and EM imaging modalities, we developed two distinct approaches depending on the goals of the experiment. In Workflow #1, we wanted to track lodgement of HSPCs in the larval KM niche using time-lapse live imaging, followed by high-contrast DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) staining with genetically encoded APEX2 to label single endogenous HSPCs in EM sections. In Workflow #2, we wanted to correlate the position of fluorescently labeled cells in existing transgenic reporter lines across confocal and EM datasets. Using these workflows, we were able to observe HSPC lodgement in the KM, then resolve the ultrastructure of those same cells together with the surrounding niche.</p><p>The first step in Workflow #1 was to generate a transgenic construct that expressed mCherry for light microscopy, and APEX2 as a genetic tag that allowed electron-dense contrast on target subcellular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our rationale was that mCherry<sup>+</sup> HSPCs are also APEX2<sup>+</sup> and will be identifiable by both fluorescence imaging and EM, respectively. We fused APEX2 with H2B and mito tags for localization to the nucleus and the mitochondrial matrix, respectively. To drive expression of this construct in HSPCs, we cloned these elements under control of the <italic>draculin</italic> (<italic>drl</italic>) promoter, generating the <italic>drl:mito-APEX2_p2A_APEX2-H2B_p2A_mCherry</italic> transgene, hereafter referred to as <italic>drl:APEX2-mCherry</italic>.

A short time-lapse was performed to confirm an HSPC was lodged in the KM and not circulating (~30 min; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). Single lodged HSPCs could be identified relative to the surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and larvae were immediately fixed after imaging.

This allowed us to characterize the different configurations of many individual HSPCs and their surrounding niche cells, as well as compare these data from an established HSPC-specific reporter line with our other datasets. After brief fixation we could still see a small cluster of cd41:GFP<sup>+</sup> HSPCs in the region of the anterior KM niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Confocal imaging was performed on a thick 100 μm vibratome section after DRAQ5 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Interestingly, extensive tracing of putative HSPCs in the SBEM dataset revealed an additional seven cells that were not well defined by their GFP signal in the confocal dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These putative HSPCs were all deeper in the sample, so were either GFP<sup>-</sup> or not detected because of low GFP signal.</p><p>All 17 putative HSPCs in the larval KM niche (GFP<sup>+</sup>, GFP<sup>-</sup>, or GFP<sup>low</sup>) were classified based on their location (i.e., within a hematopoietic cluster, vessel lumen, or perivascular niche), and by their cellular contacts (i.e., EC, MSC, HSPC, etc.). These data were summarized together with all putative HSPCs found by SBEM in this study (n=22; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Regardless of their location, all putative HSPCs were in contact with between 2 and 6 ECs. Strikingly, 50% of putative HSPCs were in contact with a single MSC (n=11/22; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), similar to what we found by light microscopy in the larval KM niche (60% cd41:GFP<sup>+</sup> HSPCs in contact with cxcl12:DsRed2<sup>+</sup> MSC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and previously in the CHT (60% Runx:GFP<sup>+</sup> HSPCs in contact with cxcl12:DsRed2<sup>+</sup> MSC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>).

Considering all our SBEM data together (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), we have also identified considerable heterogeneity between the different structural configurations of a single HSPC and its surrounding niche cells. This suggests that there could be functional heterogeneity as well between different sites of hematopoiesis in the microenvironment.

We confirmed the efficacy of the drug treatment by reduced locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2014</xref>) of the larvae (data not shown). A previous study indicated that disrupting dopamine signaling during early stages of development (five somite stage to 30 hours post fertilization (hpf)) resulted in reduced HSPC numbers within the CHT at 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kwan et al., 2016</xref>). Since our aim was to examine the effect of disrupting dopamine signaling on HSPCs during KM niche colonization, we treated larvae with 6-OHDA from 4 to 5 dpf during KM niche colonization. We observed a significant reduction in the number of Runx:mCherry<sup>+</sup> HSPCs within the niche after treatment with this dopaminergic cell neurotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>Last, we validated the presence of dbh<sup>+</sup> cells within the KM niche by confocal imaging of dbh:GFP<sup>+</sup> transgenic larva, followed by SBEM, and then correlation of the two datasets using our CLEM approach to analyze any GFP<sup>+</sup> transgenic line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>; Workflow #2). dbh:GFP<sup>+</sup> cells aligned with ganglion-like cells in the KM niche. We identified one ganglion-like cell in contact with a lodged cell that morphologically resembled an HSPC, with the caveat that this cell lacks an independent marker of HSPC identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1 fig7video2">Figure 7—videos 1; 2</xref>). We have confirmed that dbh<sup>+</sup> ganglion-like cells are present in the larval KM niche and are in direct contact with putative HSPCs. Furthermore, we used a small molecule approach to functionally test the role of dopamine signaling in HSPC colonization of the larval KM niche.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We developed two novel CLEM workflows to study the ultrastructure of HSPCs in the larval KM niche. In the first (Workflow #1), we used a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter (i.e., mCherry) together with APEX2 that produces a high-contrast label in SBEM. An advantage of this approach was that we could label specific organelles with a dark stain on EM sections (e.g., mitochondria and nuclei). In a second approach (Workflow #2), we could use any GFP<sup>+</sup> transgenic line to match the position of a single labeled cell across confocal and EM platforms. In all of the SBEM datasets, we could also identify putative unlabeled HSPCs based on their distinct size and morphology (i.e., 6–7 μm diameter, round, ruffled membrane, large nucleus, scant cytoplasm). In all datasets, lodged putative HSPCs made similar contacts with niche cells: two to six ECs, zero or one MSC, and sometimes a red blood cell, another HSPC, and/or a ganglion-like cell. Strikingly, all of these niche cells could simultaneously contact a single HSPC. This highlights the complexity of signals that an HSPC could receive, as well as the challenges ahead to resolve the functional significance of each contact on stem cell regulation.</p><p>In the zebrafish larva, dbh<sup>+</sup> sympathetic ganglion cells are found in the larval KM region at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stewart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stewart et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). We considered that these cells could be the ganglion-like cells that we found in direct contact with HSPCs. We used additional rounds of CLEM to confirm that dbh:GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were adjacent to HSPCs in the perivascular KM niche. Chemical inhibition of dbh during KM colonization significantly reduced the number of lodged HSPCs. Our findings are consistent with the established role for neuronal regulation of HSPCs in zebrafish and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agarwala and Tamplin, 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, these dbh<sup>+</sup> cells originate from the same neural crest lineage as a subtype of fetal bone marrow MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Isern et al., 2014</xref>). Together, our results have demonstrated that CLEM is a viable approach to identify single rare stem cells deep in live tissue, and that 3D models of a stem cell in its niche built from SBEM data provides a complete picture of stem cell-niche interactions.</p><p>The identification and characterization of endogenous stem cells in complex tissues remains extremely challenging. Taking advantage of the transparent zebrafish larva and light sheet imaging, we found it possible to track a single putative HSPC deep in live tissue. We directly observed the larval KM niche during the earliest stages of HSPC colonization (4–5 dpf). This is comparable to HSPC seeding of the fetal bone marrow in mammals. Multiple HSPC-specific reporter lines (e.g., cd41:GFP, Runx:GFP, Runx:mCherry), as well as transient labeling using the <italic>drl</italic> promoter, all marked putative HSPCs in clusters adjacent to the glomerulus, lodged in perivascular regions, or in the lumen of vessels. Many of these perivascular HSPCs were found in pockets of ECs and adjacent or in contact with MSCs, similar to what we previously observed in the CHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>). HSPCs found in a vessel lumen were in contact with two to three ECS, while those in clusters or the perivascular niche were in contact with three to six ECs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We found that these HSPC-EC contacts were positive for the tight junction marker ZO-1. Interestingly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> equivalent occludin junctions have been found to regulate niche interactions with hematopoietic cells and germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fairchild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khadilkar et al., 2017</xref>). Approximately 50% of putative HSPCs identified in SBEM datasets were in contact with a single MSC, while contact of HSPCs with other putative HSPCs and/or red blood cells was more variable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Taking all our data together, we only found three examples of putative HSPCs in contact with ganglion-like cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and none of these were in HSPC clusters adjacent to the glomerulus. This suggests that there is heterogeneity between sites of HSPC lodgement in the niche, although more definitive conclusions about the degree of heterogeneity will depend on more replicate samples acquired in future studies.</p><p>A major outstanding question is if our observed structural heterogeneity between HSPC locations in the niche also indicates functional heterogeneity. This would result in differential regulation of HSPCs depending on the combination of surrounding niche cells. For example, the 1:1 attachment of an HSPC to an MSC that we observe for 50–60% of HSPCs could regulate quiescence vs. expansion. In our previous studies of the CHT, the MSC appeared to provide an anchor for symmetric vs. asymmetric HSPC divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>). The CHT of the zebrafish differs from the fetal liver because there is not the massive exponential expansion of HSPCs required to sustain the mammalian embryo in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumaravelu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike mammalian embryos, zebrafish embryos develop externally and can survive for many days with no definitive hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). We do not know if the HSPCs that transit through the CHT to the KM have equal potential to become long-term quiescent hematopoietic stem cells, or if there is already heterogeneity within the HSPC pool. Some HSPCs may be fated to produce the blood lineages required during development, while others may retain their quiescence as they transit through the CHT to the KM. Although we do not have the genetic tools yet to functionally distinguish between different sites of HSPC lodgement within the larval KM niche, we are developing a labeling approach that would make this possible. Recent studies showed that subtypes of ECs within the vasculature of the mouse bone marrow microenvironment provide different regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). It will be fascinating to unravel how heterogeneity of the HSPC pool interacts with heterogeneity of different sites within the niche, and ultimately decides the functional output of HSPCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care</title><p>Adult zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were maintained at 28°C on a 14 hr:10 hr light:dark cycle.

The KM was illuminated with a light sheet from one axis, and fluorescence was detected at a perpendicular axis. Larvae were imaged with a ×20 objective using the Zeiss Light sheet Z.1 for Single Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM). The capillary tube was inserted into the sample chamber to release the larva into the chamber containing E3 while remaining attached to the capillary tube through the agarose layer. The larva was rotated such that the lateral surface of the larva closer to the edge of the agarose layer was perpendicular to the detection objective to optimize fluorescence detection. The laser path was aligned to illuminate the KM from one axis. Z stacks were acquired through the entire KM with 1 µm spacing in less than 1 min and time-lapse videos were recorded to track the circulating HSPCs entering the KM.

Imaris was used to count the number of cells within the KM niche. Imaris ‘Spot’ module was used first to specify the ROI around the KM in confocal images followed by automated counting of the spots generated corresponding to the single HSPCs. The accuracy of the spots generated was further confirmed by using the manual mode of ‘Spot’ function. ‘Co-localization’ feature on Imaris was used to identify PH3/mCherry double positive cells. Distances between HSPCs and niche cells were measured in 3D light sheet image volumes using Imaris. In microCT datasets, ImageJ/Fiji was used to orient and define the ROI that was trimmed and then scanned by SBEM. The ‘Add image to’ function in Imaris was used to add a light sheet or confocal dataset to an already open SBEM dataset, followed by alignment of both datasets in three dimensions, first using gross anatomical markers (e.g., somites, vessels), then single cells and/or nuclei as reference. Orthogonal views through the two datasets in the XY, YZ, and XZ planes were used to confirm the alignment. After alignment of light microscopy and SBEM datasets, single putative HSPCs and their surrounding niche cells were manually traced in high-resolution SBEM datasets using IMOD software. Separate objects were defined by drawing contours around the plasma membrane of the target cell (and sometimes nuclei) as it moved slice by slice in the Z plane. Individual contours were meshed with <italic>imodmesh</italic> to reveal 3D reconstructions of the cells of interest. In this way, HSPCs, ECs, MSCs, GLs, and their nuclei were identified and represented in the 3D model. Fluorescent image levels and background were adjusted, using the default ‘background subtraction’ (Imaris), threshold adjustment, and/or brightness/contrast adjustment (Fiji/ImageJ, Imaris, Zeiss Zen, Adobe Photoshop). Imaris was used to define ‘Spots’ in the cd41:GFP<sup>+</sup> CLEM dataset using default settings, except ‘Spot Detection’ was set to: Estimated XY diameter: 3.00 μm; model PSF-elongation along Z axis ‘ON’, estimated Z diameter: 6.00 μm; background subtraction ‘ON’.

Confocal images of GFP and DRAQ5 signals were collected on a Leica SPE II confocal microscope with a 20x oil-immersion objective lens using 488 and 633 nm excitation. Following, the samples were preincubated in 2.5 mM DAB solution (25.24 mM stock in 0.1 M HCl) in 0.15 M CB for 30 min on ice. Next, the photo-oxidation of DAB by DRAQ5 was done in 2.5 mM DAB in 0.15 M CB using a solar simulator (Spectra-Physics 92191-1000 solar simulator with 1600 W mercury arc lamp and two Spectra-Physics SP66239-3767 dichroic mirrors to remove infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths), while bubbling oxygen in the solution.

MicroCT volumes were generated from a tilt series of 2401 projections using XMReconstructor (Xradia). SBEM were accomplished using Merlin SEM (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a Gatan 3View system and a focal nitrogen gas injection setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deerinck et al., 2018</xref>). This system allowed the application of nitrogen gas precisely over the blockface of ROI during imaging with high vacuum to maximize the SEM image resolution. Even a minimal accumulation of charge on the specimen surface resulted in poor image quality and distortions in the non-conductive biological samples. This could happen through 3000 sequential images of the charge-prone zebrafish blockface due to image jitter. Deerinck et al. recently introduced a new approach to SBEM that uses focal nitrogen gas injection over the sample block surface to eliminate the charging, while allowing the high vacuum to be maintained in the specimen chamber, resulting in a tremendous improvement in image resolution, even with specimens that were not intensely heavy-metal stained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deerinck et al., 2018</xref>). Images were acquired in 3 kV accelerating voltage and 0.5 µs dwell time; Z step size was 70 nm; raster size was 30k × 18k and Z dimension was ~3000 image samples. Volumes were collected using 40% nitrogen gas injection to samples under high vacuum. Once volumes were collected, the histograms for the slices throughout the volume stack were normalized to correct for drift in image intensity during acquisition. Digital micrograph files (.dm4) were normalized and then converted to MRC format. The stacks were converted to eight bit and volumes were manually traced for reconstruction using IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Illinois at Chicago (Protocol ACC 19-051) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Protocol M006348).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-64835-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>SBEM datasets have been deposited in the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research (NCMIR) publicly accessible resource database Cell Image Library (CIL).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anne Schmidt (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Three reviewers (including myself) have now carefully read and considered your manuscript, and we all agree that it presents a very interesting study and a technical tour de force establishing multimodal imaging of HSPC niches in the zebrafish kidney, nicely combining confocal microscopy, light sheet microscopy and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy. The results achieved are interesting but still overall preliminary and we agree that major revisions should be completed prior to final publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main points of agreement are the following:</p><p>1) Multiple different lines of fish are used to highlight HSPCs, but since their signals do not overlap, it is hard to come to a definitive conclusion of what cells are analysed each time. It seems that Runx1:GFP would be the best line to use, but it is actually the least used. CD41:GFP is used in some analyses too and especially in the validation of the APEX transgenic line (though not shown).</p><p>2) Only two examples of HSCPs surrounded by the 7 cells niche are presented. Is this the case for all HSPCs, or what sort of variation is observed? Variation would be expected given the reporters used are marking HSPCs rather than primitive HSCs, and therefore a heterogeneous population. In general, more data should be presented and statistically analysed to support the conclusions presented.</p><p>3) APEX signal is not always shown, but should be used to unequivocally identify the cell presented.</p><p>4) In figure 2 ZO-1 does not look particularly enriched around Cherry positive cells, and the relative conclusions should be rephrased.</p><p>5) Scale bars are not always clear, and a number of figure panels are hard to read (see specific comments). The same applies to multiple videos.</p><p>6) One point to be better discussed is how the Authors reconcile the similar organisation of CHT and KM niches, when functionally they are very different, ie they support rapidly expanding and more quiescent HSPCs, respectively.</p><p>7) Is it the case that there are two anatomically and functionally distinct niches in the KM, the glomerular and perivascular one? The functional difference needs to be proven. One possibility would be to identify differential influence of dopamine on these two niches.<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>ED1A. Could some contrast indicating the glomerulous and tubules be shown?</p><p>ED1I. Please show average and error bars rather than the summarised pie chart.</p><p>Video 1 is very hard to follow as cells and structures move significantly from one frame to the next.</p><p>Video 2. Perhaps the more novel finding is that most of the interactions are relatively short lived. This should be at least noted and commented on.</p><p>Figure 2C. Why CD41gfp and not Runx1:GFP? DsRed resolution is not sufficient to rule out that each HSPC is in touch with just one MSC.</p><p>Line 106. Most other HSPCs were within 1 cell diameter: 4 vs 8 are further.</p><p>The characterization of the new transgenic fish line needs to be more precise and better shown. How can there be 1 or 2 HSPC/EC pockets, but many more HSPC clusters? IS there a functional difference between the single cells in EC pockets and the cells in clusters?</p><p>It is explained that the APEX-cherry cells are identified as also GFP+ in CD41+ fish (why not Runx-GFP?), but there is no CD41-GFP in Figure 3. Are the APEX-cherry cells truly HSPCs?</p><p>Figure 5. How many HSPCs are observed in this kind of niche in how many fish? The reporters used are not very strict for primitive HSPCs and variability would be expected and should be shown. At the moment it cannot be claimed that 'HSPCs lodge in a highly ordered multicellular niche'.</p><p>Figure 7 and 8. APEX staining is missing but CLEM is equally completed. Is APEX necessary then?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Agarwala S et al., is a very nice and interesting study and a technical tour de force to establish CLEM as an approach to study the stem cell niche composition. The authors use a variety of genetic reporters in zebrafish and multimodal imaging, comprising confocal and light sheet microscopy, microCT and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) to study the initial stages of hematopoiesis in the developing kidney marrow. The results suggest that the approach is &quot;doable&quot; and can provide qualitative and descriptive information, therefore significantly adding to the field. Among the initial description provided by this technology is the identification of several cell types that might have niche function for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the kidney marrow, including endothelial cells, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), sympathetic neurons and glial cells, resembling the results obtained by other groups in the mouse bone marrow. However, the data provided is essentially very nice images of individual HSCs or few cells that might well be representative examples, but a systematic study providing quantitative information and analysis to support the conclusions seems to be lacking. It is not clear how many zebrafish have been used in each experiment to obtain conclusions, as many images focus on a single HSPC. In fact, n numbers are only indicated in Figure 8, where 3 biological replicates have been studies. The conclusions would require additional experiments and statistical analysis of the results. Other comments are below:</p><p>1) The authors indicate that Runx:GFP is a better HSPC marker than Runx:mCherry. Yet the data with Runx:GFP are scarce. Runx:GFP is only used in Figure 1 and the less specific Runx:mCherry is used in the other main figures. Figure 1 also lacks quantification. How many HSPCs are surrounded by how many endothelial cells? Where are GFP+ cells located in relationship to other niche cells?</p><p>2) The authors provide two examples of HSPCs surrounded by 7 cell niche (5 ECs, 1 MSC, 1 Glial like cell), but we don't know if this the case for every HSPC or just a subset/what proportion.</p><p>3) Figure 7 importantly identifies putative HSPCs based on morphological criteria, but again only few examples are shown and confirmation that these are HSPCs using the reporter lines seems required.</p><p>4) In Figure 8D, HSPCs have been identified as 'morphologically resembling an HSPC'; some of the reporters available should be used to demonstrate that this is the case.</p><p>5) L. 101: &quot;This suggests that ZO-1 is a potential candidate for mediating adhesion between HSPCs and the surrounding niche cells in the KM niche&quot; and L. 244-245 of Discussion – Figure 2A does not show a particular enrichment of ZO-1 expression near mCherry+ cells.</p><p>6) L.226-7: &quot;suggesting a role for dopamine signalling in colonization of the presumptive adult KM niche&quot; should probably be rephrased. There could be different reasons and neurotransmitters/other molecules responsible for this effect.</p><p>7) Scale bars in some figures e.g 3D-G weren't always clear.<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The work presented by Owen Tamplin and collaborators is aimed at defining the different cellular components and chemical signals that provide structural and functional specificity to the niche into which hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (HSPCs) are homing. These investigations are essential to determine precisely the niches that will favour the survival and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells with the highest degree of stemness which, ultimately, should allow producing this type of cells in the context of regenerative medicine.</p><p>Importantly, this kind of work would have not been possible in any other vertebrates, which is why the developing zebrafish is a unique living model organism, owing to its transparency and relative easiness for genetic engineering.</p><p>Here, Owen Tamplin and collaborators succeed in providing impressive 3-dimensional information on the structural organization of pre-definitive niches in the developing kidney of the zebrafish larva. In analogy with what has been described in the mammalian bone marrow, they also provide functional evidence for a role of dopamine signalling via glial-like cells, which empowers the use of the zebrafish to comprehend the biology of immunity establishment, a process essential for life. Overall, this piece of work paves the way for further, more detailed analyses on the physical and fonctional interactions between hematopoietic stem cells and their 3D-niche environment.</p><p>Comments to the Authors</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors address, at high spatial 3-dimensional resolution that includes light sheet microscopy on the whole zebrafish larva and correlative light/electron microscopy, critical aspects of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (HSPCS) and their niches: their conserved structural and cellular identities as well as the regulatory function of contacting glial-like cells.</p><p>The work is overall quite impressive, ambitious technically, and provides unprecedented 3D reconstitution of the pre-definitive hematopoietic niche region, in the developmental zebrafish kidney (the future functional equivalent of the adult bone marrow in mammals). However, I think that the manuscript, in its present form, requires additional experimental work, in particular regarding physical contact between HSPCs (unambiguously identified) and glial-like cells (see comments on Figure 8 and text), which is the functional piece of work of the study. In addition, the manuscript is difficult to follow for the reader in particular for the figures that are, for many of them, lacking annotations (even with the support of Extended Data, the reader has to make serious efforts to be able to critically analyze the Figures (which is clearly a difficult task for authors that are publishing correlative images and EM analysis)).</p><p>Finally and conceptually, it would be good if the authors could propose a more precise vision in regard to the potential functional implications of the 2 geographical/structurally defined niches described here, i.e the one proximal to the glomerulus, and the more distant perivascular niche (this should be, on my opinion, included in the Discussion of the manuscript). Somehow, along the manuscript, we lose the track on the authors aim regarding the characterization of these 2 niche types/regions respective peculiarities (number of HSPCs versus other cell types, influence of neurotransmitters, etc …) and, in fine, the perivascular niche in which 'rare' cells are homing seems to be the centre of attention without any further and precise explanation.</p><p>Please find my major comments beneath on Figures and related text:</p><p>– Figure 3 and text</p><p>The information is not easily captured by the reader.</p><p>In general, panels D-G need annotations (I would suggest: DA and ISVs in D, the position of DAB stained regions in E, the main organs that we see in F (I guess we see the notochord and part of the swim bladder?), G: the position of somites (s1, s2, s3, s4; with somite 2 nearby the kidney marrow as shown in the very nice suppl. Video 4)).</p><p>More specific comments on specific panels:</p><p>D: I doubt that the large, pink, elongated structure is indeed HSPCs (could it be the auto-fluorescence (AF) from the gut as seen in Extended Data Figure 3? I guess this is the same for Figure 4, panel A)</p><p>E: the local DAB precipitate(s) is not clearly visible (could the authors make attempt to obtain an image before and after DAB staining, on the same larva (and show the comparison of the 2 of them?)).</p><p>For the accompanying Extended Data Figure 5, the legend of panel D says we see a reconstitution of HSPCs and multicellular niche (line 851), where are they? could the authors delineate the corresponding regions?</p><p>For the Supplementary Video 5, which is truly impressive, and beautiful in resolution, with plenty of information, what a pity not to have annotations to get a maximum benefit from it; the frustration is immense ! I propose that authors decompose it for the images that are the most in relation to HSPC clusters and the relevant surrounding organs (including vascular structures) and build an additional piece of Extended Data. I realize that one of the sections is composing Figure 5A (00:15 of the pile of images), which should appear in the legend to this Figure. In addition, are the panels Bi-iii of Figure 5 also extracted from Supplementary Video 5 ? In addition, for Video 5, should we expect to see the two different regions in which clusters and single (or 1-2) cells are supposed to establish 2 specific (and different) niches?</p><p>Finally, it appears that red blood cells (RBCs, which are nucleated in the zebrafish) have a very dark cytoplasm 00:11 for ex ? is it DAB staining (in the cytoplasm then and not in nuclei?) or is it endogenous cytosolic peroxydase activity which is revealed here?</p><p>In the text that relates to Figure 3, I find a potential inconsistency in the intention of having sparse labelling of HSPCs (line 131), which I understand is an obvious advantage if one wants to increase the chance to visualize single cells with no other labelled contacting hematopoietic cell (and hence using F0 larvae), but to have as an outcome the same result as when using stable transgenic line (see lines 139-140) is rather unexpected. Could the authors comment on that?</p><p>Also, do the 1-2 mCherry+ cells/EC pockets and 1-5 mCherry+/clusters were observed in each of the 11 larvae that were analyzed (owing to expected mosaicism, this may not be the case)?</p><p>– Figure 4 and text</p><p>Figure 4 is quite informative for comprehending the strategy followed technically but, somehow, is not illustrating the text lines 173-175 that makes the statement '… dark nuclear and mitochondrial staining … confirming that we have identified the same APEX2+/mCherry+ HSPC …'; thus, the authors should provide a magnification of that HSPC (from the EM image in panel Dii, with a clear nuclear and mitochondrial dark APEX2-derived staining).</p><p>– Figure 5 and text</p><p>I find an inconsistency saying that the posterior perivascular niche encloses a single HSPC as stated line 187 (or may be 2 maximum? as stated lines 137 and 140 if I understand correctly, which is also considered as a 'single rare' cell in Figure 6) (with the ratio 1xHSPC/5xEC/1xMSC) when the figure (see also the legend of Biii lines 709-710) shows two additional – non labelled – HSPCs (HSPCs 2 and 3); can the authors comment on that?</p><p>Supplementary Video 6 is impressive, but again (in particular for the planes 00:00 to 00:33), some annotations should be added on most relevant tissues/organs/cell types.</p><p>In addition, and on conceptual grounds, it is proposed that the CHT niche(s) is (are), in their vast majority, the site(s) of progenitors expansion, meaning most probably a very minor proportion would home cells bearing/maintaining full, long-term HSC potential (as opposed to the kidney marrow in which future adult HSCs are homing, thus with an expected higher proportion of HSC-specific niches). Based on this, how would the authors conceive that such conserved structures would accommodate such differentially fated cells (see the statement lines 187-188 'demonstrating this cellular structure is conserved between developmental and presumptive adult niche')?</p><p>– Figure 8 and text</p><p>The Figure with the light sheet information on close proximity between HSPCs and dbh cells is nice and the quantitative analysis panel (C) convincing.</p><p>However, the data should be substantiated using a double Tg line (draculin:2APEX2-mCherry) X (dbh:GFP) to confirm the identity of the HSPC(s) contacting the dbh cell(s) and not only a resemblance as state line 231 (hence labelled by the APEX2 nuclear + mitochondrial activities). This would very much substantiate the work and strengthen the manuscript on this important aspect of HSPC/niche establishment/regulation (and the authors have all the tools/approaches at hand). This is also required since the authors clearly state at the end of the Discussion (line 262) '… additional rounds of CLEM to confirm that dbh:GFP+ cells were adjacent to HSPCs …'; clearly, identifying unambiguously HSPCs is mandatory.</p><p>In the accompanying Extended Data Figure 9, panel (A) line 892, what do (n=10) refers to? 10 sections of 1 experiment? 1 section, each from 10 independent experiments? What cells does the blue colour in panel Bii underline?</p><p>In the text, the authors say that they wish to address a role of dopamine signalling in the KM niche colonization (hence they treat with 6-OHDA from 4 to 5dpf, during niche colonization); would a shorter treatment (ex: few hours) also affect HSPCs in the niche, which would indicate a function of dopamine in the niche per se (ex: survival, maintenance) rather than colonization?</p><p>Finally, the authors propose, if I understand correctly, that there may be 2 different types of functional niches (1) proximal/adjacent to the glomerulus, (2) more distant and referred to as posterior perivascular niche; do they have any information on a possible differential influence of dopamine and dbh-cells on these 2 niche types (or to their colonization)? Answering to that question would as well strengthen the functional impact of the work.</p><p>Comments on the Discussion:</p><p>The authors should, in my opinion, discuss the possible functional discrepancies between the 2 geographic positions of the niches that are visualized here, i.e the one adjacent to the glomerulus and the one that is perivascular (more distant from the glomerulus); they should do so also in the context of the current work on mammalian bone marrow niches. This is an important issue in the field because, ultimately, one wants to comprehend what are the functional differences between the niches that allow the maintenance of long-term HSCs and the ones that are more devoted to support specific lineage differentiation. Do the authors have a vision on that issue?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Defining the ultrastructure of the hematopoietic stem cell niche by correlative light and electron microscopy&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and all reviewers commended the extra work and data added to the study. They also agree that it is important for the readers to include a few further edits to better reflect the limitations of the techniques used and the heterogeneity uncovered when a larger number of HSPC is analysed. However, no further experiments are needed. Please see below for details of their recommendations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript describing this technically groundbreaking and very impressive approach to study the niche is largely improved and provides a more balanced interpretation of the results, considering the inherent limitation of the approach including datasets available.</p><p>I understand that the approach is technically very challenging and time-consuming, and would not allow to obtain larger datasets to perform quantitative analyses and obtain more definitive conclusions. Therefore, these should be rephrased to emphasise the qualitative (rather than quantitative) nature of the analysis and acknowledge some limitations (such as the lack of markers for putative HSCs in some cases). The contact with glial cells is emphasised but it should be noted that only 3 out of 22 HSPCs were found in contact with glial cells. Besides the numerical difference of HSPCs found in contact with different niche cells, whether HSPCs contacting these different niche cells might be functionally distinct could be incorporated into the discussion. The conclusions should acknowledge the qualitative nature of the study and emphasise the strengths and limitations of this novel approach to study the niche in the future, since it could potentially elicit significant interest in the field to use it in different experimental settings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Many thanks to the authors to have provided a significant revision of their work; obviously, this correlative multimodal microscopy work is a tedious, difficult, time-consuming but essential task.</p><p>While many of my points have been taken into account, there still remains 2 critical aspects that I believe should be addressed and that are partly emphasized by the new dataset (dataset 4 using the CD41:gfp line, workflow 2).</p><p>Point 1 (that also relates to essential point 2 of the Evaluation Summary): The authors have provided a new dataset (see new Figure 6 and the 2 Supplemental Figures+ Table 1) that significantly increases the number of HSPCs that are analysed, including the identification of potential niche contacting cells (Table 1). However, the dataset raises the critical point of heterogeneity of the niche environment because the cluster of HSPCs that is analysed appears disconnected to any glial-like cells (GL, see outcome = 0 in Table 1 for the 17 HSPCs). Hence, this new dataset strengthens the idea of the heterogeneity which is not quantitatively appreciated in the work. Also, on qualitative aspects, it appears that the HSPC cluster is more distal to the glomeruli than the HSPCs illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 5 – figure supplement 1 and 3 for example (which appear from the images to be more proximal to the glomerulus while for new Figure 6 the cluster appears to be connecting the pronephric tubule and the margin of the intestinal epithelium). Indeed, there may be different niches that may have been underappreciated in the work as it stands (niche peculiarities may depend on geo-localization, without considering the other, more posterior, perivascular niche).</p><p>Point 2 (that also relates to essential point 3 of the Evaluation Summary): The point on the APEX2 signal to unequivocally identify the HSPCs under study has not been addressed in the revision. This is important in particular for the data that illustrate the contact between dbh cells and putative HSPCs which is scarce (1 couple of cells in new Figure 7 (previous Figure 8, kept unchanged)); as it stands, this result is still preliminary (the HSPC is not identified unequivocally. The authors argue in their response that they did not manage to optimize the protocol so as to retain the GFP and mCherry signals but can't they take the peroxidase signal as reference (together with the gfp signal from dbh cells))?</p><p>[editor note: please reword the specific section to discuss other options and limitations]</p><p>Remark on essential Point 7: the answer to that point is well taken and understandable. In addition, since the strategy is to use mosaicism (hence reduced number of labelled HSPCs), this decreases the chance to capture the cells that immobilize in the perivascular, more distant niche (the HSPCS proximal to glomeruli appear to be more clusterized, increasing the chance to capture some of them). The authors have added in the discussion (lines 400-401 and not 392-394) that they are working on a labelling approach that would make it possible. I believe it is fair considering this point beyond the scope of this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64835.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The main points of agreement are the following:</p><p>1) Multiple different lines of fish are used to highlight HSPCs, but since their signals do not overlap, it is hard to come to a definitive conclusion of what cells are analysed each time.

CD41:GFP is used in some analyses too and especially in the validation of the APEX transgenic line (though not shown).</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge we have used multiple different zebrafish HSPC reporter lines throughout this study. They are all well-established HSPC reporters that have varying degrees of overlap with each other. Different lines were selected for each experiment based on their color (GFP or mCherry) and compatibility with other reagents, and if they marked a large or small proportion of the HSPC pool. In fact, we are greatly encouraged that the different HSPC lines have all produced consistent results that confirm the main conclusions from our study.</p><p>Previously, we quantified and reported the overlap between these lines in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) at 72 hours post fertilization (hpf) (Owen J Tamplin et al., 2015). We have copied that information here: “Runx:GFP overlaps 92±11% with Runx:mCherry. Runx:mCherry overlaps 13±6% with Runx:GFP. (CHT of n=11 embryos scored)” and “cd41:GFP overlaps 60±12% with Runx:mCherry. Runx:mCherry overlaps 44±8% with cd41:GFP. (CHT of n=12 embryos scored).”</p><p>For mosaic HSPC expression we used the <italic>draculin</italic> (<italic>drl</italic>) promoter because it marks HSPCs and drives expression at a higher level than other available promoters (e.g., Runx+23 or cd41). Others have validated overlap between Runx:mCherry and drl:GFP in HSPCs (Henninger et al., 2017; Mosimann et al., 2015), and showed that virtually 100% of Runx:mCherry positive cells are also drl:GFP positive from embryo to adult. One caveat of this F0 mosaic transgenic approach is that there is inherent variability between embryos. This is what we wanted because it allowed us to select embryos that had positive cells lodged in the kidney that were also sparse for single cell correlation between imaging modalities. Therefore, we selected embryos that had similar cell numbers to those in cd41:GFP embryos (i.e., 1-2 in EC pockets and 1-5 in clusters; new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1B).</p><p>Overall, we observed excellent overlap between Runx:mCherry, Runx:GFP, cd41:GFP, and draculin promoter expression in the HSPC compartment that has also been validated in other studies. Together, these lines have demonstrated HSPCs in the larval kidney marrow niche of 5 dpf zebrafish are consistently found in three locations: (1) vessel lumen; (2) clusters adjacent to the glomerulus; (3) and lodged in perivascular sites (new Table 1). We have quantified all of the data from our light sheet experiments and consistently found there are only 1-2 HSPCs in pockets, regardless of which line is used (new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1B).</p><p>Regarding the suggestion that we use the Runx:GFP line for additional experiments, over the last 2 years our Runx:GFP line has undergone transgene silencing that is a common problem with tol2 transposase-generated zebrafish lines after multiple generations. We have been working to recover the line from frozen stocks, and regenerate the line using I-SceI meganuclease transgenesis to avoid this problem in the future, but we do not yet have a line available to perform new experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Only two examples of HSCPs surrounded by the 7 cells niche are presented. Is this the case for all HSPCs, or what sort of variation is observed? Variation would be expected given the reporters used are marking HSPCs rather than primitive HSCs, and therefore a heterogeneous population. In general, more data should be presented and statistically analysed to support the conclusions presented.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revised manuscript we present more data to address the variation of HSPC lodgement in the niche of larval zebrafish at 5 dpf. We have generated one new serial section EM dataset (#4 cd41:GFP).</p><p>First, to provide context for our system, HSPC lodgement in the nascent kidney marrow of the larval zebrafish at 5 dpf is a very rare event. The predicted number of HSPCs produced from the dorsal aorta of the zebrafish embryo is considerably less (~20-fold) than mouse models. Instead of hundreds of cells produced from the dorsal aorta of the mouse embryo (Ganuza et al., 2017), in zebrafish it is less than 30 (Henninger et al., 2017). This makes tracking and quantification of many events very difficult, particularly at the early stages of larval kidney niche colonization when we are tracking the arrival of the very first cells. Our Runx:mCherry line has the broadest coverage of the HSPC pool and it shows there are only 50-100 positive cells in the entire kidney marrow niche between 4-5 dpf.</p><p>Another considerable challenge with this project is acquisition of serial section electron microscopy dataset (SBEM). From initial light imaging, to embedding, microCT scans, serial section scanning, post-acquisition data alignment and analysis, takes many months of work. This explains why some high impact studies using serial section EM only present a single dataset (Hildebrand et al., 2017). In the first submission of our study, we presented three serial section EM datasets: #1 drl:APEX2-mCherry; #2 drl:APEX2-mCherry; #3 dbh:GFP. For this resubmission we have produced a new serial section EM dataset: #4 cd41:GFP (new Figure 6). This new dataset using the cd41:GFP HSPC-specific reporter line has allowed us to analyze many lodged HSPCs in a single SBEM dataset. This has allowed us to make conclusions about common features of HSPC lodgement and confirm consistent observations with our previous datasets. Although each of the four SBEM datasets was generated to address slightly different questions, we did observe and quantify common features of HSPC lodgement in the niche of each sample. We have described niche interactions for a total of n=22 putative HSPCs collected from all SBEM datasets and summarized these results in new Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) APEX signal is not always shown, but should be used to unequivocally identify the cell presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the APEX2 staining approach was not always used to generate our serial section EM datasets. We did not clearly explain in the first version of the manuscript that we developed two distinct correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) workflows. Workflow #1 was dependent on having sparse but high levels of APEX2 expression in the HSPC compartment. For that purpose, we used the draculin promoter to express mCherry (for light microscopy) and APEX2 (for EM) from the same construct. This was injected transiently in F0 embryos because we wanted sparse mosaic labeling. APEX2 is a genetically encoded peroxidase that we tagged to nuclei and mitochondria (Lam et al., 2015), allowing us to match position across imaging modalities. The light and EM 3D datasets were merged and aligned using Imaris software.</p><p>Workflow #2 was a significant technical advance because it could be used with any GFP-expressing transgenic line. The embryos were treated with DRAQ5 nuclear stain before confocal imaging. Nuclear labeling provided the landmarks that were needed in both 3D light microscopy and EM datasets for software correlation and alignment. This second workflow was more rapid and robust in its alignments, and was used to confirm the location of cd41:GFP+ cells (new Figure 6) and dbh:GFP+ cells (Figure 7) in the niche. What we found so striking about the approach developed in Workflow #2 was the precision of alignments at the single cell level (new Figure 6 —figure supplements 1 and 2), and the ability to (as stated by the reviewer) unequivocally identify any cell between light microscopy and EM modalities.</p><p>Our results were consistent using the two different workflows and identified HSPCs in three locations (as mentioned above): (1) vessel lumen; (2) clusters adjacent to the glomerulus; (3) and lodged in perivascular sites (new Table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In figure 2 ZO-1 does not look particularly enriched around Cherry positive cells, and the relative conclusions should be rephrased.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text in Lines 135-138 to rephrase it as shown below.

For example, the 1:1 attachment of an HSPC to an MSC that we observe for 50-60% of HSPCs could regulate quiescence versus expansion. There may also be subtypes of ECs within the vasculature of the CHT and KM that provide different regulatory functions, as is observed in the adult mouse bone marrow (J. Zhang et al., 2021). The CHT of the zebrafish differs from the fetal liver because there is not the massive exponential expansion of HSPCs required to sustain the mammalian embryo in utero (Kumaravelu et al., 2002; Owen J Tamplin et al., 2015). Unlike mammalian embryos, zebrafish embryos develop externally and can survive for many days with no definitive hematopoiesis (Sood et al., 2010; Y. Zhang, Jin, Li, Qin, and Wen, 2011). We do not know if the HSPCs that transit through the CHT to the KM have equal potential to become long term quiescent HSCs, or if there is already heterogeneity. Some HSPCs may be fated to produce the blood lineages required during development, while others may retain their quiescence as they transit through the CHT to the KM.

One caveat of this F0 mosaic transgenic approach is that there is inherent variability between embryos. This is what we wanted because it allowed us to select embryos that had positive cells lodged in the kidney that were also sparse for single cell correlation between imaging modalities.

This is an important issue in the field because, ultimately, one wants to comprehend what are the functional differences between the niches that allow the maintenance of long-term HSCs and the ones that are more devoted to support specific lineage differentiation. Do the authors have a vision on that issue?</p></disp-quote><p>This is similar to Essential Revision #6 and again we have copied our response below:</p><p>We have addressed this excellent point in the Discussion section with the following paragraph:</p><p>“A major outstanding question is if there is functional heterogeneity within different niche sites of the CHT and KM. For example, the 1:1 attachment of an HSPC to an MSC that we observe for 50-60% of HSPCs could regulate quiescence versus expansion. There may also be subtypes of ECs within the vasculature of the CHT and KM that provide different regulatory functions, as is observed in the adult mouse bone marrow (J. Zhang et al., 2021). The CHT of the zebrafish differs from the fetal liver because there is not the massive exponential expansion of HSPCs required to sustain the mammalian embryo in utero (Kumaravelu et al., 2002; Owen J Tamplin et al., 2015). Unlike mammalian embryos, zebrafish embryos develop externally and can survive for many days with no definitive hematopoiesis (Sood et al., 2010; Y. Zhang et al., 2011). We do not know if the HSPCs that transit through the CHT to the KM have equal potential to become long term quiescent HSCs, or if there is already heterogeneity. Some HSPCs may be fated to produce the blood lineages required during development, while others may retain their quiescence as they transit through the CHT to the KM. Although we don’t have the genetic tools yet to functionally distinguish between different sites of HSPC lodgement within the larval KM niche, we are developing a labeling approach that would make this possible.”</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript describing this technically groundbreaking and very impressive approach to study the niche is largely improved and provides a more balanced interpretation of the results, considering the inherent limitation of the approach including datasets available.</p><p>I understand that the approach is technically very challenging and time-consuming, and would not allow to obtain larger datasets to perform quantitative analyses and obtain more definitive conclusions. Therefore, these should be rephrased to emphasise the qualitative (rather than quantitative) nature of the analysis and acknowledge some limitations (such as the lack of markers for putative HSCs in some cases). The contact with glial cells is emphasised but it should be noted that only 3 out of 22 HSPCs were found in contact with glial cells. Besides the numerical difference of HSPCs found in contact with different niche cells, whether HSPCs contacting these different niche cells might be functionally distinct could be incorporated into the discussion. The conclusions should acknowledge the qualitative nature of the study and emphasise the strengths and limitations of this novel approach to study the niche in the future, since it could potentially elicit significant interest in the field to use it in different experimental settings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We have updated the text to emphasize the qualitive nature of the approach and acknowledge some limitations along with the strengths. We will discuss that only 3 out of 22 HSPCs were found in contact with glial cells. Also, we have discussed that HSPCs could be functionally distinct based on their contact with different niche cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Comments to the Authors</p><p>Many thanks to the authors to have provided a significant revision of their work; obviously, this correlative multimodal microscopy work is a tedious, difficult, time-consuming but essential task.</p><p>While many of my points have been taken into account, there still remains 2 critical aspects that I believe should be addressed and that are partly emphasized by the new dataset (dataset 4 using the CD41:gfp line, workflow 2).</p><p>Point 1 (that also relates to essential point 2 of the Evaluation Summary): The authors have provided a new dataset (see new Figure 6 and the 2 Supplemental Figures+ Table 1) that significantly increases the number of HSPCs that are analysed, including the identification of potential niche contacting cells (Table 1). However, the dataset raises the critical point of heterogeneity of the niche environment because the cluster of HSPCs that is analysed appears disconnected to any glial-like cells (GL, see outcome = 0 in Table 1 for the 17 HSPCs). Hence, this new dataset strengthens the idea of the heterogeneity which is not quantitatively appreciated in the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. This is a similar point as stated by Reviewer #2 and we have copied the answer here:</p><p>We have updated the text to emphasize the qualitive nature of the approach and acknowledge some limitations along with the strengths.

Also, we have discussed that HSPCs could be functionally distinct based on their contact with different niche cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, on qualitative aspects, it appears that the HSPC cluster is more distal to the glomeruli than the HSPCs illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 5 – figure supplement 1 and 3 for example (which appear from the images to be more proximal to the glomerulus while for new Figure 6 the cluster appears to be connecting the pronephric tubule and the margin of the intestinal epithelium). Indeed, there may be different niches that may have been underappreciated in the work as it stands (niche peculiarities may depend on geo-localization, without considering the other, more posterior, perivascular niche).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful observations. Regarding the observation that the HSPC cluster in new Figure 6 is less proximal to the glomerulus compared to the HSPC cluster of Figure 5, we believe it is simply the slices we have chosen to present for these figures. Depending on the oblique angle chosen for visualization through the 3D serial section blockface electron microscopy (SBEM) dataset, the glomerulus and/or pronephric tubules may or may not be visible. In Figure 4 —figure supplement 2, it is easier to see that the HSPC clusters are always located between the glomerulus and pronephric tubules. Visualization of the data aside, it is possible that depending on where in the cluster a single HSPC resides, it may be closer to a particular cell type or signal that differentially regulates its function. We will make all datasets publicly available so readers can explore them further and perform new analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2 (that also relates to essential point 3 of the Evaluation Summary): The point on the APEX2 signal to unequivocally identify the HSPCs under study has not been addressed in the revision. This is important in particular for the data that illustrate the contact between dbh cells and putative HSPCs which is scarce (1 couple of cells in new Figure 7 (previous Figure 8, kept unchanged)); as it stands, this result is still preliminary (the HSPC is not identified unequivocally). The authors argue in their response that they did not manage to optimize the protocol so as to retain the GFP and mCherry signals but can't they take the peroxidase signal as reference (together with the gfp signal from dbh cells)?</p><p>[editor note: please reword the specific section to discuss other options and limitations]</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the putative HSPC in Figure 7 is not identified unequivocally based on its own HSPC-specific marker (e.g., cd41, Runx1+23, or draculin). We have been careful to describe unlabeled HSPCs as “putative”. We have emphasized that the putative HSPC in question is described based on morphology alone. For this dataset we focused on localization of the dbh:gfp+ cells to the kidney niche. Unfortunately, we cannot use the peroxidase signal generated in Workflow #1 and #2 at the same time because one relies on APEX2 and the other on DRAQ5 to create high contrast in the EM datasets and would generate overlapping signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Remark on essential Point 7: the answer to that point is well taken and understandable. In addition, since the strategy is to use mosaicism (hence reduced number of labelled HSPCs), this decreases the chance to capture the cells that immobilize in the perivascular, more distant niche (the HSPCS proximal to glomeruli appear to be more clusterized, increasing the chance to capture some of them). The authors have added in the discussion (lines 400-401 and not 392-394) that they are working on a labelling approach that would make it possible. I believe it is fair considering this point beyond the scope of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer acknowledging the technical challenges associated with aspects of the study.</p><p>For the reviewers’ information, we made one additional change that was not raised in the reviews. After careful consideration, we have revised the terminology of the “glial-like” cell to “ganglion-like cell” as it is a more accurate prediction of the dbh:gfp+ cell identity based on the available literature (1-4). The tyrosine hydroxylase/dopamine β-hydroxylase positive cells in that region of the embryo have been described as the “cervical sympathetic ganglion complex” (3), “superior cervical ganglion” (5), or “sympathetic cervical complex” made up of “neural crest-derived peripheral neurons, cranial ganglion neurons and glia” (1).</p><p>References</p><p>1.
