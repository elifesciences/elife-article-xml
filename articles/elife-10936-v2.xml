To document systematically where and when cells survive caspase-3 activation in vivo, we designed a system, CasExpress, which drives fluorescent protein expression, transiently or permanently, in cells that survive caspase-3 activation in Drosophila. We discovered widespread survival of caspase-3 activity. Distinct spatial and temporal patterns emerged in different tissues. Some cells activated caspase-3 during their normal development in every cell and in every animal without evidence of apoptosis. In other tissues, such as the brain, expression was sporadic both temporally and spatially and overlapped with periods of apoptosis. In adults, reporter expression was evident in a large fraction of cells in most tissues of every animal; however the precise patterns varied. Inhibition of caspase activity in wing discs reduced wing size demonstrating functional significance. The implications of these patterns are discussed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10936.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10936.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10936.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every day, individual cells in our body actively decide whether to live or die. There are enzymes called executioner caspases that help cells to die in a carefully controlled process called apoptosis. Although the activation of executioner caspases generally leads to apoptosis, there are some circumstances in which cells are able to survive.</p><p>Fruit flies are often used in research as models of how animals grow and develop. Ding, Sun et al. set out to find out more about the circumstances in which cells manage to survive caspase activation in fruit flies. The experiments used a new method that results in cells that survive caspase activity producing a fluorescent marker protein. This allowed Ding, Sun et al. to track when and where these events occurred in the flies.</p><p>Few cells in fruit fly embryos survive the activation of executioner caspase. However, in later stages of development, more and more cells survive this process. Cells in different parts of the body responded differently. For some types of cells, every cell seemed to survive caspase activity with no evidence of apoptosis. In other tissues like the central brain, in which a few cells normally choose to die, some cells occasionally managed to survive the activation of caspases. This rescue from the brink of death was more common than Ding, Sun et al. had anticipated.</p><p>The next step will be to uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable the cells to survive caspase activity. This knowledge may help us to develop treatments that can promote the survival of useful cells like heart muscle cells and brain cells, or trigger the death of cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10936.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10936.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>caspase</kwd><kwd>cell survival</kwd><kwd>genetically encoded reporter</kwd><kwd>anastasis</kwd><kwd>cell competition</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21EY022498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montell</surname><given-names>Denise J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM46425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montell</surname><given-names>Denise J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic labeling of cells that survive executioner caspase activity in Drosophila reveals distinct patterns in different tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell death program known as apoptosis was originally described as a series of morphological changes that cells undergo as they die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tenev et al., 2005</xref>). The reproducibility of the sequence suggested an underlying molecular program, and a conserved set of enzymes, the caspases, emerged as key regulators and executioners of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin and Green, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacobson and Evan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thornberry, 1998</xref>). While caspase activation is frequently a terminal event resulting in swift cellular demise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2002</xref>), cell survival following caspase activation has been described (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Florentin and Arama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuranaga and Miura, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meinander et al., 2012</xref>]). In some cells and tissues, caspases promote localized or partial destruction of the cell without actually killing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connolly et al., 2014)</xref>.</p><p>A variety of primary cells and cell lines can survive caspase activation following a lethal dose of an apoptotic stimulus, as long as it is transient and thus sublethal in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). This reversal of late stage apoptosis has been named <italic>anastasis</italic> (Greek for 'rising to life'). Cell survival following caspase activation in response to a sublethal dose of irradiation has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Florentin and Arama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ichim et al., 2015</xref>). Such survival following caspase activation has the potential for both beneficial and harmful effects. It may limit permanent damage to the heart following transient ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenis et al., 2010</xref>); however it can also be oncogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ichim et al., 2015</xref>), and could in principle allow tumor cells to escape chemotherapy.</p><p>Apoptosis is a critical feature of normal development in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miura, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denton and Kumar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaux and Korsmeyer, 1999</xref>). Studies in model organisms such as worms and flies have made important contributions to unraveling the underlying mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connolly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denton and Kumar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orme and Meier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steller, 1995</xref>). It is unknown whether cells ever recover from the brink of apoptotic cell death during development. The observations that cultured cells and adult cardiac myocytes recover from transient insults that cause caspase-3 activation raised the question as to how widespread cell survival following caspase activation might be in vivo, whether this ever occurs during normal development, and if so what function it might serve.</p><p>Identification of cells that survive transient caspase activation is challenging because they bear no known distinguishing characteristic. Therefore we developed a genetic system to mark and manipulate cells that survive caspase activation in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Using these CasExpress transgenic flies, we discovered that the majority of cells in the adult derive from cells that survive caspase activation during normal development. We observed distinct categories of CasExpress activation. For example, in some organs, every cell activated the sensor over an extended period of development without evidence of apoptosis or morphological remodeling, suggesting a function for caspase-3 unrelated to cellular destruction. In other tissues, activation was sporadic in temporal and spatial pattern, suggesting a stochastic process. In these tissues, the precise patterns differed from animal to animal, and occurred in regions that normally exhibit apoptosis. These observations suggest that some cells recover from the brink of apoptotic cell death and undergo developmental anastasis. We propose that these different patterns represent distinct functions of executioner caspases during normal development.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10936.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Widespread CasExpress activation in adult tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of CasExpress and G-trace.

To keep Gal4 inactive in the absence of caspase activity, we tethered it to the plasma membrane by fusing it to mCD8 (mouse cluster of differentiation 8). To render the protein caspase-inducible, we inserted the caspase-3-binding and cleavage domain from the Drosophila Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein 1 (DIAP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ditzel et al., 2003</xref>) in between CD8 and Gal4. As a negative control we created a second transgene with a DQVD to DQVA amino acid substitution in the caspase cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) in order to render it caspase insensitive, hereafter the 'DQVA control.' To allow for detection of caspase activation in as many cell types as possible, the fusion protein was expressed under the control of the ubiquitin (ubi) enhancer/promoter. We characterized the expression and activity of transgenic flies bearing a site-directed insertion into the attP40 landing site, selected for its ability to allow relatively uniform, moderate levels of expression in a variety of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Markstein et al., 2008</xref>). We also generated an insertion into a random site for comparison. We named this system CasExpress for its ability to drive expression of downstream genes and proteins under the control of caspase-3 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Widespread activation of CasExpress in the adult</title><p>To detect caspase activity, we crossed the sensor and control to G-Trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2009</xref>) a fly line that expresses two fluorescent protein targets, under the control of Gal4-responsive UAS (upstream activating sequences). G-Trace flies contain three transgenes, all on the second chromosome: UAS-RFP, UAS-FLP, which encodes a yeast recombinase enzyme, and a ubi-FRT-STOP-FRT-GFP cassette where FRT stands for <underline>F</underline>LP <underline>R</underline>ecombination <underline>T</underline>arget sequence. Crossing the mCD8-DQVD-Gal4 sensor to G-Trace should lead to permanent GFP expression in any cell that survives transient caspase activation and in all of its progeny, in contrast to other caspase activity reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardet et al., 2008</xref>). We expected the caspase-activated Gal4 protein to be short-lived because we had observed rapid degradation of other caspase reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2012</xref>), so we anticipated RFP would be transient and limited to the cells that activated caspase-3 but not their progeny.</p><p>We first examined adult tissues where, to our surprise, we found widespread GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–L</xref>). In the intestine for example, GFP was evident in the most anterior structure, the proventriculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), although little RFP was evident there, suggesting that caspase had been active earlier during development. In the midgut both RFP and GFP appeared in a partially overlapping pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D–D”</xref>). Large nuclei corresponding to differentiated epithelial cells expressed both RFP and GFP suggesting ongoing caspase activation, whereas a subset of small progenitor cells expressed GFP but not RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D”</xref> arrows). Visceral muscle and hindgut showed a mixture of GFP+/RFP- cells as well as some GFP+/RFP+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F”</xref>). The adult eye and antenna exhibited widespread nuclear GFP but only infrequent RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H”</xref>), suggesting that caspase had been activated earlier in development either in a large fraction of cells, or in precursors that gave rise to a large fraction of adult cells; however little activation of caspase appeared to be ongoing in the adult.</p><p>In the adult central brain and nerve cord, a minority of cells expressed GFP and/or RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J”</xref>). In the optic lobe, many but not all cells expressed GFP and/or RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–I”</xref>), whereas in body wall muscle, nearly every cell expressed GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–K”</xref>). In the female reproductive system, every cell of the oviduct was GFP+/RFP- in every animal, whereas the majority of germline and somatic cells in egg chambers lacked FP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref> summarizes these findings schematically. Recently a similar strategy detected similarly widespread adult expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Distinct spatial and temporal patterns of CasExpress during development</title><p>The adult expression suggested that CasExpress was activated during development. To document when caspase activation first appeared, we examined embryonic and larval stages. In Drosophila embryos, the only tissue that activated CasExpress robustly was the salivary gland beginning at stage 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–A”</xref>). Salivary gland expression was not detected in the DQVA control, demonstrating that this was not due to leaky or background expression from the G-Trace transgenes or random breakdown of the fusion protein that might separate Gal4 from the transmembrane domain. We also confirmed that the DQVD sensor and DQVA control showed similar patterns and levels of fusion protein expression at the cell surface detected with anti-mCD8 antibody staining throughout the embryo and in most tissues and stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the embryo RFP was also detected in some randomly distributed cells, likely corresponding to a subset of cells that normally undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and A”</xref>); little if any GFP was detected in those cells, presumably because dying cells were not active enough to transcribe and translate FLP, undergo DNA recombination, and then transcribe and translate GFP to detectable levels. While RFP was detected in the salivary gland beginning in stage 12, GFP expression became evident later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–B”</xref>), confirming that these FPs exhibit different timing of activation.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10936.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CasExpress activation in embryos and larvae.</title><p>(<bold>A–B”</bold>) RFP and GFP expression in Drosophila embryos (<bold>A–A”</bold>) stage 12, (<bold>B–B”</bold>) stage 17.

Apoptosis contributes substantially to these processes. To address how much of the adult expression arose during metamorphosis in each tissue, we crossed in the Gal80<sup>ts</sup> repressor and grew flies at 18°C to prevent the induction of CasExpress. We then shifted the flies to 29°C, the non-permissive temperature for Gal80<sup>ts</sup>, to allow induction only during specific time windows corresponding to larval, pupal, or adult stages respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Activation during the pupal period could be responsible for remodeling of connections during metamorphosis and was not unexpected, however the more extensive activity during the larval period suggests an additional function for caspase in earlier nervous system development. In midgut enterocytes, some activation occurred during pupal life but more appeared in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–I”</xref>), possibly related to the biology of midgut enterocytes which face damage and undergo rapid turnover in adults even under normal physiological conditions.

Thus caspase was activated during metamorphosis and some cells survived. This is intriguing because during metamorphosis the larval gut degenerates and the adult gut is reconstituted by progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Micchelli, 2012</xref>). We did not detect RFP in progenitor cells at any stage that we analyzed, and we only detected GFP in progenitors when CasExpress was allowed to be active during the pupal stage. Therefore caspase is likely activated for a brief period during pupal life. The progenitor cells, like the rest of the animal, are exposed to apoptotic stimuli such as systemic ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 1997</xref>), yet they survive to reconstitute the adult gut. They might survive either because they are particularly resistant to caspase activity and apoptosis, as is postulated for stem/progenitor cells generally. Alternatively caspases may actually promote their proliferation or maintenance as has been described for some mammalian progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoneyama et al., 2014</xref>); or some progenitor cells may undergo anastasis and recover from the brink of apoptotic cell death. Although we cannot currently distinguish definitively between these possibilities, the observation that a subset of progenitor cells activates CasExpress might indicate that some cells resist the apoptotic stimulus prior to activation of caspase-3 whereas others experience caspase activity and recover from it. The observation that pupal visceral muscle cells exhibit RFP and GFP in nearly every cell suggests prolonged caspase activation. Together these observations demonstrate that survival of caspase activation occurs in distinct spatial and temporal patterns for different cell types and tissues, possibly due to differing epigenetic states, developmental mechanisms, and/or physiological functions (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Functional significance of developmental caspase in the wing</title><p>We wondered if the observed caspase activity was functionally significant. The homozygous <italic>Drice</italic> mutant is lethal, as are <italic>dronc</italic> mutants. The interpretation is that these mutations prevent apoptosis, and that apoptosis is essential. Our results suggest an additional possibility, which is that non-apoptotic caspase activity may be important during normal development. To test this, we crossed two different UAS-p35 transgenes to the <italic>rotund-Gal4</italic> (rn-Gal4) line, which expresses in the pouch region of the wing imaginal disc, the region that gives rise to the adult wing blade. We then evaluated the morphology and size of the adult wing for defects in growth and/or patterning. Although the wings appeared normally patterned, they showed a small (10%) but reproducible and significant reduction in area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>), demonstrating the functional importance of caspase activity in this tissue. We repeated this experiment using engrailed-Gal4, which drives expression only in the posterior compartment of the wing, and compared the area of the posterior compartment to that of the anterior compartment as an internal control. Again, inhibition of apoptosis by expression of p35 caused a small but significant reduction in size. If the only function of caspase were to promote apoptosis, inhibition of caspase should result in excess cells, and therefore a larger size. The observation of a smaller wing suggests a different function for caspase in this tissue (see Discussion).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10936.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of caspase activity reduces wing size.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Representative wings from progeny of rn-Gal4 crossed to (<bold>A</bold>) control w<sup>1118</sup>, (<bold>B</bold>) UAS-p35 on chromosome II, or (<bold>C</bold>) UAS-p35 on the X chromosome.

The striking results include widespread cell survival of caspase activation and the distinct spatial and temporal patterns observed in different tissues throughout development. Caspase-3 activation has been strongly associated with cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thornberry, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chipuk et al., 2006</xref>). While some previous studies have indicated that caspase-3 can perform other functions (e.g.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connolly et al., 2014</xref>]), these non-apoptotic caspase activities are generally considered exceptions to the rule. However it has not been possible to systematically follow the fates of cells that experience executioner caspase activity throughout development in vivo.</p><p>We observed several distinct patterns of CasExpress activation, which likely reflect different biological functions. Oenocytes and cells of the salivary gland and Malpighian tubules activated CasExpress in every cell, in every animal, with no evidence of apoptosis or even partial cellular destruction. This pattern seems most consistent with non-apoptotic roles for caspases. One known protein target of Drice and Dcp1 that might be relevant in this context is the Sterol Regulatory Element-binding Protein (dSREBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amarneh et al., 2009</xref>). SREBP is synthesized as a membrane-tethered precursor that is released by proteolytic cleavage so that it can translocate to the nucleus where it transcribes target genes involved in lipid synthesis and uptake. Oenocytes have an established role in lipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Makki et al., 2014</xref>). According to FlyBase, SREBP is expressed at high levels in many of the tissues that show constitutive caspase-3 activity. SREBPs in mammals and flies are cleaved by site-2 protease (S2P). However Drice and Dcp1 can also cleave SREBP and can even substitute in the absence of S2P in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amarneh et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible then that one function of caspase activity in oenocytes and other cell types is to activate SREBP during normal development and/or in times of stress to meet metabolic demands.</p><p>The published literature provides clear examples of caspase activities that promote cellular remodeling via limited destruction such as sperm maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huh et al., 2004</xref>), remodeling of neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finckbone et al., 2009</xref>), and enucleation of certain terminally differentiating cells, such as erythrocytes and lens epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connolly et al., 2014</xref>). In such tissues one would also expect to see CasExpress activated in a reproducible temporal and spatial pattern. Metamorphosis is a period of insect development during which extensive tissue remodeling occurs. The CasExpress activity that we detected during pupal life in the nervous system for example could be a consequence of remodeling.</p><p>In contrast, in imaginal discs and the brain CasExpress was activated sporadically in both space and time, during periods of development when apoptosis is known to occur. This pattern seems most consistent with developmental anastasis. Anastasis was first described in cultured cells and is defined as the recovery of cells from the brink of apoptotic cell death after caspase-3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). During normal development of many tissues including Drosophila imaginal discs and mammalian blastocysts, cells are thought to compete for survival based on differential fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno and Rhiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kolahgar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vincent et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Beco et al., 2012</xref>). Differences in fitness can be detected amongst cells with artificially induced differences in growth rates, caused by differential ribosomal protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morata and Ripoll, 1975</xref>), c-Myc expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de la Cova et al., 2004</xref>), or access to trophic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Beco et al., 2012</xref>). In the nervous system for example, those cells that obtain sufficient growth factor signaling survive and those that receive too little undergo apoptosis. This has generally been considered an all-or-nothing decision. However the observation that cultured cells exposed transiently to a lethal toxic stimulus can recover after caspase-3 activation, or survival of cells exposed to a sublethal dose of radiation or mitochondrial permeabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ichim et al., 2015</xref>), raise the question as to whether cells might actually bounce back from transient caspase activation during development as well. Our results show that cells can survive caspase-3 activation during normal development, perhaps due to recovery from a transient apoptotic stimulus.</p><p>Another possibility is that cells in a population differ in their sensitivities to apoptosis due to variation in epigenetic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flusberg and Sorger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer and Sorger, 2011</xref>). In mammals the E3 ubiquitin ligase PARC can target cytoplasmic cytochrome c for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, providing one molecular mechanism by which cells can recover from an apoptotic stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gama et al., 2014</xref>). Differential expression of PARC may confer different levels of resistance to executioner caspase activity. Other, as yet unknown, epigenetic differences between cells may also confer differing sensitivities to caspase activation.</p><p>Our results suggest that the ability of cells to survive caspase activation changes during development. Many cells in the embryo activate caspase-3, yet we detected no GFP expression in embryos, except in the salivary gland. Our temperature shift experiments revealed that, in imaginal discs for example, more and more cells survived as development progressed, and cells that activated the sensor in early stages produced large numbers of progeny such that by the end of the third larval instar, the majority of cells expressed GFP.</p><p>A number of studies report immunoreactivity against cleaved caspase-3 in neurons that appear to be dividing, differentiating or migrating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu and Schuldiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finckbone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schoenmann et al., 2010</xref>). While tantalizing, the studies were carried out in fixed tissue so the ultimate fates of such cells could not be determined. In the current study we were able to follow the fates of cells that survived caspase activation, and these results demonstrate that in many tissues of the adult the majority of cells arise from cells that experience transient caspase activity at some point during their development. Therefore such events are not the exception; rather they are the rule.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Autonomous versus non-autonomous survival</title><p>When extra apoptosis is artificially induced in Drosophila imaginal disc cells, it stimulates surviving cells to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan and Bergmann, 2008</xref>). Dying cells secrete growth factors to facilitate the survival and proliferation of their neighbors in the process known as compensatory cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuranaga et al., 2011</xref>). The marking system that we report here demonstrates cell autonomous survival of caspase activation. Both autonomous and non-autonomous survival and proliferation may cooperate to promote recovery of tissues from insults that kill some but not all cells.</p><p>A role for caspases in injury repair and tissue regeneration has been demonstrated in Hydra, Xenopus, planaria, newts and in mouse liver (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connolly et al., 2014</xref>]), indicating that this is a well-conserved and general phenomenon. Our observation that the majority of cells in the adult fly descend from cells that survive caspase activation at some point suggests that, in addition to the well-documented compensatory proliferation in response to injury, there may autonomous compensatory proliferation in cells that survive caspase-3 activation during normal development. The idea is that some cells die and need to be replaced so the cells that survive proliferate. Such an autonomous increase in proliferation might explain the abundance of GFP-expressing cells in the adult. It could also explain the otherwise paradoxical result that inhibition of executioner caspase activity in the wing imaginal disc by p35 reduced wing area in the adult. If inhibiting caspases only blocked apoptosis, one would expect the tissue to contain excess cells and to be either larger, abnormally patterned, or both. In contrast we observed a small decrease in wing area, consistent with the idea that inhibiting caspase activity might also inhibit compensatory cell proliferation during normal development. An earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de la Cova et al., 2004</xref>) showed that inhibiting apoptosis in the wing disc led to variability in the size of the disc later in development; however this study did not address the ultimate effect on the size of the adult wing. It will be interesting in the future to examine CasExpress in models of injury, repair and regeneration to determine if cell autonomous compensatory proliferation occurs in those settings as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Additional examples of developmental anastasis</title><p>Two papers document examples of cell recovery from apoptosis during <italic>C. elegans</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reddien et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoeppner et al., 2001</xref>). When phagocytosis is impaired, a fraction of cells that normally die are able to reverse the morphological signs of apoptosis, which are caused by caspase-3 activity. These cells not only survive, they differentiate. One interpretation of these findings is that phagocytosis normally occurs so early in the death process that it prevents anastasis. However development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is far more stereotyped than it is in most organisms. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> the fate of every single cell is precisely determined. However in organisms with greater numbers of cells, cell survival or death is not thought to be a predetermined cell fate; rather there is a selection process in which cells compete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno and Rhiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vincent et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Beco et al., 2012</xref>). Our results indicate that many cells in adult flies derive from cells that survive caspase activity at some point during their development. An alternative interpretation of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> studies is that the ability to survive and recover even after caspase-3 activation is a fundamental and ancient cellular property that evolved early and still exists in a latent form, even in an animal that does not normally need it. Even in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the precise moment of engulfment is not predetermined; and it is not always the same cell that consumes the dying cell. Therefore in organisms with larger numbers of cells whose fates are far less predictable, it is unlikely that engulfment always occurs at a precise time point during the apoptotic process. The results presented here demonstrate that it is not rare for cells to survive caspase-3 activation during normal Drosophila development, and such cells make a major contribution to normal adult tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>The following transgenic and mutant strains were used:</p><p>The CasExpress biosensor (pattB-Ubi-CasExpress-DQV<underline>D</underline>) and caspase-insensitive control (pattB-Ubi-CasExpress-DQV<underline>A</underline>) were newly generated as follows. First, a backbone pattB-synaptobrevin-7-QFBDAD-hsp70 (gift from Christopher J. Potter lab) was linearized with restriction enzymes AatII and BamHI. The poly-ubiquitin promoter was cloned by PCR from pUWR (Addgene, Cambridge, MA), and the product was inserted to backbone by In-Fusion Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). The product, which was verified by sequencing was named pattB-Ubi. Second, pattB-Ubi was linearized with restriction enzymes NdeI and PstI as a backbone. An insert consisting of the sequence of MCD8, DIAP1 (residues 2–147) and Gal4 in 5’ to 3’ order and two 15 bp sequences overlap with backbone on both 3’ and 5’ end was generated by PCR and In-Fusion cloning. Residues 21 and 22, immediately following the DQVD cleavage site in DIAP1, were mutated from sequence NN to GV, in order to protect the cleaved product from possible N-end rule degradation.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this interesting paper, the authors report work in which they built a tethered Gal 4-based caspase sensor that reports caspase activation during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, in real time and, importantly, also that activated in the past, meaning that cells may have survived caspase activation (which the authors call &quot;anastasis&quot;). Cleavage of a caspase sequence inserted in between a plasma membrane tether (CD8) and Gal 4 releases Gal 4 to the nucleus where it activates UAS-RFP. A flp-out &quot;memory&quot; cassette (now known as G-trace) allows heritable GFP expression in the progeny of a cells that has activated the sensor. Cells that are both RFP and GFP positive are those that have activated the sensor in the past and also continue to activate it. Those with only GFP are those that derived from a previous activation event.</p><p>The authors observe sensor activation in numerous tissues in the fly at different developmental stages. Using a Gal80ts to inhibit Gal 4 activity at selected times in development they demonstrate interesting differences between tissues in sensor activation, suggesting that tissues activate caspases according to differences between tissue physiologies and developmental stages. These are very interesting observations that suggest that caspases are activated at numerous points in development and that this does not necessarily lead to death of the cell, at least not immediately. Although it is known that many cells die either sporadically or in response to programmed cues these data suggest that it may occur more frequently than previously thought. The validation of the sensor via a variety of controls seems solid, and overall they present a very nice tool that should be helpful for exploring in more detail the role of caspases during development. However, the authors make several conclusions that I think are less convincing, and thus reduces my enthusiasm.</p><p>For example, I'm not sure that it's fair to say that the GFP+ cells are all survivors of caspase activation. It is more likely that one of them is, which has then given rise to all of the other cells in the patch. Alternatively, even the parent cell has died but not before producing progeny that will inherit the flipped-out cassette allowing expression of GFP. It is also not clear whether the GFP+ (and RFP+ cells, for that matter) are truly &quot;clones&quot; or whether they sort together due to adhesive alterations due to caspase activation.</p><p>The authors test for a physiological function of caspase activation by blocking its effects through expression of the pan-caspase inhibitor, p35. However, it should be noted that the loss of size control from blocking death in discs with expression of p35 has been previously demonstrated (de la Cova et al., Cell 2004).</p><p>In the Discussion the authors bring up the idea that the sensor activation in imaginal discs, which occurs at several different points during larval development, could be due to competition between imaginal disc cells for growth factors. There is no citation for this supposition, and it would be helpful if they provided one. Although such competition clearly occurs in the brain, it is not at all clear this occurs in discs. The idea was previously proposed to occur (Moreno et al., Nature 2002) but the data remain controversial (later the same lab was unable to reproduce this effect; Martin et al., Development 2009). Another explanation the authors might consider is that is that genetic/epigenetic alterations arise in some cells that render them less sensitive to growth or survival factors and thus lead to caspase activation.</p><p>Finally, in reading this manuscript I was puzzled by the citation of a previous paper from earlier this year that reported very similar results using essentially an identical sensor. It became clear upon reading the Materials and methods section that the first authors of that paper (Tang et al., Sci Rep 2015) were previously in the Montell lab; it is cited here that the &quot;design and development of the approach and most of the reports were first obtained in the Montell lab&quot;. This is quite unfortunate, but since this was already published it seriously reduces the novelty of the present work. The present work does go a bit farther beyond what was reported earlier, with targeted genomic insertion, a more extensive analysis of different tissues and timing, and the report of a wing phenotype (although as noted above this also has been demonstrated previously).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe a method for detecting current or past caspase activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The CasExpress transgene is based on the GTrace method, and labels cells that are experiencing current caspase activity with RFP, and cells that have experienced past caspase activity and their progeny with GFP. A previously published paper describes a very similar construct (CaspaseTracker), but this work adds additional description and controls.</p><p>The most interesting aspect of the paper is the very large number of cells that have experienced caspase activation in the past or in progenitors. However, it is somewhat specious to claim that it is a surprise that caspase activity doesn't always kill cells. In fact, the first caspase (Caspase1) is not mainly a proapoptotic caspase. The caspase dredd in flies mainly plays a role in innate immunity. (In fact, if dredd can cleave the construct, the widespread gut staining could be explained by the immune response). A number of examples of non-apoptotic functions for pro-apoptotic caspases are also well described. However, this tool will be helpful to identify potential additional non-apoptotic caspase functions.</p><p>There are some concerns however, starting with the CasExpress construct. In theMethods, the numbering for the DIAP segment inserted into the construct seems to be incorrect. Previous work (which should be cited) shows that the cleavage site is at amino acid 20 (and the N-terminal aa that were changed are 21 and 22). Furthermore, and more problematic, is that this construct contains the entire BIR1 of DIAP1, which has caspase inhibitory function (Tenev et al. '04). Although the membrane bound construct may not inhibit cell death, it would be important to show that the cleaved form is not inhibitory. This could explain some of the survival of cells that had experienced caspase activation.</p><p>To examine the origin of the widespread caspase activity reporter shown in the adult, the authors look at the reporter expression in the embryo. However, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is somewhat puzzling. The embryo shown is almost certainly not stage 10 as stated, based on salivary gland morphology. It may be stage 14. At this stage, significant ongoing cell death, as detected with Acridine orange, TUNEL or cCP3, has been reported. Why is there so little RFP in the embryo? The Dronc null and p35 experiments are excellent controls showing that the reporter is caspase dependent, but does it somehow miss earlier caspase activation?</p><p>The wing size experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> could suggest that caspase activity contributes in a positive way to normal wing size. It is important to show that other transgenes expressed from this driver do not suppress wing growth. The driver alone is not a sufficient control. Also the graph exaggerates the wing size difference by starting at 4.2 rather than 0. The wing size should be normalized to another tissue, to account for differences in body size.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;CasExpress reveals widespread and diverse patterns of cell survival of caspase-3 activation during development in vivo&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favourably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), Utpal Banerjee (Reviewing editor), and two reviewers. The manuscript is much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers strongly feel, and you will likely agree, that it is critical to make sure that the caspase being activated in your system, and detected by the sensor is an apoptotic caspase rather than one related to immune response. Although the p35 experiment is valuable, the reviewers have pointed out that it will be important to show whole larval expression, particularly the gut which is quite active in its immune capability. Also, it is rather easy to demonstrate, by placing the sensor directly in a dredd mutant background, to rule out the possibility that this pathway might be involved. Thus, please include the image of the whole larva in p35 and also show sensor expression in a dredd mutant background (X-chromosome location of dredd makes this an easy cross to score in larvae).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10936.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1: The authors observe sensor activation in numerous tissues in the fly at different developmental stages.

We acknowledge that GFP+ cells are the sum of all cells that survive sensor activation and their progeny. We have carefully considered the writing to make sure that this point is clear.</p><p><italic>Alternatively, even the parent cell has died but not before producing progeny that will inherit the flipped-out cassette allowing expression of GFP.</italic> </p><p>We believe that it is highly unlikely that a cell could divide while dying. In our in vitro experiments on cultured mammalian cells, we have never seen even a single example of a cell doing this. We do observe cells going to the brink of death, recovering, and then dividing. Or they die. But we have never observed a cell begin to undergo apoptosis and then divide without full recovery so that one daughter dies and the other one lives. Recovery seems to be a pre-requisite for survival.</p><p><italic>It is also not clear whether the GFP+ (and RFP+ cells, for that matter) are truly &quot;clones&quot; or whether they sort together due to adhesive alterations due to caspase activation.</italic> The transient temperature shift experiments suggest that the groups of cells are likely clones. This is because the sizes of the cell clusters are larger when more time elapses between induction and analysis, consistent with an expanding clone. However, the reviewer’s alternative interpretation, which is an interesting idea, could certainly be true in some cases. Therefore, we have mentioned it in the Results (subsection “The temporal and spatial pattern of brain CasExpress”).</p><p><italic>The authors test for a physiological function of caspase activation by blocking its effects through expression of the pan-caspase inhibitor, p35. However, it should be noted that the loss of size control from blocking death in discs with expression of p35 has been previously demonstrated (de la Cova et al., Cell 2004).</italic> The reviewer is correct that de la Cova et al. inhibited caspase activity by expressing p35 in wing discs. However, they analyzed the effect on the size of the late 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larval wing disc, whereas we measured the effect on the final size of the adult wing. Importantly the result we present here has not been published before because de la Cova et al. looked at a different endpoint. It is interesting that there are similarities and differences between the two sets of findings. Neither of us observed the “expected” result, which would have been a larger organ (wing disc or wing) due to the presence of excess cells due to inhibition of cell death. They observed insteadincreased variability in the size of the developing disc, and we report asmaller adult wing. Both results are consistent with the idea that cell death plays a role in regulating tissue size, but not in the simple way that one would expect, i.e. removal of excess cells. Our result raises the possibility of cell autonomous compensatory proliferation following survival of caspase 3 activation, a concept not raised in any previous study.</p><p><italic>In the Discussion the authors bring up the idea that the sensor activation in imaginal discs, which occurs at several different points during larval development, could be due to competition between imaginal disc cells for growth factors. There is no citation for this supposition, and it would be helpful if they provided one. Although such competition clearly occurs in the brain, it is not at all clear this occurs in discs. The idea was previously proposed to occur (Moreno et al., Nature 2002) but the data remain controversial (later the same lab was unable to reproduce this effect; Martin et al., Development 2009).</italic> </p><p>We now cite a number of articles that refer to the idea that disc cells might compete for limiting growth factors (de Beco et al., 2012; Moreno and Rhiner, 2014; Vincent et al., 2013). The reviewer is correct that one particular growth factor, Dpp, does not appear to be limiting; however, the general idea that cells might compete for limiting growth factors or nutrients is still very much alive as a possibility. Wingless is another candidate growth factor, as would be circulating factors or even nutrients.</p><p><italic>Another explanation the authors might consider is that is that genetic/epigenetic alterations arise in some cells that render them less sensitive to growth or survival factors and thus lead to caspase activation.</italic> We agree that this is an interesting possibility. There may be intrinsic differences in cells that make them more or less sensitive to caspase activity levels. We also refer to the work of Peter Sorger (Flusberg and Sorger, 2015; Spencer and Sorger, 2011) for example, who studies differential sensitivity of cells to apoptotic stimuli. It is worth noting that most investigators have focused primarily on the idea that cells may differ in their sensitivity to stimuli that occur upstream of caspase activation because the field has not appreciated before that there even could be differential sensitivities to caspase activity itself, an idea supported by the current work as well as other very recent publications (Gama et al., 2014; Ichim et al., 2015).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: The most interesting aspect of the paper is the very large number of cells that have experienced caspase activation in the past or in progenitors.

The sensor is not expressed at high levels and is tethered to the membrane, providing an explanation for why it is not inhibitory. It also causes no discernible phenotype in any tissue and the animals are alive, fertile, and healthy. To make this point clear earlier in the paper, we have added text (subsection “Distinct spatial and temporal patterns of CasExpress during development”, second paragraph). We also added new data showing the very similar levels of acridine orange staining in <italic>w1118</italic> embryos compared to the DQVD and DQVA transgenic lines. This is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-C</xref>”.</p><p> <italic>To examine the origin of the widespread caspase activity reporter shown in the adult, the authors look at the reporter expression in the embryo.

Very few RFP-positive cells were evident in the single plane confocal image that was provided to show the salivary gland optimally. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-A</xref>” we now show a maximum intensity projection of a z-stack of images, which captures cells in more focal planes and it is clear that more RFP-positive cells are evident.</p><p><italic>The Dronc null and p35 experiments are excellent controls showing that the reporter is caspase dependent, but does it somehow miss earlier caspase activation?</italic> </p><p>We agree that the Dronc and p35 controls are essential. We don't think there is any reason why the sensor should miss earlier activation. It is clearly expressed in embryos, as shown in the supplement. As mentioned above, very few RFP-positive cells were evident in the single plane confocal image shown in the original image. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, we now show a maximum intensity projection of a z-stack of images, which captures cells in more focal planes, and it is clear that quite a few RFP-positive cells are evident. These cells appear to die eventually because we detect virtually no GFP in the embryo outside of the salivary gland. So cells that activate caspase in the embryo virtually all die. This is an interesting observation that suggests that sensitivity to caspase changes during development.</p><p> <italic>The wing size experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> could suggest that caspase activity contributes in a positive way to normal wing size.

Therefore, showing the whole larva would not be informative. It is not possible to express p35 globally together with the CasExpress sensor using existing fly lines or reagents. CasExpress uses Gal4 to drive expression of downstream markers such as RFP in a caspase-dependent manner. Therefore, it is not possible to use Gal4/UAS to drive expression of p35 throughout the larva. This is why we used GMR-p35 to drive expression specifically behind the morphogenetic furrow of the eye imaginal disc. Showing the whole larva would not be informative due to the restricted expression of p35. We are unaware of any existing transgene expressing p35 directly from a ubiquitous promoter, likely because this would be dominant lethal anyway.</p></body></sub-article></article>
