of the olfactory cortex and receives both bottom-up odor signals and top-down signals. However, the roles of the vTT in odor-coding and integration of inputs are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the involvement of the vTT in these processes by recording the activity from individual vTT neurons during the performance of learned odor-guided reward-directed tasks in mice. We report that individual vTT cells are highly tuned to a specific behavioral epoch of learned tasks, whereby the duration of increased firing correlated with the temporal length of the behavioral epoch. The peak time for increased firing among recorded vTT cells encompassed almost the entire temporal window of the tasks. Collectively, our results indicate that vTT cells are selectively activated during a specific behavioral context and that the function of the vTT changes dynamically in a context-dependent manner during goal-directed behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tenia tecta</kwd><kwd>olfactory cortex</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows 18J21358</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiotani</surname><given-names>Kazuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research 16K14557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manabe</surname><given-names>Hiroyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas 25135708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manabe</surname><given-names>Hiroyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manabe</surname><given-names>Hiroyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Narishige Neuroscience Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manabe</surname><given-names>Hiroyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research(A) 16H02061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakurai</surname><given-names>Yoshio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas 18H05088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakurai</surname><given-names>Yoshio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows 19J20733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanisumi</surname><given-names>Yuta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Individual neurons of ventral tenia tecta which is a part of olfactory cortex tune to specific time windows in the behavioral context during odor-guided goal-directed behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammals, odor signals detected by sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium are transmitted via the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex. Mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb send axonal projections to various areas of the olfactory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Igarashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neville and Haberly, 2004</xref>). Despite growing knowledge on how odor molecules are coded by olfactory sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>) and how neural circuits in the olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex process odor signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mori and Sakano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wilson and Sullivan, 2011</xref>), our understanding of how distinct regions of the olfactory cortex transform olfactory sensory information into behavioral outputs remains limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). In the present study, we examined how the ventral tenia tecta (vTT), a relatively unexplored area of the olfactory cortex located in the ventromedial aspect of the olfactory peduncle, transforms the perception of odor signals into reward-directed behaviors.</p><p>Physiological studies of the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices have revealed that neocortical sensory area neurons receive sensory signals from the environment, as well as top-down signals that are generated internally by higher order cognitive and behavioral decision processes, including attention, reward-prediction, working memory, and behavioral choice processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gilbert and Sigman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roelfsema and de Lange, 2016</xref>). In olfactory circuits, olfactory tubercle neurons encode goal-directed behaviors and exhibit enhanced odor responses when animals selectively attend to specific odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gadziola and Wesson, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, c-Fos expression (a marker of neuronal activity) increases in different cells in the olfactory tubercle during distinct motivated behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murata et al., 2015</xref>). However, the physiological and behavioral functions of the vTT are poorly understood. To examine whether vTT neurons are modulated by cognitive and behavioral decision-making processes, we recorded the spike activity of individual vTT cells during the performance of a series of odor-guided, goal-directed behaviors in mice.</p><p>We observed that the firing of individual vTT neurons during odor-guided goal-directed behaviors was highly tuned to distinct task-elements that occurred in relation to the flow of goal-directed tasks, with each task-element occurring in a specific behavioral context. Our results indicate that vTT functions are dynamic rather than fixed, whereby changes in information processing mode occur in a context-dependent manner during a sequence of feeding and drinking behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activity of vTT cells during the odor presentation phase of the odor-guided go/no-go task</title><p>To examine how vTT cell firing changes in relation to odor-guided, goal-directed behaviors, we recorded the neural activity of vTT cells during an odor-guided go/no-go task with a water reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this task, a light stimulus presented at the right odor port signaled to a water-restricted mouse to start the task and insert its nose into the odor port. At the moment of the nose poke, an odor cue was presented for 500 ms in the odor port. The mouse was required to keep its nose in the odor port during odor presentation to sniff the odor cue. After odor presentation, the light was turned off, and the mouse could withdraw its nose from the odor port. If the go odor cue (eugenol) was presented, the mouse was required to move to and poke its head into the left water port within a timeout period of 2 s to obtain a water reward (go trial). At the water port, the mouse was required to keep its head in the port for 300 ms to wait for water delivery. A drop of water (6 μL) was delivered 300 ms after the head poke. If the no-go odor cue (amyl acetate) was presented, the mouse was required to stay near the odor port for 2 s after the end of odor delivery without poking its head into the water port (no-go trial). After the mice were well trained, their behavioral accuracy remained above 80% throughout the session. The median duration of nose pokes after the onset of odor stimulation was 839 ms (interquartile range: 703–1003 ms) in the go trials and 738 ms (interquartile range: 621–946 ms) in the no-go trials (57 sessions from six mice).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>vTT cell activity patterns during the odor presentation phase of the odor-guided go/no-go task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the odor-guided go/no-go task.

As the vTT receives direct inputs from mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory bulb, we first focused on whether vTT cells exhibited odor cue-responsive activity during odor presentation. We observed that a subset of vTT cells increased their firing rates during the odor presentation phase during both go and no-go trials (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To quantify the dependence of firing rate on the odor presentation phase, we calculated firing rate changes from baseline (pre-odor cue period, 1.2 to 1 s before the odor port entry) in sliding bins (width, 100 ms; step, 20 ms) using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis approach. We calculated the area under the ROC curve (auROC) at each time bin (spike data were aligned to the onset of odor valve opening). auROC values ranged from −1 to +1, with positive and negative values reflecting increased and decreased firing rates relative to baseline, respectively.

Across all the cells, many exhibited significant increases in firing rate relative to both the go and no-go odor cue presentation phases (top color maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, p&lt;0.01, permutation test). No significant differences in the magnitude of these increases between the go and no-go odor cue phases at each time point were observed (bottom lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, p&gt;0.01, Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test). Changes in firing rate in individual vTT cells exhibited similar time courses for go and no-go trials. We quantified this by calculating the correlation coefficients of response profiles between correct go trials and correct no-go trials for each cell (top lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This analysis revealed that the activity of vTT cells was strongly correlated between go and no-go odor cue presentation phases, whereas different cell pairs did not exhibit this correlation (bottom lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, p&lt;10<sup>−13</sup>, two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). These results suggest that individual vTT cells did not represent odor cue differences between go and no-go trials during odor presentation phases. We therefore hypothesized that firing activity mainly reflected animal behavior and was dependent on task context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Behavior-specific activity of vTT cells in the odor-guided go/no-go task</title><p>Many vTT cells exhibited an increase in firing rate during specific behaviors over the course of the odor-guided go/no-go task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Across the population, almost all vTT cells exhibited a significant increase in firing rates during a specific behavior in each epoch (right color map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, individual vTT cells exhibited a significant decrease in firing rates in certain epochs. These results were independent of the size of the window in which auROC values were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To evaluate the relationships between epoch-specific firing rates, vTT cells were classified into five groups based on their tuning peak time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, see Materials and methods) with reference to the five go trial behavioral epochs.

We subsequently investigated how vTT cells would respond during each epoch if the behavioral epochs were prolonged to a multi-second timescale. Moreover, we also assessed whether the activity pattern of vTT cells in the go/no-go task could be generalized to different contexts and motivated behaviors. To this end, we performed an odor-guided eating/no-eating task with food rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Mice were placed on a food restriction schedule and trained to either choose to consume food in a dish or avoid consuming it using dish odor-cuing. We randomly presented sugar on a dish with one of three different odor cues (eugenol, vanilla essence, or almond essence). The dish was then placed at an arbitrary position in the test cage. During the learning phase, eugenol and vanilla essence odors were associated with a sugar reward, whereas the almond essence odor was associated with a sugar reward followed by aversive consequences (a LiCl injection). After the learning phase, mice would approach the dish and proceed to consume its contents if either the eugenol or vanilla essence odor was presented (eating trials). Approximately 6 s after the mouse began eating during the eating trials, the dish was removed even if the animal was still eating. The sequence of behaviors consistently exhibited by mice during the course of the eating trial epochs included approach (approaching the food dish), eating (from touching the dish to eating), and escape behaviors after food removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

If this were true, the response patterns of vTT cells would change in a different context, even for the same behavior. We assessed nose poke behaviors during the odor-sampling epoch of the odor-guided go/no-go task and observed that a subset of cells exhibited differences in firing rates between the go and no-go trials just before the animals exited the odor port, despite involving the same nose-poking behavior. We quantified this by calculating go-cue versus no-go-cue trial preference using ROC analyses with real-time data.

Although many of these vTT cells exhibited peak firing ~100 ms after odor onset, they did not encode learned odor differences during the odor presentation phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Firing rate differences in a subset of cells emerged just before the odor port exit during which mice performed behavioral choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Therefore, we hypothesized that the firing activity of vTT cells mainly reflected animal behavior and was dependent on task context.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Context-dependent neural activity in the vTT</title><p>During the odor-guided go/no-go task used here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), vTT cells exhibited a specific firing rate tuning to each behavioral epoch (e.g. moving to the odor port, odor-sampling in the odor port, moving to the water reward port, waiting for the reward, and obtaining the water reward) of the go trials. Furthermore, these cells tended to suppress their firing activity during epochs other than the most preferred epoch.</p><p>To evaluate context-dependent tuning of vTT cells, we employed a different odor-guided task. We identified three unique cellular subtypes based on firing pattern differences that occurred during the odor-guided eating/no-eating task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). One cell type exhibited significant increases in firing during dish approach but tended to be silent during eating and food removal. A different subset of cells tended to fire more when the mouse approached the dish, during eating, and when the dish was removed. vTT cells also tended to suppress their firing during behavioral epochs other than their most preferred epoch.</p><p>Across tasks, we observed that tuning durations for each behavioral epoch correlated with the duration of behavioral epochs. In addition, the position of tuning peak times varied across the time course of the behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Further, many cells exhibited a short duration of activity at transitions between epochs, suggestive of a role in linking the two epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, we observed that vTT cells tuned to the odor-sampling epoch exhibited different activity between go and no-go trials just before odor port withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), implying that individual vTT cells were tuned to a specific time window in task-modulated behavioral contexts rather than to a specific behavior.</p><p>Collectively, these results indicate that each vTT cell has a unique behavior- and context-dependent preference, demonstrated by tuning peak time and tuning duration. These properties of vTT cells may contribute to the representation of a series of specific behavioral context information (i.e. an episode) during odor-guided behaviors in the vTT. As vTT cells send their axons to other olfactory cortex areas such as the AON and piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luskin and Price, 1983a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luskin and Price, 1983b</xref>), we speculate that the vTT may provide information to widespread olfactory areas regarding moment-to-moment changes in behaviors within certain behavioral contexts. Indeed, context-dependent modulation of neural activity is observed in mitral cells in the OB, an area that receives direct inputs from the vTT during the performance of odor-reinforcer association learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kay and Laurent, 1999</xref>).</p><p>We conjecture that behavioral context-dependent inputs from other higher-brain areas may contribute to the context-dependent activity of vTT cells because it is difficult to explain how behavioral context-dependent activity may otherwise be induced by bottom-up olfactory sensory input alone. The vTT receives direct top-down inputs from the mPFC and indirect inputs from other olfactory cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luskin and Price, 1983b</xref>). In particular, mPFC neurons are implicated in contextual encoding when animals move between different environmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hyman et al., 2012</xref>) and preferentially fire at a specific position in the trajectory of a maze during a working memory task involving odor place-matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>). Along with the evidence presented here, these findings suggest that context-specific activity of the mPFC may contribute to the generation of context-dependent activity in the vTT. In addition, Allen et al. recently reported that odor cue-induced reward-predicting responses were not restricted to the olfactory cortex but occurred throughout the brain, including sensory, motor, and prefrontal cortices, as well as subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that context-dependent cells are located throughout the brain, and their activity may drive specific information processing modes in the brain. In this regard, the vTT may play an important role in entraining specific information processing modes in olfactory areas by acting as a hub, amplifier, or rectifier that sends context-dependent signals from the mPFC to broad olfactory areas.</p><p>Based on the firing patterns in the task behavioral epochs, we classified vTT cells into five and three cell types for the odor-guided go/no-go task and odor-guided eating/no-eating task, respectively. The tuning durations of these cells were strongly correlated with behavioral epoch durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, the tuning durations of cells classified in the eating epoch showed a bimodal distribution, whereby some cells exhibited tuning durations that lasted for almost the entire eating epoch, and other cells exhibited short duration phasic responses. In addition, the neural activity of vTT cells was not always confined to a particular epoch. For example, many cells that increased their firing rates during the eating epoch started to fire prior to this epoch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). Moreover, individual vTT cells exhibited a unique tuning duration and tuning peak time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We speculate that a subset of vTT cells are tuned to smaller scale behaviors or task elements involving moment-to-moment changes in a particular behavioral context. For instance, vTT cells, which exhibited peak firing at the transition between epochs, especially in the eating/no-eating task, may encode the initiation of movement.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Putative encoding of internal states by vTT cells</title><p>During odor-guided goal-directed tasks, many vTT cells increased their firing rates prior to the onset of the most preferred behavioral epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). These observations corroborate the idea that vTT cell activity is modulated both by signals during ongoing behavior as well as predictions about future behavior. Although a population of vTT cells increased their discharge rate during odor presentation in the odor-guided go/no-go task, their mean firing rate was not significantly different between go and no-go trials. Indeed, firing rate differences emerged just before mice exited the odor port. We speculate that vTT cell activity during the prediction of future behaviors was not driven directly by olfactory sensory inputs during ongoing behavior; rather, it was induced, directly or indirectly, by the piriform cortex and top-down inputs from higher cognitive and motivational centers in the prefrontal cortex (including mPFC) and amygdala. These regions play key roles in odor identification, odor discrimination, motivation, reward prediction, and decision-making. vTT cells fired with different intensities according to distinct cue types during the eating epoch of the odor-guided eating/no-eating task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). These response profiles may be underpinned by changes in the palatability of the reward flavors presented, since mice were exposed to both olfactory and taste stimuli during eating. Based on these results, we speculate that the firing patterns of vTT cells are influenced by both external contexts as well as internal states.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Despite its strengths, the present study did not address whether or how top-down inputs influence vTT cells in particular behavioral contexts.

Each nose-poke port was equipped with a white light-emitting diode (LED) and infrared photodiodes. Interruption of the infrared beam generated a transistor-transistor-logic (TTL) pulse, thus signaling the entry of the mouse head into the port. The odor delivery port was equipped with stainless steel tubing connected to a custom-made olfactometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Uchida and Mainen, 2003</xref>).

Water reward delivery was based on gravitational flow, controlled by a solenoid valve (The Lee Company, CT), and connected via Tygon tubing to stainless steel tubing.

During the training sessions, mice learned to obtain water rewards at the left water port, move from the right odor port to left odor port, and associate odor cues with the correct action. Each trial began with illumination of the LED light at the right odor port, which acted as a signal for the mouse to nose poke into that port. A nose poke into the odor port resulted in the delivery of one of the two odor cues for 500 ms. Mice were required to maintain their nose pokes during odor stimulation to sniff the odor. After odor stimulation, the LED light was turned off and the mice could withdraw their nose from the odor port. If eugenol odor (go odor cue) was presented, the mice were required to move to and nose poke into the left water reward port within a timeout period of 2 s. At the water port, the mice were required to maintain their nose poke for 300 ms before water delivery began. Next, 6 μL of water was delivered as a reward.

The odor cues were eugenol (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and vanilla essence (NARIZUKA Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), diluted to 10% in mineral oil. During initial training sessions, odor trials were randomly presented. After learning the association between the dish, odor, and sugar reward, mice would approach and touch the dish, dig through the overlying bedding, and proceed to consume the sucrose. As we used large beddings (the size of each bedding about 10 × 5 mm), the bedding did not mix completely with the sucrose. They could get mixed up somewhat, but the sucrose was covered with a small amount of new bedding before each trial so that the sucrose was not able to be accessed without digging the bedding. Mice required at least seven initial training sessions.</p><p>After the initial training sessions, mice were trained to associate an almond essence odor (NARIZUKA Corporation), diluted to 10% in mineral oil with an aversive consequence (malaise) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raineki et al., 2009</xref>). This was performed by allowing mice to approach the dish with the almond essence odor and consume the sucrose in the dish for 1 hr, after which mice were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 M of lithium chloride (LiCl, 0.01 mL/g). After receiving the LiCl injection, mice would continue to approach the dish with the almond odor but did not consume the sucrose (no-eating response). No-eating responses were established in a single session.</p><p>After conditioned aversion training, performance in the odor-guided eating/no-eating task was examined. Sucrose was randomly presented on a dish with one of three different odor cues (eugenol, vanilla essence, or almond essence). The almond essence odor was presented with a 20% probability. Powder chow was also presented on a dish with a 20% probability among trials. Approximately 6 s after the mice began to eat the dish was abruptly removed. The inter-trial interval (ITI) was explicitly not determined to increase the unpredictability of events. Correct trials were defined as approach and consumption for eugenol, vanilla essence, and powder chow trials. For almond essence trials, correct trials were defined as approach but no consumption or no approach for at least 30 s after the dish was presented. After the mice were well trained, their behavioral accuracy remained above 80% throughout the session. Mice were subjected to 40–60 daily trials of the task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with medetomidine (0.75 mg/kg i.p.), midazolam (4.0 mg/kg i.p.), and butorphanol (5.0 mg/kg i.p.), and implanted with a custom-built microdrive of three or four tetrodes in the vTT (2.6 mm anterior to bregma, 0.4 mm lateral to the midline, 4.0 mm from the brain surface). Individual tetrodes consisted of four twisted polyimide-coated tungsten wires (California Fine Wire, single wire diameter 12.5 μm, gold-plated to less than 500 kΩ). The tips and sides of the tetrodes were coated with DiI (Molecular Probes, OR). Two additional screws were threaded into the bone above the cerebellum for reference. The electrodes were connected to an electrode interface board (EIB-18, Neuralynx, MT) on a microdrive. A microdrive array was fixed to the skull with LOCTITE 454 (Henkel Corporation, Düsseldorf, Germany). After the completion of surgery, mice received atipamezole (0.75 mg/kg i.p.) to reverse the effects of medetomidine and enable a shorter recovery period. Analgesics were administered post-surgery (ketoprofen, 5 mg/kg, i.p.). Behavioral training resumed at least 1 week after surgery.</p><p>Electrical signals were obtained with either a Cheetah recording system (Neuralynx) or open-source hardware (Open Ephys). For unit recordings, signals were sampled at 32 kHz in NeuraLynx or 30 kHz in Open Ephys and band-pass filtered at 600–6,000 Hz. After each recording, tetrodes were lowered by 20, 40, or 75 μm more by turning a screw of the microdrive to obtain new units.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analyses</title><p>All data analyses were performed using built-in software in MATLAB 2019a (The Mathworks, Inc, MA).</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Behavioral data analyses</title><p>For the odor-guided go/no-go task, the accuracy rate was calculated as the total percentage of successful responses in the go and no-go trials in a session. Mice performed up to 600 trials in each session per day. For the odor-guided eating/no-eating task, the accuracy rate was calculated as the average percentage of trials in which mice successfully consumed sucrose paired with eugenol or vanilla essence odor, successfully consumed the powder chow, or did not consume sucrose paired with almond essence odor. Mice performed 40–60 trials in each session per day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Spike sorting</title><p>Spikes were sorted into clusters offline based on their waveform energy, peak amplitudes, and first principal components from the four tetrode channels using an automated spike-separation algorithm KlustaKwik (K.D. Harris). Resulting classifications were corrected and refined manually with MClust software (A.D. Redish). Clusters were considered single units only when the following criteria were met: (1) refractory period (2 ms) violations were less than 0.2% of all spikes and (2) isolation distance, estimated as the distance from the center of the identified cluster to the nearest cluster based on the Mahalanobis distance, was more than 20. To examine the behavioral correlates of vTT cell firing patterns, we selected vTT cells with average firing rates during the trials that were greater than 0.3 Hz for further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Spike train analyses</title><p>In the odor-guided go/no-go task, neural and behavioral data were synchronized by inputting each event timestamp from the Bpod behavioral control system into the electric signal recording system. To calculate firing rates during tasks, peri-event time histograms (PETHs) were calculated using a 20 ms bin width and smoothed by convolving spike trains with a 60 ms wide Gaussian filter (bottom lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the odor-guided eating/no-eating task, timestamps were acquired for each event (onset of dish approach, initial dish contact, and dish removal) from frames of recorded behavioral videos, which were synchronized to spike data. To calculate cell firing rates during tasks, PETHs were calculated using a 500 ms bin width and smoothed by convolving spike trains with a 500 ms wide Gaussian filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Event-aligned spike histograms</title><p>To examine the relationship between firing rate changes among individual vTT cells and the development of behavioral epochs in behavioral tasks, EASHs were generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito and Doya, 2015</xref>). As behavioral epoch durations varied for each trial, median epoch durations were first calculated. In the odor-guided go/no-go task, the median duration of odor sampling epochs (from the onset of the go odor cue to exiting the odor port) was 839 ms, and the median duration of moving epochs (from odor port exit to water port entry) was 455 ms. Spike timing during each epoch and for each trial was linearly transformed to correspond with the median duration of each behavioral epoch. The number of spikes in each epoch was preserved. We defined the approach epoch (500 ms before odor port entry), waiting epoch (300 ms reward delay, from entry into the water port to the onset of water reward), and drinking epoch (1000 ms after the onset of the water reward). These epochs were not applied to the transformation because their durations did not change across trials. In this manner, a regular raster plot was transformed into event-aligned raster plots (left plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An EASH was subsequently calculated using a 20 ms bin width and smoothed by convolving spike trains with a 60 ms wide Gaussian filter from the raster plot.</p><p>In the odor-guided eating/no-eating task, the median duration of the approach epoch (from the start of approach behavior to contacting the dish) was 2.57 s, and the median duration of the eating epoch (from the start of consumption to food removal) was 5.44 s. Spike timing during each epoch of each trial was linearly transformed into a corresponding median duration for each epoch. The number of spikes in each epoch was preserved. We defined the food removal epoch (2 s after the start of food removal), which was not applied to this transformation because the duration of this epoch did not change across trials. Thus, regular raster plots were transformed into event-aligned raster plots (left plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). An EASH was subsequently calculated using a 500 ms bin width and smoothed by convolving spike trains with a 500 ms wide Gaussian filter from the raster plots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>ROC analyses</title><p>To quantify firing rate changes, we used an algorithm based on ROC analyses that calculates the ability of an ideal observer to classify whether a given spike rate was recorded in one of two conditions (e.g. during go or no-go odor cue presentation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Felsen and Mainen, 2008</xref>). We defined an auROC equal to 2 (ROC area – 0.5), with the measure ranging from –1 to 1, where –one signified the strongest possible value for one alternative and one signified the strongest possible value for the other.</p><p>The statistical significance of ROC analyses was determined using a permutation test. For this test, ROC curves were recalculated after all firing rates were randomly assigned to either of the two groups (e.g. go-cue trial group and no-go-cue trial group) arbitrarily. This procedure was repeated a large number of times (500 times for all analyses) to obtain a distribution of values. The fraction of random values exceeding the actual value was then calculated. Based on this quantification, the auROC value for each cell was calculated along with a time course for the go/no-go or eating/no-eating tasks in sliding windows (in overlapping 100 ms windows starting every 20 ms for the go/no-go task and overlapping 500 ms windows starting every 100 ms for the odor-guided eating/no-eating task). The auROC values during the go or no-go trials were then calculated by quantifying firing rate changes from baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). A similar procedure was employed for the eating trials by quantifying firing rate changes from baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and for go trials by quantifying firing rate changes relative to no-go trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For all analyses, significance was tested with α = 0.01. Only cells with a minimum number of 10 trials for each analyzed condition were included in these analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Evaluation of neural tuning to specific behaviors</title><p>To determine the timepoint at which each vTT cell increased its firing rate the most and the duration of increased firing during the task, two measures were calculated from each auROC value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>):</p><list list-type="order"><list-item> <p>Tuning peak time: the time corresponding to the peak of the significant points when a cell significantly increased its firing rate from baseline for five or more consecutive bins (p&lt;0.01, permutation test)</p></list-item> <list-item> <p>Tuning duration: the duration, including the tuning peak time, for which increased firing was significant (p&lt;0.01, permutation test)</p></list-item></list><p>In the odor-guided go/no-go task, we classified vTT cells with tuning peak times (n = 217 cells) into five groups based on the epoch in which tuning peak time occurred during correct go trials.

In total, 19% of all cells had tuning peak times during the approach epoch, 20% during the eating epoch, and 12% during the food removal epoch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-7"><title>Relative distributions of significant responses</title><p>The distribution of behavioral epoch-specific firing for each cell type (yellow and blue shadows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>) was calculated as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). First, for each cell group, the number of cells with significant excitatory (or suppressed) firing during each time bin for each task was calculated. Their distribution was estimated using Gaussian kernel smoothing via the fitdist function in MATLAB with a bandwidth of 100 ms in the odor-guided go/no-go task and 500 ms in the odor-guided eating/no-eating task. Second, the distribution of the significant excitatory (or suppressed) firing was compared with the cell-shuffled data for each cell group. To calculate the 99% confidence intervals of this distribution, we ran 1000 iterations in which cellular group identities were randomized. We then calculated the distribution of significant excitatory (or suppressed) firing of each cell group, as above. For each bin in the tasks, the edges of the confidence interval were at the 0.5<sup>th</sup> and 99.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the distribution, as calculated from the cell-shuffled data (gray-shaded area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The significance of activity patterns for each cell group was determined by comparing the standard deviations of the data with those obtained from the cell-shuffled data, in which shuffling was performed 1000 times by randomizing the cell selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-8"><title>SVM decoding analyses</title><p>A support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with a linear kernel as a classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cury and Uchida, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miura et al., 2012</xref>) and a Matlab function (fitcsvm) were used for analyses. All analyses were conducted on trial data pooled across animals. A matrix containing concatenated firing rates for each trial and each cell was the input for the classifier. The matrix dimensions were the number of cells by the number of trials. To avoid over-fitting, k-fold cross-validation (k = 10) was used to calculate the decoding accuracy of trial type discriminations. To compute decoding accuracy, 40 trials for each trial type (from the start of the session) were selected as the data set. Next, the data set was partitioned into 10 equal parts; one part was used for testing, and the remaining parts were used for training the classifier. This process was repeated 10 times to test each individual part. The mean value of the accuracy was then used for decoding accuracy. To compute the decoding accuracy of a 100 ms bin window (step: 20 ms), the classifier was trained and tested with a 100 ms bin window (step: 20 ms). In order to verify the statistical significance of the computed accuracy, we estimated the accuracy distribution on label-shuffled data using 1000 repetitions of a random selection from the data set.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed in Matlab 2019a.

In this study, Shiotani and colleagues characterized the activity of vTT neurons in mice performing two types of odor-guided behavioral tasks. The first task is a nose-poke based Go/No-Go task using odor cues. Although vTT is considered an olfactory area, receiving direct inputs from the olfactory bulb, very few neurons responded to odors in an odor-specific manner. Instead, many neurons were excited at a specific task epoch defined by salient task events (approaching, odor sampling, choice movement, waiting for reward, and drinking a water reward). Most of the neurons that responded during odor sampling did not distinguish Go versus No-go cues. Next, the authors developed a new task where different odors predicted a food reward (sucrose) followed by nothing or a food reward followed by a LiCl injection (aversive consequence). Similar to those findings in the first task, the authors observed that neuronal activations are associated with a specific task epoch although the two tasks involved behaviors on different timescales (a fraction of a second versus seconds). Based on these results, the authors suggest that vTT neurons can be regarded as &quot;scene cells&quot;.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is likely the first study that characterized the activity of vTT neurons in behaving animals. The reviewers appreciated the novelty of the study, and they found various observations interesting. However, they raised various issues that need to be addressed before publication of this study in <italic>eLife</italic>. First, the main conclusion that vTT neurons are &quot;scene cells&quot; warrants more careful evaluations. The concept of &quot;scene cells&quot; is neither well-defined nor sufficiently supported by the presented data. For instance, reviewer #1 points out that a &quot;scene cell&quot; suggests that the activity should be relatively stable during each task event, but many neurons appear to exhibit transient activations at transitions between different task events. Reviewer #2 suggests removing the term altogether. We would like to see more concrete definitions and justification of this term. Alternatively, the authors might want to seek for different terms that better summarize the observed activity or not &quot;naming&quot; these cells. Additionally, the reviewers raised a number of technical and interpretational issues as described below. Although addressing these issues likely do not require additional experiments, we would like the authors to address these issues in a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes neural representations of vTT neurons during odor-guided tasks. The authors use tetrodes to record from populations of vTT neurons while mice are performing either a go/no go two-odor discrimination task, or a task in which mice search for and then eat odorized chow. Little is known about what vTT neurons do, and the authors' results are novel and convincing, and will be interesting to the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors measured auROC values and described these frequently as &quot;normalized firing rates&quot; (e.g. Figure 1D, E etc). The auROC is a measure of the discriminability of two distributions and not of response strength. If the authors want to talk about the size and strength of the responses then they should recalculate their data using either raw spike rates, or z-scores if they want to normalize across cells. If they want to simply make the point that response distributions are different then auROC analyses are fine.</p><p>The temporal resolution of the analyses is pretty course. If the authors use smaller time bins for the physiology as well as the behavioral analyses they may uncover additional dynamics within each epoch. (For the go/no-go assays they use 20 ms bins and a 60 ms smoothing kernel; for the eating/no-eating assay they use 500 ms binning and 500 ms smoothing.) There are a number of reasons why this may be valuable:</p><p>2) First, the authors want to convince us that vTT encodes behavioral scenes, and Figure 4A indicates a strong correlation between the behavioral and neural activity durations. However, Figure 4B indicates that a very large fraction of the recorded cells actually fire at the transitions between epochs. If this is the case, then can we really say that cells in vTT encode behavioral scenes?</p><p>3) Second, as very little is known about vTT additional insight might be gained by using a more fine-grained analysis. For example, in Figure 4A, the authors show a strong correlation between median behavioral duration and median firing activity duration. However, the eating epoch, which drives the strong correlation in 4A, has a bimodal distribution of neural activity durations, with many cells having brief responses (&lt; 1 second) and other cells having responses that last for most of the eating epoch. I suspect that there could be multiple classes of neurons (e.g. a transient food odor population and a sustained eating population) embedded within their relatively small number of existing classes.</p><p>4) In the Discussion section, the authors propose that vTT neurons may be coincidence detectors for sensory and top-down inputs. Their tracing studies, which are consistent with older studies, indeed indicate that vTT receives mPFC input, which could be the source of top-down input. However, there are at least two reasons why their results are inconsistent with this model. First, only 25% of their cells were odor responsive yet most of the other cells responded at one or another of the behavioral epochs, even when there was ostensibly no (strong) olfactory input; second, the odor responses to two different odors were essentially identical, Both of these are difficult to reconcile with a system that is strongly driven, or even contingent on direct (from bulb) olfactory input, and instead suggest a circuit that is predominantly driven by top-down input and has surprisingly little (if any) bottom-up sensory drive. For example, do the authors think that vTT neurons would respond similarly or differently to an auditory go/no-go task?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a compelling and well-written manuscript on a population of neurons which has received to date the least attention of all systems in the 'olfactory cortex'. The ventral tenia tecta has an unknown function and is quite small thus making monitoring activity of these cells technically difficult. Here, the authors uncovered that vTT neurons are recruited in mice during engagement in two different odor-guided behavioral tasks, and that the modulation occurs by separate groups of neurons, during different behavioral epochs of the tasks. The authors have shined light on something novel in the context of an underexplored brain region (a unique opportunity which is exciting) and did so in two different tasks which helps show the generalization of the outcomes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors include data on the chemical identity of vTT neurons (not those recorded from necessarily) and also their connectivity which is tangential to the main story and does not directly support or clarify any pressing matters needed to support major conclusions. We appreciate what the authors are trying to do with these data (helping readers know where input arrives from, and what the output may influence), but these data are not worthy of being included in this manuscript and do not add to the main message in a meaningful way. The main story is the unit data – which is clear, strong, and on its own makes an excellent paper.</p><p>2) There is pervasive speculation in this paper and also instances of hypotheses being foreshadowed as to be tested, but never acted upon.</p><p>Regarding the latter, the authors state the hypothesis in the Introduction that higher order top-down inputs are generating changes in the vTT – yet this hypothesis is never tested in this paper. This is never tested and the anatomy in question above (point 1) does not test that hypothesis neither.</p><p>We are all for some appropriate scholarly speculation in Discussion section, but in many cases it reads as if the authors are possibly writing about data they have yet to acquire or just did not include. The speculation in the Discussion section that learned odor information about certain contexts is handled &quot;mainly&quot; by the vTT is not warranted by these data which only investigated [albeit compellingly and carefully] vTT activity. At a simplistic level, it is not intuitive that such a small brain region would exert major behavioral influence in contrast to other regions like PCX or OT which also encode learned odor information and have vast connectivity with downstream structures important with affect and behavior. Also, there are many mentions of top-down inputs to vTT being important mediators of the task modulation shown by the authors. Yet this is never shown and are not necessary for the main story of the paper. These findings are interesting in themselves and worthy of publication without having to try to make some circuitry story embedded within. The authors need to seriously restrict speculation about top-down input and also again, remove hypotheses about top-down inputs being integral for the unit activity they report. Focusing the discussion on why the results at hand matter and how they advance the field would be appreciated. Including more discussion on how these results compare/contrast with behavioral modulation of PCX, OT, and OB units would be helpful to appreciate if and how vTT is unique.</p><p>3) The authors define the modulated vTT cells as &quot;scene&quot; cells: &quot;We found that the firing of individual vTT neurons during odor-guided goal-directed behaviors was highly tuned to distinct behavioral &quot;scenes&quot; (i.e., distinct task-elements that occurred in relation to the flow of goal-directed tasks, with each task-element occurring in a specific behavioral context). This is an attractive term, sure, but it is arguable then that almost all single units monitored in the olfactory system, or many other brain regions for that matter, could also be called &quot;scene&quot; cells and thus packaging them with this name is not optimal. For instance, in 1980 Karpov recorded mitral and tufted cells from behaving rabbits as they approached boxes containing odor which they were motivated for. The authors reported spiking upon approach, upon odor, and upon food intake. These results [while certainly not with the rigor in analyses as the authors used in the present manuscript] indicate that mitral cells encode &quot;distinct task-elements that occurred in relation to the flow of goal-directed tasks, with each task-element occurring in a specific behavioral context&quot; – also fitting the authors definition of a &quot;scene cell&quot;. We could say the same if we compare and contrast the work herein to many other awake unit recording papers whether in the context of odors or not, where the authors report, of all task modulated units, some are modulated upon anticipation, instrumental responding, stimulus delivery, reward seeking, reward acquisition, etc. There is a possibly latent reason in every one of these papers that authors do not try to name the units with a descriptor – ultimately the descriptor would become useless in the field. This is unlike descriptors bestowed upon other cell types, like &quot;head direction&quot; cells – in these cases one must do many manipulations while recording from the same cell to prove head-direction encoding. Fortunately, this is an easy fix for the authors to remove &quot;scene&quot; throughout the paper. Including a succinct discussion on this concept however is very welcome.</p><p>4) It seems the use of the decoding is not fully taken advantage of by the authors. The decoding should be compared to a shuffled baseline, or statistically validated somehow, to see at what point the classification accuracy is significantly greater than chance… in this paper the authors use it only to say that when trained on all units, the classifier increases in accuracy before odor port exit (so it tracks with the behavior and not the odor itself). But wouldn't it be more compelling to see how classification accuracy differs across the populations they identified? This would strengthen the conclusions that these different populations of modulated neurons are handling information differently. This we will leave at the will of the authors though since, while likely informative, it may delay publication.</p><p>5) Details on adjustment of tetrode locations between recording sessions is needed to ensure redundant sampling of units did not occur. The authors state some mice were recorded from for 18 sessions (in table), but if the tetrodes were driven enough to rule out resampling the same units on subsequent days, but how 18 movements can occur in the vTT which is so slender on its dorsal/ventral axis is not clear. What was the driving depth? How were new units identified following new depths?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57268.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is likely the first study that characterized the activity of vTT neurons in behaving animals.

First, as they pointed out, we surely do not have sufficient data to define vTT cells as “scene cells”. Therefore, we have decided to exclude the term in the revised paper.

We then exhibited the correlation between neural activity durations and behavioral epoch durations (Figure 4A). However, as the reviewer pointed out, some cells showed transient phasic activities at the transition between epochs. In addition, we also exhibited that individual vTT neurons had unique tuning characteristics during development of the tasks, demonstrated by the tuning peak and tuning duration (Figure 4B). Based on these results, we hypothesized that individual vTT cells tuned to distinct behavioral contexts, that is, distinct task-elements occurred in relation to the flow of tasks. We also assumed that these activities were modulated not only by external contextual inputs, but also by internal information such as motivation, memory retrieval, prediction, decision-making, and so on. Then, we named such externally and internally modulated cells as “scene cells”. However, the definition of scene cells in the previous manuscript was inadequate and there were not enough data to support the term.
