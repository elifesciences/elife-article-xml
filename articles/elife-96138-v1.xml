constitute a family of large pore channels that contains six closely related paralogs in humans. Two family members, CALHM1 and 3, have been associated with the release of ATP during taste sensation. Both proteins form heteromeric channels that activate at positive potential and decreased extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Although the structures of several family members displayed large oligomeric organizations of different size, their function has in most cases remained elusive. Our previous study has identified the paralogs CALHM2, 4 and, 6 to be highly expressed in the placenta and defined their structural properties as membrane proteins exhibiting features of large pore channels with unknown activation properties (Drożdżyk et al., 2020). Here, we investigated whether these placental paralogs would form heteromers and characterized heteromeric complexes consisting of CALHM2 and CALHM4 subunits using specific binders as fiducial markers. Both proteins assemble with different stoichiometries with the largest population containing CALHM2 as the predominant component. In these oligomers, the subunits segregate and reside in their preferred conformation found in homomeric channels. Our study has thus revealed the properties that govern the formation of CALHM heteromers in a process of potential relevance in a cellular context.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>large pore channels</kwd><kwd>heteromerization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030B_182828</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutzler</surname><given-names>Raimund</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural studies revealing the organization of assemblies consisting of CALHM2 and CALHM4 subunits provide insight into the mechanism of heteromerization of large pore channels.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Large pore channels encompass a heterogeneous group of membrane proteins in higher eukaryotes, which form large oligomeric assemblies that facilitate the diffusion of diverse substrates with poor selectivity, including metabolites and signaling molecules such as the nucleotide ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Syrjanen et al., 2021</xref>). The calcium homeostasis modulators (CALHM) constitute one family of large pore channels that contains six members in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Their role in physiology is currently best understood for the paralogs CALHM1 and 3. Both proteins are expressed in type II taste bud cells to contribute to the sensation of umami, sweet, and bitter taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taruno et al., 2013b</xref>). There, they are involved in the non-vesicular release of ATP as a consequence of membrane depolarization following the initial sensation of tastants by G-protein coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taruno et al., 2013a</xref>). ATP in turn acts as a neurotransmitter to activate P2X-receptors on the postsynaptic side. CALHM proteins reside in a non-conducting state at resting potentials and are activated in response to membrane depolarization with a decrease in extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> shifting the threshold of activation towards more hyperpolarizing voltages, thereby allowing conduction also at negative potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). The open channel shows poor selectivity and is permeable to the multivalent anion ATP. Although these properties are shared by homomeric assemblies of CALHM1 in heterologous expression systems, their slow kinetics of activation would prohibit fast signaling and thus does not reflect the behavior observed in taste bud cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). To enhance its activation properties, CALHM1 assembles as heteromeric complex with its paralog CALHM3, which on its own does not form functional ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2018b</xref>). The physiological role of other CALHM paralogs is currently much less well understood, although the ubiquitously expressed CALHM2 was also associated with ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ma et al., 2018a</xref>) and CALHM6 was recently described as channel in immunological synapses of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Danielli et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Based on their assumed topology containing four membrane-spanning segments, the CALHM family was originally predicted to share a close structural relationship with large pore channels of the connexin, pannexin, and LRRC8 families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Siebert et al., 2013</xref>). However, this relationship was refuted in numerous structures of homomeric assemblies of different CALHM paralogs that have recently been determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) from samples obtained from heterologous expression in mammalian and insect cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Demura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foskett, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Although sharing the same number of membrane-spanning segments, their arrangement is unique and differs from other large pore channels, with an extended helix located on the C-terminus and forming the core of a cytoplasmic domain further mediating subunit interactions. These structures show channels that assemble into higher oligomers around an axis of symmetry that presumably defines the conduction path. These assemblies are heterogeneous in nature, with paralogs frequently adopting different oligomeric states in the same sample. The smallest assemblies were generally observed for CALHM1, where structures from different species contained between seven and nine subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Demura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Syrjänen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>). The size of the respective assemblies is generally larger for other CALHM paralogs, ranging from decamers to tridecamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>). In detergent solution, these channels do in certain cases pair to form gap-junction-like organizations, although there is currently no evidence for such transcellular interactions in a physiological environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>). In oligomeric channels, the pore is lined by the first transmembrane segment (TM1) of each subunit, which forms an inner, of two concentric rings, with the outer ring being constituted by TM2-4, with TM2 and 4 of neighboring subunits engaging in extended interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>). The loosely packed TM1 is found in distinct conformations in different structures to shape the pore geometry and thus presumably alter conduction properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We have previously studied the structural and functional properties of the CALHM paralogs 2, 4 and 6, whose transcripts were found to be abundant in placental epithelia in dependence on the developmental stage of the organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>). These placental paralogs all form large oligomers, which in CALHM4 consist of similar-sized populations of decameric and undecameric assemblies in the same sample. Both oligomers were found to pair via contacts on their intracellular side into large tubular structures. In this sample, both assemblies adopt equivalent subunit conformations, leading to large cylindrical pores that are constricted by a short N-terminal helix preceding TM1, which is oriented parallel to the membrane plane and projects towards the pore axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>). In the same study, a similar pairing of channels containing between 11 and 12 subunits was also found for CALHM2, where the preferred orientation of the particles within the sample has prevented a three-dimensional reconstruction at high-resolution. In contrast, no dimerization was detected in a CALHM6 preparation, where, although also existing as undecamers, a decameric assembly was prevalent and thus better resolved. As a consequence of a conformational rearrangement of TM1, which has detached from its interaction with the rest of the subunit, resulting in a higher mobility, the CALHM6 pore has adopted a conical shape with a decreasing diameter towards the intracellular side suggesting that it might reside in a different functional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite the observed large assemblies, none of the three paralogs overexpressed in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes showed any activity in electrophysiology experiments under conditions where CALHM1 was conductive, regardless of their expression at the cell surface, suggesting that they may be activated by different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>). This was unexpected in light of the distinct conformations observed for CALHM4 and 6 and their large apparent pore diameter, which is particularly pronounced in case of CALHM4. In this respect, it was remarkable to find continuous density with bilayer-like features inside the pore of CALHM4, matching the hydrophobic character of the pore lining, which might explain the lack of activity observed for this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>). This density is not found in CALHM6, where the altered shape of the pore could not accommodate a bilayer. The functional properties of placental CALHM paralogs thus remained elusive.</p><p>Since the formation of heteromers composed of CALHM1 and 3 paralogs strongly altered the functional behavior of the respective homomers, we wondered whether the tree paralogs expressed in the placenta would share a similar property and whether their heteromerization would increase their activity under the investigated conditions. To clarify this question, we have here investigated the ability of the overexpressed CALHM homologs 2, 4, and 6, to form heteromeric assemblies. Robust interactions were identified between CALHM2 and 4, but to a much lower extent between any of the two paralogs and CALHM6. The subsequent structural characterization of CALHM2/4 heteromers, employing synthetic subunit-specific nanobodies (sybodies), showed channels with a broad subunit distribution. The largest populations contain a predominance of CALHM2 with two to four CALHM4 subunits, where both paralogs segregate in the heteromeric assemblies. While subunits maintain their distinct structural features found in homomeric channels, they also influence the conformations of contacting subunits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of CALHM heteromers</title><p>The formation of heteromers is a hallmark of different eukaryotic ion channels, with their subunit composition shaping functional properties. Such heteromerization has also been found in the CALHM family of large-pore channels, where the paralogs CALHM1 and 3 oligomerize to form channels that are activated by membrane depolarization and the decrease of the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2018b</xref>). To probe whether this property would also extend to other family members, we have initially investigated the ability of the three placental paralogs CALHM2, 4, and 6 to form heteromeric assemblies. To this end, we have co-transfected HEK293S cells with pairs of constructs coding for different paralogs and containing unique tags for affinity purification. After solubilization, specific subunits were captured via their attached tags and the sample was assayed for the co-purification of the second subunit by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. In that way, we have identified robust heteromerization of the paralogs CALHM2 and 4, and weak pairing of both paralogs with CALHM6, thus suggesting that specific heteromerization might be a property that is inherent to certain CALHM paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heteromerization and functional properties of placental calcium homeostasis modulators (CALHM) paralogs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot (detecting the myc-tag attached to the C-termini of respective constructs) of CALHM subunits expressed upon co-transfection of HEK293S GnTI<sup>−</sup> cells with pairs of CALHM subunits.

To this end, we have expressed either single or pairs of different CALHM paralogs in HEK293 cells and investigated their functional properties by patch-clamp electrophysiology. When recorded in the whole-cell configuration, we were able to reproduce the previously observed phenotype of CALHM1 to form channels that activate at positive voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The observed functional properties are enhanced upon co-expression of CALHM1 and 3 subunits, which results in the increase of currents and activation kinetics compared to CALHM1, when recorded in the same manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, neither CALHM2 nor CALHM4 shows appreciable currents under equivalent conditions, which conforms with a previous investigation performed in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, we have investigated whether their assembly as heteromers would enhance the activity of CALHM2 and CALHM4 and thus proceeded with the functional characterization of cells that were co-transfected with plasmids encoding each subunit. However, similar to the respective homomers, we were unable to detect any current response at a positive voltage, thus emphasizing that these proteins share an activation mechanism that is distinct from CALHM1/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Selection of paralog-specific binders</title><p>Following, we set out to characterize the structural properties of CALHM2/4 heteromers by cryo-EM. This task is complicated by the unknown arrangement of subunits sharing similar structural features and the potentially large compositional heterogeneity of heteromers, which might prohibit the classification and alignment of oligomeric complexes. We have thus initially engaged in the generation of paralog-specific binders that can be used as fiducial markers to aid the identification of subunits in heteromeric channels. As in previous projects, we have decided for synthetic nanobodies (termed sybodies), which were selected from large construct libraries by different display methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zimmermann et al., 2020</xref>). In independent efforts, we have isolated binders against homomeric assemblies of CALHM2 and CALHM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and subsequently used them for a structural characterization of respective homomers to define their binding epitopes and their effect on subunit conformations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Features of the CALHM4/SbC4 complex</title><p>Our selection against CALHM4 was carried out with paired assemblies of channels containing either ten or eleven subunits each, which is reflected in the low elution volume of the sample during size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Dimerization in CALHM4 proceeds at its intracellular region, resulting in large particles, which expose their extracellular parts at both ends of a tubular assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>). This sample has allowed us to isolate a specific binder, termed Sb<sup>CALHM4</sup> or short SbC4, that forms a tight complex with the CALHM4 channel pair, which remains intact during size exclusion chromatography as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, B). Upon characterization by surface plasmon resonance, we measured a binding affinity of about 100 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Conversely, we did not find any evidence of this protein to engage in strong interactions with CALHM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). When investigated by cryo-EM, we observed two populations of particles either exhibiting D10 or D11 symmetry (corresponding to dimers of decameric and undecameric channels) that closely resemble equivalent structures of CALHM4 determined in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Between the two populations, the reconstruction of the density with D10 symmetry imposed was of higher resolution and we thus restrict our detailed analysis to this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Subunits in the oligomeric assembly are arranged around an axis of symmetry, which presumably defines the pore of a large channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Each subunit contains four membrane-spanning helices, three of which (TM2-4) are tightly interacting to form an outer ring with a large diameter that separates the inside of the pore from its surrounding membrane environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). In this ring, TM2 and 4 of adjacent subunits engage in extended interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, TM1 forms an inner ring of helices lining the pore, with the bent helical N-terminus (NH) running perpendicular to the membrane and projecting towards the pore axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). TM1 packs against TM3 of the outer ring but is not involved in direct subunit interactions. Within each channel, we find residual density of low resolution, whose distribution resembles the headgroup region of a lipid bilayer, which was thus previously ascribed to a membrane assembled in the lumen of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In this cryo-EM map, we find the density of sybodies binding at the extracellular side of each subunit forming two rings of binders at both ends of the assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Although not sufficiently well resolved to define detailed interactions with certainty, neighboring sybodies appear not to clash, with epitopes being confined to a single subunit, which provides ideal properties for the identification of CALHM4 subunits in heteromeric channels.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) Data

This sybody remains bound to the channel during size exclusion chromatography, which is manifested in the decreased elution volume of the complex and the presence of both proteins in peak fractions as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As in case of SbC4, the binding is subunit specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). We have then proceeded with the structural characterization of CALHM2/SbC2 complexes by cryo-EM and found two populations of particles showing either C10 or C11 symmetry. In this dataset, only the reconstruction of undecameric particles resulted in high-resolution density that resembles structures of CALHM2 determined in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Demura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast to the CALHM4 structure, we did not detect any dimerization of channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Another pronounced difference in the CALHM2 structure concerns the conformation of TM1, which is detached from its interaction with TM3 as found in CALHM4 and instead projects towards the pore axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Due to its high mobility, the density of this helix is only defined at its C-terminal end at the boundary to the extracellular loop connecting to TM2, whereas its remainder towards the N-terminus is not resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This arrangement of TM1 in an ‘up’ position resembles the conformation observed in a previous structure of a complex of CALHM2 with its putative inhibitor rubidium red, although its density in the inhibitor complex is better defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to CALHM4, where TM3 and TM4 of the same subunit tightly interact throughout, in CALHM2 both helices have moved apart at their intracellular halve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the structure, the resulting narrow fenestration connecting the channel interior and the membrane is filled by a bound lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Finally, unlike in the CALHM4 structure where TM1 resides in a ‘down’ conformation, the lumen of the CALHM2 channel does not contain pronounced bilayer-like residual density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In the CALHM2 assembly, strong density of appropriate size and shape at each subunit defines the location of SbC2 binding to the intracellular side of the channel via its extended CDR3 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>). On CALHM2, the epitope encompasses residues located on the intracellular end of TM3, the region immediately following TM4, and part of the C-terminal loop connecting the short helices CT2H and CT3H of the contacted subunit. Additionally, the very C-terminus of the adjacent subunit (CT<sup>+1</sup>, located in a counterclockwise position when viewed from the extracellular side), which contains six additional residues added to the expression construct contributes to the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This C-terminus is unstructured in the absence of the sybody but contacts the region preceding CT3H on the neighboring CALHM2 subunit and the CDR3 region of SbC2 to become partly buried in the binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As a consequence, about 75% of the binding interface covering about 2’200 Å<sup>2</sup> of the combined molecular surface is contributed by the CT<sup>+1</sup>. Despite the described involvement of CT<sup>+1</sup> to SbC2 binding, sybodies bound to neighboring subunits do not overlap and bind remotely from the primary subunit interface and thus clearly label CALHM2 subunits engaging in homomeric interactions in the +1 position.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structural characterization of a CALHM2/SbC2 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) density of the undecameric CALHM2/SbC2 complex at 3.1 Å (after application of C11 symmetry).

We have thus used both binders for the structure determination of channels consisting of CALHM2 and CALHM4 subunits (CALHM2/4). To this end, we have transfected HEK293S cells with equimolar amounts of DNA encoding constructs of the respective paralogs and isolated heteromeric channels by tandem purification, sequentially capturing different tags that are attached to either construct. This strategy has allowed us to isolate channels containing both subunits, which constitute a small fraction (&lt;10%) of the total expressed protein, most of which assemble as homomers. We have then added sybodies in stoichiometric excess and determined two datasets of CALHM2/4-sybody complexes, one containing both binders and a second SbC4 only. Both datasets are of high quality and provide insight into the organization of heteromeric channels with the sybodies defining the distribution of CALHM2 and 4 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In both datasets, the position of CALHM4 subunits is marked by the binding of SbC4 to the extracellular part of the protein, whereas in the dataset containing both sybodies, SbC2 additionally labels CALHM2 subunits. Both samples show a heterogeneous distribution of complexes with variable ratios of the two paralogs, which in all cases segregate into clusters to minimize heteromeric interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). A 3D classification shows particles of three distinct oligomeric organizations.

These channels consist predominantly of CALHM4 with interspersed CALHM2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, in two larger populations of undecameric and dodecameric channels that do not dimerize, CALHM2 subunits predominate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

We have thus pooled the classes of all undecameric channels containing two to four copies of CALHM4, and proceeded with further map refinement, which has allowed us to obtain maps extending to global resolutions of 3.8 Å and 3.3 Å for the datasets of samples containing either SbC4 only (CALHM2/4/SbC4), or both SbC2 and SbC4 (CALHM2/4/SbC2/SbC4), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The two cryo-EM densities provide congruent views of the relative arrangement and conformational preferences of CALHM2 and CALHM4 subunits in heteromeric channels. In both datasets, the two positions uniformly occupied by CALHM4 (referred to as 1 and 2 when numbered in a counterclockwise direction from the extracellular side) are well-defined and clearly discernable by SbC4 bound to its extracellular epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similarly, the seven following positions (3-9), occupied by CALHM2, are well defined, whereas the two positions adjacent to the two CALHM4 subunits in a clockwise direction (11 and 10), which contain CALHM2 or 4 at different ratios are of somewhat lower resolution due to the averaging of two different subunits. This feature is particularly pronounced in the dataset of CALHM2/4/SbC2/SbC4, containing both sybodies, where position 11 bears closer resemblance to CALHM4, as further evidenced by weak residual density of SbC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Conversely, features in the neighboring position 10 are closer to CALHM2, as expected for an average of channel populations containing two to four CALHM4 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In the CALHM2/4/SbC2/SbC4 complex, most of the positions occupied by CALHM2 (i.e. positions 4–8) are also distinguished by the strong density of SbC2 binding to its intracellular epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, since the C-terminus of the neighboring CALHM2 (CT<sup>+1</sup>) contributes to binding, we find weaker density in position 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, the weaker density of SbC2 in position 3, which is fully occupied by CALHM2, is probably a consequence of the distinct conformation of this particular subunit, which compromises sybody binding.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CALHM2/CALHM4 heteromer structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depiction of the subunit distribution in CALHM2/4 heteromers. 4 refers to CALHM4, 2 to CALHM2 in ‘up’ conformation, 2d to CALHM2 in ‘down’ conformation, 2 u/d to a mixed population of both conformations of CALHM2 subunits, 4/2, and 2/4 to mixed populations of CALHM2 and 4 with the first number indicating the predominant subunit.

CALHM2 subunits that are distant from CALHM4 predominantly reside in the familiar ‘up’ position of TM1 observed in the structure of the CALHM2/SbC2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, CALHM2 in position 3 shows a distinct conformation, where TM1 has rearranged to maximize its contacts with TM3, resembling the ‘down’ conformation of adjacent CALHM4 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). As a consequence of this interaction, TM1 and TM3 have moved towards the outer ring of helices constituted by TM2-4 to close the fenestration between TM3 and TM4, which in the CALHM2/SbC2 complex was found to be occupied by a lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>).

The influence of CALHM4 on CALHM2 conformations is also observed in position 4, where we find a mix of both states, and in the weak density of the ‘down’ conformation in CALHM2 subunits located remotely from CALHM4.

Whereas the homotypic interactions between pairs of CALHM2 or CALHM4 subunits are essentially identical as in the respective homomeric channels, the structure also reveals the well-defined interaction interface between CALHM4 and 2 subunits (viewed from the extracellular side in the counterclockwise direction) whereas the details of the 2/4 interface are blurred by the mix of subunits at the 10 and 11 positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). With 5400 Å<sup>2</sup>, the interface buried between two CALHM2 subunits is 40% larger compared to the corresponding CALHM4 interface (burying 3960 Å<sup>2</sup>), with the latter being similar in size to the heteromeric CALHM4/CALHM2 interface (3572 Å<sup>2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). The larger surface buried between CALHM2 subunits, which presumably translates into a stronger interaction, reflects the observed prevalence of homomers upon coexpression of subunits. In CALHM2/4 heteromers it accounts for the dominance of one paralog in different channel populations combined with the observed segregation of subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Structural features of subunit interfaces.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Interaction interfaces between pairs of CALHM2 subunits (<bold>A</bold>), CALHM4 subunits (<bold>B</bold>), and a CALHM2 and a CALHM4 subunit (<bold>C</bold>).

Within the membrane, contacts are similar and dominated by hydrophobic residues several of which are conserved between both paralogs, although polar contacts extend further towards the extracellular region in CALHM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In the cytoplasmic domain, the interactions show pronounced differences with the contact area buried by CALHM2 being considerably larger (3003 Å<sup>2</sup>) compared to CALHM4 (1909 Å<sup>2</sup>), which is a consequence of the parts located C-terminally to CTH, which differ in both paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Whereas interactions mediated by the conserved CTH are similar between CALHM2 and 4, the following region in CALHM2 consists of three short helices (CTH’, CT2H, and CT3H), and connecting loops which wrap around CTH to increase the interface and contribute to subunit interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In CALHM4, of these three short helices only CT3H is present which engages in similar conserved interactions with the CTH as the equivalent region in CALHM2, although with different subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). While, due to the altered location of CT2H, the helix in CALHM2 primarily binds to an epitope located in the interacting subunit in the +1 position, in CALHM4 the helix binds to the equivalent region in the same subunit. A generally similar pattern of interactions is also found between subunits at the CALHM4/2 interface where the buried surface area at the C-terminus is even smaller than in CALHM4/4 interfaces (1671 Å<sup>2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In summary, we find conserved complementary contacts between CALHM2 and CALHM4 subunits, which promote the formation of heteromeric channels. However, the larger area that is buried in interfaces between equivalent subunits underlines the observed prevalence of homomeric interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The formation of heteromers of close paralogs of a protein family is a common mechanism in eukaryotic ion channels to confer distinct functional properties to an oligomeric assembly. Heteromeric assemblies are found in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, glutamate receptors, and volume-regulated anion channels of the LRRC8 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greger and Mayer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Voss et al., 2014</xref>). In the CALHM family of large pore channels, the formation of heteromers has been demonstrated for the paralogs CALHM1 and CALHM3, where the pairing of subunits results in a strong improvement of the activation properties compared to their homomeric equivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2018b</xref>). We reasoned that a similar process might also extend to other family members and thus investigated the heteromerization of three paralogs that we have previously shown to be expressed in placental epithelia but for which we were so far unable to detect any function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>). Our experiments here have demonstrated the ability of at least two paralogs, CALHM2 and 4, to form heteromeric assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although the existence of such mixed assemblies in a cellular context is still uncertain, our study has shed light on the detailed features of the interaction of both subunits. In that way it has revealed energetic relationships between homo- and heteromeric subunit pairing, providing insight that might also be relevant for other ion channels.</p><p>The ability to form heteromers appears specific to certain members of the CALHM family, since not all of the investigated combinations of paralogs were equally suited to interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The general ability of subunits to become part of the same assembly is encoded in their structure. Based on the comparison of known structures, there is an apparent incompatibility between one group consisting of CALHM1 and 3 and the second encompassing CALHM 2, 4, 5, and 6. This is reflected in the distinct orientation of the C-terminal domain, which constitutes a large part of the interaction interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). In its orientation, the first helix of this domain termed CTH is similar in CALHM2, 4, 5, and 6 and, although different degrees of pairing have been detected between these subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the energetic penalty to form heteromers is presumably small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In contrast, the conformation of the C-terminus of CALHM1 and presumably also CALHM3 would likely interfere with their incorporation in a heteromeric assembly with any of the other four subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In this respect, it is noteworthy that the same unit was previously shown to be responsible for the smaller oligomeric assembly of CALHM1 as either heptamer or octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>). The fact that in case of the co-expression of CALHM2 and CALHM4, the homomeric populations prevail, underlines the energetic preference of homotypic interactions. Such prevalence was previously also observed upon overexpression of different members of the unrelated LRRC8 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rutz et al., 2023</xref>), where homomeric assemblies are believed not to be present in a cellular environment, pointing towards a tightly regulated oligomerization process that might be disturbed upon overexpression. However, in contrast to LRRC8A/C heteromers which, when expressed under equivalent conditions, adopt a single oligomeric organization with a 2:1 ratio of A to C subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rutz et al., 2023</xref>), we find a broad distribution of different assemblies in the case of CALHM2/4 heteromers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8C</xref>). For either protein family, the predominance of one of the paralogs and a segregation of subunits within the oligomer provides additional evidence for the higher affinity of homomeric interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Discussion.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Superposition of single subunits of different calcium homeostasis modulators (CALHM) paralogs on CALHM2 viewed from within the membrane (top) and of their cytosolic domain viewed from the outside (bottom).

This is illustrated in the preference of CALHM2 subunits to reside in a lifted ‘up’ conformation of TM1 if the subunit is located distant from CALHM4 subunits whereas this conformation changes into a ‘down’ conformation in the vicinity of CALHM4 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). The conformational preference of subunits is also extended to the shape of residual density inside the pore, which exclusively around subunits in a ‘down’ conformation shows the described bilayer-like features found in CALHM4 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8D</xref>). These observations underline the general independence of subunits in assuming their conformation but also indicate some coupling between neighbors. Thus, a change between conformations would not necessarily have to proceed as a fully concerted transition.</p><p>Despite the observed diversity of subunit assemblies and pore conformations in CALHM2/4 heteromers, it is puzzling not to find detectable changes in their functional properties, as neither of the constructs shows any sign of activity under conditions where CALHM1/3 heteromers robustly conduct ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), despite the fact that their larger assembly should result in a wider pore diameter. The activation properties of these CALHM paralogs have thus remained elusive and might require still unidentified interaction partners. Alternatively, we also cannot exclude that these large oligomers might serve a function or substrate preference that differs from classical large pore channels, which could be modified by the observed formation of heteromers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression constructs</title><p>CALHM coding sequences (synthesized by GeneScript) were inserted into a modified FX-cloning compatible pcDNA1.3 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geertsma, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geertsma and Dutzler, 2011</xref>).

The membranes were first blocked at room temperature for 1 hr with 5% non-fat milk in TBST buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.075% Tween20) and then incubated with anti-Myc primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 2 hr at 4 °C. After blotting, the membranes were washed three times with TBST buffer and developed with the Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection kit (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sybody selection</title><p>For sybody selection procedures, CALHM2 and CALHM4 proteins were chemically biotinylated using amine-reactive EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For this purpose, proteins were diluted to a concentration of 25 µM in SEC buffer, and the coupling agent was added at an eightfold molar excess. Samples were incubated for 1 hr on ice and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Excess biotin was removed from the biotinylated protein on a PD-10 desalting column. The eluted proteins were concentrated, mixed with glycerol to a final concentration of 10%, aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid N<sub>2,</sub> and stored at –80 °C. Sybody selection was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zimmermann et al., 2020</xref>). Three synthetic ribosome-display libraries, concave, loop, and convex libraries, and the plasmids, were kindly provided by Prof. Markus Seeger. Sybodies were selected against chemically biotinylated CALHM proteins. In brief, one round of ribosome display was performed, and the output RNA was reverse transcribed and cloned into a phage-display compatible vector. The obtained plasmids were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> SS320 cells to produce phages using a helper phage M13KO7. The produced phages were then used in the subsequent two rounds of phage display. Phagemids were isolated from the output phages of the second round, and the sequences coding for sybodies were subcloned into an pSB_init expression vector. The resulting plasmids were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> MC1061, which were plated on agar plates. Single clones were expressed on a small scale and used for binding tests by ELISA. Positive clones were sequenced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Sybody expression and purification</title><p>DNA constructs of sybodies were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> MC1061 by a heat shock procedure and grown in one liter of Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 25 µg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. After initial incubation at 37 °C for 2 hr, the temperature was lowered to 22 °C and once the cultures reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5, L-arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.02% to induce expression. After 16–18 hr of expression, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for 20 min and pellets were either used immediately or stored at –80 °C until further use. For purification, pellets were resuspended in TBS buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme at a 1:30 w/v ratio. Bacteria were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles followed by sonication to release the periplasmic content. Lysates were centrifuged at 8000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and mixed with Ni-NTA resin and incubated for 30 min. The resin was washed with TBS and sybodies were eluted with TBS supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. For removal of the affinity tag, eluates were incubated overnight with 3 C protease while dialyzing with a MWCO of 5 kDa. The eluates were then concentrated and filtered through a 0.22 μm centrifugal filter and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Sepax SRT-10C SEC100 column equilibrated in TBS. Fractions of the monomeric sybody peaks were collected and stored at –80 °C for further use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Binding assays</title><p>Purified CALHM proteins were mixed with sybodies in a molar ratio of 1:2 to a final concentration of 25 µM CALHM proteins. Prior to mixing, sybodies were supplemented with GDN to a final concentration of 50 μM. Protein mixtures were applied to a Superose 6 5/150 Increase column equilibrated with SEC buffer. Peak fractions corresponding to CALHM proteins were collected, concentrated using Amicon Ultra 0.5 ml centrifugal filters (10 kDa cut-off, Ultracel), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SPR measurements were performed at the Functional Genomic Centre Zurich using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). The chemically biotinylated CALHM proteins were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (XanTec), resulting in a maximum response value of approximately 600 response units (RU). Measurements were performed at 10 °C at a flow rate of 30 µl/min. The buffer used during the experiments consisted of 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2,</sub> and 0.006% GDN for CALHM2 or 0.01% LMNG for CALHM4. Flow cell 1 was left empty to act as a reference cell for the measurements. Prior to measurements, the system was equilibrated with the appropriate buffer for 2 hr. The sybodies were injected in a single cycle kinetic measurement at concentrations of 7.8, 15.6, 31.25, 125, and 500 nM for sybody SbC2 and 8, 24, 72, 216, and 648 nM for sybody SbC4. Binding data was analyzed using BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare) and fitted to a single-site binding model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings</title><p>Adherent HEK-293 cells were gently detached from their support and seeded in 10 cm dishes at 10% confluency. After a 3 hr incubation, cells were transfected with a mixture of 12 µg PEI and 3 µg of plasmids encoding CALHM constructs, which were C-terminally tagged with Venus-Myc-SBP. For co-expression experiments, cells were transfected at a 1:1 ratio of the constructs at a total amount of 3 µg of plasmids. Mock cells were transfected with a vector expressing Venus tag only. Prior to transfection, DNA and PEI were separately incubated in 0.5 ml of DMEM medium. After 5 min, both solutions were mixed, incubated for 15 min, and added to respective cell cultures. Whole-cell currents were recorded 16–24 hr after transfection at room temperature (20–22°C). Recordings were conducted using borosilicate glass capillaries that were pulled and polished to achieve a final resistance of 4–6 MΩ. Patches were held at –40 mV and the voltage was altered between –80 mV and +100 mV in 10 mV increments for 500 ms by a step protocol. Cells were perfused using a gravity-fed system. The solutions were as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>). The pipette solution contained 147 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.0, using NaOH to adjusting the pH. The bath solution contained 147 mM NaCl, 13 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), using NaOH for adjusting the pH, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. In Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free experiments, the bath solution was similar but without the addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Data acquisition was performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and either Digidata 1440 or 1550 (Molecular Devices). Analog signals were digitized at a sampling rate of 10–20 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz using the built-in four-pole Bessel filter. Clampex 10.6 software (Molecular Devices) was used for data acquisition and GraphPad Prism 8 for data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection</title><p>Cryo-EM grids were prepared with freshly purified CALHM proteins. Prior to freezing, sybodies were added to the CALHM samples at a 1:1.5 molar excess (based on the total amount of CALHM subunits). In the sample containing heteromeric CALHM2/4 channels and both sybodies, SbC4 was added at a 1.5 and SbC2 at a 2.5 molar excess. The samples were frozen at different concentrations of CALHM proteins (20 µM in the CALHM2/SbC2 sample, 47 µM in the CALHM4/SbC4 sample, 38 µM in the CALHM2/4/SbC4 sample, and 45 µM in the CALHM2/4/SbC2/SbC4 sample). Samples were applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 Au 200 mesh). Excess liquid was removed in a controlled environment (4 °C and 100% relative humidity) by blotting grids for 2–4 s. Grids were subsequently flash-frozen in a liquid propane-ethane mix using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples were imaged with a 300 kV Titan Krios G3i with a 100 μm objective aperture and data were collected using a post-column BioQuantum energy filter with a 20 eV slit and a K3 direct electron detector operating in super-resolution counted mode. Dose-fractionated micrographs were recorded with a defocus range of –1 μm to –2.4 μm in an automated mode using EPU 2.9. Datasets were recorded at a nominal magnification of 130,000 corresponding to a pixel size of 0.651 Å (0.3255 Å per pixel in super-resolution mode).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cryo-EM image processing</title><p>Micrographs from all datasets were pre-processed in a similar manner. Micrographs of the CALHM2/SbC2, CALHM2/4/SbC4, and CALHM2/4/SbC2/SbC4 datasets were binned prior to processing resulting in a pixel size of 0.651 Å. The raw movies were used to correct for beam-induced motion using patch motion correction in cryoSPARC v.3.2.0 and v.4.0.3, followed by patch CTF estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). For the CALHM4/SbC4 dataset, the raw movies were used for correction of the beam-induced movement using a dose-weighting scheme in RELION’s own implementation of the MotionCor2 algorithm available in version 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>) and the CTF parameters were estimated on summed movie frames using CTFFIND4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Poor quality images with significant drift, ice contamination or poor CTF estimates were discarded.</p><p>The dataset of CALHM4/SbC4 was processed entirely in RELION-3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scheres, 2012</xref>). Particles were first selected by Laplacian-of-Gaussian-based auto-picking and subjected to a first round of 2D classification to generate 2D average templates. Next, four 2D classes with protein-like features were used as references for a second template-based picking. The particles were extracted with a box size of 720 pixels and downscaled four times. A second 2D classification was performed and the particles from the five best classes were used for the generation of an initial 3D model, imposing C10 symmetry. The extracted particles from the second 2D classification round were subjected to a round of 3D classification with C10 symmetry imposed, using the initial model low pass filtered to 60 Å as a reference map. The best 3D class was selected and the particles belonging to this class were unbinned to their original pixel size and subjected to 3D refinement with D10 symmetry imposed. Additionally, CTF and aberration refinement, and Bayesian polishing were applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zivanov et al., 2019</xref>). The map was sharpened with an isotropic b-factor of –153 Å<sup>2</sup>, resulting in a global resolution of 3.7 Å. The local resolution was estimated using RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The dataset of CALHM2/SbC2 was processed entirely in cryoSPARC v.3.2.0 and v.4.0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). Particles were initially picked with the blob picker and subjected to 2D classification to generate 2D average templates for more accurate template-based particle picking. Particles were selected and extracted with a box size of 512 pixels and downscaled twice. Selected particles were subjected to four rounds of 2D classification to remove false positives and low-quality particles and subjected to an <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction with three classes. The obtained classes included decameric, undecameric, and ambiguous assemblies of CALHM2. Particles belonging to classes showing an undecameric assembly were further sorted by a round of heterogeneous refinement using three <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstructions as references. The same procedure was used for particles belonging to classes showing a decameric assembly, which yielded a low-quality reconstruction. Therefore, further processing was restricted to the more promising undecameric assemblies. The quality of the reconstruction was further improved by CTF global and local refinements and non-uniform refinement with C11 symmetry imposed, yielding a map at 3.07 Å. The local resolution was estimated with cryoSPARC. To improve the resolution of the CALHM-sybody interface region, a local refinement with C11 symmetry imposed was performed in the presence of a tight mask restricted to the region surrounding the sybody binding site, yielding a reconstruction of this region at a global resolution of 2.8 Å.</p><p>The datasets of CALHM2/4 in complex with sybodies were processed in cryoSPARC v.4.0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>), unless indicated otherwise. Particles from the CALHM2/4 datasets containing either both sybodies (CALHM2/4/SbC2/SbC4) or SbC4 alone (CALHM2/4/SbC4) were initially picked with the blob picker and subjected to 2D classification to generate 2D templates for more accurate template-based particle picking. Particles were selected and extracted with a box size of 512 pixels, downscaled twice, and subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classification to remove false positives and poor-quality particles. Visual inspection of the 2D classes indicated the presence of different assemblies. To separate these assemblies, particles were exported to RELION (version 4.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kimanius et al., 2021</xref>) and used to generate initial models. Subsequently, particles were subjected to several rounds of 3D classification using the initial models as references. In the first two rounds of classification, low-quality particles were excluded and only particles belonging to the high-quality classes were subjected to a final 3D classification with 10 distinct classes. To obtain high-resolution reconstructions of complexes, particles belonging to 2D classes of channel dimers were excluded and only particles belonging to high-quality 2D classes with single channels were used to generate <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstructions in cryoSPARC. This yielded decoy reconstructions and undecameric reconstructions. Particles of undecameric reconstructions were used as input for heterogeneous refinements with three references including a decoy class and two proper classes. This approach yielded reconstructions of undecameric and dodecameric assemblies. The heterogeneous refinement was repeated four times using particles belonging to the undecameric assembly from the previous refinement as input and undecameric and dodecameric reconstructions as references. Resulting undecameric reconstructions were further improved by local and global CTF, and non-uniform refinements in C1. These approaches yielded maps with global resolutions of 3.8 Å and 3.3 Å for the CALHM2/4/SbC4 and CALHM2/4/SbC2/SbC4 complexes, respectively. The local resolution of maps was estimated within cryoSPARC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Model building and Refinement</title><p>Models were built using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) based on previously determined structures of CALHM2 (PDB:6UIW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>) and CALHM4 (PDB:6YTL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drożdżyk et al., 2020</xref>). Sybodies were initially modeled based on high-resolution structures (PDB:1ZVH for SbC2 and PDB:3K1K for SbC4). Models were first fitted into their corresponding densities using ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pettersen et al., 2021</xref>). The cryo-EM density of CALHM2/SbC2 allowed us to assign residues 39–308 and 314–323 of CALHM2 and 324–329 of the remaining sequence of the expression tag, and the entire model of SbC2 whose CDRs interacting with CALHM2 were rebuilt into the cryo-EM density. The cryo-EM density of CALHM4/SbC4 was of sufficiently high-resolution to unambiguously assign residues 5–82 and 94–276 of CALHM4. In contrast, the limited quality of the density of SbC4 did not permit a complete interpretation of its atomic model and thus a truncated version lacking the variable regions was placed into the density.</p><p>The model of the heteromeric CALHM2/4 in complex with sybodies SbC2 and SbC4 was built by placing eight CALHM2 and three CALHM4 subunits into the cryo-EM density obtained from the CALHM2/4/SbC2/SbC4 dataset at 3.3 Å. Coordinates of CALHM subunits and sybodies were obtained from the structures of the homomeric CALHM2/SbC2 and CALHM4/SbC4 complexes. Residues 19–46 of CALHM2 in the downward conformation were built de novo. The subunit displaying a mix of CALHM2 and 4 (i.e. position 10) was interpreted by a CALHM2 subunit where loop regions not defined in the density were removed. The structure of the CALHM2/4/SbC4 complex at 3.8 Å was built based on the model of CALHM2/4/SbC2/SbC4 after the removal of the SbC2 models, except that it contains a truncated version of CALHM2 also in position 11.

The activation mechanism of CALHM1 involves membrane depolarization and a decrease in extracellular Ca concentration, allowing the passage of large cellular metabolites. However, the activation mechanism and physiological roles of other family members are much less well understood. Many structures of homomeric CALHM proteins have been determined, revealing distinct oligomeric assemblies despite a common transmembrane domain topology. CALHM1 and 3 have been shown functionally to form heteromeric assemblies with properties distinct from those of homomeric CALHM1. However, the structural basis of heteromeric CALHM1 and 3 remains unexplored.</p><p>In this paper, Drozdzyk et al. present an important study on the structures of heteromeric channels composed of CALHM2 and CALHM4, extending the structural understanding of the CALHM family beyond homomeric channels. The study relies primarily on cryo-EM. Despite the inherent challenges of structural determination due to the similar structural features of CALHM2 and CALHM4, the authors innovatively use synthetic nanobodies to distinguish between the subunits. Their results show a broad distribution of different heteromeric assemblies, with CALHM4 conformation similar to its homomeric form and CALHM2 conformation influenced by its proximity to CALHM4, and provide detailed insights into the interaction between CALHM2 and CALHM4.</p><p>The manuscript is well-structured and presents clear results that support the conclusions drawn. The discovery of heteromeric CALHM channels, although currently limited to an overexpressed system, represents a significant advance in the field of large-pore channels and will certainly encourage further investigation into the physiological relevance and roles of heteromeric CALHM channels.</p><p>Comments on the revised version:</p><p>I appreciate the authors' efforts to try the alternative data processing strategy.

By adding fiducial markers that specifically recognize either CALHM2 or CALHM4, the authors determine a cryo-EM density map of heterooligomeric CALHM2/CALHM4 from which they can determine how the channel in assembled. Surprisingly, the two orthologs segregate into two distinct segments of the channel. This segregation enables the interfacial subunits to ease the transition between the preferred conformations of each ortholog, which are similar to the confirmation that each ortholog adopts in homooligomeric channels.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Through the use of fiducial markers, the authors can clearly distinguish between the CALHM2 and CALHM4 promoters in the heterooligomeric channels, strengthening their assignment of most of the promoters. The authors take appropriate caution in identifying two subunits that are likely a mix of the two orthologs in the channel.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Despite the authors' efforts, no currents could be observed that corresponded to CALHM2/CALHM4 channels and thus the functional effect of their interaction is not known.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96138.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Drożdżyk</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Biochemistry, University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peter</surname><given-names>Martina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Biochemistry, University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dutzler</surname><given-names>Raimund</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Biochemistry, University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank both reviewers for their supportive comments. Reviewer 1 has suggested a different data processing strategy to better resolve subunits at the CALHM4/CALHM2 interface:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I recommend an alternative data processing strategy. First, refine particles with 2-4 CALHM4 subunits with symmetry imposed. This is followed by symmetry expansion, signal subtraction of two adjacent subunits, and subsequent classification and refinement of the subtracted particles. This approach, while not guaranteed, can potentially provide a clearer definition of CALHM2 and CALHM4 interfaces and show whether CALHM2 subunits adopt different conformations based on their proximity to CALHM4 subunits.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the recommended strategy in an attempt to improve the resolution and better resolve the structural heterogeneity in CALHM2/4 channels. To this end, we have combined symmetry expansion and partial signal subtraction, as suggested by the reviewer. Initially, a symmetrized (C11) 3.4 Å consensus map of undecameric CALHM2/4 channels bound to sybodies SbC2 and SbC4 was used. The particles of this reconstruction were subjected to symmetry expansion (C11) followed by signal subtraction of nine adjacent subunits. Next, we performed focused, alignment-free 3D classification of the remaining two subunits followed by refinement of these classes, leading to the classification of CALHM subunit pairs. The majority of the classes feature well-resolved CALHM2 pairs, consistent with the original approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). A minority of the classes contain CALHM4 subunits, revealing heterogeneity similar to regions of CALHM4 subunits observed in the non-symmetrized channel reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>) . Unfortunately, this approach thus did not improve resolution or facilitate a more accurate subunit assignment. Consequently, we decided not to include these attempts in our manuscript. The resubmitted version thus contains only small corrections compared to the previous version.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Classification of subunit pairs of undecameric CALHM2/4 channels bound to sybodies SbC2 and SbC4 after the processing combining symmetry expansion and partial signal subtraction.</title><p>(A) Classes showing CALHM2 subunit pairs.
