localization of Prickle (Pk) and Strabismus (Stbm). We report that a myosin is polarized anteriorly in these cells and strongly colocalizes with Stbm. Disruption of the actin/myosin machinery with cytochalasin or blebbistatin disrupts polarization of Pk and Stbm, but not of myosin complexes, suggesting a PCP-independent aspect of myosin localization. Wash out of cytochalasin restored Pk polarization, but not if done in the presence of blebbistatin, suggesting an active role for myosin in core PCP protein localization. On the other hand, in the <italic>pk</italic> mutant line, <italic>aimless</italic>, myosin polarization is disrupted in approximately one third of the cells, indicating a reciprocal action of core PCP signaling on myosin localization. Our results indicate a complex relationship between the actomyosin cytoskeleton and core PCP components in which myosin is not simply a downstream target of PCP signaling, but also required for PCP protein localization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05361.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05361.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05361.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal cells that form flat layers of a tissue, such as the skin or the lining of internal cavities, are often orientated in the same direction. The same is true for structures such as hairs or feathers, which are attached to the skin. This phenomenon is known as ‘planar cell polarity’ (or ‘PCP’ for short).</p><p>Many different organisms use similar mechanisms to establish this kind of tissue pattern. The best-studied mechanism involves the so-called ‘core PCP pathway’. Signaling proteins in this pathway coordinate the polarity of neighboring cells. Other ‘global signaling pathways’ are thought to first ensure that tissues are correctly orientated within the embryo as a whole, and to do this, the global pathways are thought to align a network of filament-like structures within the cells in a particular direction. Once correctly orientated, these filaments—known as microtubules—have been proposed to help position the components of the core PCP pathway such that they can correctly orientate the rest of the cell.</p><p>Now Newman-Smith, Kourakis et al. have identified another network of filaments within cells that interacts with components of the core PCP pathway in a sea squirt called <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic>. This organism begins life as a tadpole-like larva that has a flexible rod-shaped structure, called a ‘notochord’, running along the length of its body. The cells of the notochord become polarized as they develop. When microtubules are disrupted, their planar polarity remains unaffected. However, when another network of filaments—called the actomyosin network––is chemically disrupted, the polarity of certain core PCP components is lost.</p><p>The findings of Newman-Smith, Kourakis et al. reveal that the core PCP components and the actomyosin network in this sea squirt reinforce each other's polarity. This represents an alternative to the previously described models of planar polarity in which the core PCP components are thought to drive the polarization of the actomyosin network. Whether this model extends to planar cell polarity mechanisms in other organisms, such humans and other animals with backbones, remains a question for future work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05361.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05361.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Ciona</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd><kwd>notohcord</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM088997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newman-Smith</surname><given-names>Erin</given-names></name><name><surname>Kourakis</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Reeves</surname><given-names>Wendy</given-names></name><name><surname>Veeman</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>William C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Planar cell polarity (PCP) components and myosin show a parallel temporal polarization in the <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord and the mutual interaction between these proteins is required for proper tissue-wide polarity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the importance of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in ensuring the proper orientation of cells in a range of embryonic and adult tissues, the molecular mechanisms of this pathway are not fully understood. The PCP pathway is ancient in metazoans, and its requirement for proper development and physiology has been well described in insects (e.g., <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and chordates. The function of the PCP pathway can be seen in the coordinated polarization of subcellular components such as cilia and multi-celled structures such as bristles in epithelial sheets and organs like the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, vertebrate inner ear, and kidney, as well as in dynamic processes, such as cell migration, convergence and extension of mesoderm, neural tube closure, and axonal guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wallingford, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tissir and Goffinet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Papakrivopoulou et al., 2014</xref>). One of the complicating issues of PCP signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where it has been most extensively addressed, is that it appears to consist of several semi-independent pathways that may act either in parallel or in sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lawrence and Casal, 2013</xref>). The best characterized of these pathways is the core PCP pathway, which acts locally to coordinate polarity between neighboring cells. The key components of the core pathway include the transmembrane proteins Strabismus/Van Gogh and Frizzled, and the cytoplasmic proteins Prickle and Dishevelled. Some components of this pathway are shared with the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, although unlike the Wnt/β-catenin pathway the core PCP pathway is thought to act primarily by directing cytoskeletal organization, rather than by regulating transcription.</p><p>While the core PCP pathway coordinates local polarity in groups of cells, there appears to be a requirement for an additional signaling pathway(s) that brings this local coordination into register with the axes of the organ or embryo. The precise nature of this so-called ‘global’ signaling pathway has been elusive, although several candidate pathways are supported experimentally. One model for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> global polarizer stresses the importance of mechanical forces generated during morphogenesis leading to the alignment of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eaton and Jülicher, 2011</xref>). Two signaling pathways have also been proposed to act as global polarizers—the Wg/Wnt4 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), and the Dachsous (Ds)/Fat/Four-jointed (Fj) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Casal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thomas and Strutt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Olofsson et al., 2014</xref>). The Ds/Fat/Fj module has been most extensively characterized and appears to signal via formation of heterodimers with the extracellular domains of Ds and Fat (which are atypical cadherins), putatively in a gradient across the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>). Most recently, it was reported that the Ds/Fat/Fj module affects polarity through microtubule orientation, which in turn directs core PCP polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matis et al., 2014</xref>). Fat and Ds orthologs also play roles in vertebrate development, but their precise roles in regulating aspects of PCP remain to be clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saburi et al., 2012</xref>). One final complicating factor in assessing the role of the Fat/Ds/Fj pathway in planar polarity is the apparent overlap with the growth-stimulating Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lawrence and Casal, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The notochord of the ascidian <italic>Ciona</italic> provides a particularly tractable model for the study of the PCP pathway in tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>). Ascidians are invertebrate chordates, and as members of the chordate subphylum Tunicata they belong to the group of animals that are the closest extant relatives of the vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delsuc et al., 2006</xref>). While the presence of the notochord—a stiff axial rod of mesodermal cells lying under the nerve cord—is a uniting feature of the Chordata, tunicate notochords are much simpler than those of vertebrates, and in <italic>Ciona</italic> the fully formed notochord consists of only 40 cells arranged in a stack one-cell wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>). We have described two discrete developmental phases in notochord morphogenesis that shows polarized cell behavior. Initially, the notochord precursor cells undergo a mediolaterally oriented intercalation behavior, which forms the notochord column along the AP axis. The role of the core PCP pathway in the convergent extension of the <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord is seen in the <italic>pk</italic> mutant <italic>aimless (aim)</italic> of <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic>, which has defects in notochord cell intercalation behavior, morphology, and extracellular matrix deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veeman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Following the completion of intercalation, the individual notochord cells initially assume a flattened-disk shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang and Smith, 2007</xref>). Over the next approximately 3–4 hr (corresponding to stages 21–24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hotta et al., 2007</xref>]), the cells undergo a dramatic elongation in the A/P axis, which results in the continued elongation of the entire tail. During the process of elongation, a second polarity becomes evident in the A/P axis (at a right angle to the mediolateral polarity seen earlier at intercalation). The first sign of A/P polarity can be seen shortly after the completion of intercalation (stage 22) in the localization of Pk protein to the anterior poles of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>). As elongation continues the core PCP protein Strabismus (Stbm) also localizes to the anterior pole, while nuclei move to the posterior poles of the cells where they take on a flattened shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>). The exception to this pattern is the posterior-most notochord cell whose nucleus is usually found in reverse orientation relative to the other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>aim</italic> embryos, the nuclei of intercalated cells are still polarized, but they are randomly oriented to either the anterior or posterior pole of each cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>). Following elongation, the notochord enters a new phase in its development (from stage 24 onward). A matrix is secreted into extracellular pockets that form between A and P faces of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denker and Jiang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2013</xref>). As this process continues, the pockets of matrix between the cells expand and then fuse to make a single, uninterrupted lumen along the length of the notochord.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05361.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> late-tailbud embryo (stage 23) expressing an electroporated Histone 2A/Red Fluorescent Protein (H2A-RFP) in the notochord.</title><p>Insets show two cells to illustrate the polarization of the nuclei to the posterior of the cells.

We report here that the notochord cells have anteriorly polarized myosin machinery.

One of these, myosin10/11/14/9, is reported to be expressed exclusively in the notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Satou et al., 2001</xref>) and is found in a two-gene operon with a myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Satou et al., 2008</xref>). This MRLC is one of five found in the <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> genome and has previously been used to mark myosin assemblies in notochord cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2011</xref>). By convention, <italic>Ciona</italic> genes are named according to their vertebrate orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stolfi et al., 2014</xref>). This particular <italic>Ciona</italic> MRLC shares orthology to vertebrate MRLCs 9 and 12 (phylogeny not shown) and will be referred to here as MRLC9/12.</p><p>To visualize myosin assemblies in developing notochord cells, we constructed fusion proteins of MRLC9/12 and Myosin10/11/14/9 with Venus fluorescent protein and myc antigen, respectively. The resulting cDNAs were fused to the <italic>Brachyury</italic> cis-regulatory region to drive notochord expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corbo et al., 1997</xref>), and then introduced to embryos by electroporation. Low doses of plasmid were used to encourage highly mosaic expression. This allows the visualization of the exogenous proteins in cells isolated from the expression of neighboring cells, which would otherwise make the determination of anterior vs posterior protein localization difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>). At the earliest developmental stage analyzed, stage 19—when the notochord cells are mid-intercalation, both Myosin10/11/14/9-myc and MRLC9/12-Venus were observed throughout the cells, with the highest localization on the perinotochordal surfaces where cells contact the basement membrane that surrounds the developing notochord (white arrows, stage 19; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veeman et al., 2008</xref>). At the immediate completion of intercalation (stage 21, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the localization of both fusion proteins was still the strongest at the basal/lateral edges. However, less than an hour later, at stage 22, both proteins were found localized to the anterior pole of each notochord cell (arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), as well as continuing to be found at the basal/lateral edges. Quantification of MRLC9/12-Venus fluorescence signal along the anterior/posterior axis of notochord cells confirms a distinct transition in MRLC9/12-Venus localization between stages 21 and 22 (insets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). During notochord cell elongation, and at its completion (stage 24), the anterior localization of both proteins persists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The onset of anterior/posterior localization of myosin assemblies closely matches the localization of Pk-myc, with A/P localization of Pk-myc starting at stage 22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>). However, the Pk-myc and MRLC9/12 proteins do not appear to completely colocalize spatially. At stage 22, Pk-myc, Myosin10/11/14/9-myc, and MRLC9/12-Venus are each found to be enriched on the anterior side of the cells. However, as elongation progresses, Pk-myc localization becomes restricted to a small region within the center of this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>), while Myosin10/11/14/9-myc and MRLC9/12-Venus remain more dispersed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05361.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Time course for the subcellular localization of myc-tagged myosin10/11/14/9-tagged myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) and Venus-tagged myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC9/12-Venus) at the stages indicated.</title><p>Arrows in <bold>A</bold> indicate contacts of cells with the basement membrane, and arrowheads in <bold>C</bold> indicate anteriorly localized protein.

Embryos were scored for cytochalasin B treatment at both mid-stage 23 and late-stage 23, and only 6% (n = 35) and 5% (n = 20) of cells showed Pk-myc polarization, respectively. Even in cells scored as having polarized Pk-myc, the tight localization seen at the center of the anterior membrane was lost, replaced by labeling throughout the anterior membrane. By contrast, cells from embryos treated with DMSO at mid-stage 23 and late-stage 23 had 81% (n = 59) and 100% (n = 5) of cells with Pk-myc properly polarized, respectively.

In embryos treated with cytochalasin B at stage 23, only 6% (n = 50) had detectable Stbm-Venus localization vs 75% (n = 52) of control DMSO-treated cells. Latrunculin B, which inhibits actin polymerization by a different mechanism than cytochalasin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morton et al., 2000</xref>), also caused a loss of nuclear, Stbm-Venus, and Pk-myc polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,F</xref>).

The stage 23 treatments demonstrated that cytochalasin B could disrupt the notochord cell polarity once it was established. To examine the effect of cytochalasin B on the establishment of polarity, embryos were treated at stage 21 and scored at stage 23.

While treatment of embryos at early stage 23 to the start of stage 24 only resulted in a modest disruption of MRLC9/12-Venus polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), with 80% of treated cells retaining polarity vs 90% of control cells, treatment of embryos with cytochalasin B at late-stage 23 had a stronger effect, with 57% of cells scored (n = 44) having polarized MRLC9/12-Venus (vs 100% of cells in DMSO-treated embryos (n = 13); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The transition to cytochalasin B dependence from early to late-stage 23 may be tied to dramatic changes in cell architecture as the notochord begins the process of lumen formation, first visible at stage 24, a period during which the orderly A/P arrangement and polarity of cells changes dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The dependence of the anterior polarization of MRLC9/12-Venus on myosin activity was also examined using blebbistatin. Because blebbistatin inhibits myosin II Mg-ATPase activity without disassembling actin/myosin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Straight et al., 2003</xref>), we would expect to observe a disruption in polarization of MRLC9/12-Venus only if the polarization required myosin motor activity. In embryos treated with 10 μM blebbistatin from stage 21 through stage 23, a dramatic block in cell elongation was observed, although there was no apparent disruption of MRLC9/12-Venus polarization indicating that MRLC9/12-Venus polarization does not require myosin activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the core PCP proteins and myosins respond very differently to cytoskeletal inhibitors. The initiation and maintenance of Stbm-Venus and Pk-myc localization depends on an intact actin cytoskeleton, and addition of the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin leads to loss of Pk-myc and Stbm-Venus polarization. These same treatments also disrupted nuclei, which normally polarize posteriorly in a PCP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>), indicating an extensive disruption to the normal polarity of notochord cells. In contrast, the anterior polarization of MRLC9/12-Venus is largely resistant to these treatments, indicating that the polarization of the myosin machinery in <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord cells can occur independently of the localization of the core PCP proteins Pk and Stbm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dynamic repolarization upon removal of cytochalasin B</title><p>Despite the loss of A/P polarization of nuclei, Pk-myc, and Stbm-Venus in cytochalasin B-treated cells, we observed that polarity could be restored when the cytochalasin B was washed out.

The cells undergo a dramatic shape change, the polarization of Pk-myc, Stbm-Venus, and nuclei is lost, and the localization of aPKC is disrupted. Despite this, polarization of MRLC9/12-Venus persists, and much of the actin network remains cortical, although fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Inhibition of myosin motor activity with blebbistatin gives similar effects on Pk-myc and nuclei. Thus, in blebbistatin-treated cells or cytochalasin B-treated cells, while the actin and myosin machinery are inactivated, they appear to remain polarized and cortical. Removal of embryos from cytochalasin B allows the recovery of Pk-myc and nuclei, but not in the presence of blebbistatin. Together, these results support an active role for actin/myosin machinery in repolarization of core PCP proteins and nuclei. Consistent with this, latrunculin treatment, while not disrupting MRLC9/12-Venus localization, caused a much more extensive disruption the cortical actin network than did cytochalasin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). These cells do not recover nuclear or Pk-myc polarization when removed from latrunculin, presumably because of the more extensive loss of the actin network. In summary, despite the loss of Stbm and Pk localization in cytochalasin-treated cells a polarity persists that can restore proper core PCP and nuclei polarity. This persistent polarity appears to be the actin/myosin machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Neither establishment, maintenance nor recovery of nuclear, Pk or MRLC9/12 polarity requires the microtubule network</title><p>Previous reports in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown an important role for the microtubule network in PCP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shimada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harumoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Olofsson et al., 2014</xref>).

Additionally, and in contrast to results in other experimental systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shimada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harumoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vladar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matis et al., 2014</xref>), we find no evidence of a role for the microtubule network in the localization of either PCP components Pk and Stbm, or MRLC9/12.</p><p>We report here for the first time that myosin machinery (Myosin10/11/14/9 and MRLC9/12) is anteriorly polarized in <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> notochord cells and shows extensive colocalization with the core PCP protein Stbm, suggesting a functional interaction between them. This is further supported by the fact that the disruption of the actin/myosin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin, latrunculin, or blebbistatin all result in the loss of polarization of Pk and Stbm. Conversely, these same treatments leave the polarization of MRLC9/12 largely intact. Thus, Myosin10/11/14/9 in the notochord appears to localize in the absence of core PCP protein localization, similar to the situation for the atypical myosin Dachs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which is also polarized independently of the core PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>). It should be noted, however, that no direct ortholog of Dachs is found in chordate genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, the persistence of MRLC9/12 localization when Pk and Stbm are delocalized (e.g., cytochalasin treatment), and the requirement for myosin activity during repolarization after cytochalasin treatment, suggest that myosin polarization in <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord cells could act upstream of core PCP localization. However, it is important to note that in the developing notochord, Pk, Myosin10/11/14/9, and MRLC9/12 all appear to simultaneously localize in the A/P axis between stages 21 and 22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>]). Thus, the timing of events would argue against a simple model in which myosin localization precedes and directs Pk polarization. Moreover, it has also been observed that polarization of Stbm lags behind that of Pk (and thus also of myosin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>), indicating that the core PCP machinery is still assembling at the time we first see polarized myosin.</p><p>The mechanism and identity of the polarizing cue that leads to the simultaneous polarization of Pk, Myosin10/11/14/9, and MRLC9/12 remains mysterious. The observations presented here in a Pk null mutant line (<italic>aim</italic>) provides clues to the nature of this signal. Myosin polarization was disrupted in approximately one third of the notochord cells scored in <italic>aim</italic> embryos. While the <italic>pk</italic> allele in <italic>aim</italic> contains an ∼200 base-pair deletion that spans one intron and an adjacent exon, creating a premature stop codon and a likely null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>), and the <italic>Ciona</italic> genome contains only a single <italic>pk</italic> gene, one possible explanation for the variability between cells is that residual Pk-independent PCP activity remains in a subset of the notochord cells in <italic>aim</italic> embryos. However, by other measures of cell polarity, such as extension and protrusive activity along the mediolaterial axis during intercalation, and the membrane localization of Dishevelled, we see no evidence for residual PCP activity in <italic>aim</italic> embryos, and moreover, all notochord cells appear to be uniformly disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veeman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kourakis et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we surmise that many cells in the notochord are able to properly polarize myosin without input from the core PCP pathway. The notochord cells in <italic>aim</italic> embryos show a highly consistent pattern in which those having posterior localized nuclei (i.e., the wild-type pattern) have anterior polarized myosin, while those with inverted nuclei polarity (anterior) lacked detectable myosin polarity, rather than having inverted myosin polarity. We speculate that those cells in <italic>aim</italic> embryos showing wild-type nuclear polarity are correctly aligned with a global polarizing cue, and can polarize their myosin complex, while those cells showing anterior nuclei are not in alignment, and myosin does not polarize properly. The role of the core PCP pathway, which is lacking in the <italic>aim</italic> cells, is thus to act locally to bring the cells into proper alignment. Despite this observation, disruption of Pk and Stbm localization with cytochalasin C, latrunculin, or blebbistatin has relatively little effect on MRLC9/12 localization. One potentially important difference between these two examples is that the <italic>aim</italic> mutants are null for <italic>pk</italic> from fertilization, while the cytoskeletal inhibitors are added post-intercalation. Thus, while we see no evidence of A/P polarization until approximately 1 hr after the completion of intercalation (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), earlier events during intercalation may be required for the establishment of A/P polarity. The nature of these events and the mechanism that switches notochord polarity from mediolateral to A/P remain unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal culture</title><p>Adult <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> were collected from Santa Barbara Harbor or purchased from M-REP (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and kept at a facility supplied with raw seawater at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Suzanne Eaton, has agreed to share her identity.</p><p>The Senior editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Newman-Smith et al. have investigated how the core planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway coordinates cell polarization in the <italic>Ciona</italic> notochord. This is a particularly interesting one in which to study PCP. Previous work from the same group has shown that polarity of Core PCP proteins change dynamically as cells shift from intercalation to AP polarization, so some new insights into the diversity of polarization signals may emerge from this system. Furthermore the Core PCP proteins appear to be wired up somewhat differently than in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Dsh and Pk are on the same side of the cell). Here, they have demonstrated that myosin, like Pk, becomes anteriorly polarized, and they present data suggesting that the actin-myosin cytoskeleton is important to maintain anterior localization of Pk and Stbm. This requirement is bidirectional to some extent because myosin localization is occasionally perturbed in the Pk mutant <italic>aimless</italic>. This would be a novel contribution to the PCP field: while it has been clear that Core PCP can influence the actin cytoskeleton, we are not aware of any data showing the reverse.</p><p>There are many important issues that need to be addressed before the paper is suitable for publication. A principal concern is the specificity of the phenotypes caused by perturbing actin and the myosin components MRLC9/12 and Myosin10/11/14/9. In general, the study relies too extensively on drug treatments without addressing the obvious caveat that these could exert non-specific effects by acting on neighboring tissues. For example, knock-down of the MLRC9/12 and/or Myosin10/11/14/9 genes and analyses of the effects on Pk and Stbm polarization would adequately complement the blebbistatin study. Much value will be added by independent ways of down-regulating cytoskeletal components, such as the use of Morpholinos or more recent CRISPR methods to knockdown components specifically in the notochord. If the authors can manage these additional experiments in a reasonable time-frame, the results and analysis could place the work on a more robust footing.</p><p>Further, how dramatically is the cell cortex affected? The authors have shown that Pk and Stbm localization is perturbed, but are other cortical proteins insensitive to these treatments? Drug treatments that depolymerize the actin cytoskeleton are shown to disrupt the anterior localization of Pk-myc and Stbm-Venus fusion proteins and the posterior localization of the nuclei, but not the anterior localization of MLRC9/12 and Myosin10/11/14/9 fusion proteins. The authors show that polarity can be recovered upon washing the drug cytochalasin, but not latrunculin. Blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin II, is presented as blocking the recovery of Pk-myc and Stbm-Venus repolarization following cytochalasin washout. As shown this data is not convincing. Blebbistatin does not seem to disrupt myosin localization. Is there something that we are missing?</p><p>There are several other important issues that also need addressing. In general, the results need to be presented with clear interpretation or conclusions about the biological mechanisms which they reveal. The absence of this is pervasive from the Abstract through the Results and Discussion. The discussion invokes elusive and hypothetical cell autonomous and global polarization mechanisms, which weaken the paper rather than clarifying the main conclusions. The final model summarizes the observations while it could instead propose a mechanism to explain how PCP components and myosin regulate each other's localization. The authors use the drug nocodazole to effectively disrupt the microtubule cytoskeleton and observed no effect on the polarization of the PCP components. They conclude that the microtubules are dispensable for polarized distribution of Pk and Stbm. However, these treatments were apparently performed at a stage following the initial polarization, meaning that microtubules may be dispensable for the local steady-state maintenance of polarized distribution but not for the initial polarization. It would be important to perform the treatments and analyses at different time points, especially before the initial polarization, to conclude on this negative result. For myosin, only subcellular localization is showed while one could use anti phospho-myosin antibodies (as in Sherrard et al, Curr Biol, 2010, 20(17), 1-12) to ask if active myosin is localized to the anterior side of the cells. Colocalization analyses between PCP and Myosin components in both control and drug-treated (or knockdown) embryos would probably illuminate specific aspects of the crosstalk. It would be interesting to test if PCP components and myosin colocalize in control embryos whereas this would be disrupted upon cytochalasin, latrunculin and/or blebbistatin treatments.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1) Section headed “Dynamic Repolarization upon Removal of Cytochalasin B”. The data showing the delocalized cortical distribution of Pk in blebbistatin-treated animals should be shown and quantified because the effects of blebbistatin are central to the model.</p><p>2) Section headed “Myosin is Anteriorly Polarized in Notochord Cells”. The authors describe the localization of Myosin light and heavy chain as being more dispersed. Looking at the figure, the distribution of myosin heavy chain actually seems quite focused. Interestingly, it looks as if myosin heavy chain localization extends further into the cell and isn't just cortical, but it is hard to tell how different it is from MRLC because the images are somewhat over-exposed. It would be nice to see shorter exposures and some discussion of the differences in localization if they are there. Is myosin covering the nuclei?</p><p>3) Section “Myosin Remains Localized in the Presence of Cytoskeletal Inhibitors” (last paragraph). It would be good to see the pictures of the nocodozole experiments, rather than just the quantifications in the text.</p><p>4) Section entitled “Complex Localization of Myosin10/11/14/9 and MRLC9/12 in the Absence of PCP Signaling” and Discussion. In their model, the authors treat <italic>aimless</italic> mutants as null for Core PCP in general but this may not be so. It could be possible that residual activity of Core PCP proteins is responsible for the incomplete disruption of myosin polarity. Is polarization of Stbm abrogated in <italic>aimless</italic> mutants?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05361.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>There are many important issues that need to be addressed before the paper is suitable for publication.

Therefore we would not be able to assess their role in A/P polarity because the morphogenesis would arrest too early in development. This is exactly what we see when cytoskeletal disrupting drugs are added during intercalation. All existing protocols for gene knockdown in <italic>Ciona</italic> require introduction of morpholinos or CRISPR plasmids at the one cell stage, and methods that would allow us to temporally target the knockdown postintercalation have not been developed in <italic>Ciona</italic>. Moreover, we feel that the reviewers’ concern about “non-specific effects by acting on neighboring tissues” should not be a major concern. These are the conclusions we are drawing from the drug studies:</p><p>• Myosin is still polarized despite Pk and Stbm (and nuclei) being delocalized by the drugs. Therefore, there is not a strict requirement for core PCP polarization for myosin polarization.</p><p>• Repolarization following cytochalasin wash-out is blocked by blebbistatin. Therefore, myosin activity can localize pk.</p><p>• While the drugs we are using will disrupt cytoskeleton embryo-wide, in <italic>Ciona</italic> the core PCP proteins are only expressed in the notochord, and the only known phenotypes from loss of PCP activity are in the notochord (our published data).</p><p>Despite this, we attempted CRISPR knockout for both MRLC9/12 and Myosin10/11/14/9 using a recently published protocol for <italic>Ciona</italic>. We’ve tried two guide RNAs for each target, and so far we have been unable to detect any evidence of gene editing using either nuclease assays or direct sequencing (but we have had success targeting other genes). We will continue to try targeting MRLC9/12 and Myosin10/11/14/9 by CRISPR, but we do not feel that we can trouble-shoot this approach within the time-frame of the revision, and we point out that the reviewers requested these experiments “if the authors can manage these additional experiments in a reasonable time-frame”. We will continue to work on the MRLC9/12 and Myosin10/11/14/9 knockdown, but this may require development of tools that allow inducible expression.</p><p><italic>Further</italic>, <italic>how dramatically is the cell cortex affected? The authors have shown that Pk and Stbm localization is perturbed, but are other cortical proteins insensitive to these treatments?</italic></p><p>We’ve looked at the localization of aPKC, another protein localized to the cortex and A/P polarized (and one that we can easily detect with an antibody). We find that its localization is also disrupted by cytochalasin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 H and I</xref>). In the same figure we also present data on cortical actin.</p><p><italic>Drug treatments that depolymerize the actin cytoskeleton are shown to disrupt the anterior localization of Pk-myc and Stbm-Venus fusion proteins and the posterior localization of the nuclei, but not the anterior localization of MLRC9/12 and Myosin10/11/14/9 fusion proteins.

Is there something that we are missing?</italic></p><p>Based on published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Straight et al., 2003</xref>, Science), we would not expect to see disruption in myosin localization. Blebbistin inhibits myosin II Mg-ATPase activity without disassembling the actin/myosin complex. We have modified the text to make this clear.</p><p><italic>There are several other important issues that also need addressing.

The final model summarizes the observations while it could instead propose a mechanism to explain how PCP components and myosin regulate each other's localization</italic>.</p><p>We have extensively re-written the text according to the reviewers’ suggestion to make it less speculative. Accordingly, we have removed the cartoon that summarizes our speculation.</p><p><italic>The authors use the drug nocodazole to effectively disrupt the microtubule cytoskeleton and observed no effect on the polarization of the PCP components.

We see no significant disruption in polarity. Thus we’ve now tested for an effect on nocodazole on the establishment of polarity, the disruption of polarity once it is established, and the recovery of polarity following cytochalasin wash-out.</p><p><italic>For myosin, only subcellular localization is showed while one could use anti phospho-myosin antibodies (as in Sherrard et al, Curr Biol, 2010, 20(17), 1-12) to ask if active myosin is localized to the anterior side of the cells.

Interestingly, we see stronger co-localization of Stbm with p-myosin than we do with Pk. These results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure. 3</xref>.</p><p>The suggestion that we examine Stbm, Pk and phosphomyosin overlap following treatment with cytoskeletal inhibiting drugs is not feasible. The disruption in the localization of Pk and Stbm following treatment disperses the protein to the degree that in most cases make them undetectable above the level of background fluorescence.</p><p><italic>Other comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Section headed “Dynamic Repolarization upon Removal of Cytochalasin B”.

Our new anti-phosphomyosin data show endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); and in this case, the protein looks very cortical. We have replaced the myosin heavy chain with an image from a cell expressing a lower amount of exogenous myosin, on the assumption that this more closely matches the endogenous protein.</p><p><italic>3) Section “Myosin Remains Localized in the Presence of Cytoskeletal Inhibitors” (last paragraph).
