Here, we show that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) expression is cell cycle-dependent and negatively regulates quiescence exit in cultured cells and in an injury-induced liver regeneration mouse model. Specifically, acute reduction of Mecp2 is required for efficient quiescence exit as deletion of Mecp2 accelerates, while overexpression of Mecp2 delays quiescence exit, and forced expression of Mecp2 after Mecp2 conditional knockout rescues cell cycle reentry. The E3 ligase Nedd4 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of Mecp2, and thus facilitates quiescence exit. A genome-wide study uncovered the dual role of Mecp2 in preventing quiescence exit by transcriptionally activating metabolic genes while repressing proliferation-associated genes. Particularly disruption of two nuclear receptors, <italic>Rara</italic> or <italic>Nr1h3,</italic> accelerates quiescence exit, mimicking the Mecp2 depletion phenotype. Our studies unravel a previously unrecognized role for Mecp2 as an essential regulator of quiescence exit and tissue regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mecp2</kwd><kwd>G0 exit</kwd><kwd>liver regeneration</kwd><kwd>Nedd4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31900507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>92268204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Xiaochun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013050</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Provincial Applied Science and Technology Research and Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019A1515011511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019M652955</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023M731541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mecp2 expression is cell cycle-dependent and negatively regulates quiescence exit.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular quiescence, also referred to as G0, is a reversible non-proliferating state. Quiescent cells can be reactivated to exit from the quiescent state and reenter the actively cycling states (G1, S, G2, and M phases) in response to certain intrinsic or extrinsic signals. Increasing evidence indicates that quiescence is not a passive non-proliferating state but is rather an active metabolic state maintained by certain transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roche et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yao, 2014</xref>). The switch from quiescence to proliferation is coupled with extensive changes in the transcriptional program coordinating metabolic and proliferation dynamics. The tightly orchestrated quiescence exit is crucial for tissue homeostasis and regeneration after injury, especially in the liver, which is composed of hepatocytes with both metabolic and regenerative capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fausto et al., 2006</xref>). The unique regenerative capability of hepatocytes as differentiated cells after injury makes the liver an ideal in vivo model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying quiescence exit. Recent studies have demonstrated that hepatocytes act like stem cells that possess regenerative potential to reenter the cell cycle and proliferate during liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michalopoulos and Bhushan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsumoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Upon quiescence exit, a process also known as priming/initiation, hepatocytes favor proliferative capacity over metabolism to meet the rapid hepatic growth demand. However, how the active metabolic state is transcriptionally altered and modulated during the G0/G1 transition remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2), as a chromatin-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tillotson and Bird, 2020</xref>), plays multiple roles in gene expression regulation, including transcriptional activation and repression, RNA splicing, chromatin remodeling, and regulation of chromatin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ezeonwuka and Rastegar, 2014</xref>). Given the high expression and pivotal role of Mecp2 in the brain, understanding the mechanisms of Mecp2 in neurological disorders such as Rett syndrome and autism has attracted intense interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tillotson and Bird, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ip et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guy et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, Mecp2 has also been identified as an oncogene highly expressed in several cancer types. Several lines of evidence suggest that the role of Mecp2 in malignancy mainly involves facilitation of cancer cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babbio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neupane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). The role of Mecp2 in quiescence exit and tissue regeneration and the underlying mechanisms have not been reported to the best of our knowledge.</p><p>In this study, using a mouse model of injury-induced liver regeneration and cellular models of quiescence exit, we intriguingly found that Mecp2 is a cell cycle-dependent protein that is drastically abated during the G0/G1 transition and gradually restored at further stages of cell cycle progression. A sharp decline in Mecp2 expression is essential for efficient quiescence exit in response to extrinsic stimuli using both in vivo and in vitro models. Additionally, the E3 ligase Nedd4 contributes to the ubiquitination and degradation of Mecp2 at quiescence exit, which modulates the pace of quiescence exit. Mechanistically, Mecp2 governs quiescence exit by transcriptionally orchestrating proliferative and metabolic gene expression, among which many nuclear receptor genes (NRs) emerge as novel Mecp2-activated genes in quiescent cells. Together, our findings identify a critical negative regulatory role for Mecp2 in quiescence exit and tissue regeneration, partially through targeting several NRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mecp2 is dynamically expressed during injury-induced liver regeneration</title><p>To screen for key regulators governing the initiation/priming phase of liver regeneration, we used the 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PHx) mouse model, a widely used in vivo model to study quiescence exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mitchell and Willenbring, 2008</xref>). Surprisingly, Mecp2, a well-known essential regulator of brain development, emerged as a dramatically repressed protein at the priming/initiation stage of PHx-induced liver regeneration. The expression kinetics of Mecp2 were examined at both the mRNA and protein levels in liver tissues at six time points after PHx, which cover the three phases of liver regeneration, namely priming/initiation, progression, and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fausto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The results showed that Mecp2 was remarkably reduced as early as 6 hr after PHx, was further decreased at 12 hr and 24 hr, but was restored at the 48 and 120 h time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The decrease in the active histone mark H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>) at the Mecp2 promoter was consistent with the reduced transcriptional activity within 36 hr post-PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, Mecp2 protein levels were decreased more dramatically than mRNA, suggesting a post-translational regulation of Mecp2 at the very early stage of liver regeneration. The early acute reduction of Mecp2 in hepatocytes during liver regeneration, mainly in nuclei, was further validated by immunofluorescence (IF) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To confirm the quiescence exit-specific reduction of Mecp2 in hepatocytes, we assessed proliferation-associated proteins that are widely used to distinguish the G0 from the G1 phase, including phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), Cyclin D1, and Ki67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). The phosphorylation states of Rb, including unphosphorylated, hypo-phosphorylated, and hyper-phosphorylated Rb, can reflect G0, early G1, and late G1 phases, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Narasimha et al., 2014</xref>). The results showed that pRb was undetectable by 6 hr after PHx. Accordingly, Cyclin D1, which mediates the phosphorylation of Rb, was also maintained at extremely low levels during the very early stage of liver regeneration. Several other cyclins important for the G1/S stage (Cyclin E1) and the G2/M stage (Cyclin A2 and B1) were also expressed at low levels, further supporting the negative correlation between the amount of Mecp2 and cell cycle reentry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, Ki67, a well-known proliferation marker, which is degraded and barely detected in the G0 phase but accumulates during cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim and Sederstrom, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 2018</xref>), showed an inverse correlation with Mecp2 in hepatocytes within 48 hr after PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It is worth noting that the acute reduction in Mecp2 during quiescence exit was gradually restored by 48–120 hr post-PHx, suggesting the functional involvement of Mecp2 in active cell cycle phases. Together, these findings demonstrate the identification of Mecp2 as a new cell cycle-associated protein, which is highly expressed in quiescent hepatocytes, sharply decreased at the G0/G1 transition, and gradually restored at later stages of cell cycle progression during injury-induced liver regeneration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mecp2 is immediately decreased in the liver after partial hepatectomy (PHx).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Real-time PCR to evaluate mRNA levels of Mecp2 at different time points after PHx.

IF staining for Ki67 showed that Mecp2-deficient livers contained more proliferating hepatocytes than controls, further supporting the enhanced G0/G1 transition in Mecp2-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Accordingly, liver regeneration was significantly enhanced at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr after PHx based on the significantly higher liver index in the Mecp2-cKO mice than in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of Nedd4 on SR-induced quiescence exit of 3T3 cells. Knocking down Nedd4 using siRNA replenished the remarkable reduction of Mecp2 at the early stages of quiescence exit, and thus resulted in lower levels of proliferation markers such as pRb, Cyclin D1, and Ki67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). Nedd4 deficiency significantly retained cells in the G0 phase upon SR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). On the contrary, Nedd4 OE significantly enhanced the degradation of Mecp2 and accordingly accelerated the quiescence exit, which mimicked the effect of Mecp2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–J</xref>). Thus, Nedd4 interacts with Mepc2 and regulates quiescence exit partially through post-translational regulation of Mecp2 upon quiescence exit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mecp2 slows quiescence exit by transcriptionally activating metabolism-associated genes while repressing proliferation-associated genes</title><p>It has been well established that Mecp2 transcriptionally regulates gene expression by binding methylated CpG islands and chromatin proteins in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rube et al., 2016</xref>). However, little is known about the transcriptional targets of Mecp2 during hepatocyte quiescence exit in the regenerating liver. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying Mecp2-regulated quiescence exit, we performed RNA-seq combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the Mecp2-dependent transcriptome genome-wide during the very early stage of liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). RNA-seq and comparative analyses in control <italic>Mecp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and Mecp2-cKO mice livers before and 6 hr after PHx revealed 3048 Mecp2-dependent genes that were differentially expressed in a Mecp2-dependent manner.

It has been reported that Mecp2 occupies a large proportion of the genome in the brain due to its methyl-CpG (mCpG)-binding preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rube et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lagger et al., 2017</xref>).

To further identify putative Mecp2-direct target genes, we integrated Mecp2-dependent genes with Mecp2-binding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As a result, there were 2658 Mecp2 direct target genes, in which 537 were PHx-activated and 2121 were PHx-repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). GO analysis showed that PHx-activated Mecp2 targets, which are either silent or basally expressed in quiescent hepatocytes, were highly enriched in proliferation-associated biological processes such as ribosome biogenesis, rRNA metabolic process, ncRNA metabolic process, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase I, whereas PHx-repressed Mecp2 targets, which are highly expressed in quiescent hepatocytes, were associated with several metabolic processes including carboxylic acid catabolic process, cellular amino acid metabolic process, fatty acid metabolic process, and steroid metabolic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Notably, among PHx-repressed genes, several NRs were newly identified as Mecp2 direct targets, such as <italic>Nr2f6</italic>, <italic>Nr3c1</italic>, <italic>Nr1h3</italic>, <italic>Nr1i3</italic>, <italic>Nr6a1</italic>, <italic>Rxrg</italic>, <italic>Rara</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1</italic>, <italic>Srebf1,</italic> and <italic>Ppard</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Intriguingly, Mecp2 occupancy at these regions was not apparently altered after PHx, which was inconsistent with its protein levels, suggesting that the majority of Mecp2 is not tightly associated with the genome in quiescent hepatocytes and Mecp2 may recruit other factor(s) to achieve the differential transcriptional outcomes in response to extrinsic stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mecp2 transcriptionally regulates quiescence exit.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap of Mecp2 direct target genes at the early stage of liver regeneration rank-ordered by their gene expression fold change.

Retinoic acid (RA) has long been recognized as a liver mitogen required for normal liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bushue and Wan, 2009</xref>). Rara and Rarb as receptors for RA have been recently identified to mediate RA-induced hepatocyte proliferation after PHx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Cholesterol is another important regulator of cell proliferation. Nr1h3 (LXR) is highly expressed in the liver and has recently been reported to reduce hepatocyte proliferative capacity during PHx-induced regeneration by regulating genes involved in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lo Sasso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willy et al., 1995</xref>).

Conversely, dysregulation of quiescence exit may compromise tissue integrity and lead to oncogenesis. In this work, we sought to explore the general molecular mechanisms that regulate quiescence by focusing on Mecp2, a multifunctional protein with a broad spectrum of activities. Using genetic mouse models, cellular models, and genome-wide approaches, we uncovered a regulatory capacity of Mecp2 in quiescence exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). In quiescent cells, Mecp2 is maintained at relative high levels and serves as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. It binds to and activates metabolic genes, such as several NRs, while repressing proliferation-associated genes in quiescent and metabolically hyperactive hepatocytes. In response to extrinsic stimuli, such as injury and mitogenic stimulation, the protein levels of Mecp2 are acutely decreased by both transcriptional repression and Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination. The remarkable reduction of Mecp2 releases the transcriptional repression of proliferation-associated genes while compromising the activation of metabolic genes in order to satisfy a rapidly regenerating demand of the remaining hepatocytes, eventually leading to quiescence exit and cell cycle progression. The transient repression of Mecp2 during quiescence exit and its restoration during further cell cycle progression probably serve as means to avoid overinhibition of metabolism and guarantee the appropriate metabolic adaption required for cell proliferation. Therefore, our results suggest that quiescent cells employ Mecp2 to balance the needs of cell division and metabolism upon receiving extrinsic signals.</p><p>Although it has been reported that Mecp2 null mice develop fatty liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kyle et al., 2016</xref>), the Mecp2-cKO mice used in our study did not demonstrate obvious abnormalities, such as necrosis or liver damage when we performed PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Based on our comparative analysis of RNA-seq data from control and Mecp2 cKO livers before PHx, only 90 upregulated and 128 downregulated genes (log2 |FC|&gt;1.5, p&lt;0.05) were identified, which did not enrich any GO terms with adjusted p&lt;1 × 10<sup>–3</sup>, further supporting the notion that liver-specific deletion of Mecp2 does not cause liver abnormalities in 3-month-old mice. This allowed us to study liver regeneration in mice with non-damaged livers and avoid any defects prior to injury. It is worth noting that, other than accelerated cell cycle reentry, Mecp2 cKO hepatocytes also displayed a modest increase in cell size with enlarged nuclei relative to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), implying the attenuation of mitosis.</p><p>It has been well documented that both overexpression and depletion of Mecp2 have deleterious effects on neuronal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Na et al., 2013</xref>), and thus, tight regulation of Mecp2 protein levels is critical for its physiological functions. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that many Rett syndrome-causing mutations in the methyl-CpG binding domain not only compromise DNA binding capacity of Mecp2 but also reduce its protein stability, implying the relevance of protein stability in Mecp2 dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tillotson and Bird, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2016</xref>). Mecp2 has been shown to undergo various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation, which may also affect protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ausió et al., 2014</xref>). Protein degradation via ubiquitination is the most prevalent recycling machinery used by cells. Despite 11 identified ubiquitination sites in Mecp2, our knowledge about the E3 ligases that catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to these sites remains scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamonica et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellini et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang, 2014</xref> uncovered the role of RING Finger Protein 4 (RNF4) in transcriptional activation by mediating the ubiquitination of Mecp2. Herein, we discovered Nedd4 as a novel regulator of Mecp2 protein stability. Nedd4 has recently been identified as an essential regulator of liver regeneration through post-translational modification of growth factor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachofner et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with our results, Bachofner et al. reported in vivo knockdown of Nedd4 in hepatocytes caused inhibition of cell proliferation after PHx. Although we identified Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of Mecp2 in the cellular model of quiescence exit, we also measured the expression of Nedd4 at the early stages of liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which in turn may drive hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle by targeting Mecp2. Further studies are needed to explore what domain(s) is (are) responsible for the interaction between Mecp2 and Nedd4, which corresponding ubiquitylation sites within Mecp2 are targeted by Nedd4, and whether ubiquitylation site mutations of Mecp2 can completely abolish cell cycle reentry.</p><p>The switch from quiescence to active cycling requires coordinating all the necessary metabolic and cell cycle machinery. There is an urgent need to synthesize DNA, proteins, and lipids required for the generation of daughter cells in resting cells reentering the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coller, 2019</xref>). Regarding injury-induced hepatic regeneration, a global transcriptome shift from metabolism to proliferation is a reasonable strategy to satisfy the proliferating needs at the early stages of liver regeneration after PHx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Chen, 2017</xref>). Consistently, we observed an increase in gene expression involved in mRNA abundance, splicing, and translation, and a decrease in genes enriched in fatty acid, lipid, and amino acid metabolism at 6 hr post-PHx in a Mecp2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). This metabolic repression is transient and largely restored when the regenerating liver reaches its original size. Yet, how Mecp2 differentially regulates proliferation-associated and metabolic genes is a fascinating question that remains unanswered in our study and merits further investigation.</p><p>In this study, we discovered that Mecp2-mediated transcriptional activation of genes involved in metabolism is one of the mechanisms that prevents exit from quiescence. Specifically, we identified 10 NRs, which are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The NR superfamily can be divided into three classes based on their ligands and mechanisms of action, including the steroid receptor family, the thyroid/retinoid family, and the orphan receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rudraiah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pearen and Muscat, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng and Murphy, 2016</xref>). To date, studies on NRs have elucidated the roles of several NRs in regulating hepatomegaly and liver regeneration, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα or Nr1c1, and PPARγ or Nr1c3), pregnane X receptor (PXR, Nr1i2), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, Nr1i3), liver X receptor (LXR, Nr1h3), and farnesoid X receptor (FXR, Nr1h4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). Among these genes, <italic>Nr1i3</italic> and <italic>Nr1h3</italic> also emerged as PHx-repressed Mecp2-activated NRs in our study. Consistent with our observations, Sasso et al. demonstrated that Nr1h3, which is responsible for cholesterol catabolism and fatty acid synthesis, acts as an inhibitor of liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lo Sasso et al., 2010</xref>). However, they did not observe the decreased mRNA levels of both LXR isoforms (Nr1h3 and Nr1h2) mainly because they monitored the transcriptional levels at 1 d post-PHx, which was not early enough to capture the upstream changes in transcriptional regulation. In general, previous studies have barely focused on the connection between quiescence exit and NRs. Based on our observations, the inhibition of certain NRs by Mecp2 depletion during quiescence exit is probably general and not hepatocyte-specific because we also validated the repression of several NRs in cellular models of quiescence exit. Additionally, the functional validation of Nr1h3 and Rara in 3T3 cells further supports the notion that Mecp2 may postpone cell cycle reentry through activating NRs. However, not all NRs exhibit the same function in quiescence exit. Huang and colleagues reported that the absence of the primary nuclear bile acid receptor FXR (also known as Nr1h4) strongly inhibited liver growth in the early stages of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the cell type- and/or stimulus-specific function and detailed mechanisms for certain NRs in regulating quiescence exit await further investigation. Our study highlights the importance of NRs in mediating Mecp2-regulated quiescence exit, which may serve as attractive therapeutic targets after further investigation of the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>In summary, our study opens a brand-new perspective to understand the functional involvement of Mecp2 as a general regulator of quiescence exit and has provided insight into the mechanisms that may link metabolism to quiescence exit. Differential targeting of Mecp2 based on its different roles at different cell-cycle phases should be taken into consideration when examining potential clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Resources table</title><p>Detailed information on reagents, antibodies, primers, and shRNAs is listed in Appendix 1—key resources table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>All the animal studies were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of South Medical University ethics committee and were approved by the Ethics Committee on Use and Care of Animals of Southern Medical University (SMUL2017193).

All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/l glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). To synchronize cells in G0 by SS, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per cm<sup>2</sup> overnight and allowed to attach to the tissue culture plate. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and starved in DMEM with 0.1% FBS for 30 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coller et al., 2006</xref>).

The integrity of RNA was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system. After the fragmentation was carried out, first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase, then used RNaseH to degrade the RNA. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA Polymerase I and dNTP. The library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system and then sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. According to the Eoulsan pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jourdren et al., 2012</xref>), data were processed using read filters, mappings, alignment filters, read quantifications, normalizations, and differential analyses. Before mapping, polyN read tails were trimmed, reads ≤40 bases were removed, and reads with quality mean ≤ 30 were discarded. Alignments from reads matching more than once on the reference genome were removed using the Java version of Samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2009</xref>). All overlapping regions between alignments and referenced exons (or genes) were counted using HTSeq-count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>). The normalization step and the differential analyses were carried out with DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Love et al., 2014</xref>).

Approximately 10 µg of chromatin was diluted in ChIP buffer and pre-cleared with Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen, 10004D) for 2 hr at 4°C. Anti-H3K27ac antibodies and anti-Mecp2 antibodies were added to the pre-cleared chromatin, followed by rotation overnight at 4°C. The Dynabeads were washed with low/high salt solutions and eluted twice in TE buffer containing 1% SDS at 65°C for 15 min. The combined eluates were isolated by reversal of cross-linking, incubated with RNase A (10 µg/ml) followed by proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml), and the DNA was extracted using a phenol-chloroform extraction protocol.

Their data show that Mecp2 levels were remarkably reduced during the priming/initiation stage of partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration and that altered Mecp2 expression affected the quiescence exit. Additionally, the authors identified Nedd4 E3 ligase that is required for downregulation of Mecp2 during quiescence exit. This is an interesting study with well-presented data that supports the authors' conclusions regarding the role of Mecp2 in transcription regulation during the G0/G1 transition. However, the significance of the study is limited by a lack of mechanistic insights into the function of Mecp2 in the process. This weakness can be addressed by identifying the signaling pathway(s) that trigger Mecp2 degradation during the quiescence exit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Since the data suggests that the degradation of Mecp2 is a crucial event in the exit from quiescence, gaining a better understanding of the underlying mechanism would improve the significance of the study. In this regard, the authors should take advantage of the serum stimulated degradation of Mecp2 (Fig. 3D) to identify the signaling pathway(s) required for the degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying Mecp2-regulated quiescence exit, we performed RNA-seq combined with ChIP-seq to identify the Mecp2-dependent transcriptome genome-wide during the early stage of liver regeneration (Figure S6C). There were 2658 Mecp2 direct target genes, in which 537 were PHx-activated and 2121 were PHx-repressed genes (Figure 6A). GO analysis showed that PHx-activated Mecp2 targets were highly enriched in proliferation-associated biological processes such as ribosome biogenesis, rRNA metabolic process, ncRNA metabolic process, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase I, whereas PHx-repressed Mecp2 targets were associated with several metabolic processes including carboxylic acid catabolic process, cellular amino acid metabolic process, fatty acid metabolic process and steroid metabolic process (Figure 6B). These results suggest that Mecp2 plays a negative regulatory role during quiescence exit by activating metabolism-associated genes while repressing proliferation-associated genes in quiescent cells.</p><p>Given the more rapid decay of Mecp2 at the protein compared to the mRNA level during the quiescence-proliferation transition, we speculated that Mecp2 is targeted by posttranslational regulation. This hypothesis was supported by proteasome inhibition with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which attenuated the reduction of Mecp2 in quiescent cells after S.R. (Figure S5A). To identify the signaling pathway that regulate Mecp2 degradation during the G0/G1 transition, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) using Mecp2 antibody in quiescent 3T3 cells treated with or without S.R. (Figure S5B). A total of 647 proteins were identified as putative Mecp2 interactors. We were particularly interested in the proteins involved in proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process which was one of the enriched Gene Ontology (GO) items in the Mecp2 interactome (Table S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors suggest that Mecp2 downregulation accelerates the induction of pRb, which serves as a key marker for G0/G1 transition. However, their data only show increased magnitudes of the expression in Mecp2 downregulated cells at the timepoints when samples were collected (Figs. 2B and 4B). In the in vitro experiments, the authors should investigate earlier timepoints to demonstrate that induction of pRB during the quiescence exit occurs earlier in Mecp2 deficient cells compared to control cells. Likewise, a later induction of pRB in Mecp2 overexpression cells, in comparison to normal cells, should be demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these valuable suggestions. We have, accordingly, collected cell samples re-entered the cell cycle at 30-, 60-, 90- and 120-minutes post-S.R. We examined the pRb expression and found that phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) at Ser807/811 occurs earlier (about 90 minutes) in Mecp2 deficient cells compared to control cells (Figure S4C). Compared to the EV, Mecp2 OE resulted in the delayed induction of pRB (about 60 minutes) upon S.R. (Figure S4D). These data indicate that enhanced reduction of Mecp2 stimulates exit from quiescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There are three well-known phosphorylation sites in Mecp2, including S80, S229, and S423. As protein ubiquitination and degradation are often triggered by phosphorylation, it would be interesting to examine whether phosphorylation at these sites of Mecp2 is required for its downregulation during quiescence exit. This can be achieved using non-phosphorylate mutants of Mecp2.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good question. Indeed, the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome system (26S UPS) is responsible for the breakdown of MeCP2 (PMID: 28394263, 28973632). In 2009, the bona fide PEST (enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) domains have been identified, which are highly conserved across vertebrate evolution (PMID: 19319913). Consensus sequences enriched in PEST residues have been found to predispose proteins containing them for rapid proteolytic degradation (PMID: 8755249, 2876518). In addition, phosphorylation within PEST motifs precedes ubiquitination of proteins (PMID: 15229225). One of the best characterized sites of MeCP2 phosphorylation (S80) (PMID: 19225110), as well as one of the identified ubiquitination sites (K82/K99) (PMID: 22615490), both fall within one of these regions. It is still noteworthy that most of the MeCP2 phosphorylation sites were found in close proximity to potential ubiquitylation sites. For example, Rett syndrome missense mutations in Rett syndrome affecting three (K82R, K135A, K256S) of the ubiquitination sites (PMID: 25165434) and S80 (within one of the PEST sequences) and K82 have been shown to be phosphorylated and ubiquitinated.</p><p>Based on the above discussion, we providing a potential hypothesis that the MeCP2 turnover during cell cycle re-entry is achieved by an initial phosphorylation signal (phosphorylated at S80, S229, or S421) that triggers the ubiquitination of a close lysine residue. We hope to solve these issues and be able to present the findings in future work. Thanks again for your professional suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It would be interesting if the authors could also examine the effect of altered expression of Mecp2 on the maintenance of quiescence. For example, whether the downregulation of Mecp2 sensitizes quiescent cells for entry of the cell cycle in response to serum stimulation or delays withdrawal from the cell cycle upon serum starvation or contact inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. Cell cycle synchronization was induced with serum deprivation. When nutrients are exhausted, altered expression of Mecp2 have no statistical influence on the maintenance of quiescence as analyzed by Flow cytometric (Figure 4D and H). This suggests that the altered expression of Mecp2 alone may not be sufficient for cell cycle exit. In the presence of growth factors or nutrients, loss of MeCP2 only accelerates the rate of cell cycle re-entry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>For Figs. 2D, 2H, and 2L, it would be more intuitive if the percentage of changes in liver index rather than the relative index values were used. Also, the values listed in the figures should start from time zero after partial hepatectomy rather than pre-surgery.</p></disp-quote><p>Liver weight have the corresponding change with body weight. The liver index (ratio of regenerate liver weight/body weight) is tightly regulated and depends on metabolic demands of the organism. During the course of liver regeneration, reestablishment of liver volume after resection is regulated by the functional needs of the organism. Using the percentage of regenerate liver weight/body weight as a liver growth index could reflect the regenerative function.Next, we agree with the data presentation form and the values listed in the figures have been modified in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>My concerns are as follows:</p><p>(1) The authors note that the decrease in Mecp2 protein levels was more pronounced than the decrease in mRNA levels, suggesting the presence of post-translational regulation of Mecp2 during the early stages of G0 exit. Could the decrease in MeCP2 levels be related to autophagy flux?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comments. Also, we have compared the cells extracts from untreated and chloroquine-treated cells (to block lysosomal degradation). Chloroquine did not cause any accumulation of MeCP2 (Figure S5B). The results suggest that autophagy activity do not involve in the decrease the MeCP2 protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In addition to Cyclin D1, how about other cell cycle-related proteins (cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin E) were changed when MeCP2 was lost during cell cycle re-entry? Protein expression should be examined by western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your valuable suggestions. The expression of cell cycle related protein cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 were evaluated by Western blotting. The expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 was enhanced by the knockdown of MeCP2 (Figure 4B). Conversely, the repressed expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 was observed by the over-expression of MeCP2 (Figure 4F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) By combining MeCP2 ChIP-seq and RNA-seq of genes regulated by MeCP2, the authors uncovered the dual role of Mecp2 in preventing quiescence exit by targeting Rara and Nr1h3. All they show are the Q-PCR results. The authors should show the protein level of Rara and Nr1h3 when MeCP2 was lost during cell cycle re-entry.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your advice.
