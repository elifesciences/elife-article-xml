population of neural stem cells prevalent in the developing human cortex that contribute to its cellular diversity and evolutionary expansion. The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is active in human oRG cells. Mutations in mTOR pathway genes are linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders and malformations of cortical development. We find that dysregulation of mTOR signaling specifically affects oRG cells, but not other progenitor types, by changing the actin cytoskeleton through the activity of the Rho-GTPase, CDC42. These effects change oRG cellular morphology, migration, and mitotic behavior, but do not affect proliferation or cell fate. Thus, mTOR signaling can regulate the architecture of the developing human cortex by maintaining the cytoskeletal organization of oRG cells and the radial glia scaffold. Our study provides insight into how mTOR dysregulation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>outer radial glia</kwd><kwd>human cortex</kwd><kwd>organoids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01MH114825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kriegstein</surname><given-names>Arnold</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3R35NS097305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kriegstein</surname><given-names>Arnold</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRANT_NUMBER: 27729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Subramanian</surname><given-names>Lakshmi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002736</institution-id><institution>Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P0530360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Subramanian</surname><given-names>Lakshmi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007557</institution-id><institution>California Institute of Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GC1R-06673-C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kriegstein</surname><given-names>Arnold</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>mTOR signaling regulates the morphology of a human-enriched neural stem cell population and thus contributes to the radial architecture of the developing human cortex with implications for neurodevelopmental disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionary expansion of the human cerebral cortex has been attributed to an increase in progenitor cell number and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borrell and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rakic, 2009</xref>). In particular, oRG cells, a predominant progenitor population in the developing human cortex, contribute extensively to cortical expansion and folding due, in part, to their morphology and unique mitotic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsumoto et al., 2020</xref>). oRG cells undergo mitotic somal translocation (MST) where the nucleus moves rapidly along the basal process towards the pial surface prior to mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>). The migration and MST behaviors of oRG cells depend greatly on the integrity of the basal process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalebic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostrem et al., 2014</xref>). oRG basal processes also function as a glial scaffold to support neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gertz and Kriegstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nowakowski et al., 2016</xref>). The specific morphology and dynamic behavior of oRG cells contribute to the proliferative expansion of the cortex and provide a scaffold upon which neuronal migration depends.</p><p>Recent studies have identified high levels of mTOR signaling in human oRG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nowakowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pollen et al., 2019</xref>). Multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and malformations of cortical development are thought to arise due to the effects of mTOR signaling mutations on progenitor cells during fetal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subramanian et al., 2019</xref>). Because oRG cells are a major progenitor population during neurogenesis and show significant mTOR activity at this stage, they may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of dysregulated mTOR signaling during a critical developmental period. Recent studies ectopically hyperactivating the mTOR Complex 1 (C1) pathway in mouse models have identified phenotypic changes to neuronal size, morphology, and laminar position that resemble disease features of cortical malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2018</xref>). However, questions remain regarding the effects of mTOR dysregulation on progenitor cells as well as relevant differences between human and mouse cortical development. oRG cells are a vital cortical stem cell population in humans, but they are much less abundant in the mouse cortex. While mTOR signaling can regulate aspects of cortical development in rodents, the role of this signaling pathway in human oRG cells is not yet understood.</p><p>We therefore investigated the functional role of mTOR signaling in oRG cells using both tissue samples and in vitro models of the developing human cortex. In addition to the culture of primary cortical tissue and dissociated cells, we utilized cortical organoids because of their tractability as a model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews and Nowakowski, 2019</xref>). Using these human model systems we observed that an appropriate level of mTOR activity is required to maintain oRG basal process morphology and migration behavior. As the basal processes of oRG cells contribute to the primary radial scaffold, particularly during the migration of upper layer cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nowakowski et al., 2016</xref>), balanced mTOR signaling is also crucial for the development of proper human cortical structure and organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Changes in mTOR signaling disrupt the glial scaffold in primary cortical cultures and organoids</title><p>Mediators of mTOR signaling are expressed in discrete domains in the developing human cortex, in both primary cortical tissue and cortical organoid models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Activation of the mTORC1 pathway leads to the phosphorylation of S6 kinase, which can be used as a downstream readout of mTORC1 signaling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). In the developing human cortex, oRG cells can be identified by the expression of HOPX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>). Phosphorylated S6 (pS6) is detected in HOPX-expressing oRG cells, but not in other progenitor subtypes such as ventricular radial glia (vRG), truncated radial glia (tRG), and intermediate progenitors (IPCs), or in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–I</xref>). To explore the role of mTOR signaling in oRG cells, we utilized organotypic slice cultures of primary cortical tissue from gestational weeks (GW) 15–19, the developmental period when oRG cells are rapidly expanding. This corresponds to the peak neurogenic stages in the developing human cortex. Cortical slice cultures were treated with rapamycin to inhibit, and BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>) or 3BDO (Sigma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) to hyperactivate, mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In control slices, pS6 expression was most abundant in the outer subventricular zone (oSVZ), where most oRG cells reside. In rapamycin-treated slices, most of the pS6 expression was lost, while slices treated with BDNF/3BDO generally showed increased pS6, indicating activation of mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>mTOR signaling is active in outer radial glial cells, but not other neural progenitor types, during human cortical development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simplified schematic of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. mTOR signaling has many mediators and regulates diverse processes throughout development.

By 10 weeks, HOPX+ oRG cells in cortical organoids are arranged in a rosette-like formation with a rudimentary radial scaffold.

In primary cortical tissue slices and organoids, <italic>RPTOR</italic> shRNA electroporation resulted in decreased pS6 levels in GFP-expressing electroporated cells, while <italic>TSC2</italic> shRNA increased pS6 levels in primary tissue, supporting the efficacy of the mTOR manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).

In the organoid models, there were modest changes to progenitor and neuron proportions in some mTOR manipulation conditions. However, these results were inconsistent across PSC lines and conditions. Therefore, the organoid model may not be a reliable indicator of mTOR-induced changes in cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; n &gt; 34 sections/group, six organoids/group from three experiments). Moreover, the results did not reflect the observations from slice culture experiments, a more cytoarchitecturally accurate model of human cortex development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that mTOR signaling has little effect on oRG cell fate. Additionally, mTOR modulation did not alter proliferation, as indicated by BrdU incorporation or presence of the mitotic marker, phospho-histone-H3 (pH-H3), or induce cell death, as indicated by cleaved-caspase 3, in primary slices or organoid cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>; primary: n &gt; 3 slices/group from five experiments; organoids: n &gt; 19 sections/group four organoids/group from four experiments).

The mTOR signaling pathway is dysregulated in many neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and Fragile X Syndrome, as well as in cortical malformations such as Focal Cortical Dysplasia and Tuberous Sclerosis. These complex neurodevelopmental disorders arise as a result of accumulated errors throughout development affecting both proliferative cells as well as the migration, morphology, connectivity and plasticity of neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subramanian et al., 2019</xref>). Discrete short-term and long-term changes to mTOR signaling can therefore create dynamic structural and functional changes in the brain, complicating our understanding of these diseases. A thorough characterization of these different effects of mTOR dysregulation in human cortical development is therefore crucial to the creation of better disease models and therapies for multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we document the role of mTOR signaling in oRG cells during the neurogenic period of human cortical development. We observe specific activation and function of mTORC1 signaling in human oRG cells, but not other neural progenitor subtypes, during peak neurogenesis. Further, we identify a unique role for the mTOR signaling pathway in regulating oRG morphology and migration. The polar morphology of oRG cells, with an elongated basal process, not only provides a mechanism for the dynamic division and migratory behavior that promotes progenitor expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gertz and Kriegstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalebic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">LaMonica et al., 2013</xref>), but also creates a scaffold for the migration of cortical neurons. Our results show that mTOR signaling in oRG cells is tightly regulated to maintain cell morphology. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling results in truncation of the basal process and oRG migration defects. Furthermore, mTOR signaling activity is transduced by CDC42/RAC1-mediated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and defects after mTOR loss can be rescued by CDC42/RAC1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). By regulating the morphology of oRG cells and modulating their migratory behavior, mTOR signaling plays a central role in the development of the human cerebral cortex.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model of mTOR regulation of oRG morphology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simplified model of mTOR signaling pathway activating the GTPases, CDC42 and RAC1 to regulate actin dynamics.

(<bold>C</bold>) When mTOR signaling is dysregulated the basal process is truncated and oRG cells have decreased levels of F-actin, CDC42, CFL1, and ACTR2.

Given the cytoskeletal effects of mTOR signaling in oRG cells, the mTORC2 pathway could be the transducer of mTOR signaling in oRG cells. However, mTORC2 signaling is RPTOR-independent and less sensitive to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>). In oRG cells, both rapamycin treatment and RPTOR shRNA have clear effects on the cytoskeleton, similar to the downstream effects of mTORC2. Prolonged rapamycin exposure may affect the assembly of mTORC2 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sarbassov et al., 2006</xref>), but the cytoskeletal effects of RPTOR shRNA remain puzzling. Instead, it is possible that mTORC1 controls translation initiation and local mRNA transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pilaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pilaz and Silver, 2017</xref>) into the basal processes of oRG cells. Recent studies have identified direct regulation of translation of the human <italic>ß-Actin</italic> mRNA by mTORC1 and shown that this regulation may be cell-type dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eliseeva et al., 2019</xref>). mTORC1 may therefore, indirectly affect the ability of oRGs to generate cytoskeletal proteins needed for basal process elongation and maintenance by regulating protein synthesis. Both mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and C2, could thus control the cytoskeletal organization of the basal process in oRG cells, suggesting that the morphology and cell biology of the basal process may represent a crucial regulatory hub for cortical expansion.</p><p>In migrating neurons in the mammalian cortex, actin filaments interact with myosin motor proteins to control aspects of cell motility via actomyosin regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Solecki et al., 2009</xref>). We observed a particular division of labor between the actin cytoskeleton and non-muscle myosin II in human oRGs. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of the molecular motor, non-muscle myosin-II, along with active Rho-ROCK signaling for the generation of MSTs - the characteristic ‘jump and divide’ mitotic behavior unique to oRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostrem et al., 2014</xref>). mTOR signaling appears to affect the migration of oRGs prior to and during mitosis, without actually affecting the MST itself. mTOR signaling alters actin and its regulators in oRG cells but does not affect RHO A activity. Thus, the components of the actomyosin system appear to have complementary roles in regulating different aspects of oRG movement, with Rho-mediated non-muscle myosins regulating MSTs while migration itself is controlled by actin-modulating GTPases, such as CDC42 and RAC1. Effects of CDC42/RAC1 signaling on the morphology, polarity and proliferation of ventricular radial glia (vRG) have been reported in the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cappello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yokota et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that the specific activity of mTOR signaling in human oRG cells may control their morphology and migration through conserved molecular pathways.</p><p>The reasons behind the bimodal effects of mTOR signaling in human oRG cells remain unclear. Our observations of rapid and sustained changes to cell morphology following mTOR modulation in oRG cells suggest that these effects occur at the protein level, either by phosphorylation of key cytoskeletal mediators or due to the translational regulation of cytoskeletal mRNAs. mTORC1 and C2 act in large multi-protein complexes to control both aspects of protein regulation. As a result, optimum levels of individual proteins are needed for the proper assembly of functional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardestani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eliseeva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Varusai and Nguyen, 2018</xref>). It is probable that too much or too little of any of the individual proteins will result in abnormal functional protein assemblies and disrupted cytoskeleton in oRG cells. Similar observations detailing the bimodal effects of mTOR signaling on cellular phenomena have been made in other neurological systems. For example, mTOR signaling appears to function within an optimal activity range to regulate synaptic plasticity. Alterations leading to excessive increase or decrease in mTOR signaling have detrimental effects on both learning and long-term memory retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oddo, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the effects of mTOR on learning and memory likely occur via local translational control of protein synthesis in dendrites, which in turn regulate the structural plasticity of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehninger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oddo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puighermanal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2002</xref>). Similar translational control may operate in the basal processes of oRG cells, regulating the abundance of cytoskeletal proteins by maintaining optimal levels of mTOR signaling.</p><p>Future experiments will more deeply probe the molecular pathways by which mTOR signaling mediates its effects on the cytoskeleton of human oRG cells. Exploring the complexity of mTOR pathway interactions in the developing human cortex is particularly challenging given the limited availability of primary tissue. Cortical organoids, therefore, present an attractive option for future exploration as they are stem cell-derived, can be maintained long term, and are well-suited for molecular and genetic manipulations. While cortical organoids do not currently replicate all aspects of developing cortical organization and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amiri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pollen et al., 2019</xref>), many molecular and cellular developmental programs are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bershteyn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quadrato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sloan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramanian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Velasco et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that the mTOR signaling pathway has similar expression and functional effects in both primary human tissue and organoids. Future studies using human in vitro models will better resolve which mTOR complex proteins control cytoskeletal GTPases and clarify the relationship between actin regulation and oRG morphology, insights that may shed light on the mechanisms of human neurodevelopmental disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>H1/WA01 embryonic stem cell line</td><td>WiCell</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_9771">CVCL_9771</ext-link></td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>H28126 induced pluripotent stem cell line</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pollen et al., 2019</xref></td><td/><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>13234 induced pluripotent stem cell line</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0G84">CVCL_0G84</ext-link></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td> Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>CMV::GFP Adenovirus</td><td>Vector Biolabs, 1060</td><td/><td>1:200 dilution</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Aequorea victoria</italic>)</td><td>pCAG-EGFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref></td><td/><td>Electroporation</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Scramble shRNA</td><td>Addgene plasmid # 1864</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_1864">Addgene_1864</ext-link></td><td>Electroporation (1 µg/ul)</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Raptor_1 shRNA</td><td>Addgene plasmid # 1857</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_1857">Addgene_1857</ext-link></td><td>Electroporation (1 µg/ul)</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>pLKO.1-TSC2</td><td>Addgene plasmid # 15478</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_15478">Addgene_15478</ext-link></td><td>Electroporation (1 µg/ul)</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Primary Cortex Tissue Samples</td><td>UCSF Gamete, Embryo and Stem Cell Research Committee (GESCR) approval</td><td/><td>GW16-19</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Sox2 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10842165">AB_10842165</ext-link>;

Briefly, protein was isolated from the SVZ of microdissected slice cultures after treatment with vehicle, rapamycin, BDNF, CN04 or CN04+rapamycin. Microdissected tissue pieces were triturated with a fine gauge needle in lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor on ice. Protein concentration was calculated on a cuvette spectrometer (600 nM) using Precision Red Reagent (part #GL50). Concentration was normalized across samples by addition of proportionate volumes of lysis buffer. Normalized protein lysates were then applied to equilibrated Cytoskeleton Inc microplate wells and incubated. Plates were washed in between each of the subsequent steps: incubation with antigen presenting buffer, primary antibody, HRP secondary antibody, HRP detection solution and HRP stop solution. Colorimetric changes compared to negative control were detected using a microplate spectrometer (490 nM). Differences across groups were normalized to control and averaged across experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Primary basal fiber length quantification</title><p>To quantify the length of individual radial fibers, clearly visible GFP+ radial glia were selected. For all conditions, we identified the GFP+ cell in the oSVZ with the longest basal process, along with at least two additional representative cells for a total of three GFP+ processes per slice culture. The length of the basal process in these cells was measured between its point of origin on the basal side of the cell and its end point. As these were z-stacks of 300 µM tissue slices, the point where the basal process emerged from the cell body on the basal side was found in the appropriate z-plane and marked. The length of the process was traced through the depth of the z-stack and the endpoint marked using the polygon trace tool in Imaris software. The same tool was used to measure the length of the traced process. At least 3 cells/slice image were measured in µMs. The total height of the slice was then determined from the ventricular zone edge to the edge of the cortical plate. Since slice culture size is variable across experiments the length of each radial fiber was calculated as a percent of the total slice height. In both pharmacological and genetic studies, the GFP length of the longest process in all groups, which was also always the primary (basally-oriented) process, was measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Live imaging data analysis</title><p>Maximum intensity projections of the collected image stacks (5–10 μm step size) were compiled, generated into movies, and analysed using Imaris software. Maximum intensity projections of individual mitotic cells were examined before, during and after cytokinesis. The fiber was measured from the point of origin at the cell body to the tip of the longest primary branch. oRG cells were identified in dissociated progenitor cultures by their characteristic MST behavior, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostrem et al., 2014</xref>). MST was defined as a translocation of greater than or equal to one cell diameter of the soma along the primary process, with a velocity of greater than or equal to 20 μm/hr, coinciding with cell rounding, and ending either in immediate cytokinesis or in a prolonged, rounded state. Migration distance was calculated for mitotic cells that showed MSTs by retrospectively measuring the distance traveled by the cell during 20 imaging timepoints (approximately 16 hr) prior to mitosis.</p><sec id="s4-4-2-1"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All experiments, which contained more than two conditions per experiment, were evaluated for normality with the D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus test. If normally distributed, one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons was performed. If not normally distributed, Kruskall-Wallis Test was performed. For experiments containing only two conditions an unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test was used. Within an experiment, the control group was compared to each experimental group (rapamycin, BDNF, CN04 etc) and significance determined. Significance was assigned when p&lt;0.05. For all groups: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2-2"><title>Sample sizes </title><p>No sample size calculations were performed prior to experiments. Due to limited availability of developing human cortical tissue, we replicated experiments as many times as possible during the timeframe of the study. All experiments included samples from at least two individuals, although most were performed with &gt;3 individuals, and multiple technical replicates within each of those independent experiments. As organoids are a more readily available and renewable resource, we utilized more than three organoids for each experiment. All experiments also contained organoids derived from three different iPSC lines and several experimental replicates were collected from each line.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2-3"><title>Pre-established exclusion criteria </title><p>Slice, cell or organoid cultures with bacterial or fungal contamination were excluded.

Live imaging and primary electroporation experiments required large intact pieces of developing human cortex that are only rarely available. Some of these experiments were repeated two times using tissue from two different individuals. For organoid experiments, three different pluripotent stem cell lines were used for differentiation. All attempts at replication were successful.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2-5"><title>Randomization </title><p>In each experiment, the same tissue samples were sectioned and slices were evenly distributed across experimental conditions. Similar criteria were used for dissociated cell cultures.

functional role of mTOR signaling in human cortical development. Understanding the contribution of mTOR in human cortical development is important, as mTOR signaling is impaired in many neurodevelopmental disorders. The work provides valuable insights into the impact of mTOR signaling in regulating the morphology and behavior of outer radial glia (oRG) in the developing human cortex.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;mTOR signaling regulates the morphology and migration of outer radial glia in developing human cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Anita Bhattacharyya as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers all agree that the manuscript is elegantly performed and provides an important contribution by providing valuable insights into the impact of mTOR signaling in regulating the morphology and behavior of outer radial glia (oRG) in the developing human cortex.</p><p>The reviewers also agree that despite these strengths, there are significant problems that limit the potential impact of the results. In particular, the lack of consideration of other downstream signaling effectors, some that have been previously implicated to contribute to the cell behaviors in the manuscript, and the lack of rigorous statistical methods stand out as the major shortcomings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Need for more rigorous statistics, including statistical testing and comparisons as well as presentation of p-values. Specific revisions:</p><p>- Several times three or more groups are compared using one-way ANOVA and only one p-value is reported. For normally distributed data one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons and for not normally distributed data non-parametric test with multiple comparisons should be performed to compare each sample group and show individual p-values. This applies to Figure 1I, Figure 2C, 2D, 2E, Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, Figure 3B, Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, Figure 4A, 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>- Figure legends indicate that the mean with standard error of the mean is shown. However, Figure 4B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D actually show the mean with standard deviation. When reporting individual values, the mean with standard deviation should be given to account for the central tendency and variance of the data. Furthermore, in e.g. Figure 2D or Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and other figures the mean with error bars is not visible as it is covered by data points.</p><p>- In Figure 2C the quantification shows mean with standard error of the mean. However, control and rapamycin groups are clearly not normally distributed. Thus, rather the median and quartiles should be used to present the data. Furthermore, one-way ANOVA cannot be applied here as it assumes gaussian distribution of the data. A non-parametric test with multiple comparisons should be used.</p><p>- Exact values of N are not given for all figures. This is despite clear statements in the Transparent Reporting file. For example, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, says &quot;three independent experiments/protein/group&quot;, but based on the source file, this figure actually has between 2 and 7 data points.</p><p>- While the authors claim organoid experiments where reproduced with 3 independent cell lines there is no data showing this. Individual data points should be shown also in supplementary figures, especially for very low N-numbers and differing N-numbers between samples mean with SEM is misleading.</p><p>- The authors state that &quot;slices treated with BDNF/3BDO showed an increase in the number of pS6 expressing cells, indicating activation of mTOR signaling (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).&quot; Figure 2—figure supplement 1A shows no statistical test and based on source data 3BDO shows no significant increase in pS6 cells.</p><p>- Individual data points should be shown also in supplementary figures, especially for very low N-numbers and differing N-numbers between samples mean with SEM is misleading.</p><p>2) The authors will need to modify some of their conclusions and claims of novelty, taking all the previously published literature into consideration. Specific revisions:</p><p>- Modify conclusions: The data in the paper do not rule out other molecular contributors. The authors cannot rule out that the observed rescue in Figure 4 is not also due to activated Rac1 signaling and so the authors should modify their interpretation of this data.</p><p>- Modify claims of novelty: The authors demonstrate oRG-specific defects arising from mTOR hyper-activation and inhibition, but both the downstream targets and their effects have been characterized before. In particular, the authors should consider previous studies related to CDC42 (Cappello et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2010 (Rac1)).</p><p>3) Developmental timing and developmental disorders.

Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>For the revision of this manuscript by Andrews et al., authors were asked to modify three aspects of the original results and conclusions: (1) statistical analyses, (2) conclusions and claims of novelty and (3) discussion of developmental disorders. The authors have adequately provided more transparent and rigorous statistical analyses. The Discussion section has been modified to put the results in context of previously published literature and to include more specific consideration of the results in the context of developmental disorders.</p><p>However, there are two remaining issues that need to be addressed concerning the presentation of new data on the PSC lines and the way data were changed during the revision so that they no longer support the initial results.</p><p>1) The authors state (subsection “Changes in mTOR signaling disrupt the glial scaffold in primary cortical cultures and organoids”) &quot;In the organoid models, there were modest changes to progenitor and neuron proportions in one gain of function condition, with some variability across PSC lines (Figure 2—figure supplement 4;[…])&quot; and the figure supplement is entitled &quot;Effects of mTOR manipulations are generally consistent across PSC lines&quot;. Yet, the effects of rapamycin, BDNF and 3BDO treatment differ greatly between the different cell lines, sometimes resulting in opposite effects upon treatments (e.g. Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and Figure 2—figure supplement 4C). Thus, the data show that the effects of mTOR manipulation are not consistent and this should be discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>Comparison of treatment effects should be performed within a cell line, ideally presenting the data for control and all treatments next to each other per cell line. Combining the data of all cell lines as done in Figure 2—figure supplement 3B is not informative due to the big differences between cell lines. Rather conditions should be compared within each cell line and subsequently the observed differences should be compared to those in other cell lines. The authors should discuss the observed differences and the limitations arising from these.</p><p>2) While the statistics were corrected in the new version of the manuscript, the data used for the figure has also substantially changed. Based on the Source files provided, all the data points above 0.4 were left out and new data were added in the same range as the values that were kept. The same was done for Rapamycin and BDNF, while the 3BDO condition stayed exactly the same. The authors should provide an explanation for why they altered the data in this way. They also should explain how they determined the cellular processes that were measured. This is important as differences between rapamycin, BDNF and 3BDO treatment observed in the previous version are no longer observed in the current version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58737.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers all agree that the manuscript is elegantly performed and provides an important contribution by providing valuable insights into the impact of mTOR signaling in regulating the morphology and behavior of outer radial glia (oRG) in the developing human cortex.</p><p>The reviewers also agree that despite these strengths, there are significant problems that limit the potential impact of the results.

Changes to oRG morphology following mTOR manipulations were robust and always reproduced in organoids across iPSC lines. In our cell fate studies, we observed some variability among organoids from different iPSC lines following 3BD0 treatment, in the proportions of Hopx+, Tbr2+ and Ctip2+ cells. However, given the known variability of organoid models (Bhaduri et al., 2020), the modest differences in 3BD0-treated groups and overall consistency in rapamycin and BDNF-treated organoids with our independent observations in primary tissue, we concluded that mTOR manipulations have no significant effect on cell fate.

Additionally, we have clarified the possibility that RAC1 may play a role in mediating the changes we observed after mTOR manipulation. However, we observed a more dramatic activation of CDC42 in our Rho GTPase activation assays when compared to RAC1, and the CDC42 response was modulated by rapamycin, while the RAC1 response was not responsive to rapamycin. Therefore, we chose to directly pursue the relationship between mTOR signaling and CDC42. Although we still cannot rule out that RAC1 may play a role in the mTOR response, we want to be conservative in assigning such a role since there is little experimental evidence that it mediates the described phenotype.</p><p>This is further described in the Results section as follows: “The Rho GTPases, RHOA, RAC1 and CDC42, are actin regulators and prime candidate molecules to affect radial glial morphology and migration as Rho-ROCK signaling is required for oRG MST divisions <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/1wl7o3/Wa1W+oUQMN">(Hansen et al., 2017; Ostrem et al., 2014b)</ext-link> and CDC42 and RAC1 maintain radial glial polarity during mouse cortex development (Yokota et al. 2010; Cappello et al. 2006; Leone et al. 2010)<italic>”</italic> and in the discussion as follows: “Thus, the components of the actomyosin system appear to have complementary roles in regulating different aspects of oRG movement, with Rho-mediated non-muscle myosins regulating MSTs while migration itself is controlled by actin-modulating GTPases, such as CDC42 and RAC1. Effects of CDC42/RAC1 signaling on the morphology, polarity and proliferation of ventricular radial glia (vRG) have been reported in the mouse cortex (Capello et al., 2006; Yokota et al., 2010; Leone et al., 2010), suggesting that the specific activity of mTOR signaling in human oRG cells may control their morphology and migration through conserved molecular pathways.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Developmental timing and developmental disorders. The authors mention that mTOR pathway deregulation is important in several neurodevelopmental disorders. To avoid misinterpretation of the current study and its relevance for disease, acute effects of mTOR pathway deregulation and long-term developmental outcomes should be more clearly distinguished.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded our discussion on the implications of our studies and how the described short-term changes to mTOR signaling specifically affect early neural developmental processes. Additionally, we describe the potential long-term impact these changes may have on neuronal structure, maturation, connectivity and ultimately function as follows: “The mTOR signaling pathway is dysregulated in many neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and Fragile X Syndrome, as well as in cortical malformations such as Focal Cortical Dysplasia and Tuberous Sclerosis. These complex neurodevelopmental disorders arise as a result of accumulated errors throughout development affecting both proliferative cells as well as the migration, morphology, connectivity and plasticity of neurons and glia (Subramanian et al., 2020). Discrete short-term and long-term changes to mTOR signaling can therefore create dynamic structural and functional changes in the brain, complicating our understanding of these diseases. A thorough characterization of these different effects of mTOR dysregulation in human cortical development is therefore crucial to the creation of better disease models and therapies for multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the revision of this manuscript by Andrews et al., authors were asked to modify three aspects of the original results and conclusions: (1) statistical analyses, (2) conclusions and claims of novelty and (3) discussion of developmental disorders.

As noted by reviewers, there is variability in proportions of cell types across different stem cell lines. However, the results indicate minimal changes to cell fate overall. We have now represented cell fate organoid data in Figure 2—figure supplement 4 only and show the findings by cell line in detail. Figure 2—figure supplement 3 is now solely focused on the cell fate results from the primary tissue studies. Graphs in Figure 2—figure supplement 4 now represent each cell line with the control and treatment conditions together and statistics run within each group. Changes to particular markers in a given cell line and condition are detailed in the figure legend. The text in the manuscript now reads “In the organoid models, there were modest changes to progenitor and neuron proportions in some mTOR manipulation conditions. However, these results were inconsistent across PSC lines and conditions. Therefore, the organoid model may not be a reliable indicator of mTOR-induced changes in cell number (Figure 2—figure supplement 4; n&gt;34sections/group, six organoids/group from three experiments). Moreover, the results did not reflect the observations from slice culture experiments, a more cytoarchitecturally accurate model of human cortex development”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the statistics were corrected in the new version of the manuscript, the data used for the figure has also substantially changed. Based on the Source files provided, all the data points above 0.4 were left out and new data were added in the same range as the values that were kept. The same was done for Rapamycin and BDNF, while the 3BDO condition stayed exactly the same. The authors should provide an explanation for why they altered the data in this way. They also should explain how they determined the cellular processes that were measured. This is important as differences between rapamycin, BDNF and 3BDO treatment observed in the previous version are no longer observed in the current version.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to address this difference in our re-submitted manuscript primary slice culture data for Figure 2C. In our initial submission, we had included all slice culture data that had been collected and analyzed over many experiments that spanned several years, due to limited access of primary human tissue. However, upon re-analysis of our data, per reviewers’ comments, we realized that some of the initial studies did not include all mTOR conditions in every experiment. Although the trend for the early dataset was consistent, with a clear decrease in fiber length after mTOR manipulation, we decided it would be best to only include full experiments that had all mTOR conditions along with matched, paired controls and had been quantified using consistent, well-defined criteria. We apologise for not clarifying this change in our first revision. For full transparency, these initial datasets are now represented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and exclusion criteria is now detailed in the transparent reporting form.</p><p>Measurement of cellular processes: For all conditions, we identified the GFP+ cell in the oSVZ with the longest basal process, along with two additional representative cells for a total of three GFP+ processes per slice culture. The length of the basal process in these cells was measured between its point of origin on the basal side of the cell and its end using Imaris software as described in the subsection “Primary Basal Fiber Length Quantification”. The height of the slice is measured from the edge of the ventricular zone to the edge of the cortical plate. The GFP fiber length is then divided by the total slice height to determine the proportional fiber length. The quantification methods are additionally detailed in the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
