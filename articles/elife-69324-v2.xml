vistas on cellular processes. Extensive cell-to-cell variability at the transcriptomic and proteomic level has been one of the stand-out observations. Because most experimental analyses are destructive we only have access to snapshot data of cellular states. This loss of temporal information presents significant challenges for inferring dynamics, as well as causes of cell-to-cell variability. In particular, we typically cannot separate dynamic variability from within cells (‘intrinsic noise’) from variability across the population (‘extrinsic noise’). Here, we make this non-identifiability mathematically precise, allowing us to identify new experimental set-ups that can assist in resolving this non-identifiability. We show that multiple generic reporters from the same biochemical pathways (e.g. mRNA and protein) can infer magnitudes of intrinsic and extrinsic transcriptional noise, identifying sources of heterogeneity. Stochastic simulations support our theory, and demonstrate that ‘pathway-reporters’ compare favourably to the well-known, but often difficult to implement, dual-reporter method.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In biology, seemingly random variation within or between cells can have significant effects on a number of cellular processes, like how cells divide and develop. For example, how often a gene is switched on, or ‘expressed’, can randomly fluctuate over time. This ‘noise’ may lead to a cell having slightly more of a particular molecule, causing it to behave differently to other cells in the population. However, it is currently unclear how this random variation is created and controlled in cells, and what effect this has on biological systems as a whole.</p><p>When a gene is expressed, its sequence typically gets copied in to a molecule called mRNA, which is then processed and used to build the protein encoded by the gene. By measuring the levels of mRNA molecules in individual cells, researchers have been able to investigate how gene expression varies within populations. These experiments are carried out on dead cells at a single point in time, and mathematical models are then applied to detect noise in the molecular data.</p><p>This approach, however, precludes how noise changes over time, making it difficult to determine the source of cell-to-cell variability. In particular, whether the variation detected is the result of genuine random molecular changes (intrinsic noise), or external factors – such as temperature and pH – fluctuating in the cells environment (extrinsic noise).</p><p>Here, Ham et al. have built on previous mathematical models to identify a new approach for investigating the source of molecular noise. They found that for any given gene it is impossible to understand what causes its activity levels to vary just from data on its mRNA levels. Instead, information on other molecules that are affected by expression of the gene (termed ‘pathway reporters’) can provide a clearer picture of whether molecular variability is the result of intrinsic or extrinsic noise.</p><p>The mathematical models developed by Ham et al. reveal what can and cannot be learned about noise from gene expression data. Furthermore, pathway-reporters are easier to measure experimentally than other reporters that are typically used to study the origins and effects of cell-to-cell variability. These findings could help researchers design single cell experiments that are better for studying noise, leading to a deeper understanding of how different types of variation impact cell biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>stochasticity</kwd><kwd>extrinsic noise</kwd><kwd>noise decomposition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001782</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ham</surname><given-names>Lucy</given-names></name><name><surname>Stumpf</surname><given-names>Michael PH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>93 062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stumpf</surname><given-names>Michael PH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>There are fundamental limits to what can be learned about the origins of transcriptional noise from gene expression data alone, which can be overcome by simultaneously quantifying the abundances of linked molecular species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Noise is a fundamental aspect of every cellular process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shahrezaei and Swain, 2008b</xref>. Frequently it is even of functional importance, for example in driving cell-fate transitions. Sometimes it can afford evolutionary advantages, for example, in the context of bet-hedging strategies. Sometimes, it can be a nuisance, for example, when it makes cellular signal processing more difficult. But noise is nearly ubiquitous at the molecular scale, and its presence has profoundly shaped cellular life. Analysing and understanding the sources of noise, how it is propagated, amplified or attenuated, and how it can be controlled, has therefore become a cornerstone of modern molecular cell biology.</p><p>Noise arising in gene expression has arguably attracted most of the attention so far (but see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Filippi et al., 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jetka et al., 2018</xref> for the analysis of noise at the signalling level). Generally speaking, gene expression noise is separable into two sources of variability, as pioneered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swain et al., 2002</xref>. <italic>Intrinsic noise</italic> is generated by the dynamics of the gene expression process itself. The process, however, is often influenced by other external factors, such as the availability of promoters and of RNA polymerase, the influence of long noncoding RNA as a transcriptional regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodrich and Kugel, 2006</xref>, as well as differences in the cellular environment. Such sources of variability contribute <italic>extrinsic noise</italic>, and reflect the variation in gene expression and transcription activity across the cell population. As such, understanding extrinsic noise lies at the heart of understanding cell-population heterogeneity.</p><p>So far, identifying the sources of gene expression noise from transcriptomic measurements alone has proven difficult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paulsson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pedraza and Paulsson, 2008</xref>. The fundamental hindrance lies in the fact that single-cell RNA sequencing, which provides most of the available data, is destructive, so that datasets reflect samples from across a population, rather than samples taken repeatedly from the same cell. As temporal information is lost in such measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Komorowski et al., 2011</xref>, it may be impossible to distinguish temporal variability within individual cells (e.g. burstiness), from ensemble variability across the population (i.e. extrinsic noise). A number of numerical and experimental studies have suggested this confounding effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones and Elf, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zopf et al., 2013</xref>, showing that systems with intrinsic noise alone exhibit behaviour that is indistinguishable from systems with both extrinsic and intrinsic noise. This is examined more formally in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ham et al., 2020a</xref>, where we show that the moment scaling behaviour and transcript distribution may be indistinguishable from situations with purely intrinsic noise. The limitations in inferring dynamics from population data are becoming increasingly evident, and a number of studies that seek to address some of these problems have emerged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gorin and Pachter, 2020a</xref>.</p><p>Here we provide adetailed analysis of the extent to which sources of variability are identifiable from population single-cell omics data. We are able to prove rigorously that it is in general impossible to identify the sources of variability, and consequently, the underlying transcription dynamics, from observed transcript abundance distributions alone. Systems with intrinsic noise alone can always present identically to similar systems with extrinsic noise. For practical purposes, the effect does not appear to depend on the precise choice of distribution, but holds more generally. Moreover, we demonstrate that extrinsic noise invariably distorts the apparent degree of burstiness of the underlying system: data which seems ‘bursty’ is not necessarily generated by a bursty process, if there is cell-to-cell variability across the population. This is a stronger non-identifiability result than has previously been obtained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ingram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shahrezaei and Swain, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khammash, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Munsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Komorowski et al., 2011</xref>, and has important ramifications for our analysis of experimental data: we cannot assess causes of transcriptional variability, if we do not simultaneously assess cell-to-cell variability in the transcriptional machinery. Our results highlight (in fact prove mathematically) the requirement for additional information, beyond the observed copy number distribution, in order to constrain the space of possible dynamics that could give rise to the same distribution.</p><p>This seemingly intractable problem can at least partially be resolved with a brilliantly simple approach: the dual-reporter method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swain et al., 2002</xref>. In this approach, noise can be separated into extrinsic and intrinsic components, by observing correlations between the expression of two independent, but identically distributed fluorescent reporter genes. Dual-reporter assays have been employed experimentally to study the noise contributed by both global and gene-specific effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raser and O'Shea, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raj et al., 2006</xref>. A particular challenge, however, is that dual reporters are rarely identically regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quarton et al., 2020</xref>, and are not straightforward to set up in every system. More recently, it has been shown that the independence of dual reporters cannot be guaranteed in some systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Naik et al., 2021</xref>. As a result, there have been efforts in developing alternative methods for decomposing noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quarton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin and Amir, 2021</xref>. Here we develop a widely applicable generalisation (and simplification) of the original dual-reporter approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swain et al., 2002</xref>. We demonstrate that non-identical and not-necessarily independent reporters can provide an analogous noise decomposition. Our result shows that measurements taken from the same biochemical pathway (e.g. mRNA and protein) can replace dual reporters, enabling the noise decomposition to be obtained from a single gene. This completely circumvents the requirement of conditionally independent and identically regulated reporter genes. The results obtained from our ‘pathway-reporter’ method are also borne out by stochastic simulations, and compare favourably with the dual-reporter method. In the case of constitutive expression, the results obtained from our decomposition are identical to those obtained from dual reporters. For bursty systems, we show that our approach provides a satisfactorily close approximation, except in extreme cases. Our methodology is verified mathematically for the most common models of gene transcription, but holds independently of the specific nature of the gene expression dynamics, as we verify in silico across a range of more detailed models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A simple model for stochastic mRNA dynamics is the <italic>Telegraph model</italic>: a two-state model describing promoter switching, transcription, and mRNA degradation. In this model, all parameters are fixed, and gene expression variability arises due to the inherent stochasticity of the transcription process. As discussed above, this process will often be influenced by extrinsic sources of variability, and so modifications to account for this additional source of variability are required.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The telegraph model</title><p>The Telegraph model was first introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ko, 1991</xref>, and has since then been widely employed in the literature to model bursty gene expression in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahar Halpern et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">So et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larsson et al., 2019</xref>. In this model, the gene switches probabilistically between an active state and an inactive state, at rates λ (on-rate) and μ (off-rate), respectively.

Such dispersion is widely observed experimentally, and as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ham et al., 2020a</xref>, reflects the presence of extrinsic noise.</p><p>In the context of gene expression, it has been shown experimentally that some of the primary sources of extrinsic noise have an autocorrelation time comparable to the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenfeld et al., 2005</xref>. It is these slow changes in variability that justify the assumptions of the compound model. Typical sources of extrinsic variability for each parameter in the Telegraph model are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ham et al., 2020a</xref>. A further significant source of heterogeneity arises from the differences in cell-cycle phases across the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>. Such effects have been shown to obscure the precise underlying transcriptional dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zopf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huh and Paulsson, 2011</xref>, and impede the inference of transcriptional parameters from experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beentjes et al., 2020</xref>. The compound model we consider here is able to capture this variability, provided that the parameter change within each cell phase is relatively slow, and any dynamic parameter changes during the transition between phases can be considered as ephemeral. A more explicit treatment of the mechanisms and changes during the cell cycle is challenging to study analytically, and theoretical modelling is only in its infancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao and Grima, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beentjes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perez-Carrasco et al., 2020</xref>. Later, we verify our proposed noise decomposition on detailed models of gene transcription, incorporating salient features of the cell-cycle, such as gene replication, dosage compensation, binomial partitioning of products due to cell division, and cell-cycle length variability.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of the non-identifiability results.</title><p>in lines 1, 3, and 5 are our contributions, while the remaining representations (lines 2 and 4) are known and can be obtained as special cases of our results.

The representations given in (3 – 5), however, show that both estimating parameters and the underlying dynamics from the form of the copy number distribution alone can be misleading.

To demonstrate this, we replace the various noise distributions required for the representations in (3 – 5), with suitable normal distributions truncated at 0. In each case, we sample 1000 data points from the corresponding compound distribution, and compared this with the associated fixed-parameter copy number distribution. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The truncated normal distribution is not chosen on the basis of biological relevance, but rather to demonstrate that even a symmetric noise distribution (except for truncation at 0) produces qualitatively similar results to the distributions used in the precise non-identifiability results. In every case, the effect of varying the transcription rate or burst intensity parameter according to a unimodal noise distribution is to produce copy number distributions that are generally consistent with systems that appear burstier.</p><p>Finally, we note that our results explain previous empirical observations that static measurements of mRNA are not always sufficient to infer the underlying dynamics of gene activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skinner et al., 2016</xref> address some of these limitations by quantifying both nascent and mature mRNA in individual cells, as well incorporating cell-cycle effects into their analysis of two mammalian genes. A more developed treatment of model identifiability is given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gorin and Pachter, 2020a</xref>, where it shown how a stochastic model incorporating the downstream processing of mRNA can be used to distinguish a particular instance of non-identifiability. More specifically, the authors consider the non-identifiability problem noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ham et al., 2020a</xref>, arising from the Gamma-Poisson compound representation of the negative binomial distribution; a particular case of (4) above. Despite identical distributions at the nascent level, the marginal distributions of the processed (mature) mRNA are found to be substantially different. It is likely that a similar analysis will be valuable in the context of the other identifiability problems we have given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. In the next section, we take a more general approach to resolving non-identifibiality and exploit the properties of complex gene expression dynamics to determine not only the presence of extrinsic noise, but also estimate its magnitude.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Resolving non-identifiability</title><p>The results of the previous section show that additional information, beyond the observed copy number distribution, is required to constrain the space of possible dynamics that could give rise to the same distribution.

One example is gene regulation via repression, which naturally leads to periods of gene inactivity. Here, we consider a four-stage model of bursty gene expression, which incorporates both promoter switching and mRNA maturation; we denote this model by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf328"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐌</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (bottom left). This model has recently been considered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao and Grima, 2020</xref>, where the marginal distributions are solved in some limiting cases. In this model, the gene switches probabilistically between an active state (A) and an inactive state (I), at rates λ (on-rate) and μ (off-rate), respectively. In the active state, nascent mRNA is synthesised according to a Poisson process at rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf329"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, while in the inactive state transcription does not occur. Nascent mRNA is spliced into mature mRNA at rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf330"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>; this in turn is later translated into protein, with rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf331"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

We begin by showing that each of the reporter pairs (a), (b), and (c) satisfy the Noise Decomposition Principle. We then demonstrate computationally, that despite a lack of independence between these reporter pairs, the pathway-reporter method can still be used to decompose the total gene expression noise at the transcriptional level.

This condition will hold provided there is sufficiently small correlation between the reporter pairs. In the case of (prokaryotic) mRNA and protein, this lack of correlation has been been verified experimentally in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taniguchi et al., 2010</xref>). More generally, it is possible to provide an intuition about the conditions under which the lack of correlation might hold. The time series of copy numbers for each of nascent mRNA, mature mRNA and protein broadly follow each other, each with delay from its predecessor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Parameter values that reduce this delay will tend to increase correlation, and thereby increase the normalised intrinsic contribution to the covariance. The primary example of this effect is seen when <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf362"><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> approaches, or even exceeds <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf363"><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> (or for nascent-mature reporters, when <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf364"><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> approaches the maturation rate). A further contributor to high correlation between mRNA and protein, is when the system undergoes long timescale changes. In this situation, the copy numbers tend to drop to very low values for extended periods. The primary parameter influencing this type of behaviour is the active-rate λ, specifically, when λ tends to 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). An illustrative example of this can be seen by considering a Telegraph system in the limit of slow switching, which produces a copy number distribution that converges to a scaled Poisson-Bernoulli compound distribution: even without any extrinsic noise, the pathway reporter method will identify the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf365"><mml:msup><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> value of the corresponding scaled Bernoulli distribution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Heatmaps for the intrinsic contribution to the covariance.</title><p>These heatmaps estimate the level of overshoot in the pathway-reporter approach for the nascent-protein and mature-protein reporters; blue regions show an overshoot of less than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf366"><mml:mrow><mml:mi/><mml:mo>≃</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>Here, the intrinsic contribution is calculated using stochastic simulations of the model <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf367"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐌</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

In all cases, the parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf371"><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and the on-rate λ are varied between 0.01 and 0.5, and 0.5 and 5, respectively. The parameters of the model <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf372"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐌</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> are scaled so that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf373"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Each individual pixel is generated from a sample of size 3000, although there is still some instability in the convergence for the nascent-protein reporter, particularly as the overshoot estimation starts to increase, and particularly as μ is larger. To produce more accurate values, the case of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf376"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> was averaged over two full experiments while <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf377"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>20</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> was averaged over three. This was also done for the mature-protein reporter, however for these images there was almost no visible difference between the various runs of the experiment and their averages. Each of the three μ values takes approximately 7–10 hr of computation, depending on lead in time before sampling within a simulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> gives a heatmap for the overshoot in the pathway-reporter approach for nascent-mature pathway reporters.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69324-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Heatmap for the intrinsic contribution to the covariance for nascent-mature pathway reporters.</title><p>The nascent-mature reporter concerns only mRNA and so is independent of all protein-related parameters.

In <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taniguchi et al., 2010</xref> and yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belle et al., 2006</xref>, for example, mRNA are typically degraded within a few minutes, while most proteins have lifetimes at the level of 10 s of minutes to hours. For mammalian genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>, it has been reported that the median mRNA decay rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf388"><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is (approximately) five times larger than the median protein decay rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf389"><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, determined from 4200 genes. Assumption (b) requires that the gene is sufficiently active. In a recent paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larsson et al., 2019</xref>, the promoter-switching rates λ, μ, and the transcription rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf390"><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> of the Telegraph model are estimated from single-cell data for over 7000 genes in mouse and human fibroblasts. Of those genes with mean mRNA levels greater than 5, we found that over 90% have a value for λ of at least 0.5, and over 65% have a value for λ greater than 1. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao and Grima, 2020</xref>, a comprehensive list of genes (ranging from yeast cells through to human cells) with experimentally inferred parameter values are sourced from across the literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao and Grima, 2020</xref>). After scaling the parameter values of the 26 genes reported there, we find that around 88% have a value for λ of at least 0.5, and approximately 58% have a value for λ greater than 1. Thus, the heatmaps given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (top panel) suggest that nascent-protein reporters will provide a satisfactory estimate of the extrinsic noise level for a substantial fraction of genes.</p><p>The mature nRNA–protein reporters are less reliable, with the requirement of slow protein decay and higher on-rate being more pronounced than for the nascent mRNA–protein reporters; this is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (second panel).

Additionally, we explore maturation times sampled from Erlang distributions, to account for the fact that maturation can involve several shorter stochastic processes. We find that the extrinsic noise contribution obtained using the nascent and mature mRNA reporters match closely to the true (dual reporter) values across a range of maturation times; refer to the supplementary material for details.</p><p>(2): Next we consider an extension of a model of transcriptional bursting given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2020</xref>. The model we consider is the same as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2020</xref>, however, is extended to include protein synthesis and degradation.

We verify our pathway reporter method on three variations of the multiscale model. First, we assume all reactions are first-order Poisson processes (Case (2) in the main text). We then incorporate further details of the mRNA maturation process, where nascent mRNA occurs after a fixed amount of time (Case (3)). Finally, we incorporate features of the cell-cycle such as gene replication, dosage compensation, cell division, and cell-cycle length variability, as well as incorporating more realistic Erlang distributed maturation times (Case (4)).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69324-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>(3): We combine models (1) and (2) above, incorporating the fixed time maturation of (1) with the multiscale approach of (2).</p><p>(4): The cell cycle is a major contributing factor to extrinsic noise, introducing population heterogeneity (as cells are at different stages of the cell cycle), as well as internal dynamics to parameter values. Here we incorporate the salient features of the cell cycle into model (3), which is measurable as extrinsic noise by our methodology. Specifically, we model the effects of (i) gene replication, (ii) dosage compensation, (iii) binomial partitioning of products due to cell division, as well as (iv) cell-cycle length variability. Refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> for a schematic. This model is an extension of that solved in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao and Grima, 2020</xref>. Our model further incorporates the multi-scale dynamics of model (3) and the Erlang-distributed maturation times of model (1). As far as we are aware, this model has not been explored even by stochastic simulations before. A detailed description of how the above cell-cycle effects are captured in our model is given as follows. (i) Replication results in a doubling of the gene from one to two at the replication time, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>. This replication occurs over a period which is much shorter than the length of the cell cycle, and we follow the assumptions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao and Grima, 2020</xref> by considering it to occur instantaneously. (ii) Dosage compensation changes the rate at which the gene switches from inactive to active (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf465"><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) upon replication at time <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>. Again following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao and Grima, 2020</xref>, the activation rate after replication is 70% of the rate prior to replication. (iii) Binomial partitioning of nascent mRNA, mature mRNA and protein at cell division. We assume that nascent mRNA, mature mRNA, and protein segregate into the two daughter cells, with independent probability <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf466"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. We follow just one of the daughter cells, chosen at random with equal probability. (iv) Cell-cycle length variability. The time between successive cell divisions is stochastic, and is assumed to be sampled from an Erlang distribution. This has been shown to be consistent with experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao and Grima, 2020</xref>. The time to replication, and subsequently to cell division, are both chosen from an Erlang distribution with shape parameter 12, which produces a total cell cycle length distributed according to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf467"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>24</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; this matches the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf468"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>24</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> cell cycle length in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao and Grima, 2020</xref>, where replication is at the exact halfway point.

Details of the simulation methods and results can be found in the supplementary material (Appendix Convergence of Pathway and Dual Reporters). In summary, the results show that our pathway reporter approach is remarkably insensitive to the specific dynamics of mRNA and protein synthesis. In particular, the correlations between reporter pairs do not strongly depend on the details of the gene expression model used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the proliferation of experimental methods for single-cell profiling, the ability to extract transcriptional dynamics from measured distributions of mRNA copy numbers is limited. In particular, the multiple factors that contribute to mRNA heterogeneity can confound the measured distribution, which hinders analysis. Theoretical innovations that allow us to quantify and help in identifying the causes of these observable effects are therefore of great importance. In this work, we have demonstrated, through a series of mathematical results, that it is impossible to delineate the relative sources of heterogeneity from the measured transcript abundance distribution alone: multiple possible dynamics can give rise to the same distribution. Our approach involves establishing integral representations for distributions that are commonly encountered in single-cell data analysis, such as the negative binomial distribution and the stationary probability distribution of the Telegraph model. We show that a number of well-known representations can be obtained from our results. A particular feature of our non-identifiability results is that population heterogeneity inflates the apparent burstiness of the system. It is therefore necessary to collect further information, beyond measurements of the transcripts alone, in order to constrain the number of possible theoretical models of gene activity that could represent the system. In particular, additional work may be required to determine the true level of burstiness of the underlying system.</p><p>We have developed a theoretical framework for estimating levels of extrinsic noise, which can assist in resolving non-identifiability problems. The dual reporter method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swain et al., 2002</xref> already provides one such approach; but it is experimentally challenging to set up in many systems, and requires strictly identical and conditionally independent pairs of gene reporters. Our <italic>Noise Decomposition Principle</italic> directly generalises the theoretical underpinnings of the dual reporter method and related approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowsher and Swain, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jetka et al., 2018</xref>; here we have used it to identify a practical approach—the pathway-reporter method—for obtaining an effective and experimentally more easily implementable noise decomposition. Our approach allows us to use measurements of two different species from the transcriptional pathway of a single gene copy instead of having to set up a more cumbersome dual reporter assay. The accuracy of the pathway-reporter method is provably identical for constitutive gene expression, and in the case of nascent-mature mRNA reporters, the measurements are readily obtainable from current single-cell data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>. For bursty systems, the method in general provides only an approximation of the extrinsic noise. We are, however, able to demonstrate computationally, that one of the proposed pathway reporters provides a satisfactory estimate of the extrinsic noise for most genes. The other pathway reporters also provide viable estimates of the extrinsic noise in some cases. We further validate our theoretical framework on synthetic data for genes with various underlying gene expression dynamics. Our results show that the pathway reporter method is independent of the specific dynamics of mRNA and protein synthesis, and therefore should be applicable to a broad range of experimental scenarios.</p><p>Despite the generality of our theoretical contribution, our pathway-reporter approach has some caveats. In particular, the approach relies on the assumption that extrinsic noise sources act independently. Experimentally, however, these may be correlated. For example, it has been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilfinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole and Luthey-Schulten, 2017</xref> that the transcription and translation rates in <italic>E. coli</italic> anticorrelate. Additional work is required to determine degree to which the independence of noise sources is a reasonable assumption.</p><p>Recent developments in single-cell profiling now allow simultaneous measurements of transcripts and proteins in thousands of single cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stoeckius et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peterson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reimegård et al., 2019</xref>. As discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gorin and Pachter, 2020a</xref>, experimental improvements that would additionally allow measurements of nascent transcripts, coupled with theoretical developments such as those presented here, will allow for identification of noise sources on a genome-wide scale. Our work reveals that extrinsic noise distorts the multivariate copy number distribution of the different species in the gene expression pathway. We have exploited this to yield reliable estimates of noise strength, which we are confident will assist in setting better practices for model fitting and inference in the analysis of single-cell data. A more nuanced analysis of this multivariate distribution may offer even further insight into model and noise identifiability.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Rowan D Brackston for helpful discussions in the early stages of this research.

from a single gene copy, whereas in practice there may be multiple copies of the gene that contribute to the overall mRNA. If there are mechanisms in place to distinguish the mRNA or protein of one gene copy from another then the theory and analysis we have developed in main paper holds without change. In the case where it is not possible to distinguish mRNA and protein (respectively) from the multiple gene copies, then we now observe that the general theory continues to hold, provided there is independence between the gene copies; this assumption has been verified experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>. Here, we demonstrate this in the case of two gene copies, though the general case for more than two genes is essentially identical but is notationally cumbersome.

The high output gene then expects an overshoot of 0.003146 from the mature-protein reporters, while the low output gene expects an overshoot of approximately 0.03146. Figure Convergence of Pathway and Dual ReportersA shows comparison of convergence over the first 2000 samples, with the theoretical values accommodating the calculated overshoot. Figure Convergence of Pathway and Dual ReportersB shows the same over 20,000 samples; this time two low-output two high-output genes are considered, so that the variation around the expected long term value can be seen. It is evident that reasonable estimates are given after a relatively modest number of samples, but there is a very long delay to a highly accurate convergence for the pathway reporters in the low output gene.</p><fig id="app4fig3" position="float"><label>Appendix 4—figure 3.</label><caption><title>Convergence for reporter pairs for low gene activity.</title><p>In each case, the mean nascent mRNA level is 0.5, the mean mature mRNA level of 5, and the mean protein level is 500.

In the main text, we consider four different scenarios, beyond the standard four-stage model of gene transcription. Below we give details of these models, and their method of simulation.</p><p>(1): First, we consider a more detailed model of the mRNA maturation process, where the nascent mRNA maturate after a more finely controlled time interval. Specifically we adjust the constitutive model of gene transcription (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf587"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐌</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> of the main text with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf588"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf589"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) to include a fixed-duration of maturation. We also explore time-intervals sampled from Erlang distributions, to account for the fact that maturation can involve several shorter stochastic processes. The process is simulated using an adaptation of SSA, whereby the time of maturation of an individual nascent mRNA is calculated (by sample from the chosen distribution) at the point it is transcribed, and this timepoint is queued in a register of maturation times; this can be trivially adapted to other distributions; generalised-Erlang for example. At each iteration of the simulation, determination of the next event involves taking the smallest of the various exponentially sampled Markov processes (on, off, mRNA transcription, etc) and the next maturation event (the minimum of the maturation register). In the case that maturation is the next event, the corresponding maturation time is removed from the maturation register.</p><p>(2): We next consider a model of transcriptional bursting given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2020</xref>. In this ‘multiscale’ model, gene activation occurs in two steps, initially by the binding of transcription factors, and then as a secondary step by the binding and pause of the mRNA polymerase. For details of the model refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and the surrounding paragraphs in the main text. We here show that our Noise Decomposition Principle holds for all reporters taken from this gene pathway, and verify computationally that correlations between some of the reporter pairs are negligible; the process is simulated by the SSA. In the following, we assume all reactions are first-order, characterised by exponential waiting times between successive reactions.

Again, we employ the adaptation of the SSA described in (1).</p><p>(4): We incorporate the salient features of the cell-cycle into model (3), as well as introducing Erlang-distributed maturation times. Specifically, the model accounts for the effects of gene replication, dosage compensation, binomial partitioning of products due to cell division, as well as cell-cycle length variability. Within each phase of the cell cycle, the handling of maturation times for a given gene copy is exactly as in Case (1) above, but within the overall system described in Case (3). To capture the cell cycle, the SSA is now further modified to handle the two key sporadic changes: gene replication and cell division. After gene replication, we perform two independent modified SSA simulations, with common parameter values. The final copy numbers are obtained as a sum of those from each gene copy. At cell division, we follow just one daughter cell, selecting the inherited copy numbers by way of binomial partitioning from the mother cell values at the point of division (including the maturation register). The length of these cell-cycle phases is sampled from the chosen Erlang distribution, on commencement of the simulation of the phase.</p><p>The results of pathway reporters for each of the Cases (1 – 4) above are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app5table1">Appendix 5—tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="app5table8">8</xref> below. In all cases, the values given are the average of 20 simulations, each calculated from 500 copy number samples, and the errors are ± one standard deviation. For each model, we consider two parameter sets, each without extrinsic noise (Subcase A) and with extrinsic noise (Subcase B). For Case (1), the model parameters are chosen to produce an average nascent mRNA copy number of 10, and an average number of 2000 proteins; the average mature mRNA copy number varies according to the maturation time. We find that all of the pathway reporters accurately predict the true extrinsic noise levels (as given by dual reporters) across a range of maturation times; refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="app5table1">Appendix 5—table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app5table2">2</xref>. For Cases (2 – 4), the model parameters are chosen to produce an average nascent mRNA copy number of 5 and an average mature mRNA copy number of 100, and an average number of 2000 proteins. We verify computationally that the mature-protein and nascent-protein reporter pairs provide accurate predictions of extrinsic noise contributions across a range of noise levels. For these results refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="app5table3">Appendix 5—tables 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="app5table8">8</xref>. We mention that the results of Case (4)B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app5table8">Appendix 5—tables 8</xref>) may suggest a slight undershoot in the pathway reporter values in comparison to dual reporters. The difference is, however, within one standard deviation, and are calculated from a relatively small sample size due to the complexity of the simulation and corresponding run time. Investigating the presence and possible causes of this marginal effect for this model and other complicated models may be of interest in further work.</p><table-wrap id="app5table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 5—table 1.</label><caption><title>A comparison of the pathway-reporter method and dual-reporter method for constitutive gene expression with Erlang-distributed maturation times (Case (1)A).</title><p>Here, PR (NP) gives the results of the nascent and protein pathway reporters, PR (MP) gives the results of the mRNA and protein reporters, while DR (Mat) gives the results of the dual reporters calculated from the mature mRNA.

In particular the authors have clarified the connection of the present work to previous work and shown that their method's accuracy in identifying noise sources does not depend on the details of the gene expression model used. The novel method is based on multiple generic reporters from the same biochemical pathways. Since now it is possible to do simultaneous measurements of transcripts and proteins in single cells, this method offers a viable alternative to the standard dual reporter method, as a means to infer the magnitudes of intrinsic and extrinsic transcriptional noise.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Pathway dynamics can delineate the sources of transcriptional noise in gene expression&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. Although the work is of interest, we are not convinced that the findings presented have the potential significance that we require for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, some of the main critical comments overlapping between one or more reviews are: the need for experimental confirmation of the approach, major issues with the model assumptions and potential overlap with previously published works. Several recommendations have been made by the referees and we hope you find these useful. However it appears that the changes needed are considerable and the paper would need to be rewritten, hence the decision to reject the paper in its current form.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Ham et al. present a manuscript that attempts to answer two main questions:</p><p>(i) Is it possible to identify the relative sources of population heterogeneity from</p><p>the measured transcript abundance distribution alone?</p><p>(ii) Can one develop a method that can reliably estimate the strength of intrinsic and extrinsic noise and that does not require identical and independent pairs of</p><p>gene reporters?</p><p>In the context of this paper, extrinsic noise is assumed to be variations in parameters across cells; these variations are static and do not depend on time. The authors then proceed to answer question (i) by writing the observed distribution of transcripts as a compound distribution given by Equation 2 which takes as input the distribution of the telegraph model (that is analytically known in closed-form) – the underlying dynamics – and the distribution of parameters across a cellular population – the population heterogeneity. As summarized in Table I, they find that there are various different choices of these 2 distributions that can lead to the same compound (observed) distribution, thus highlighting the issue of non-identifiability if one only has available transcription abundance distributions. I note that the issue of non-identifiability is already known and described in the literature, however the authors identify some cases that were previously unknown. This framework is useful and the results are interesting; however the present formalism does not take into account some of the most important and ubiquitous sources of noise, namely those due to cell division (binomial partitioning of products upon division) and the cell-cycle (replication and cell-cycle length variability) because the authors use the conventional telegraph model that does not account for these phenomena – see Ref 38 where it is shown that these sources of noise can easily mimic that due to transcriptional bursting.</p><p>In the second part of the paper, the authors address question (ii). The dual reporter method of Swain et al. (Ref 4) is the standard method to decompose noise into its intrinsic and extrinsic contributions by using two independent reporter genes integrated into the same cell. The assumption that the reporters have identical dynamics is a strong one and presents difficulties in interpreting the results. Ham et al. present an alternative method which does not need dual reporters, rather makes use of 2 pieces of data (for e.g. mRNA and protein) belonging to the same biochemical pathway. The result is based on the decomposition of the covariance of any two variables according to the law of total covariance. This &quot;pathway-reporter method&quot; is shown to be accurate provided there is a small correlation between the reporter pairs – this is a strong assumption, in my view, and it is difficult to make a strong case for it generally. Also when carrying out verification of the method using synthetic data, the correlations between reporter pairs may strongly depend on the details of the model used. For e.g. nascent mRNA maturation to mRNA is in the present paper modeled via a one-step first-order process but more biologically faithful models (see for example PMID: 27667861 and 33976195) model this via a reaction step with a fixed time delay (modelling elongation + termination). The correlations calculated using the latter are likely stronger than the former because the former assumes exponentially distributed times. My main concern however is that the method presented is similar to another one described in the paper PMID: 22529351 which also uses the law of total covariance to understand how the variation in a species is determined by other species in the same pathway. There is also no comparison of the present method with another common one whereby the extrinsic noise is estimated as the part of the expression for the coefficient of variation that is not dependent on the mean molecule numbers; see for e.g. Ref 38 and Ref. 55 (Figure 2B).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I found this paper very interesting to read and I think there is ample scope for the development of new methods in this field.

This has previously been done primarily using the dual reporter method. Here, the authors suggest alternative methods that could in principle bypass the need for using two reporters.</p><p>I do not find the results very relevant from the biological perspective. The authors only verify their methods on stochastic simulations, where the model assumptions are specified by hand and thus fit perfectly into their theoretical framework. But how the proposed protocols would perform on experimental data remains unclear. The authors also seem unaware of recent work where essentially the same problem is addressed (Lin and Amir, PRL 2021) – inferring extrinsic vs. intrinsic noise from data – and a method not relying on dual reporters is tested on two existing experimental datasets. Related to the above, it was unclear to me precisely what sort of data would be needed in practice to implement their pathway-reporter method – and whether such data are currently available.</p><p>Another example of the potential discrepancy between mathematics and working with actual data is the authors' discussion of the identifiability problem. It seems to me that in reality distributions are always subject to noise (e.g. due to sampling errors) and it is unclear to me whether the sort of rigorous analysis they perform in the paper (that shows whether or not identifiability is possible or not in principle, assuming a perfectly measured distribution) is relevant at all to real data. (e.g.. even if two distributions are mathematically different, would it be possible to distinguish them in practice?)</p><p>It seems to me that the paper in its current format is a much better fit for specialized journals in biophysics/mathematics such as the biophysical journal or physical review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>It is now well-known that single-cell expression data exhibits significant cell-to-cell heterogeneity, which can stem from both &quot;extrinsic&quot; factors (e.g. enzyme concentrations, energy content, cellular environment etc.) or &quot;intrinsic&quot; noise (e.g. firing of reactions). Ham et al. rigorously show how extrinsic factors can cause non-identifiability of a model from single time-point gene-expression data, and also lead to incorrect conclusions about the underlying process if they are excluded from the model. Then they propose a novel pathway reporter (PR) approach for quantifying the contributions of the extrinsic and the intrinsic factors to the overall cell-to-cell heterogeneity. These results are illustrated with examples based on the telegraph gene-expression model which includes both nascent and mature mRNA. While the developed results are interesting and mathematically accurate, they come with many caveats, and they do not present a significant advance over existing works on this topic. My reasons for this assessment are mentioned below:</p><p>1. Non-identifiability results: The observations regarding non-identifiability of the dynamic parameters from the compound distribution model are not surprising and even though specific examples in Table 1 are nicely worked out, I do not see how they contribute substantially to the existing knowledge on the subject. Essentially non-identifiability will hold for nearly all choices of tilde{p} and f, and identifiability, if it exists, is an exception rather than the norm. This is consistent with what the authors observed in the simulation study outlined at the end of page 10.</p><p>2. The Pathway Reporter (PR) scheme: The PR scheme is presented as an alternative to the dual reporter (DR) scheme. However PR also suffers from issues similar to the DR scheme:</p><p>– DR assumes conditional independence of reporters. Likewise, PR also requires that such an independence (at least at the level of covariance) in order to argue that the intrinsic noise contribution is zero in the reporter covariance. The paper establishes this approximately for certain parameter regimes by using analytical expressions for the steady-state covariances. However generally such neat expressions are not readily available. It is unclear how one can check that this expected covariance is small. Of course if a fully identified model is available, then one can check it with simulations, but then one can simply compute the extrinsic noise directly.</p><p>– Another critical assumption of the PR scheme is that the conditional expectation for the reporters given the extrinsic factors Z, should nicely separate into a function of the common parameters and a function of independent parameters. Even though this works for the specific linear gene-expression model considered in the paper, it is unclear if this would work more generally. Moreover having such a splitting is (up to an additional scaling factor) is not much more general than having identical conditional expectations, as needed by the DR approach.</p><p>3. Applicability to experimental studies: As the authors mention in the paper, it is difficult to experimentally construct reporters satisfying the conditions of the DR scheme. However the paper does not discuss how for unknown experimental systems one can identify/construct reporters that satisfy the conditions of the PR scheme. In light of my previous comment, this seems to be as challenging as the DR approach, if one does not have a well-characterized mathematical model.</p><p>4. Lack of a meaningful connection: There is very little connection between the two parts of the paper (non-identifiability and PR scheme). A more substantial connection is expected, as in the abstract it is said that: &quot;Here we mathematically formalize this non-identifiability; but we also use this to identify how new experimental set-ups coupled to statistical noise decomposition can resolve this non-identifiability.&quot;</p><p>An example showing how noise decomposition helped turn a non-identifiable system into an identifiable one is lacking. Moreover, it is unclear how quantification of the extrinsic noise enables resolution of the challenging non-identifiability issue in the compound model.</p><p>5. All the results are presented for a specific gene-expression model and its derivatives. As the paper claims to provide a general approach for analyzing noise sources, more examples need to be provided, for a clearer evaluation of the PR method and comparison with the dual reporter method.</p><p>6. The paper only considers single time-point snapshot data measured at steady-state. What happens if multiple time-points, including the transience, is also taken into account. Certainly model identifiability would improve and the PR scheme should still work. The authors should consider such examples in the paper.</p><p>7. The description of the dual reporter method is misleading – at several places the paper says that the dual reporter method requires &quot;independent gene-reporters&quot;. However only conditional independence is required by the method. If there is full independence, then the covariance (extrinsic noise) would always be zero.</p><p>8. On page 21, first paragraph it is mentioned that &quot;For nascent-protein reporters, the normalized intrinsic contribution to the covariance is satisfactorily small (less than 0.05) for (a) high values of δp in unison with (b) low values of λ (less than 1, though lower values are acceptable if δp is small)&quot;. However based on the discussion prior/post this statement and also Figure 5, it seems that λ values should be high (not low!) for the normalized intrinsic contribution to the covariance to be small.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69324.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

To clarify, the primary similarity is that both papers involve an analysis of the covariance between reporters. In our submission, this analysis is between two reporters in the same pathway. In the article PMID: 2259351, this is between reporters in different genes. While it is true that PMID: 2259351 considers dual reporters (<italic>not</italic> pathway reporters) from multiple levels of a system, we emphasise that this is not the same as an analysis of covariance between single reporters from multiple levels of a system, as we do. There is certainly relevance of the PMID: 2259351 method in our broader discussion of noise decomposition, and we have now included this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) Nascent mRNA is more faithfully modeled using a delay step rather than a first-order step.

We would first like to address the validity of the model for nascent mRNA maturation used in the submitted manuscript. This model is standard in the literature and the article PMID: 27667861 states that the model we use is a “reasonable interpretation of the release kinetics&quot; of the maturation process. PMID: 27667861 also notes that the release kinetics are currently not well-understood but that the nascent mRNA distribution is insensitive to whether the maturation time is exponentially distributed or is modelled as a deterministic time delay, provided that the transcription rate is significantly greater than the switching (on/off rates) rates; this assumption is generally the case experimentally (refer to Section 14.3 and Figure S3 of the Supplementary Material). Our expectation then is that the nascent/mature-mRNA pathway reporter scheme will produce similar results irrespective of the details of the model used.</p><p>In order to substantiate this intuition, we have now tested the performance of our method for an alternative model of maturation, where the nascent mRNA maturate after a fixed amount of time. We also explore maturation times sampled from Erlang distributions to account for the fact that maturation can involve several shorter stochastic processes. As expected, we find that pathway reporters continue to correctly identify the extrinsic noise contribution across a range of maturation times; a discussion of these results have now been added to the revised manuscript (see the new section titled “Generality of the Pathway Reporter method&quot;). We mention, in addition, that the issue does not arise for the mature-mRNA/protein (or the nascent-mRNA/protein) pathway reporter method in our article, which for at least some reasonable parameter ranges, is sufficient to provide good estimates of extrinsic noise.</p><p>Furthermore, we have now additionally considered various other gene expression dynamics, including a nuanced model of transcriptional bursting (capturing polymerase recruitment and pause release), as well as models that account for cell-cycle effects such as gene replication, dosage compensation, binomial partitioning due to cell division, and cell-cycle length variability. In all cases, the pathway reporter method is able to accurately identify noise sources, showing that our approach does not depend on the precise dynamics of mRNA and protein synthesis. In particular, we find that the correlations between pathway reporter pairs do not depend on the details of the gene expression model used. A new section that encompasses these results, as well as addressing the generality of the pathway reporter method has been added to the revised manuscript; please refer to the new section titled “Generality of the Pathway Reporter method&quot; and the supplementary material. Together our results continue to suggest that our method will serve as a useful tool for gene expression analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iii) Cell-cycle and cell division effects are strong sources of noise and it would be ideal that these are at least discussed extensively; even better if they can be integrated into a modified telegraph model and then one can ask the same questions about what one can identify from a compound distribution based on Equation 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Cell-cycle and cell division/replication effects do indeed have a significant impact on gene expression variability. Cell-cycle effects arise predominantly from differences in the transcription rate across the cell population, and can be modelled already by Equation 2 under reasonable assumptions, without modification to the underlying telegraph model. A more explicit treatment of the mechanisms and changes along the cell cycle are challenging to study analytically (see Reference 38 for example), and theoretical models to account for such details are only starting to emerge. However, we agree that an interesting future direction would be to address how taking into account such details in the context of Equation 2 may also affect the inference of biochemical parameters. At this stage, we feel that a more detailed discussion of these effects should be included, and we have now amended the manuscript to reflect this; please refer to the final paragraph of the section titled “The Compound Distribution&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) Discussion of their method vs the other method of obtaining the extrinsic noise from plots of the coefficient of variation squared versus molecule numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>The method of obtaining extrinsic noise from such plots is mentioned already in the introduction of the submitted manuscript.

The authors only verify their methods on stochastic simulations, where the model assumptions are specified by hand and thus fit perfectly into their theoretical framework. But how the proposed protocols would perform on experimental data remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very valid observation in general concerning the translation from mathematical models to practice. The article considers already some existing databases of transcriptomic data, finding that around 90% of the genes lie within the parameter range for reasonable estimates via our method (and certainly identification of the presence of extrinsic noise), with 70% in the range for accurate measurement. We also give discussion of newly emerging experimental approaches required for the most widely applicable of our pathway combinations; these are in the final discussion of the article.</p><p>While for some models we have been able to mathematically prove that our method applies, we have now considered the robustness of our pathway reporter method on more nuanced models of gene transcription. More specifically, we consider models incorporating complex maturation processes (at the response of Referee #1), nuanced models of transcriptional bursting (capturing polymerase recruitment and pause release), as well as incorporating the effects of the cell cycle such as gene replication, dosage compensation, binomial partitioning of products due to cell division and cell-cycle length variability. In all cases, the pathway reporter method is able to accurately identify noise sources, showing that our approach does not depend on the precise dynamics of mRNA and protein synthesis. We hope this will help in assuring the referee that the method does not significantly depend on the precise details of the gene expression dynamics, nor on the availability of analytical formulas. A new section that encompasses these results has been added to the revised manuscript; please refer to the section titled “Generality of the Pathway Reporter Method&quot; in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also seem unaware of recent work where essentially the same problem is addressed (Lin and Amir, PRL 2021) – inferring extrinsic vs. intrinsic noise from data – and a method not relying on dual reporters is tested on two existing experimental datasets. Related to the above, it was unclear to me precisely what sort of data would be needed in practice to implement their pathway-reporter method – and whether such data are currently available.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this work. The article by Lin and Amir was yet to appear at the time of submission, which partly explains why the work slipped the attention of the authors. Lin and Amir’s work does offer an alternative approach to decomposing noise, which we now reference in the revised manuscript. The generality of their approach appears comparable to ours, and is demonstrated on what is now a similar range of model variations. The applicability also appears comparable: their approach relies upon lineage (single-cell trajectory) measurements of protein concentration over many generations, and such high throughput measurements have only recently become available. Some of our reporter pairs also require experimental data that is only recently emerging, while others are obtainable from nascent/mature-mRNA measurements, which have been routinely achieved for some time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another example of the potential discrepancy between mathematics and working with actual data is the authors' discussion of the identifiability problem. It seems to me that in reality distributions are always subject to noise (e.g. due to sampling errors) and it is unclear to me whether the sort of rigorous analysis they perform in the paper (that shows whether or not identifiability is possible or not in principle, assuming a perfectly measured distribution) is relevant at all to real data. (e.g.. even if two distributions are mathematically different, would it be possible to distinguish them in practice?)</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree that mathematically different distributions in general will not be distinguishable in practice: the calibration of models to data is one of the central pillars of the scientific method, and in gene expression in particular, has lead to significant improvements in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The non-identifiability results presented in the manuscript show that the concern expressed by the referee <italic>does</italic> indeed hold in the case of the analysis of transcript abundance alone. It is a particularly strong instance, as it shows that totally different processes can present identically in experimental data. This is proved using precise distributions, but the manuscript verifies that the effect is robust, and that “for practical purposes any similar distribution will produce a similar effect”; see Figure 2B for example. A direct consequence of our results is that extrinsic noise invariably leads to data appearing more bursty than the true underlying system; we prove this mathematically for the most popular model underlying current gene expression studies, and demonstrate this through simulations for other instances. Discussion of this important observation can be found in the introductory section as well as in the section just mentioned. To ensure that these points are made as clearly as possible, we have now amended some of the phrasing in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems to me that the paper in its current format is a much better fit for specialized journals in biophysics/mathematics such as the biophysical journal or physical review.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>It is now well-known that single-cell expression data exhibits significant cell-to-cell heterogeneity, which can stem from both &quot;extrinsic&quot; factors (e.g. enzyme concentrations, energy content, cellular environment etc.) or &quot;intrinsic&quot; noise (e.g. firing of reactions). Ham et al. rigorously show how extrinsic factors can cause non-identifiability of a model from single time-point gene-expression data, and also lead to incorrect conclusions about the underlying process if they are excluded from the model. Then they propose a novel pathway reporter (PR) approach for quantifying the contributions of the extrinsic and the intrinsic factors to the overall cell-to-cell heterogeneity. These results are illustrated with examples based on the telegraph gene-expression model which includes both nascent and mature mRNA. While the developed results are interesting and mathematically accurate, they come with many caveats, and they do not present a significant advance over existing works on this topic. My reasons for this assessment are mentioned below:</p><p>1. Non-identifiability results: The observations regarding non-identifiability of the dynamic parameters from the compound distribution model are not surprising and even though specific examples in Table 1 are nicely worked out, I do not see how they contribute substantially to the existing knowledge on the subject. Essentially non-identifiability will hold for nearly all choices of tilde{p} and f, and identifiability, if it exists, is an exception rather than the norm. This is consistent with what the authors observed in the simulation study outlined at the end of page 10.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our non-identifiability results may not be surprising to some audiences (non-identifiability issues have already been reported empirically), and we are open about this in the manuscript. This does not, however, undermine the value in proving that they are true and uncovering previously unknown, and more encompassing, non-identifiability cases. One of the results, for example, has recently formed the basis of the research paper doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.312868.</p><p>Our non-identifiability results are in many ways more of an entry point to our main noise decomposition methods. However, there is a very important consequence of this preliminary section: (as noted in the comments to Referee #2) the results demonstrate that extrinsic noise invariably leads to data appearing more bursty than the actual underlying system, and that this holds for all parameter regimes of the standard models. We feel this is a particularly important message to be highlighted, especially to an interdisciplinary community where the analysis of transcriptional processes increasingly relies on calibrating models to experimental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The Pathway Reporter (PR) scheme: The PR scheme is presented as an alternative to the dual reporter (DR) scheme. However PR also suffers from issues similar to the DR scheme:</p><p>– DR assumes conditional independence of reporters. Likewise, PR also requires that such an independence (at least at the level of covariance) in order to argue that the intrinsic noise contribution is zero in the reporter covariance. The paper establishes this approximately for certain parameter regimes by using analytical expressions for the steady-state covariances. However generally such neat expressions are not readily available. It is unclear how one can check that this expected covariance is small. Of course if a fully identified model is available, then one can check it with simulations, but then one can simply compute the extrinsic noise directly.</p></disp-quote><p>While we used the specific expressions to prove approximate independence (conditional on the cell environment), the approximate independence can also be verified across a range of models, where analytical expressions are not available. Our computational efforts already provided this corroboration to some extent, and we have now explored a broader range of models, with the same result. Please refer to our response of point (5) below for more details of these newly added models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Another critical assumption of the PR scheme is that the conditional expectation for the reporters given the extrinsic factors Z, should nicely separate into a function of the common parameters and a function of independent parameters. Even though this works for the specific linear gene-expression model considered in the paper, it is unclear if this would work more generally. Moreover having such a splitting is (up to an additional scaling factor) is not much more general than having identical conditional expectations, as needed by the DR approach.</p></disp-quote><p>The Noise Decomposition Principle presented in the paper is a convenient and powerful framework that appears to be general enough to capture a flexible range of reporter pairs to estimate extrinsic noise. The assumptions are not restrictive. We have focused on the linear gene expression model because it is broadly applicable, and we can use the available analytical formulas to provide a mathematical verification of the method. As in the previous response, however, the computational simulations also provide a demonstration of what our method is capable of measuring. We have now tested the theoretical framework in extensive simulations for a range of other, more nuanced, gene expression dynamics, to explore applicability in the absence of analytical solutions. For these results, refer to the new section in the manuscript titled &quot;Generality of the Pathway Reporter Method&quot;. The results show that our approach is remarkably insensitive to the specific dynamics of mRNA and protein synthesis, and therefore should be broadly applicable to a range of experimental scenarios.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Applicability to experimental studies: As the authors mention in the paper, it is difficult to experimentally construct reporters satisfying the conditions of the DR scheme. However the paper does not discuss how for unknown experimental systems one can identify/construct reporters that satisfy the conditions of the PR scheme. In light of my previous comment, this seems to be as challenging as the DR approach, if one does not have a well-characterized mathematical model.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed, the general approach is verified computationally across a range of models, including those where we cannot rely on precise formulas. Additionally, the models we consider are widely used for identifying modes of gene activity from experimental data. In such situations, our assumptions have been implicitly invoked already, and the consequences of our observations would appear to hold the same validity as other consequences frequently being drawn from experimental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Lack of a meaningful connection: There is very little connection between the two parts of the paper (non-identifiability and PR scheme). A more substantial connection is expected, as in the abstract it is said that: &quot;Here we mathematically formalize this non-identifiability; but we also use this to identify how new experimental set-ups coupled to statistical noise decomposition can resolve this non-identifiability.&quot;</p><p>An example showing how noise decomposition helped turn a non-identifiable system into an identifiable one is lacking. Moreover, it is unclear how quantification of the extrinsic noise enables resolution of the challenging non-identifiability issue in the compound model.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially show that mRNA measurements alone cannot be used to identify even the presence of extrinsic noise; we then proceed to show that with pathway reporters it can; and moreover, we can measure its strength. We feel that this is a very clear connection. The pathway reporter scheme resolves non-identifiability to the extent that the presence of extrinsic noise can be identified and measured, whereas from copy number data alone it cannot, as we demonstrate in the first part of the manuscript. There is no claim in the article that we can identify the precise noise distribution in a compound model, and we are not sure this can be done in general, though further consideration of that claim will be an interesting topic for future work. It is, we believe, important to be able to demonstrate convincingly and unequivocally the presence of extrinsic noise from experimental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. All the results are presented for a specific gene-expression model and its derivatives. As the paper claims to provide a general approach for analyzing noise sources, more examples need to be provided, for a clearer evaluation of the PR method and comparison with the dual reporter method.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, as we believe the addition of a more robust evaluation of the pathway reporter method has substantially improved the paper. We have now considered various other gene expression dynamics, including detailed models of the maturation process (at the suggestion of Referee #1), a more nuanced model of transcriptional bursting (capturing polymerase recruitment and pause release), as well as accounting for the cell-cycle effects such as gene replication, dosage compensation, binomial partitioning of products due to cell division, and cell-cycle length variability. In all cases, the pathway reporter method is able to accurately identify noise sources, showing that our approach does not depend on the precise dynamics of mRNA and protein synthesis. In particular, we find that the correlations between pathway reporter pairs do not depend on the details of the gene expression model used. A new section that encompasses these results, as well as addressing the generality of the pathway reporter method has been added to the revised manuscript. Together our results continue to suggest that our method will serve as a useful tool for gene expression analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The paper only considers single time-point snapshot data measured at steady-state. What happens if multiple time-points, including the transience, is also taken into account. Certainly model identifiability would improve and the PR scheme should still work. The authors should consider such examples in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The extension to multiple time points is certainly of interest to us. In previous and related work, we have considered time course data for cells and the identifiability of model characteristics (PMID:21551095) in contrast to snapshot data. So this is definitely an avenue for further exploration that we intend to follow. But in the submitted manuscript, the focus is on the development of an alternative noise decomposition for snapshot data as such data sets are becoming readily available. The analysis of the transient behaviour of dissipative dynamical systems in the presence of noise requires a much more detailed analysis than we attempt here and is clearly outside the scope of what can be dealt with here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The description of the dual reporter method is misleading – at several places the paper says that the dual reporter method requires &quot;independent gene-reporters&quot;. However only conditional independence is required by the method. If there is full independence, then the covariance (extrinsic noise) would always be zero.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now amended the manuscript to make this implicit understanding explicit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. On page 21, first paragraph it is mentioned that &quot;For nascent-protein reporters, the normalized intrinsic contribution to the covariance is satisfactorily small (less than 0.05) for (a) high values of δp in unison with (b) low values of λ (less than 1, though lower values are acceptable if δp is small)&quot;. However based on the discussion prior/post this statement and also Figure 5, it seems that λ values should be high (not low!) for the normalized intrinsic contribution to the covariance to be small.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this. It appears that this error was introduced at some stage in preparation (it is expressed exactly as the referee suggests in the original BioaRχiv version of the manuscript, for example). We regret this potential cause for confusion, and have carefully checked and corrected all typographical mistakes that we can find in the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
