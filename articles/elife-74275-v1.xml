proteases is challenging. We examined inhibition of intramembrane metalloprotease SpoIVFB by proteins BofA and SpoIVFA. We found that SpoIVFB inhibition requires BofA residues in and near a predicted transmembrane segment (TMS). This segment of BofA occupies the SpoIVFB active site cleft based on cross-linking experiments. SpoIVFB inhibition also requires SpoIVFA. The inhibitory proteins block access of the substrate N-terminal region to the membrane-embedded SpoIVFB active site, based on additional cross-linking experiments; however, the inhibitory proteins did not prevent interaction between the substrate C-terminal region and the SpoIVFB soluble domain. We built a structural model of SpoIVFB in complex with BofA and parts of SpoIVFA and substrate, using partial homology and constraints from cross-linking and co-evolutionary analyses. The model predicts that conserved BofA residues interact to stabilize a TMS and a membrane-embedded C-terminal region. The model also predicts that SpoIVFA bridges the BofA C-terminal region and SpoIVFB, forming a membrane-embedded inhibition complex. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of IP inhibition with clear implications for relief from inhibition in vivo and design of inhibitors as potential therapeutics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteases are a type of protein that work by cutting up other proteins. The part of the protease that does the cutting is called the active site. Intramembrane proteases are a specific group of proteases that cut up the proteins within cell membranes. There is a lot of interest in learning how to control intramembrane proteases because they are important in regulating the signaling processes that cells use to communicate. SpoIVFB is an intramembrane protease from the bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> that is studied often as a model for these types of proteases.</p><p><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> uses SpoIVFB to produce spores, dormant reproductive cells that can survive extreme, harsh conditions for long periods with minimal energy. SpoIVFB is part of the system that allows spores to communicate with their ‘parent cells’, the cells they develop in. The activity of this protein is blocked by two other proteins called SpoIVFA and BofA. When these proteins are destroyed, SpoIVFB becomes active, but it is unclear exactly how SpoIVFA and BofA inhibit SpoIVFB. Understanding this relationship could help to reveal ways to regulate other intramembrane proteases.</p><p>To address this question, Olenic et al. used genetic, biochemical and computer modelling techniques to study how SpoIVFB activity is regulated in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. The results show that a region of BofA blocks the area of SpoIVFB that cuts a protein called Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>, which stops SpoIVFB from releasing active σ<sup>K</sup> into the ‘parent cell’. By making genetic variants of BofA, Olenic et al. identified three parts of BofA that are needed to fully inhibit SpoIVFB. A computer model predicts that these three parts give BofA the right shape to inhibit SpoIVFB, and that SpoIVFA helps by forming a bridge between BofA and SpoIVFB.</p><p>This investigation reveals how the intramembrane protease SpoIVFB is regulated by SpoIVFA and BofA. This information could be useful in developing inhibitors for other intramembrane proteases. The next stage will be to make and test artificial inhibitors based on the structures studied here. If successful, these could have applications in areas such as medicine, agriculture, industry and environmental protection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regulated intramembrane proteolysis</kwd><kwd>intramembrane protease</kwd><kwd>membrane proteins</kwd><kwd>protease inhibition</kwd><kwd>metalloprotease</kwd><kwd>sporulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM43585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olenic</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Kroos</surname><given-names>Lee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM12648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heo</surname><given-names>Lim</given-names></name><name><surname>Feig</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel mechanism of intramembrane protease regulation involves a protein blocking the active site of the enzyme.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intramembrane proteases (IPs) are membrane proteins containing a membrane-embedded active site.

Bacterial metallo IPs enhance pathogenicity, control stress responses and polar morphogenesis, produce mating signals, and clear signal peptides from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Urban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kroos and Akiyama, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schneider and Glickman, 2013</xref>). SpoIVFB is a bacterial metallo IP that cleaves inactive Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> to σ<sup>K</sup>, which directs RNA polymerase to transcribe genes necessary for endospore formation of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kroos and Akiyama, 2013</xref>).

Understanding the regulation of SpoIVFB could lead to new strategies to manipulate endosporulation and other processes involving IPs in bacteria and eukaryotes.</p><p>During endospore formation, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> forms a polar septum that divides the mother cell (MC) and forespore (FS) compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tan and Ramamurthi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The MC engulfs the FS, surrounding it with a second membrane and pinching it off within the MC. Regulation of SpoIVFB involves inhibition by BofA and SpoIVFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cutting et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cutting et al., 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ricca et al., 1992</xref>). The three proteins form a complex in the outer FS membrane during engulfment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Resnekov et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rudner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rudner and Losick, 2002</xref>). BofA appears to be the direct inhibitor of SpoIVFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhou and Kroos, 2004</xref>), while SpoIVFA appears to localize and stabilize the inhibition complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rudner and Losick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kroos et al., 2002</xref>). Signaling from the FS relieves inhibition of SpoIVFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The FS exports two proteases, SpoIVB and CtpB, into the space between the two membranes surrounding the FS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cutting et al., 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pan et al., 2003</xref>). SpoIVB cleaves the C-terminal end of SpoIVFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dong and Cutting, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campo and Rudner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campo and Rudner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mastny et al., 2013</xref>) and CtpB can cleave the C-terminal ends of both SpoIVFA and BofA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campo and Rudner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campo and Rudner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhou and Kroos, 2005</xref>). Once inhibition is relieved, SpoIVFB cleaves the N-terminal 21-residue pro-sequence from Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>, releasing σ<sup>K</sup> into the MC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rudner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yu and Kroos, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). σ<sup>K</sup> directs RNA polymerase to transcribe genes whose products form the spore coat and lyse the MC, releasing a mature spore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kroos et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eichenberger et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of SpoIVFB by direct interaction with the inhibitory proteins BofA and SpoIVFA differs from known regulation of other IPs. In eukaryotic cells, some IP substrates initially localize to a different organelle than their cognate IP, and regulation involves membrane trafficking to deliver the substrate to the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kühnle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morohashi and Tomita, 2013</xref>). In bacteria and eukaryotes, many IP substrates require an initial extramembrane cleavage by another protease prior to the intramembrane cleavage, and the initial cleavage is typically the regulated step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Urban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kroos and Akiyama, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schneider and Glickman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lichtenthaler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beard et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, SpoIVFB cleaves Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> only once. BofA and SpoIVFA inhibit SpoIVFB by an unknown mechanism. Understanding the mechanism of inhibition could have broad implications since the catalytic core of metallo IPs includes three conserved TMSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kinch et al., 2006</xref>) and general principles may emerge that inform potential inhibition strategies for other IP types.</p><p>Our results reveal a novel mechanism of IP inhibition in which the second predicted TMS (TMS2) of BofA occupies the SpoIVFB active site cleft. Together BofA and SpoIVFA block access of the N-terminal pro-sequence region (Proregion) of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> to the membrane-embedded SpoIVFB active site, yet the C-terminal soluble regions of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> and SpoIVFB can interact. We used these results in combination with prior cross-linking studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Halder et al., 2017</xref>), partial homology, and evolutionary co-variation of amino acid residues, to constrain a structural model of SpoIVFB in complex with BofA and parts of SpoIVFA and Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>. The model predicts that conserved BofA residues interact to stabilize TMS2 and its C-terminal region, and that SpoIVFA bridges the BofA C-terminal region and SpoIVFB to form an inhibition complex. The predicted inhibition complex has implications for activation of SpoIVFB and its orthologs in other endospore formers, as well as for translational efforts to design therapeutic IP inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SpoIVFB inhibition requires both BofA and SpoIVFA in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic></title><p>To study RIP of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>, we engineered <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to synthesize variants of SpoIVFB and Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>, and the inhibitory proteins BofA and SpoIVFA, in various combinations.

The levels of the variants were similar to GFPΔ27BofA at 4 hr, but reduced at 5 hr, especially for the N61A variant (lane 12). In comparison with the strain that produced GFPΔ27BofA, the SpoIVFA level was normal in the strain that produced the N48A variant, but the SpoIVFB level was very low, and the levels of both SpoIVFA and SpoIVFB were low in the strains producing the N61A and T64 variants. The reduced levels of SpoIVFB and SpoIVFA may reflect protein instability due to altered complex formation with the GFPΔ27BofA variants, as inferred from reduced SpoIVFB and SpoIVFA levels in the absence of BofA during <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rudner and Losick, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Production of the T64A variant in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lanes 13 and 14) showed a pattern similar to wild type (lanes 1 and 2); Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> cleavage increased between 4 and 5 hr, and the levels of SpoIVFA and SpoIVFB decreased. The levels of all three proteins were slightly lower in the strain producing the T64A variant than in wild type. The level of the T64A variant was similar to the N48A and N61A variants at 4 hr, yet the T64A variant allowed less Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> cleavage (lanes 9, 11, and 13), suggesting that the T64A variant inhibits SpoIVFB, although not as well as GFPΔ27BofA (lane 7). We conclude that the three conserved residues of BofA are important for SpoIVFB inhibition during sporulation.</p><p>Since GFPΔ27BofA co-localizes with SpoIVFA and SpoIVFB to the outer FS membrane during sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Resnekov et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rudner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rudner and Losick, 2002</xref>), we examined the ability of the GFPΔ27BofA variants to localize to the FS. As a control, GFPΔ27BofA produced in the <italic>spoIVB165 bofA::erm</italic> double mutant localized discretely to the FS at 3 hr PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The N48A and T64A variants localized partially to the FS, but the MC cytoplasm also exhibited GFP fluorescence, suggesting partial mislocalization. The N61A variant failed to localize to the FS, instead showing GFP fluorescence throughout the MC cytoplasm. The fusion proteins were intact, demonstrating that the cytoplasmic GFP fluorescence was not attributable to breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Inability of the N61A variant to localize to the FS may explain the loss of SpoIVFB inhibition and the abundant cleavage of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> at 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lane 11). Importantly, the similar ability of the N48A and T64A variants to localize to the FS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) does not account for their differential effects on the level of SpoIVFB and its ability to cleave Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The strain producing GFPΔ27BofA N48A exhibited less SpoIVFB yet more Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> cleavage at 4 hr (lane 9) than the strain producing GFPΔ27BofA T64A (lane 13), so the N48A substitution more severely impairs the ability of GFPΔ27BofA to inhibit SpoIVFB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>BofA TMS2 occupies the SpoIVFB active site cleft</title><p>We hypothesized that TMS2 of BofA occupies the SpoIVFB active site cleft in the inhibition complex, because the GFPΔ27BofA N48 side chain is important for inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) and located near the middle of predicted TMS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To begin testing our hypothesis, we devised a strategy based on a model of the SpoIVFB membrane domain derived from the crystal structure of an archaeal homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feng et al., 2007</xref>) and supported by cross-linking studies of catalytically inactive SpoIVFB E44Q in complex with Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>(1–127), whose Proregion appears to occupy the SpoIVFB active site cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Halder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).

We reasoned that BofA TMS2 occupancy of the SpoIVFB active site cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) would exclude the substrate Proregion and may be detectable using a disulfide cross-linking approach.

Treatment with the reducing agent DTT greatly diminished the abundance of the apparent complex, consistent with cross-link reversal (lane 3). We also observed a species of the expected size for a cross-linked dimer of single-Cys E44C cytTM-SpoIVFB. Formation of the apparent dimer varied, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, anti-MBP antibodies detected the presumptive cross-linked complex of MBPΔ27BofA C46 with single-Cys E44C cytTM-SpoIVFB, albeit weakly, and the negative control with E44Q rather than E44C failed to form the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, lanes 2 and 5).

The initial model predicted proximity between residues at or near the ends of BofA TMS2 and residues of SpoIVFB, thus identifying residues of interest for cross-linking experiments. First, we examined the effects of Cys substitutions for the residues of interest using cleavage assays. pET Duet plasmids were used to produce Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>(1–127) in combination with cytTM-SpoIVFB from pYZ2 as a control (lane 1) or with the indicated Cys-substituted cytTM-SpoIVFB from pSO141 or pSO256-pSO259 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<italic>Left</italic>). pET Quartet plasmids were used to produce Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>(1–127), cytTM-SpoIVFB, and SpoIVFA in combination with GFPΔ27BofA from pSO40 as a control (lane 7) or with the indicated Cys-substituted GFPΔ27BofA from pSO142, pSO143, or pSO260-pSO263 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>Right</italic>).

GFPΔ27BofA with Cys substitutions for residues of interest inhibited Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>(1–127) cleavage by cytTM-SpoIVFB, although the G40C and H57C substitutions caused partial loss of inhibition, and the G40C substitution resulted in less accumulation of all four proteins (lanes 8–13).

Similarly, comparison of complex formation by G40C and A41C MBPΔ27BofA variants with the V86C cytTM-SpoIVFB variant (lanes 7 and 16) suggested that a preferred orientation of BofA TMS2 places G40C farther than A41C from V86C near the C-terminal end of SpoIVFB TMS3.

Since full-length BofA hindered cross-linking more than MBPΔ27BofA (lacking TMS1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>), both TMSs of BofA appear to interfere with the normal interaction between the SpoIVFB membrane-reentrant loop and the substrate Proregion. BofA may cause the SpoIVFB membrane-reentrant loop to be exposed since we observed four novel species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3G</xref>), perhaps due to cross-linking of the V70C cytTM-SpoIVFB variant to <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins.</p><p>Since full-length BofA also inhibited cleavage of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>(1–127) in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, longer exposure) and Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lanes 4 and 8) slightly more than GFPΔ27BofA (lacking TMS1), we compared time-dependent cross-linking of C46 of BofA and MBPΔ27BofA to single-Cys E44C and P135C cytTM-SpoIVFB variants. The results suggest that full-length BofA forms slightly more complex over time, whereas complex abundance did not increase over time with MBPΔ27BofA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Hence, BofA TMS1 may slightly enhance TMS2 occupancy in the SpoIVFB active site cleft.</p><p>To examine the extent to which inhibitory proteins hinder the interaction of the substrate with SpoIVFB, we used the model of catalytically inactive SpoIVFB E44Q in complex with Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>( 1–127) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Halder et al., 2017</xref>) to guide testing for disulfide cross-link formation and found that A214C in the cytTM-SpoIVFB linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) can be cross-linked to A41C in Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>(1–127) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>). We showed that the Cys substitutions do not impair cytTM-SpoIVFB activity or Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>(1–127) susceptibility to cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Finally, we measured time-dependent cross-linking in the presence or absence of Cys-less inhibitory proteins.

Our model predicts that BofA contains two TMSs and a membrane-embedded C-terminal region (labeled C near the C-terminus in the enlarged view of the SpoIVFB active site cleft) that forms two short α-helices connected by a turn. The enlarged and top views show that BofA interacts extensively with SpoIVFB and occupies its active site cleft, which would sterically hinder access of the Proregion of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>. In the model, the conserved residue N48 in BofA TMS2 is near T64 and N61. Both T64 and N61 are in a loop that precedes the first short α-helix of the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). All three residues are likely able to interact, but the constraints from experiments and co-evolutionary couplings are not sufficient for predicting the exact side-chain orientations with high certainty. So, even though the N61 side chain is shown pointing away from the N48 and T64 side chains in the model, slight structural rearrangements within the modeling constraints could allow the N61 side chain to interact more directly with the N48 and/or T64 side chain(s). Alternatively, the three conserved residues may contact other residues within BofA, based on co-evolutionary couplings, to stabilize the BofA structure or they may be essential for interactions with nearby elements of SpoIVFA and SpoIVFB.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> shows the addition of the modeled portion of SpoIVFA (purple).

In addition to steric hindrance, inhibition of soluble metalloproteases often involves a residue of the inhibitory protein, prodomain, or prosegment with a side chain that coordinates the catalytic metal ion in place of a water molecule necessary for substrate peptide bond hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arolas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Van Wart and Birkedal-Hansen, 1990</xref>). <italic>B. subtilis</italic> BofA C46 is a potential zinc ligand near the SpoIVFB active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>), but most BofA orthologs lack a Cys near the middle of predicted TMS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This proposal can explain several experimental observations. First, Ala substitutions for N48, N61, and T64 in GFPΔ27BofA accumulated normally in <italic>E. coli</italic> in the absence of the other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting the variants fold almost normally. However, all three variants allowed Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>(1–127) cleavage and reduced the SpoIVFA and cytTM-SpoIVFB levels upon coproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), so subtle changes in the proposed BofA structural domain may alter formation of the inhibition complex and lead to protein instability. Similarly, all three GFPΔ27BofA variants accumulated normally at 4 hr during <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation, but allowed premature cleavage of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>, despite reducing the level of SpoIVFB and in some cases SpoIVFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with altered assembly of the inhibition complex. In agreement, the Ala substitutions caused partial or complete mislocalization of GFPΔ27BofA during sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which normally relies on SpoIVFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rudner and Losick, 2002</xref>).</p><p>A second observation that our proposed model for the SpoIVFB inhibition complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) can explain is the requirement for the C-terminal end of BofA.

BofA TMS1 appears to play a minor role by sterically hindering some interactions between the Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> N-terminal region and SpoIVFB, based on the comparison between full-length BofA and MBPΔ27BofA in cross-linking time courses. The interactions hindered more by full-length BofA included cross-links between the Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> Proregion and the SpoIVFB membrane-reentrant loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>), which may bind to the Proregion and present it to the SpoIVFB active site for cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Halder et al., 2017</xref>) based on a study of the homologous membrane-reentrant loop of <italic>E. coli</italic> RseP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akiyama et al., 2015</xref>).

Based on phylogenomic analysis, the precise control of σ<sup>K</sup>-dependent gene expression observed in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> emerged early in evolution and persisted in bacilli which propagate primarily in aerobic environments, but has been modified or lost in many clostridia which are found mainly in anaerobic habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ramos-Silva et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Design of IP Inhibitors</title><p>Efforts toward the development of therapeutic peptidyl inhibitors of serine IPs (rhomboids) are well-advanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tichá et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tichá et al., 2018</xref>). Translational work on aspartyl IPs has focused on γ-secretase owing to its processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) associated with Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wolfe, 2019</xref>). Wide-spectrum inhibitors of γ-secretase exhibit toxicity in clinical trials, mainly due to inhibition of signaling via Notch receptors, which are also substrates of γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Strooper and Chávez Gutiérrez, 2015</xref>). The structures of γ-secretase complexes with APP and Notch reveal differences in binding that may allow substrate-specific inhibitors to be developed as therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Stabilization of complexes in which γ-secretase progressively cleaves APP is another promising approach toward the development of drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Szaruga et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In comparison with rhomboids and γ-secretase, translational work on metallo IP inhibitors is in its infancy. Batimastat, a peptidic hydroxamate known to inhibit eukaryotic matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), selectively inhibited RseP in <italic>E. coli</italic> in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Konovalova et al., 2018</xref>). A lack of selectivity has impeded efforts toward using peptidic hydroxamates as MMP inhibitors for the treatment of cancer, arthritis, and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jacobsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fields, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gomis-Rüth, 2017</xref>). The hydroxamate strongly coordinates the catalytic metal ion and the peptidic portions have lacked sufficient specificity to prevent off-target effects. Even so, side effects may not preclude using peptidic hydroxamates to treat bacterial infections topically or with brief systemic administration. Screening other small-molecule MMP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jacobsen et al., 2010</xref>) for activity against bacteria and fungi with metallo IPs known to be involved in pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Urban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kroos and Akiyama, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schneider and Glickman, 2013</xref>) may prove productive.</p><p>Our findings reveal concepts that may inform efforts to design selective inhibitors of IPs. BofA TMS2 appears to block the SpoIVFB active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), similar to the prosegment of many latent proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arolas et al., 2018</xref>). Like BofA, some prosegments can act in trans, an observation that led to prodomains being used as selective inhibitors of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase (ADAM) family enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moss et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). Selectivity relies on the extensive interaction surface between the prodomain and the enzyme, including features specific to the pair, which can boost efficacy and diminish off-target effects in therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gomis-Rüth, 2017</xref>). A peptide corresponding to BofA N48 to T64 may inhibit SpoIVFB, but our model also predicts extensive interactions between the BofA C-terminal region (residues 65–87) and SpoIVFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A longer BofA peptide, perhaps flexibly linked to SpoIVFA residues 96–109, which are also predicted to interact with SpoIVFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), may exhibit improved inhibition and selectivity. Testing peptide inhibitory activity in vitro is possible since purified cytTM-SpoIVFB cleaves Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>(1-127) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Structure determination of SpoIVFB in complex with an inhibitory peptide, GFPΔ27BofA, or full-length BofA is an important goal to facilitate the design of metallo IP inhibitors. In particular, it may inform efforts to design inhibitors of SpoIVFB orthologs in pathogenic bacilli and clostridia, which persist by forming endospores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Al-Hinai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Checinska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Browne et al., 2016</xref>). Such efforts could lead to new strategies to control endosporulation.</p><p>Our findings also suggest that BofA TMS1 interferes with interactions between the Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> N-terminal region and SpoIVFB. Therefore, a cyclic peptide inhibitor may prove to be more effective than a linear one. The desirable characteristics of cyclic peptides as therapeutics, and new methods of producing and screening cyclic peptide libraries, make this an attractive possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zorzi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sohrabi et al., 2020</xref>). Although we favor a simple steric hindrance mechanism of inhibition not involving a BofA residue acting as a zinc ligand, it is possible that inclusion of such a residue in a BofA TMS2 peptide mimic would improve SpoIVFB inhibition. A similar strategy could be used to design inhibitors of other metallo IPs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

In experiments with single-Cys V70C cytTM-SpoIVFB E44Q, single-Cys Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>(1–127) variants, and Cys-less variants of BofA and SpoIVFA, samples were boiled 3 min prior to immunoblot analysis, which helped to resolve species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3E and G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation (FLAG<sub>2</sub> pull-down assays)</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) was transformed with a plasmid, grown in LB (1 L), and induced with IPTG as described above.

More specifically, a SpoIVFB monomer was first assembled from the membrane and CBS domains. Two monomers were combined into a dimer and the dimer was assembled into a plausible tetramer. Part of one molecule of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> (residues 1–114) was subsequently added, which resulted in ‘fb.sigk.’ The ‘fb.sigk.bofa.fa’ model was developed by starting from ‘fb.sigk,’ truncating the Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> N-terminus (residues 1–37), and subsequently adding first BofA and finally SpoIVFA (residues 65–111).</p><p>The membrane domain of a SpoIVFB monomer was modeled initially based on the structure for the site-2 protease from <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> (PDB code: 3B4R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feng et al., 2007</xref>). The structure was combined with a CBS domain modeled based on the CBS-domain protein TM0935 from <italic>Thermotoga martima</italic> (PDB code: 1O50) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miller et al., 2004</xref>). The CBS domain provides a dimerization interface for the C-terminal part of SpoIVFB. The full-length dimer, including the membrane domain, was completed by considering predicted contacts from co-evolutionary coupling analysis. A tetramer was then built guided by the arrangement of transmembrane helices and orientation of CBS domains in the recently published full-length structure of the chloride proton exchanger CLC-7 (PDB code: 7JM6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schrecker et al., 2020</xref>) and again by considering contacts from co-evolutionary couplings. We note that the resulting dimer and tetramer models are different from our previous model for the SpoIVFB as we could take advantage of the new structural template and additional information from the co-evolutionary couplings. The initial model for the well-folded C-terminal part of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> (residues 40–114) was built based on the structure of RNA polymerase sigma subunit domain 2 (PDB code: 3UGO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feklistov and Darst, 2011</xref>). Suitable templates are not available for BofA and the part of SpoIVFA modeled here. For these components, initial models were obtained based on the predicted intra-chain contacts from the co-evolutionary couplings.</p><p>The modeling under restraints was initially carried out using Cα-based coarse-grained models that were allowed to relax under restraints via cycles of energy minimization and short molecular dynamics simulations at elevated temperature as described in more detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Halder et al., 2017</xref>). Restraints from cross-linking were applied as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Halder et al., 2017</xref>). Different from our previous work, we also applied extensive intra- and inter-chain restraints based on predicted contacts from co-evolutionary coupling analysis. In addition, we applied positional restraints to keep the structures of the SpoIVFB membrane and CBS domains and the folded C-terminus of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> close to their initial models while allowing subunits to move relative to each other as guided by the restraints. For BofA and SpoIVFA, individual helices were restrained internally but allowed to move relative to each other to find the optimal arrangement in complex with SpoIVFB, again guided by the predicted contact restraints. Contact restraints with respect to SpoIVFB were implemented as minimum distance restraints to the closest residue in any of the four subunits since contact predictions cannot distinguish between chemically equivalent oligomer units. All available experimental cross-links were applied but the list of predicted contacts was edited to exclude certain contacts incompatible with cross-linking data and previous biochemical data on the overall topology of the SpoIVFB-BofA-SpoIVFA complex when embedded into the membrane. Excluded contacts may reflect uncertainties in the prediction method as inter-chain contacts are more difficult to predict reliably. They may also indicate alternate biologically relevant interactions between SpoIVFB, BofA, and SpoIVFA that were not probed in the experiments via cross-linking. Detailed lists of all applied restraints are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3 supp4 supp5">Supplementary files 2-5</xref>.</p><p>Inter-residue contacts were predicted by trRosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). A MSA, the input of trRosetta, for a protein was generated using HHblits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Remmert et al., 2011</xref>) to search against the UniClust30 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mirdita et al., 2017</xref>). It was further curated to only include sequences that are related to spore formation and are from organisms that have both SpoIVFB and SpoIVFA sequences. To predict inter-protein contacts using trRosetta, a hybrid MSA was generated by pasting two interacting proteins’ sequences that are from the same strain. Twenty glycines were inserted between the target sequences to prevent irrelevant predictions near the pasted regions due to the proximity in the hybrid sequence. Similarly, gaps were inserted for the homologous sequences to preserve alignment with the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> proteins. The contact predictions for the inserted residues were ignored for further modeling.</p><p>Finally, the Cα models for the complexes were converted to an all-atom model using PyRosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaudhury et al., 2010</xref>) with the curated predicted intra- and inter-protein contacts and the cross-linking constraints. First, the model was locally minimized in the Rosetta centroid representation. The cross-linking constraints and inter-protein contacts were used for the Cα model building. Predicted intra-protein contacts were also used only if their contact probabilities were higher than 0.15 and if they were not violated severely in the Cα model; a predicted contact was considered as a severe violation if its score was greater than 10 Rosetta energy units (REUs). The relative weights for each scoring term were 25, 0.25, and 0.1 for the cross-linking constraints, inter-protein contacts, and intra-protein contacts, respectively. To prevent large deviation from the Cα model, harmonic restraints were applied on every Cα atom with a force constant of 0.1 REU/Å<sup>2</sup>. In addition, Rosetta centroid energy terms were also used: Ramachandran energy (1.0), omega angle potential (0.5), backbone hydrogen bond energy (5.0), and van der Waals energy (1.0) with weights in the parentheses. The minimization was performed for 100 steps. Then, the minimized structure was converted to an all-atom model, and the FastRelax protocol was applied to the model with the Rosetta scoring function (ref2015) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Park et al., 2016</xref>) and the same cross-linking constraints, the contact predictions, and the harmonic restraints on Cα atoms that were used for the minimization. Eight all-atom models were generated from the Cα model, and a model with the least cross-linking constraint violations was selected. To generate final models, Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions were added at the active sites of each subunit of SpoIVFB to be coordinated with D137, H43, and H47 followed by another brief minimization using CHARMM under harmonic restraints on heavy atoms to accommodate the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions without clashes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Plasmids, primers, and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains used in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74275-supp1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Applied restraints from cross-linking, and distance evaluation, for the model of SpoIVFB in complex with part of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74275-supp2-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Applied restraints from co-evolutionary coupling analysis, and distance evaluation, for the model of SpoIVFB in complex with part of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74275-supp3-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Applied restraints from cross-linking, and distance evaluation, for the model of SpoIVFB in complex with BofA and parts of SpoIVFA and Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74275-supp4-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Applied restraints from co-evolutionary coupling analysis, and distance evaluation, for the model of SpoIVFB in complex with BofA and parts of SpoIVFA and Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74275-supp5-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74275-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Daniel Parrell for assistance with fluorescence microscopy, Jon Kaguni for helpful comments on the manuscript, and David Rudner, Simon Cutting, Ruanbao Zhou, and Yang Zhang for plasmids.

for development in the spore-forming firmicute, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. SpoIVFB activity is tightly controlled, however, its status as a multipass membrane protein has made illuminating the molecular basis of SpoIVFB inhibition challenging. Here, Olenic and colleagues combine genetics, cross-linking, and co-evolutionary analysis to develop a structural model of interaction between SpoIVFB and its inhibitors SpoIVFA and BofA. Given the conservation and importance of this family of metalloproteases, this work should have a broad impact influencing our understanding of the regulation of this class of proteins across the tree of life.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74275.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Levin</surname><given-names>Petra Anne</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01yc7t268</institution-id><institution>Washington University in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Levin</surname><given-names>Petra Anne</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01yc7t268</institution-id><institution>Washington University in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Dötsch</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04cvxnb49</institution-id><institution>Goethe University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.07.09.451828">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.09.451828v5">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We broadened the hypothesis – “TMS2 of BofA occupies the SpoIVFB active site cleft in the inhibition complex” and explained the rationale for the hypothesis – “the GFPΔ27BofA N48 side chain is important for inhibition (Figure 2 and 3) and located near the middle of predicted TMS2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).” (l. 225-228). We then explain in general terms a strategy to begin testing the hypothesis based on a model of the SpoIVFB active site cleft and reasoning that BofA TMS2 occupancy of the cleft may be detectable using a disulfide cross-linking approach (l. 228-236). Because this approach may be unfamiliar to readers and we use it in many subsequent experiments, we added a sentence explaining its implementation in the context of the SpoIVFB inhibition complex (l. 236-239). Finally, we describe the first experiment to begin testing the hypothesis (l. 240-249) and the result (250-261).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Much of the work has been performed carefully and conclusions are warranted.

As mentioned in our response to “Essential Revisions”, we expressed the N48A, N61A, and T64A variants of GFPΔ27BofA in <italic>E. coli</italic> in the absence of other <italic>B. subtilis</italic> proteins and found that accumulation of the variants was indistinguishable from wild-type GFPΔ27BofA (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Since the Ala substitutions had little or no effect on GFPΔ27BofA stability, altered complex formation leading to protein instability likely explains the altered protein concentrations observed upon co-production with the other <italic>B. subtilis</italic> proteins (Figure 2) (l. 155-159).</p><p>During sporulation of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the three variants of GFPΔ27BofA accumulated normally at 4 h poststarvation, yet allowed premature cleavage of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>, despite reducing the level of SpoIVFB and in some cases SpoIVFA (Figure 3A). These observations support altered complex formation leading to instability of SpoIVFB and in some cases SpoIVFA, without additional experiments.</p><p>Together, the data suggest that the GFPΔ27BofA variants fold almost normally in <italic>E. coli</italic> in the absence of other <italic>B. subtilis</italic> proteins (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2) and at 4 h during <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation (Figure 3A), but subtle changes alter formation of the inhibition complex, relieving SpoIVFB inhibition and reducing its level. In the Discussion (l. 473-516), we integrate these observations with others that can be explained by proposing that “the BofA N48, N61, and T64 side chains are critical for interactions that stabilize a structural domain including TMS2 and a membrane-embedded C-terminal region, which in turn interact with SpoIVFA and SpoIVFB (Figure 7C), accounting for most of the steric hindrance mechanism of inhibition.” (l. 473-476).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear to me in the crosslinking studies why the P135C-SpoIVFG-BofA complex is not DTT sensitive.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the reviewer is referring to the bands labeled “complex” in lanes 8 and 9 of Figure 4B. We find that cross-link reversal by DTT treatment is variable. For example, in Figure 6—figure supplement 4D (60 min), we observed slightly more reversal of the same cross-link by DTT treatment. In Figure 6—figure supplement 4A (60 min), we observed less reversal of the E44C cytTM-SpoIVFB cross-link to MBPΔ27BofA C46 by DTT treatment than in lanes 1 and 2 of Figure 4A. We observed many other examples in our cross-linking experiments, but we do not understand the variability. We decided not to comment on the variability in the manuscript, since we think it would distract readers. In general, some cross-links appear to be less sensitive to DTT treatment, perhaps owing to the chemical environment of the cross-link.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors use alanine scanning to identify N48 as a critical amino acid for the inhibitory process.

So, even though the N61 side chain is shown pointing away from the N48 and T64 side chains in the model, slight structural rearrangements within the modeling constraints could allow the N61 side chain to interact more directly with the N48 and/or T64 side chain(s).” (l. 410-414).</p><p>As mentioned in our response to the first comment of Reviewer #2, we propose in the Discussion that “the BofA N48, N61, and T64 side chains are critical for interactions that stabilize a structural domain including TMS2 and a membrane-embedded C-terminal region, which in turn interact with SpoIVFA and SpoIVFB (Figure 7C), accounting for most of the steric hindrance mechanism of inhibition.” (l. 473-476).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In some of the figures showing the results of the cross linking experiments the largest density is seen as diffuse bands of molecular weights higher than the complex.
