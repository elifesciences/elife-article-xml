2019) using adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy. Here, we apply this technique to the context of acute inflammation and discover both infiltrating and tissue-resident immune cells to be visible without any labeling in the living mouse retina using near-infrared light alone. Intravital imaging of immune cells can be negatively impacted by surgical manipulation, exogenous dyes, transgenic manipulation and phototoxicity. These confounds are now overcome, using phase contrast and time-lapse videography to reveal the dynamic behavior of myeloid cells as they interact, extravasate and survey the mouse retina. Cellular motility and differential vascular responses were measured noninvasively and in vivo across hours to months at the same retinal location, from initiation to the resolution of inflammation. As comparable systems are already available for clinical research, this approach could be readily translated to human application.</p></abstract><kwd-group

robust and noninvasive method for directly imaging immune cells in humans has not been established, limiting our understanding of autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Immune cells typically provide weak optical contrast requiring exogenous or transgenic labeling for detection even in animal models. The eye is optimally suited to image immune responses in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rosenbaum et al., 2002</xref>). As the only transparent organ in mammals, no inflammatory surgical or environmental perturbation is required. However, aberrations of the otherwise clear optics of the eye limit achievable image resolution. We employed a custom adaptive-optics-scanning-light-ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) to image the mouse eye. By correcting for the eye’s aberrations, single-cell resolution provides detailed imaging of photoreceptors to erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joseph et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Roorda and Duncan, 2015</xref>). Incorporating our recent advance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guevara-Torres et al., 2020</xref>) on AOSLO phase contrast approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Scoles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sulai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guevara-Torres et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>) allowed deep tissue detection of translucent immune cells. We combined and applied these strategies and serendipitously discovered that immune cells and their dynamics could be imaged without labeling using 796 nm near-infrared light, to which the eye is less sensitive, and at far lower levels (200–500 µW) than multiphoton systems, which can be phototoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Galli et al., 2014</xref>). This new approach builds on our ability to quantify single-cell blood flow in vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joseph et al., 2019</xref>) revealing the dynamic interplay of blood flow and single immune cells in response to inflammation in the living eye. Our approach is in a similar power range to those already employed safely in human AOSLO studies, where phase contrast approaches have also been used to study other retinal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Scoles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rossi et al., 2017</xref>). This speaks to the feasibility of translating this technique to the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To model an immune response, ocular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to provide an acute but self-resolving inflammatory stimulus: endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chu et al., 2016</xref>).

Adapting our recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joseph et al., 2019</xref>), red blood cell (RBC) velocimetry, vessel dilation and flow-rate changes were quantified in this same cohort of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–H</xref>). AOSLO revealed micron-level vascular dilations and heterogeneous changes in blood flow in arterioles and venules in response to LPS. Total blood flow increased in the retinal circulation, yet elevated flow in arterioles and venules was achieved in fundamentally different ways. Venules dilated on average 36% (±8%) at 24 hr post-LPS injection facilitating a total flow increase of 67% (±27%) relative to baseline. Conversely, arterioles also showed a total flow increase, however with minimal dilation and a dramatic elevation in RBC velocity (48% (±31%) increase in arteriole RBC velocity at 24 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). Despite these different mechanisms, conservation of flow was confirmed as arterioles and venules showed correlated changes in flow over time (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.83, for linear-fit, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). Velocity, dilation and flow began resolution toward baseline levels by 10 days post-injection.</p><p>Thus, we found that arterioles and venules have functionally opposing behaviors when it comes to modulating volumetric blood flow in inflammation, via opposing changes in lumen diameter and blood velocity. Venules modulate blood flow primarily by changing their diameter while arterioles respond primarily not by a change in diameter but by showing increased blood velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In our current study, by measuring both blood velocity and lumen diameter, which gives us total flow rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), we build on previous reports that found venular widening in association with inflammation (using diameter measurements alone, and using fundus photography) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). However, diameter measurements alone would not have given a complete picture of volumetric blood flow rate and would have missed the functionally opposing behaviours of arterioles and venules shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>. In summary, our single-cell velocimetry combined with AO-resolution diameter measurements adds to our understanding of hemodynamic control in response to inflammation, achieved by applying our recently developed blood flow measurement tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joseph et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study advances our understanding of the immune response by imaging both the nuanced differences of vascular perfusion with the first detailed imaging of single immune cell activity imaged without labels. Unlike other approaches, inflammatory surgery is not required; the label-free feature avoids confounds from exogenous fluorescent dyes, gene haplo-insufficiency from transgenic labels and using near-infrared light avoids significant phototoxicity inherent to multiphoton platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Galli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">You et al., 2018</xref>). This therefore provides the closest fidelity conditions to an unperturbed biological system achievable, which is critical particularly in the context of immune cell behaviours. These advantages are greatest in relation to human translation, where exogenous manipulation and tissue biopsy are often prohibitive. Correlative study using mice to understand AOSLO phase contrast cell morphologies would be highly informative, but there are labeling limitations even in murine systems, and it is rarely possible to label more than three markers simultaneously in vivo. This means populations not already known can be missed, whereas by phase contrast AOSLO any cell causing reasonable scatter of light could be detected, ensuring a more comprehensive characterization of true tissue infiltration.</p><p>Our choice of imaging wavelength (796 nm) provided minimal phototoxicity, greater theoretical penetration through the eye’s anterior optics and minimal absorption in the retina without scatter typical of short visible wavelengths. Furthermore, we have previously published a detailed wave-optics simulation to determine the source of contrast in our imaging modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guevara-Torres et al., 2020</xref>), where we found that the combination of this wavelength and other imaging parameters rendered imaging contrast to translucent cells.</p><p>Perivascular imaging of immune cells with AOSLO appeared to capture transendothelial migration (TEM). The axial resolution of our system (&lt;16 µm) and known diameters of mouse retinal veins (30–50 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joseph et al., 2019</xref>) demonstrates vessel bisection in the majority of images, rather than cells residing above or below the focal plane of imaging. Furthermore, parallel orientation and motility of cells as they interact with the vascular wall would indicate that they are meeting mechanical resistance as they pass through the vascular wall. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, second-half of <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref> show that dynamic and motile cells often pause and slow as they meet the vascular barrier; a finding consistent with diapedesis as seen in transendothelial migration. Such behaviors would not be expected if cells were moving above or below the vessel, nor would they be optically visible due to the imaging constraints of the system axial resolution described above.</p><p>Consistent with all AOSLO approaches, in our approach, relatively clear optical media is required and severe cataract or vitritis during peak inflammation can limit successful imaging. In our study, this affected 25% of the eyes given EIU. A further limitation is that deeper retinal structures are not as well visualized due to the nature of contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guevara-Torres et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the choroid, which is often involved in ocular inflammation, is challenging to image due to the scatter and absorption of the RPE. Nevertheless, our approach here on inner retinal pathology likely extends deep within the retina as work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Scoles et al., 2017</xref> with a similar detection strategy, has identified a putative macrophage by morphology and motility, deep in the retina of a retinal dystrophy patient. This suggests deeper retinal imaging of immune cells could be possible with further study and refinement. Our work reinforces this exciting finding as we now demonstrate, with transgenic markers in the mouse, that tissue immune cells are reliably detectable by label-free phase-contrast AOSLO.</p><p>There are numerous benefits if this approach can be applied to the human eye. Retinal diseases could be characterized for contributions by immune cells for the first time at a quantitative single-cell basis, which has the potential to redefine their clinical status and classification. Active retinal inflammation can only be assessed currently using surrogate biomarkers such as macular edema, vascular involvement or subjective detection of overspill of infiltrating cells into the vitreous cavity. By providing a direct method to diagnose the presence of active immune cells, more accurate diagnosis and differentiation from clinically challenging masquerade entities such as ocular lymphoma would be of great benefit. Finally, accurate monitoring of cellular infiltration to detect early response to treatment could avoid the use of excessive or ineffective therapy in patients with uveitis, yet alone support the screening of novel agents in clinical trials. Furthermore, this could allow study of the many systemic diseases and infections that manifest in the eye. By providing this proof of concept, as AOSLO systems are already available for clinical research, the approach stands to be rapidly tested for translation to human application. Our approach is in a similar power range to those already employed safely in human AOSLO studies, where phase contrast approaches have also been used to study photoreceptors and other retinal cells using a similar light source and wavelength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Scoles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rossi et al., 2017</xref>). This speaks to the feasibility of translating this technique to the clinic. While some studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rossi et al., 2017</xref> have used up to ~280 µW of NIR light, other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2017</xref> have used 115–130 µW of NIR light.</p><p>We also recognize the following challenges to translating our approach to use in human beings. The larger eye motion of the human eye without anesthesia will include saccades and drift that may impact image registration critical for stable time-lapse videography. Nevertheless, only a single image is required over any sparse time interval and therefore may be more lenient to this challenge. The investigation is rate-limited by the biology of immune cell dynamics, as most cells move relatively slowly, so will require patient cooperation over extended periods of imaging time. As we demonstrate, however, that single-cell surveillance can be observed over minutes, the approach would be feasible in a single imaging session, and thus still shorter than comparable tests in the clinic such as electroretinography. Next, on the imaging side, there will be ~4 times reduced axial imaging resolution in the human eye compared to the mouse eye due to the ~2 times smaller numerical aperture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geng et al., 2012</xref>). This may impact the axial specificity or contrast of the single immune cell dynamics visualized in humans. However, other translucent cell types have been successfully imaged using human AOSLO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Scoles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sulai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rossi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Scoles et al., 2017</xref>), holding promise that our approach presented here can be translated to humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, males)</td><td>Wildtype C57BL/6J mice</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>, JAX Stock number 000664</td><td>six to 12 weeks old</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, males)</td><td>Cx3cr1-GFP Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup>hemizygous mice</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005582">IMSR_JAX:005582</ext-link>, JAX Stock number 005582</td><td>six to 8 months old</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, males)</td><td>Tg(CD68-EGFP)1Drg hemizygous mice</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:026827">IMSR_JAX:026827</ext-link>, JAX Stock number 026827</td><td>six to 12 weeks old</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 647 anti-mouse Ly-6G antibody (1A8 clone) <break/>for labeling (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>Catalogue number: 127610</td><td>2 µg total prepared in 100 µl PBS</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>All mice were sourced from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) and maintained at the University of Rochester in compliance with all guidelines from the University Committee on Animal Resources and according to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.

The measured imaging spatial resolution was: lateral: 0.77 µm for 520 nm fluorescence and 1.2 µm for 796 nm reflectance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joseph et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geng et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, the confocal axial resolution was 10.5 µm for 520 nm fluorescence. For phase-contrast imaging, the axial depth of focus is narrow in the mouse (numerical aperture = 0.49) and provides optimal contrast in a thin optical section less than the diameter of most retinal cell types as described by us previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guevara-Torres et al., 2020</xref>). Given this numerical aperture, nearly 50 diopters of focus covers the mouse retina meaning that cells outside the plane of optimal focus will be rendered invisible due to defocus blur. Phase-contrast imaging referred to in the context of this paper, was achieved by purposefully displacing the detector axially to a plane conjugate to the highly reflective RPE/choroid complex, to enable detection of forward and multiply scattered light from translucent cells, as detailed in our recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guevara-Torres et al., 2020</xref>). In a subset of experiments for confirmation of immune cell types, fluorescence was simultaneously imaged using 488 nm excitation (220-330 µW) and 520Δ35 emission for GFP, and 640 nm excitation and 676Δ29 emission for Alexa Fluor 647 (excitation laser diode: iChrome MLE, Toptica Photonics, Farmington, New York, USA; emission filters: FF01-520/35-25 and FF01-676/29-25, Semrock, Rochester, New York, USA).

Sixty AOSLO phase-contrast videos were used to analyse the migration of extravasated cells. Registered videos were pre-processed by cropping to 512 × 400 pixels and temporally averaged with five frames. A customized semi-automated deep-learning based cell tracking software was employed to track and quantify the migration behavior of cells. The software consisted of a deep learning-based cell detector with an encoder-decoder U-Net backbone architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Falk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>). The U-Net was trained on phase-contrast AOSLO images with the centroids of 387 cells manually identified by expert graders obtained from four mice at either 6 or 24 hr post LPS injection. Immune cell data from mice imaged for training were excluded from the final analysis of the results in this paper. The trained U-Net outputs a probability map for each frame of a video that was thresholded (&gt;=90%) to identify the centroids of cells. The cell counts of a video were calculated by averaging the number of detected objects in the first 25 frames (5 s). To track the cells, centroid positions detected by the U-Net in adjacent frames were linked with a nearest neighbor search algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>). The deep learning strategy facilitated tracking of a large number of cells across multiple frames captured at different time points across inflammation. Once the heavy burden of tracking this population over a large data set was complete, a human user provided quality control of the automated outputted traces to confirm tracking fidelity. Traces due to incorrect linkage (for example, a single trace that falsely jumped between two adjacent cells) were manually rejected based on visual inspection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). To quantify cell migration, two quantities were extracted from the traces: 1. cell displacement which is defined as the displacement of a cell over 100 s. 2. confinement ratio which is defined as the ratio of cell displacement and the total path length over 100 s.

Briefly, a fast 15 kHz beam (796∆17 nm) was scanned across a vessel of interest to image passing blood cells without requiring contrast agent. Cellular-scale blood velocity and vessel diameter were quantified automatically. Given the small size of even the largest mouse retinal vessels (&lt;45 µm inner diameter in healthy mice), the spatial resolution of our approach accurately measured the inner lumen diameter with micrometer precision, accounting for vessel tortuosity, vascular wall thickness and cell-free plasma layer. Additionally, the temporal resolution of the velocity detection approach was more than sufficient to measure and account for cardiac pulsatility in flow, as demonstrated previously. This ensured accurate measurement of the average blood velocity through the vessel. Combined, the volumetric flow rate through the vessel was quantified label-free.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Johnny Tam as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Timothy Secomb (Reviewer #2); Tyson Kim (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The reviewers raised some specific and useful suggestions. I have combined them into a single review below to help improve the clarity and presentation of the work.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Building upon their prior <italic>eLife</italic> article, the authors have extended their approach to image immune cells that are most easily seen in an endotoxin-induced mouse model of uveitis. The authors present a novel approach to directly image the motion of immune cells in the mouse retinal circulation, without the use of dyes or contrast agents. The ability to carry out longitudinal non-invasive imaging alongside confirmatory experiments with fluorescently-tagged cells is compelling. This simultaneous non-invasive imaging of blood flow and immune cells in the mouse retinal circulation opens up new possibilities for investigating the role of the vasculature in inflammation and immune responses. The work is clearly and concisely presented.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The novelty and impact of this manuscript is based on the specific implementation and potential for human application. The authors allude to human imaging in the Introduction and Conclusion, and often describe their work in a broader context of ocular imaging. However, there is currently inadequate description of relevance and consideration for human use. The authors should include a robust description of potential human applications and limitations in the Discussion section of the manuscript. This imaging method may provide an exquisite level of quantitative assessment in retinitis, uveitis, and ocular lymphoma. It may also offer immune surveillance in a number of systemic diseases.</p><p>2) In order to better understand the variation in cells observed both across difference mice as well as in different areas within an eye, it is suggested to clarify whether any variability was observed across the different mouse eyes, and if available, across the different areas imaged in the eye. For example, in Figure 1, it's not clear if this impressive degree of cells is observed on the other veins too. Clarifying the variability would be extremely helpful for documenting how representative this data is for the purposes of maximizing repeatability. In the <italic>eLife</italic> transparent reporting form, specifying the number/type of each mice used for each experiment in addition to the measurement replication and technical replicates would be useful.</p><p>3) It's possible that not all cells are fluorescently tagged (especially in the case of the Ly6G-Alexa Fluor 647 tail vein injection). Presumably, only those cells that are in the proximity of the injection bolus will be efficiently labeled. This should be clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>4) Can the authors say anything about why microscopy at this particular wavelength shows up the immune cells?</p><p>5) The authors should comment on the ability/inability to image deeper structure including the subretinal space and choroid, which are highly involved in many immune-mediated pathologies of the eye.</p><p>6) How might this imaging method perform with vitritis and media opacity, which are often important features of uveitis? It would be valuable to describe or show data on the performance of this imaging approach with media opacity (vitritis, cataract).</p><p>7) The authors perform imaging with near infrared light (796nm) at power levels of 200-500 microwatts. Given the implications for human application and the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, the authors should comment on prospective safety in human application, such as for the power levels of near infrared light (796 nm, 200-500 microwatts).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60547.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The novelty and impact of this manuscript is based on the specific implementation and potential for human application.

However, we would also highlight that the novelty and impact of this work is applicable to visualizing CNS immune cells in one of the most widely used models in biomedical science to date, the mouse. We feel the readership will also appreciate that this approach facilitates a far wider range of science applications than only the clinically translational potential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In order to better understand the variation in cells observed both across difference mice as well as in different areas within an eye, it is suggested to clarify whether any variability was observed across the different mouse eyes, and if available, across the different areas imaged in the eye.

However, we agree that the argument is more compelling with multiple examples. Therefore, we provide a new supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1): a catalog of infiltrating cells of six mice in veins on both sides of the optic disc.</p><p>Furthermore, like most retinal insults or chronic disease, the manifestation of the disease phenotype is geographic. Variation exists between veins of the same eye and within eyes from different mice (inter and intraocular variation). The variation could be accounted for by known variability of the EIU model and biological response (Chu et al., 2016). While this variation may initially appear to reduce “repeatability”, we contend that the power of our approach is this very ability to focus in on a single retinal location and track it longitudinally without surgery or histology, to provide an internal control. This is the basis of our data in Figures 1 and 2 of the paper and is perhaps the greatest testament to reducing experimental variability within cohorts, post-mortem artifact, and the aforementioned phenotype variability that is present in most retinal disease.</p><p>To the reviewers’ further comments, the Materials and methods section has been updated:</p><p>“The following numbers, types, sex and ages of mice were used: Six C57BL/6J mice (JAX stock number 000664, males, 6-12 weeks old) were analyzed for longitudinal study of immune cell motility and blood flow after induction of EIU with LPS (Figure 2). […] Four Cx3cr1-GFP hemizygotes (stock number 005582, males, 6-8 months old) were used for positive confirmation of fluorescent tissue-resident myeloid cells (Figure 1G and I).”</p><p>Numbers and types of mice have also been added to Figure 1 legend as:</p><p>“Representative images from cohort of eleven (A to D, J) and three C57BL/6J mice (E), three CD68-GFP mice (F and H) and four Cx3cr1-GFP mice (G and I).”</p><p>These numbers have also been summarized in the <italic>eLife</italic> transparent reporting form as requested by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It's possible that not all cells are fluorescently tagged (especially in the case of the Ly6G-Alexa Fluor 647 tail vein injection). Presumably, only those cells that are in the proximity of the injection bolus will be efficiently labeled. This should be clarified in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with this limitation and the manuscript text has been amended (see below). The antibody is known to be specific, so fluorescent cells are almost certain to be neutrophils, yet we rightly cannot be certain of the identity of the unlabeled population in this context and have altered the text. For reader’s reference, previous work has shown the main population in EIU are neutrophils (Chu et al., 2016) and the technique is widely used, yet one of the few studies to show data on labelling efficiency identifies only 10% of circulating leukocytes are tagged. (Bucher et al., 2015).</p><p>Text altered to:</p><p>“Simultaneous phase contrast and confocal fluorescence AOSLO revealed most leukocytes rolling along venular endothelium were neutrophils using intravenous anti-Ly6G fluorescent antibody labelling, though the proportion may be higher as only 10% of circulating leukocytes may be labelled using this method (Bucher et al., 2015) (Figure 1E, Video 5 ).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Can the authors say anything about why microscopy at this particular wavelength shows up the immune cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Our choice of imaging wavelength was driven by the following considerations: First, NIR (near infrared) light (796 nm) provided lower phototoxicity regimes for imaging the retina than visible light. This means that higher light levels of NIR can be used without phototoxicity or subject discomfort. This is a similar strategy employed by many ophthalmoscopy approaches such as NIR fluorescence imaging, commercial OCT and SLO. Second, the use of NIR also provides optical benefit of greater theoretical penetration into the retinal tissue without scatter typical of short visible wavelengths and was favorably transmitted by the anterior optics and cells of the retina with minimal absorption.</p><p>We also point the readers to our recent publication (Guevara-Torres et al., 2020) that provides a detailed wave-optics simulation to determine the source of contrast in this modality using this particular wavelength (796 nm). In those simulations, we found that the combination of this wavelength and other imaging parameters rendered contrast to a large catalog of translucent retinal cells.</p><p>Having stated this, we have not tested other wavelengths for phase-contrast imaging, and expect there to be a tradeoff of light-budget, scatter and subject comfort using shorter wavelength (visible) light. Despite a few theoretical benefits, we are reluctant to state more in the manuscript as it would be speculative and not based in scientific rigor.</p><p>In summary, we agree with the need to highlight these aspects. We summarize the above and address the reviewers’ comments in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Our choice of imaging wavelength (796 nm) provided both minimal phototoxicity and greater theoretical penetration through the eye’s anterior optics and minimal absorption in the retina without scatter typical of short visible wavelengths. Furthermore, we have previously published a detailed wave-optics simulation to determine the source of contrast in our imaging modality (Guevara-Torres et al., 2020), where we found that the combination of this wavelength and other imaging parameters rendered reasonable contrast to translucent cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should comment on the ability/inability to image deeper structure including the subretinal space and choroid, which are highly involved in many immune-mediated pathologies of the eye.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. Our phase-contrast approach relies on imaging cells in front of the backscattered light from RPE/choroid complex (described in detail by Guevara-Torres et al., 2020). As such, we expect contrast will be lower when attempting to image the subretinal and choroidal space due to scatter/absorption of the RPE. Importantly though, these values are expected to be non-zero (as measured and modeled by Guevara-Torres et al., 2020).</p><p>In the current manuscript, we focus upon inflammation of the inner retina, vasculature and peripapillary region, which is still frequently involved in many forms of ocular inflammation. While it might seem challenging to image deeper cell structures, we draw the readers’ attention to Scoles et al., 2017, (we thank the reviewers for highlighting this omission), which uses a similar approach to visualize a dynamic structure suspected to be a macrophage next to the photoreceptor layer of the human retina, in response to retinal disease. Whilst the cell type could not be confirmed, it raises the possibility that in certain contexts deeper retinal imaging of immune cells with phase contrast approaches could be possible, even in humans.</p><p>To address the above, we have revised the Discussion and included the Scoles et al., 2017 reference:</p><p>“A further limitation is that deeper retinal structures are not as well visualized due to the nature of contrast (Guevara-Torres et al., 2020). […] Our work reinforces this exciting finding as we now demonstrate, with transgenic markers in the mouse, that tissue immune cells are reliably detectable by label-free phase-contrast AOSLO.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How might this imaging method perform with vitritis and media opacity, which are often important features of uveitis? It would be valuable to describe or show data on the performance of this imaging approach with media opacity (vitritis, cataract).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an important point and address it in the following ways. First, as mentioned in point 4 above, this is an additional benefit of using NIR light as anterior scatter may be mitigated to a small extent. However, severe vitritis, cataract or other significant media opacities do affect almost all ophthalmological imaging approaches that use light and therefore will be a formidable hurdle to overcome. AO imaging is subject to the same degradation due to scatter.</p><p>Our new supplementary figure, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, provides examples of the variation of retinal inflammation in the mouse where imaging is still possible. We expect the initial deployment of this technique will find greatest success in the study of primary retinal inflammation. Many types of posterior uveitis do not develop severe vitritis or anterior chamber inflammation that would result in prohibitive loss of optical clarity. In cases that do, imaging soon after the initiation of treatment when media opacity improves can still provide important biological insight.</p><p>The occurrence of vitritis limiting imaging in our cohorts has now been included in the transparent reporting form. We have also added the following clarifications to the manuscript.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Consistent with all AOSLO approaches, in our approach, relatively clear optical media is required and severe cataract or vitritis during peak inflammation can limit successful imaging. In our study, this affected 25 % of the eyes given EIU.”</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“Reversible severe vitritis or cataract precluding AOSLO imaging occurred at a peak inflammation timepoint in 25% of eyes induced with EIU in our work.”</p><p>Of note, however, the EIU model arguably develops more severe vitritis than seen in most diseases or disease models and induces inflammation (including hypopyon) of the anterior optics (Chu et al., 2016). Our images show empirically that it is still possible to get sufficient image contrast and resolution in many cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors perform imaging with near infrared light (796nm) at power levels of 200-500 microwatts. Given the implications for human application and the broad readership of eLife, the authors should comment on prospective safety in human application, such as for the power levels of near infrared light (796 nm, 200-500 microwatts).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this. We have included the following new text in revised manuscript:</p><p>“Our approach is in a similar power range to those already employed safely in human AOSLO studies, where phase contrast approaches have also been used to study neuronal and photoreceptor cells using a similar light source and wavelength (Rossi et al., 2017, Scoles et al. 2014). […] While some studies (Rossi et al. 2017) used up to ~280 µW of NIR light, other studies (Liu et al. 2017) have used 115-130 µW of NIR light.”</p><p>In addition to the above edits in the manuscript, we draw the reviewers’ attention to Rossi et al., 2017 for precedence in compliance with the ANSI standard in the human retina. While we have provided this for clarity for the readership, we are reluctant to state more in the manuscript as the ANSI light safety standard applies only to the human eye and it is difficult to apply it directly to the mouse eye due to species difference, photopigment density, subtended visual angle, visual acuity limits, lack of fovea and strong pigmentation of the RPE, among others, that make a direct comparison between human and mouse challenging.</p></body></sub-article></article>
