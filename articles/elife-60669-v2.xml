is critical for surface adhesion, pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance and survival. The major constituent – hydrophobic β-barrel <italic>O</italic>uter-<italic>M</italic>embrane <italic>P</italic>roteins (OMPs) – are first secreted across the inner-membrane through the Sec-translocon for delivery to periplasmic chaperones, for example SurA, which prevent aggregation. OMPs are then offloaded to the β-<italic>B</italic>arrel <italic>A</italic>ssembly <italic>M</italic>achinery (BAM) in the outer-membrane for insertion and folding. We show the <italic>H</italic>olo-<italic>T</italic>rans<italic>L</italic>ocon (HTL) – an assembly of the protein-channel core-complex SecYEG, the ancillary sub-complex SecDF, and the membrane ‘insertase’ YidC – contacts BAM through periplasmic domains of SecDF and YidC, ensuring efficient OMP maturation. Furthermore, the proton-motive force (PMF) across the inner-membrane acts at distinct stages of protein secretion: (1) SecA-driven translocation through SecYEG and (2) communication of conformational changes via SecDF across the periplasm to BAM. The latter presumably drives efficient passage of OMPs. These interactions provide insights of inter-membrane organisation and communication, the importance of which is becoming increasingly apparent.</p></abstract><kwd-group

bacteria (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Konovalova et al., 2017</xref>) requires substantial quantities of protein to be exported, a process which begins by transport across the inner plasma membrane. Precursors of β-barrel <italic>O</italic>uter-<italic>M</italic>embrane <italic>P</italic>roteins (OMPs) with cleavable N-terminal signal-sequences are targeted to the ubiquitous Sec-machinery and driven into the periplasm by the ATPase SecA and the trans-membrane proton-motive force (PMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Collinson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lill et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cranford-Smith and Huber, 2018</xref>). Upon completion, the pre-protein signal-sequence is proteolytically cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Josefsson and Randall, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 1978</xref>), releasing the mature unfolded protein into the periplasm. The emergent protein is then picked up by periplasmic chaperones, such as SurA and Skp, which prevent aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McMorran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>), and somehow facilitate delivery to the β-<italic>B</italic>arrel <italic>A</italic>ssembly <italic>M</italic>achinery (BAM) for outer-membrane insertion and folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Voulhoux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> BAM consists of a membrane protein complex of subunits BamA-E, of known structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iadanza et al., 2016</xref>). The core component, BamA, is a 16 stranded β-barrel integral membrane protein, which projects a large periplasmic stretch of 5 <italic>PO</italic>lypeptide <italic>TR</italic>anslocation-<italic>A</italic>ssociated (POTRA) domains into the periplasm. BamB-E are peripheral membrane lipoproteins anchored to the inner leaflet of the OM. In spite of the structural insights, the mechanism for BAM-facilitated OMP insertion is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ricci and Silhavy, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The bacterial periplasm is a challenging environment for unfolded proteins, so complexes spanning both membranes are critical for efficient delivery through many specialised secretion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Green and Mecsas, 2016</xref>). How do enormous quantities of proteins entering the periplasm via the general secretory pathway (Sec) efficiently find their way through the cell envelope to the outer-membrane? From where is the energy derived to facilitate these trafficking processes some distance from the energy transducing inner-membrane, and in an environment lacking ATP? Could it be achieved by a direct interaction between chaperones, and the translocons of the inner (Sec) and outer (BAM) membranes?</p><p>The core-translocon, SecYEG, does not possess periplasmic domains of sufficient size to mediate such an interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>). However, the Holo-TransLocon (HTL) contains the ancillary sub-complex SecDF and the membrane protein ‘insertase’ YidC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duong and Wickner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schulze et al., 2014</xref>), both of which contain periplasmic extensions potentially large enough to reach the POTRA domains of BamA.</p><p>SecDF is a member of the so-called root nodulation division (RND) superfamily of PMF-driven transporters (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tseng et al., 1999</xref>). It is a highly conserved component of the bacterial Sec translocon, wherein it has long been known to facilitate protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duong and Wickner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Economou et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pogliano and Beckwith, 1994</xref>). While fellow component of the HTL – YidC – is essential for membrane protein insertion, and thus indispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Samuelson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scotti et al., 2000</xref>), mutants of <italic>secD</italic> and <italic>secF</italic> are not fatal but severely compromised and cold-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardel et al., 1987</xref>), presumably due to deficiencies in envelope biogenesis. The cause of this has been ascribed to a defect in protein transport across the inner membrane.</p><p>In keeping with other members of the RND family, like AcrB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eicher et al., 2014</xref>), SecDF confers PMF stimulation of protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arkowitz and Wickner, 1994</xref>). Different structures of SecDF show the large periplasmic domains in different conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Furukawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsukazaki et al., 2011</xref>), affected by altering a key residue of the proton transport pathway (SecD<sub>D519N </sub>– <italic>E. coli</italic> numbering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Furukawa et al., 2017</xref>). On this basis, an elaborate mechanism has been proposed whereby PMF-driven conformational changes, at the outer surface of the inner-membrane, pick up and pull polypeptides as they emerge from the protein-channel exit site of SecY. Yet, ATP- and PMF-driven translocation across the inner-membrane does not require SecDF or YidC; SecYEG and SecA will suffice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schulze et al., 2014</xref>). Evidently then, there must be two PMF-dependent components of protein secretion: an early stage dependent only on SecYEG/SecA and another later event regulated by an AcrB-like SecDF activity. This distinction has not been fully appreciated.</p><p>This study explores the role of the ancillary components of the Sec machinery for protein secretion, and for downstream trafficking through the periplasm for delivery to the outer-membrane and OMP maturation. In particular, we examine the possibility of a direct interaction between the HTL and BAM machineries to facilitate protein transport through the envelope. The basic properties and structure of the inter-membrane super-complex are investigated, as well as its importance for OMP folding and insertion. The implications of this interaction and its modulation caused by proton transport through SecDF are profound. Thus, we consider their consequences for the mechanism of protein transport through the Sec and BAM machineries, and for outer-membrane biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Co-fractionation and immunoprecipitation highlight an interaction between the Sec and BAM machineries</title><p>Total <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes from cells over-producing either SecYEG or HTL were prepared and fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation to separate the inner- and outer-membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Likewise, the over-produced SecY and SecE subunits mark the fractions containing the core-complex (SecYEG) in the inner-membrane fractions (IM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, YEG↑). However, when over-produced as part of HTL, there is a marked shift of their migration peak towards the outer-membrane containing fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, HTL↑). Interestingly, the over-production of SecDF alone results in a similar effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), where SecD, SecY, and SecG all migrate into the outer-membrane containing fractions. An effect which was lost in comparable experiments where the periplasmic domain of SecD (P1) had been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Our interpretation of these experiments is that an interaction between the Sec and Bam complexes, requiring at least the periplasmic domains of SecD (and most likely SecF and YidC), causes an association of inner- and outer-membrane vesicles reflected in the shift we observe.</p><p>To further examine this interaction, we extracted native membranes with a mild detergent for immuno-precipitation (IP) using a monoclonal antibody raised against SecG. The pull-downs were then probed for native interacting partners by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). As expected, SecG (positive control) and SecD of HTL co-immuno-precipitated. Crucially, BamA could also be detected. The specificity of the association was demonstrated by controls omitting the SecG antibody or the SecG protein (produced from membranes extracts of a <italic>ΔsecG</italic> strain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishiyama et al., 1994</xref>), wherein non-specific binding was either undetectable, or considerably lower than the specific co-immuno-precipitant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). When BAM was over-produced the yield of BamA recovered in the IPs increased accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>In a similar experiment, a hexa-histidine-tagged BamA was used to isolate BAM from cells over-producing the complex. Western blots showed that BamA co-purified, as expected, with additional components of the BAM complex (BamB and BamD), and crucially also with SecD and SecG of the HTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

Many factors contribute to this problem: the dynamism of the complex due to the limited contact surface between the HTL and BAM; its inherent mobility necessary for function; the presence of detergent surrounding the trans-membrane regions of the HTL and BAM components accounting for most of the surface of the assembly; and finally, the absence of inner- and outer-membrane scaffolds. The loss of the fixed double membrane architecture was particularly problematic; during image processing, we found different sub-populations where BAM pivots away from its raised position towards where the inner-membrane would otherwise have been. Obviously this would not happen if restrained by the outer-membrane.</p><p>Due to the limited resolution, we deployed cross-linking mass spectroscopy (XL-MS) to verify the contacts between HTL and BAM responsible for inter-membrane contact points. The HTL and BAM complexes were mixed together in equimolar quantities and cross-linked with the lysine-specific reagent DSBU. The reaction mixture was then fractionated by gel filtration chromatography and analysed by SDS-PAGE. A single band corresponding to the cross-linked HTL-BAM complex was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5a</xref>, lower band, black asterisk); note that the isolation of the intact HTL-BAM complex by gel filtration chromatography provides further evidence of a genuine interaction between inner- and outer-membrane translocons. The fractions containing the cross-linked complex were combined and digested prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.</p><p>The analysis of mass spectrometry data enabled the detection and mapping of the inter- and intra-molecular protein cross-links within the assembly. The results show an intricate network of interactions, most of which are consistent with the cryo-EM structure, particularly at one side of the assembly between SecD and BamBCD and on the other side between YidC and BamABCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5b,c</xref>).</p><p>All the constituent proteins of HTL were cross-linked to BAM subunits with the exception of SecG and YajC. Thus, the co-immunoprecipitation and affinity pull-down of SecG together with BamA (described above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f</xref>) must have been the result of an indirect interaction, presumably bridged via SecDF-YidC, which interacts with both SecG and BAM. This is consistent with the lack of an interaction of SecYEG alone with the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>), and the assignment of the electron microscopy structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>) – also showing no direct connection between SecYEG and BAM. In this respect, it is interesting to note in the structure that the periplasmic domains of SecD, YidC, and to a lesser degree SecF, extend to establish multiple interactions with the BAM lipoproteins suggesting a pivotal role for these subunits in the formation of the HTL-BAM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). This bridge between the two complexes also helps to define a very large cavity between the inner- and outer-membrane regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p>The BAM complex is recognisable in the cryo-EM structure at the outer-membrane with the expected extensive periplasmic protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gu et al., 2016</xref>).

So, we can rule out that this larger form, assigned as an ‘open’ state, of HTL is not due to the presence of contaminants, unknown additional partner proteins, or dimerisation. Lipid content within the HTL is critical for proper structure and function, and CL is particularly important for protein translocation through the Sec machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schulze et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hendrick and Wickner, 1991</xref>). Depletion of these core lipids, for instance by detergent extraction, might be expected to cause a collapse of the complex. Therefore, the reason for the presence of these different populations of the HTL – ‘compact’ and ‘open’ states – is likely due to varying interactions with lipids, including CL. In line with this hypothesis, augmenting the HTL with CL during purification increased the proportion of the ‘open’ state (from 8% to 17%), which could be enriched by glycerol gradient fractionation (to 32%), and further stabilised by cross-linking (to 40%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Evidently then, it seems likely that the open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, structure iv) is the state capable of interacting with the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, structure ii). The ‘open’ structure, and the ‘compact’ structure seen before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Botte et al., 2016</xref>), may reflect different functional states of the translocon. Presumably, the HTL would be closed when idle in the membrane and would be opened to various degrees depending on the associated cytosolic partners (e.g. ribosomes or SecA), periplasmic factors (chaperones, BAM, etc), and various substrates (e.g. globular, membrane, or β-barrels).

We also show the unfolded and folded forms also migrate differently from the precursor – proOmpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Therefore, the subsequent periplasmic analysis could not have been confused by un-secreted pre-protein – potentially from contaminating cytosol.</p><p>Based on the above results, SecDF looks like the most important mediator of the Sec-BAM interaction. We therefore used the SecDF depletion strain (JP325) as a basis for functional assays. To overcome the growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, panels 1 and 2) and produce sufficient cells to analyse, overnight cultures of the strains used above were grown in permissive media (arabinose). Cells were then washed thoroughly to remove arabinose and transferred to new media containing glucose (non-permissive), or maintained in arabinose as a control, then resuspended to give an OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 0.05 (marked as t = 0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,d,e–g</xref>).

Under SecDF depletion conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, red squares), high levels of unfolded OmpA accumulate in the periplasm, particularly during the exponential phase when the demand for outer-membrane biogenesis is highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, yellow asterisk; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f,g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

The stationary state of these cultures, grown in permissive and native conditions – with no impediment, or high demand for OmpA maturation – should not induce a build up of unfolded OmpA.

Taken together, the data show that depletion of SecDF reduces the interaction between HTL and BAM, and thereby hampers transport of β-barrel proteins to the outer-membrane resulting in a build-up of ufOmpA in the periplasm.

At OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 1.0, the cultures were harvested and membranes were prepared and solubilised for IP with SecG antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h,i</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1f,g</xref>). As expected the immuno-precipitated yields of SecG were invariant, but the depletion of SecD (cells harbouring only the empty vector; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1g</xref>) reduced the recovery of BamA commensurately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h,i</xref>). The levels of co-immuno-precipitated SecG, SecD, and BamA were the same irrespective of complementation with the wild type or mutant forms of <italic>secDF</italic>. Evidently then, the integrity of the HTL and its ability to interact with the BAM complex do not require a functional proton wire through SecD. Therefore, the mutant’s compromised OmpA maturation must be due to the loss of proton flow through SecD, rather than a loss of contact between HTL and BAM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>HTL(SecD<sub>D519N</sub>F) adopts a different conformation to the native version</title><p>The PMF-dependent mobility of the periplasmic domain of SecD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Furukawa et al., 2017</xref>) seems like it might be critical for its activity as part of the BAM-HTL complex.

Evidently, direct contact between HTL and BAM is required for efficient OMP biogenesis in rapidly growing cells. The interaction could enable large protein fluxes to stream through the periplasm, while minimising aggregation and proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The presence of super-complexes that bridge both membranes appears to be a fundamental feature of the Gram negative bacterial cell envelope – critical for a whole range of activities including the export of proteins through a gamut of different secretion systems (e.g. type I, II, III, IV, and VI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Green and Mecsas, 2016</xref>); now including the Sec machinery. The general importance of these inter-membrane associations is only just coming to the fore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rassam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rassam et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the HTL-BAM machinery.</title><p>Model of OMP transfer through the bacterial envelope, facilitated by HTL-BAM and periplasmic chaperones, such as SurA, Skp, PpiD, and YfgM. From left to right: OMP precursors with an N-terminal signal sequence are driven across the membrane by the ATPase SecA through the Sec translocon – this process is stimulated by the PMF (independent of SecDF). Late in this process, the pre-protein emerges into the periplasm and the signal sequence is removed, releasing the mature protein. Presumably, globular proteins are then guided into the periplasm, where folding will occur assisted by periplasmic chaperones. Otherwise, OMP-chaperone-HTL complexes are recognised by the BAM complex, with interactions forming between BAM and both HTL (this study) and SurA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>). The persistence and variety of chaperones involvement at this stage is unclear (?). This conjunction enables the smooth and efficient passage of OMPs to the outer-membrane, which is enabled by coupling of the inner-membrane proton-motive force with conformational changes in the periplasmic domain of SecDF (right).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60669-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It has already been shown that the HTL encloses a lipid-containing cavity within the membrane, presumably to facilitate membrane protein insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Botte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2019</xref>). Remarkably, in the super-complex between HTL and BAM there is a much larger extension of this cavity opening into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This would seem an obvious place for OMP passage and for the interaction with chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and is of sufficient size to do so. The cavity is situated such that a secretory protein could enter via the protein-channel through SecYEG, and then exit accordingly into the periplasm, or into the mouth of the BAM complex.</p><p>It remains to be seen how the Sec-BAM complex and the periplasmic chaperones coordinate. Perhaps these chaperones recognise emerging globular proteins at the Sec-machinery and shuttle them into the periplasm, with or without the need for the BAM complex. Otherwise, they could facilitate passage of OMPs through the inter-membrane assembly for outer-membrane folding and insertion by BAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). SurA is known to interact with BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>), and an interaction with the HTL also seems likely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Other ancillary factors of the Sec machinery have also been implicated: YfgM and PpiD are thought to mediate interactions between emergent periplasmic proteins and chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Götzke et al., 2014</xref>); indeed, PpiD has also been shown to interact with SecYEG and YidC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jauss et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>yfgL</italic> and <italic>yfgM</italic> are in the same operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blattner et al., 1997</xref>), the former encoding a subunit of the BAM complex (BamB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, a recent proteomic analysis of the <italic>E. coli</italic> ‘membrane protein interactome’ identifies cross-membrane interactions involving SecYEG, BAM and the chaperones YfgM and PpiD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlson et al., 2019</xref>). Clearly, understanding the interplay of various periplasmic chaperones during OMP passage through the Sec-BAM assembly to the outer-membrane will require further attention.</p><p>From our data it is clear that the periplasmic domain of SecD is central to the physical HTL-BAM interaction. Even more intriguing though is the requirement for a functioning proton wire through the SecDF trans-membrane domain. The non-functioning SecDF is fully capable of conferring an interaction with BAM but is presumably unable to transmit PMF-dependent conformational changes relayed from the inner-membrane. This static interaction of HTL and BAM is insuffient to enable efficient OMP maturation. The consequences of preventing PMF inducing dynamic interplay between HTL and BAM are as severe as the disconnection induced by SecDF depletion. Presumably, the deletion of the periplasmic domain P1 of SecD, which also eliminates the interaction with the outer-membrane, will have an equally severe effect.</p><p>The requirement for PMF-driven inter-membrane dynamic connectivity raises the intriguing prospect of TonB-style energy-coupling from the inner-membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Celia et al., 2016</xref>): that is the transmission of free energy available from the PMF via the Sec-machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arkowitz and Wickner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schiebel et al., 1991</xref>) for OMP folding and insertion at the outer-membrane. We therefore propose that one of the primary roles of SecDF is in inter-membrane trafficking and energy transduction. Indeed, we and others have shown that ATP- and PMF-driven transport of proteins through the inner-membrane is dependent only on SecYEG and SecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schulze et al., 2014</xref>), whereas we show here that proton translocation through SecD is crucial for efficient OMP folding and growth.</p><p>Thus, there appears to be two distinct requirements of the PMF in protein secretion: one for the early stage – SecA-driven translocation through SecYEG at the inner-membrane, and another for late stages of OMP maturation. The latter is facilitated by conformational changes in SecDF for transduction of energy from the inner- to the outer-membrane. Here, we show that an ‘open’ state of the HTL interacts with the BAM complex, and that the periplasmic regions of SecD can adopt different conformations, reminiscent of those previously characterised as the <italic>I-</italic> and <italic>F-</italic>forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Furukawa et al., 2017</xref>); when a key proton carrying residue of the inner-membrane segment of the translocon is neutralised – SecD<sub>D519N</sub> – the periplasmic domain adopts the <italic>F</italic>-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Furukawa et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, successive protonation (approximated by SecD<sub>D519N</sub>) and deprotonation result in large, cyclical movements – between the <italic>I-</italic> and <italic>F-</italic>forms – during PMF-driven proton transport from the periplasm to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Presumably then, the occurance of these conformational changes, while connected to the BAM complex, results in long-range energetic coupling between the inner- and outer-membranes. Interestingly, the phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) is important for the stabilisation of the ‘open’ state of the HTL and its interaction with the BAM machinery. It is probably not a coincidence that this lipid has already been shown to be critical for PMF-driven protein translocation through SecYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corey et al., 2018</xref>). Certainly, we hope to overcome the inherent flexibility of the CL-stabilised open translocon, primed to receive BAM, in order to determine its high-resolution structure, and further understand this process.</p><p>Taking all together, this builds a compelling case for SecD mediated inter-membrane energy transduction – in keeping with other members of the RND transporter family, such as the assembly of AcrAB (inner-membrane) and TolC (outer-membrane) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Direct association between inner- and outer-membrane components appears to be the rule rather than the exception for transporters embedded in double membrane systems: parallels with the translocation assembly module (TAM) for auto-transporter secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Selkrig et al., 2012</xref>), and the TIC-TOC import machinery of chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) are striking, given the respective outer-membrane components (TamA and TOC75) are homologous of BamA. Particularly intriguing is the possibility of the mitochondrial homologue of BAM (sorting and assembly machinery; SAM) participating in analogous inter-membrane interactions between inner- and outer-membranes. Indeed, subunits of the MItochondrial contact site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS) connect the energy-transducing ATP synthase of the inner-membrane and SAM at the outer-membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rampelt et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> C43 (DE3) was a gift from Sir John Walker (MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit, Cambridge, UK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miroux and Walker, 1996</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) were purchased as competent cells (New England Biolabs). <italic>E. coli ΔsecG</italic> (KN425 (W3110 M25 <italic>ΔsecG</italic>::kan)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishiyama et al., 1994</xref>), which lacks a genomic copy of <italic>secG</italic>, was obtained from Prof. Frank Duong (University of British Colombia, Vancouver, Canada). <italic>E. coli</italic> strain jp325 (Kan<sup>r</sup>), which contains an arabinose-regulated <italic>secDF-yajC</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Economou et al., 1995</xref>), was given to us by Prof. Ross Dalbey.</p><p>The plasmids for over-expression of <italic>secEYG</italic> and <italic>yidC</italic> were from our laboratory collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collinson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lotz et al., 2008</xref>), the former and also that of <italic>secDF</italic> were acquired from Prof. Frank Duong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duong and Wickner, 1997</xref>).

An Ultimate U3000 HPLC (ThermoScientific Dionex, USA) was used to deliver a flow of approximately 300 nL/min. A C18 Acclaim PepMap100 5 μm, 100 μm × 20 mm nanoViper (ThermoScientific Dionex, USA), trapped the peptides before separation on a C18 Acclaim PepMap100 3 μm, 75 μm × 250 mm nanoViper (ThermoScientific Dionex, USA). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile. The analytical column was directly interfaced via a nano-flow electrospray ionisation source, with a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive HF-X, ThermoScientific, USA). MS data were acquired in data-dependent mode. High-resolution full scans (R = 120000, m/z 350–2000) were recorded in the Orbitrap and after CID activation (stepped collision energy 30 ± 3) of the 10 most intense MS peaks, MS/MS scans (R = 45,000) were acquired.</p><p>For data analysis, Xcalibur raw files were converted into the MGF format through MSConvert (Proteowizard; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kessner et al., 2008</xref>) and used directly as input files for MeroX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Götze et al., 2015</xref>). Searches were performed against an ad hoc protein database containing the sequences of the complexes and a set of randomised decoy sequences generated by the software. The following parameters were set for the searches: maximum number of missed cleavages 3; targeted residues K; minimum peptide length five amino acids; variable modifications: carbamidomethyl-Cys (mass shift 57.02146 Da), Met-oxidation (mass shift 15.99491 Da); DSBU modification fragments: 85.05276 Da and 111.03203 (precision: five ppm MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kessner et al., 2008</xref>] and 10 ppm MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Götze et al., 2015</xref>]); False Discovery Rate cut-off: 5%. Finally, each fragmentation spectra were manually inspected and validated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>EM and image processing</title><p>For negative stain EM, aliquots of sucrose gradient fractions containing the different complexes were applied to glow-discharged (15 s) carbon grids with Cu 300 mesh, washed and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate (1 min). Digital images were acquired with two different microscopes; a Tecnai 12 with a Ceta 16M camera (ThermoFisher Scientific) at a digital magnification of 49000 x and a sampling resolution of 2.04 Å per pixel, and in a Tecnai 12 with a Gatan Camera One View at a digital magnification of 59400 x and a sampling resolution of 2.1 Å per pixel. Image processing was performed using the EM software framework Scipion v1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de la Rosa-Trevín et al., 2016</xref>). Several thousand particles were manually and semi-automatically supervised selected as input for automatic particle picking through the XMIPP3 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrishami et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de la Rosa-Trevín et al., 2013</xref>).

After manually removing low-quality 2D classes, a second round of 2D classification was performed with Relion and XMIPP-CL2D in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sorzano et al., 2010</xref>). Representative 2D averages were used to generate several initial 3D models with the EMAN v2.12 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scheres, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). Extensive rounds of 3D classification were then carried out using Relion 3D-classification due to the heterogeneity of the sample. The most consistent models were used for subsequent 3D classifications. For the final 3D volume refinement, Relion auto-refine or XMIPP3-Projection Matching were used. Resolution was estimated with Fourier shell correlation using 0.143 correlation coefficient criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheres and Chen, 2012</xref>). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> for image processing details.</p><p>For cryo-EM, appropriate fractions of the glutaraldehyde-crosslinked HTL-BAM complex purified by gel filtration were applied to glow-discharged (20 s) Quantifoil grids (R1.2/R1.3, Cu 300 mesh) with an ultrathin carbon layer (2 nm), blotted and plunged into a liquid ethane chamber in a Leica EM GP. Two data sets from the same grid were acquired in a FEI Talos Arctica cryo-electron microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a K2 detector at calibrated magnification of 79000 x. The first data set with 2056 images recorded, had a 1.75 Å/px sample resolution, dose rate of 2.26 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup> and 20 s exposure time fractionated in 40 frames. Defocus values oscillated between −1.5 nm and −3.0 nm. The second data set with 3703 images recorded, had a 0.875 Å/px sample resolution, dose rate of 2.47 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup> and 18 s exposure time fractionated in 40 frames. Defocus values oscillated between – 1.0 nm and −2.2 nm. Particles were picked in the same way as for negative stain, and were binned to a 1.75 Å/px sample resolution before merging to the first data set. Image processing was performed using the EM software framework Scipion v1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de la Rosa-Trevín et al., 2016</xref>) with a similar strategy to the negative stain-EM samples but also using extensive masking procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>All 3D reconstructions were calculated using a home-built workstation (CPU Intel Core i7 7820X, 2x Asus Turbo GTX 1080Ti, 16 Gb RAM DDR4) and partial usage of HPC clusters (Bluecrystal four and Bluecryo) at the University of Bristol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Depletion of SecDF-YajC</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strain jp325 was transformed with empty pTrc99a, or the same plasmid, but cloned with either wild type <italic>secDF</italic> or s<italic>ecD<sub>D519N</sub>F</italic>. Precultures of the strains were prepared in 100 mL 2xYT media supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) arabinose, ampicillin (100 μg/mL, for pTrc selectivity) and kanamycin (50 μg/mL, for jp325 selectivity). The following morning, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended with 50 mL fresh 2xYT (no arabinose). This washing procedure was repeated two more times to remove excess arabinose. Prewarmed (37°C) 1 L 2xYT cultures containing either 0.2% (w/v) arabinose or 0.5% (w/v) glucose were then inoculated with the preculture such that a final OD<sub>600 nm</sub> of 0.05 was achieved. An aliquot was taken every 1.5 hr for 6 hr. Induction of pTrc with IPTG was not necessary as background expression was sufficient to achieve levels of SecD similar to that of JP325 cultured in the presence of arabinose.

The authors show by immunoprecipitation, cross-linking and electron microscopy that both complexes interact with each other. In particular the cross linking / mass spectrometry data allow them to map the interaction between different components that confirm the model based on the EM data.</p><p>They further show that the HTL subcomplex adopts different conformations (open and closed) and that proton translocation via the SecDF subcomponent is important for folding of OmpA.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The western blot in Figure 5D contains several OmpA bands, but it does not indicate which of these bands is precursor OmpA. In addition, there is no control to establish which band is precursor OmpA. In Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, lanes 1-5, I see three bands: a high MW band (band 1), a middle MW band (band 2) and a lower MW band (band 3). To me, it appears that band 1 chases to band 2 and then to band 3, so I would guess that band 1 is precursor, band 2 is ufOmpA and band 3 is fOmpA. However, the arrows to the side of the blot suggest that the authors believe band 1 is ufOmpA. How can they be sure? How do the authors know that the indicated band in Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1D is mature periplasmic ufOmpA and not precursor OmpA? Without this information it is not possible to make any conclusions about the secretion or assembly of OmpA.</p><p>2) The mutant SecD protein that lacks the periplasmic domain does not interact with the BAM machinery. Does this mutant behave similarly to the SecD(D519N) mutant in translocation assays?</p><p>3) The SurA data suggests a function for SecDF in bacteria that lack the BAM machinery, such as Gram-positive bacteria. However, these results are still very preliminary. The author should provide additional experiments demonstrating that the interaction between SecDF and SurA-OmpA is not an interaction artefact. Alternatively, because this interaction is not required for any of the authors' main conclusions, it could be removed from the paper.</p><p>4) More detailed structural characterization would of course be useful in describing the molecular mechanism but the current state convincingly shows the interaction between both translocon complexes.

In addition, there is no control to establish which band is precursor OmpA. In Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, lanes 1-5, I see three bands: a high MW band (band 1), a middle MW band (band 2) and a lower MW band (band 3). To me, it appears that band 1 chases to band 2 and then to band 3, so I would guess that band 1 is precursor, band 2 is ufOmpA and band 3 is fOmpA. However, the arrows to the side of the blot suggest that the authors believe band 1 is ufOmpA. How can they be sure? How do the authors know that the indicated band in Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1D is mature periplasmic ufOmpA and not precursor OmpA? Without this information it is not possible to make any conclusions about the secretion or assembly of OmpA.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, there are a few spurious bands in the Western – quite common in antibodies raised in sheep against <italic>E. coli</italic> antigens. However, we were able to eliminate any misidentification and confusion.</p><p>Our periplasmic samples were prepared carefully, and were devoid of any contaminating cytosolic proOmpA. We prepared the proOmpA (unfolded of course) and ran this as a new control in a new panel (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). Clearly proOmpA runs higher than the unfolded OmpA, and was not present in the samples to confuse the analysis.</p><p>With controls we show the higher (‘band 1’) and lower (‘band 3’) MW bands represent unfolded and folded OmpA, respectively. The middle one (‘band 2’; Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, red asterisk) only appears in samples prepared from cells grown with arabinose. We do not know what it is, but we show it is present in stationary cells grown in permissive conditions, as well as in a wild type strain. Thus, they should not promote the build-up of unfolded OmpA – so band 2 is not representative of an unfolded species of OmpA, and was ignored.</p><p>We clarify these points in the text and include additional data to rule out the interference of proOmpA and ‘band 2’ in the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The mutant SecD protein that lacks the periplasmic domain does not interact with the BAM machinery. Does this mutant behave similarly to the SecD(D519N) mutant in translocation assays?</p></disp-quote><p>We show that the variant SecD(D519N) retains its ability to interact with the Bam complex (Figure 5I), but is incapable of promoting efficient OmpA maturation, which we argue is due to loss of PMF driven conformational changes. While SecDF depletion breaks the interaction, with similar consequences. Presumably the P1 depletion will have the same result, also due to loss of the interaction with the Bam complex. We felt that a whole series of new experiments to prove this obvious conclusion would not have been worthwhile.</p><p>Words to this effect have been added for further clarity in the Discussion, highlighting the similarity of the effects caused by loss of a functional dynamic interplay, and disconnection of the interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The SurA data suggests a function for SecDF in bacteria that lack the BAM machinery, such as Gram-positive bacteria. However, these results are still very preliminary. The author should provide additional experiments demonstrating that the interaction between SecDF and SurA-OmpA is not an interaction artefact. Alternatively, because this interaction is not required for any of the authors' main conclusions, it could be removed from the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Agree. We have removed this from the paper and are in the process of improving and building on this work for another stand-alone paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) More detailed structural characterization would of course be useful in describing the molecular mechanism but the current state convincingly shows the interaction between both translocon complexes. Have the authors tried to further characterize the open and closed states of the HTL complex by cross linking / mass spectrometry (for example before CL addition and glycerol gradient fractionation and after?</p></disp-quote><p>Not yet, but this is certainly where we intend to go. We are in the process of trying to reduce the inherent flexibility of the CL<sup>-</sup>stabilised open translocon (not easy), in order to produce a better specimen for high-resolution electron microscopy. This objective is way beyond the scope of this paper. However, as suggested we intend to further characterise the open-state, including its interaction and dynamic interplay with the BAM complex, for a follow up publication.</p><p>We have added words to this effect in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) SecD was originally identified because mutants have a translocation defect.

Rather than a translocation defect, it would be better to say a secretion defect – which could mean a problem of translocation through the inner membrane OR beyond. The in vivo experiment we show (Figure 5B) highlights a strong growth defect – consistent with an unspecified secretion defect. It would indeed be difficult to pinpoint this in an in vivo experiment. So we set up an in vitro experiment (Figure 5C), which show the secretion problem is not caused by defective translocation through the Sec machinery at the inner membrane, so it must be something downstream of that.</p><p>We have clarified this section of the Results accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
