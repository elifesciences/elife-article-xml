Regulated by genes and messenger molecules, non-specialized cells known as precursor cells, move, divide and adapt to produce the different cells in the adult body.</p><p>However, sometimes already-specialized adult cells can acquire a new role in a process known as lineage reprogramming. Finding ways to artificially induce and control lineage reprogramming could be useful in regenerative medicine. This would allow cells to be reprogrammed to replace those that are lost or damaged. So far, scientists have been unable to develop a clear view of how lineage reprogramming happens naturally.</p><p>Here, Xu et al. identified a cell-conversion event in the developing fruit fly. As the fly larva develops into an adult, a group of cells in the midgut reprogramme to become renal cells – the equivalent to human kidney cells. The experiments revealed that a combination of signals from a cell messenger system important for cell specialization (called Wnt) and the hormone that controls molting in insects, activate a gene called cut, which controls the midgut-to-renal lineage reprogramming.</p><p>Together, Wnt and the hormone ensure that cut is activated only in a small, specific group of midgut precursor cells at a precise time. The reprogrammed cells then move into the excretory organs, the renal tubes, where they give rise to renal cells. Midgut precursor cells in which cut had been experimentally removed, still traveled into the renal tubes. However, they failed to switch their identity and gave rise to midgut cells instead.</p><p>Further examination revealed that both Wnt and the ecdysone hormone are needed to activate the cut gene. This is probably achieved by creating loops in the DNA to bring together the two distantly located key regulatory elements of cut gene expression. If this mechanism can be seen in other contexts it may be possible to adapt it for medical purposes. The ability to reprogramme groups of cells with high specificity could transform medicine. It would make it easier for our bodies to regenerate and repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>in vivo lineage reprogramming</kwd><kwd>temporospatial integration</kwd><kwd>enhancer-promoter looping</kwd><kwd>Wnt/Wingless signaling</kwd><kwd>ecdysone signaling pathway</kwd><kwd>organ-specific progenitor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31471372</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31771629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spatial and temporal cues intersect, likely via enhancer-promoter looping, to turn on a master identity switch that in turn dictates natural lineage reprogramming with high efficiency and temporospatial precision.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Classical regenerative strategies are facing challenges, including difficulties associated with the acquisition, delivery and integration of proper cell types into a complex milieu of tissues. In vivo lineage reprogramming, conversion of a highly specialized cell into the desired cell identity, has therefore emerged as an alternative and promising regenerative strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heinrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jopling et al., 2011</xref>). However, molecular mechanisms underlying in vivo lineage conversion remained obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heinrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jopling et al., 2011</xref>). Due to its high efficiency and temporospatial precision, rare naturally-occurring lineage reprogramming events provide powerful model systems for elucidating the molecular basis of cell plasticity and identity switch.</p><p>Here, we revealed a unique naturally-occurring midgut-to-renal lineage reprogramming event at the onset of <italic>Drosophila</italic> metamorphosis. <italic>Drosophila</italic> excretory system, so-called Malpighian tubules, are two pairs of tubules converge through common ureters onto midgut-hindgut junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denholm and Skaer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singh et al., 2007</xref>). Each pair of renal tubules can be mainly divided into three segments: ureter, lower tubule and upper tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sözen et al., 1997</xref>). The ureter can be further divided into lower and upper regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Renal stem cells (RSCs) were found to be dispersed in the adult ureter and lower tubule regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singh et al., 2007</xref>) but not in the larval renal tubules, raising the question of how the adult RSCs emerge in development. Earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takashima et al., 2013</xref>) and our independent observations found that adult RSCs are likely to be derived from progenitors within the midgut region. Midgut progenitors (MPs) and renal progenitors (RPs), although both express Snail-type transcription factor Escargot (Esg), are distinct populations of precursor cells in terms of lineage composition and functionality: midgut progenitors/stem cells undergo asymmetric cell divisions to self-renew and meanwhile differentiate into hormone/peptide-secreting enteroendocrine (EE) cells and nutrient-absorbing enterocytes (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>); in contrast, renal progenitors undergo asymmetric, self-renewing divisions to give rise to principal cells that mediate organic cation and solute transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singh et al., 2007</xref>). Intriguingly, we observed that, during metamorphosis, a small subset of Esg<sup>+</sup> progenitors appeared to migrate away from the midgut and onto the renal tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>), where they terminally differentiated into new Cut<sup>+</sup>principal cells (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), replacing the old Cut<sup>- </sup>principal cells in the lower ureter region (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takashima et al., 2013</xref>). However, it remains enigmatic when, where and how the pool of Esg<sup>+ </sup>midgut progenitors is selected and converted into renal identity during metamorphosis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33934.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Homeodomain transcription factor Cut is specifically expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult renal stem cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram of two pairs of renal tubules (red) that converge at ureters and connect to the digestive tract at the midgut (green)-hindgut (grey) boundary of an adult fly (<bold>A</bold>).

Cut is an evolutionarily-conserved homeodomain-containing transcription factor that has been shown to regulate various developmental events in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, including sensory organ identity specification and dendritic morphogenesis in peripheral nervous system, dorsal-ventral boundary formation in the fly wings, projection neuron dendritic targeting, as well as patterning and growth during fly airway remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blochlinger et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodmer et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cubelos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grueber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Komiyama and Luo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ludlow et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pitsouli and Perrimon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodríguez-Tornos et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that a steep Wnt/Wingless (Wg) morphogen gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loh et al., 2016</xref>) at the midgut-hindgut boundary intersects with a pulse of the steroid hormone ecdysone at the onset of metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>) to induce <italic>cut</italic> expression in a subset of midgut progenitors and reprogram them into renal progenitors. Mechanistically, the Wg morphogen gradient, through its pathway effector TCF/β-catenin, determines the pool of future renal progenitors, presumably by poising a distal <italic>cut</italic> enhancer for timely activation. On the other hand, the hormone ecdysone-induced BTB-Zinc finger protein Broad determines the timing of lineage conversion by physically interacting with enhancer-bound TCF/β-catenin complex and likely bridging the distal enhancer and promoter region of <italic>cut</italic> through its self-association. Such long-range enhancer-promoter looping could subsequently trigger timely <italic>cut</italic> transcription. Thus, integration of spatial and temporal cues by a master cell identity switch, likely through a chromatin looping mechanism, orchestrates natural lineage reprogramming with temporal and spatial precision.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adult renal stem cells specifically express homeodomain protein Cut</title><p>To identify key regulators governing midgut-to-renal lineage conversion, we carried out a genome-wide RNAi-based screen. We used temperature-sensitive, midgut and renal progenitor-specific <italic>esg</italic>-Gal4, UAS-CD8-GFP, tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup> system to drive RNAi expression, transferred animals from permissive temperature (18°C) to restrictive temperature (29°C) at mid third instar larval stage, approximately 48 hr before the lineage reprogramming event occurs, and analyzed the renal phenotypes at early adult stages. Intriguingly, we found that midgut progenitor-specific knockdown of the transcription factor Cut resulted in lack of the entire lower ureter region (brackets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and appearance of extra Esg<sup>-</sup> diploid cells along the renal tubules (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Such striking renal tubule phenotypes of <italic>cut-RNAi</italic> prompted us to carefully investigate the expression pattern of Cut in adult intestine and renal tubules. Cut has previously been found to be highly expressed in two types of post-mitotic, polyploid cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> digestive-excretive system: the acid-secreting copper cells in the middle midgut region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</xref>) and the fluid-balancing principal cells within renal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, we detected moderate Cut expression in Esg<sup>+</sup> diploid cells along adult renal tubules (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,F’</xref>). Knockdown or overexpression of Cut within adult renal stem cells, by <italic>esg</italic>-Gal4, diminished or elevated the Cut expression levels respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that such Cut expression is specific. In contrast, Cut was not detectable in adult intestinal stem cells or enteroblasts (EBs) in midgut (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,G’</xref>). To further confirm the specific expression of Cut in renal stem cell lineages, we induced wild-type MARCM (mosaic analysis with repressible cell marker) clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Luo, 2001</xref>) at larval stages and analyzed Cut expression pattern of clones at early adult stage. Using the MARCM system, the homozygous clones are produced upon mitotic recombination and are positively labeled by GFP. MARCM clones induced at the lower ureter region (bracket in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) contained both diploid cells expressing moderate levels of Cut (white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,I’</xref>) and polyploid cells expressing high levels of Cut (yellow arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,I’</xref>), indicating that new Cut<sup>+ </sup>principal cells are derived from Cut<sup>+ </sup>renal progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D,I</xref>). By contrast, MARCM clones in the midgut region, composed of diploid ISCs (cyan arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), EBs, EEs and polyploid ECs (pink arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), did not exhibit Cut expression. Therefore, distinct from Cut<sup>- </sup>intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that differentiate into Cut<sup>-</sup> EEs and ECs in the midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), Cut<sup>+ </sup>renal stem cells (RSCs) differentiate into Cut<sup>+ </sup>principal cells (PCs) on the renal tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).

At the onset of metamorphosis (0 hr after puparium formation (APF)), a few clusters of Esg<sup>+</sup> progenitors in closest proximity to the midgut-hindgut boundary started to exhibit Cut expression (white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Compared with experimentally induced reprogramming, natural reprogramming events in physiological settings are relatively rare, yet much more efficient, predictable and robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gettings et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jarriault et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schaub et al., 2015</xref>). The lineage reprogramming process unveiled in our studies represents a unique natural lineage conversion event in that (1) The cell identity switch occurs between organ-specific progenitors, not fully-differentiated cells; (2) the reprogramming event takes place at postembryonic stages, when cells are much less plastic; and (3) the cell identity fully converts from one organ-specific characteristics to another. Thus, this midgut-to-renal lineage conversion event provides a previously unexplored physiological context for elucidating the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying cell plasticity.</p><p>Our results further show that the homeodomain protein Cut is a master cell identity switch controlling the natural conversion of midgut progenitors into renal identity. Cut was originally identified as a binary identity switch between subtypes of neurons in the peripheral nervous systems (PNS) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodmer et al., 1987</xref>). Compelling evidence demonstrated that Cut is both necessary and sufficient in specifying neuronal identities in fly PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blochlinger et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodmer et al., 1987</xref>). Therefore, Cut dictates cell identity switch within or across organ boundary.</p><p>We reason that Cut might be particularly suitable for being a master cell identity switch in diverse biological contexts. Firstly, <italic>cut</italic> is an unusually large gene harboring a long and complex enhancer region spanning more than 150 kb. Such a long enhancer region can be subdivided into small segments responsive to different stimuli or signals in diverse tissues or organs at distinct developmental stages. Therefore, akin to neurons with extensive and complex arbors, the extra-long and segmented enhancer region of <italic>cut</italic> receives and integrates diverse input signals, and drives Cut expression with high temporospatial precision. Secondly, Cut, as a homeobox transcription factor, may intrinsically possess the ability to specify and confer organ or tissue identities, analogous to the classic homeotic genes such as <italic>Antennapedia</italic>, by simultaneously erasing old cell identities and writing new ones.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Precise induction of master identity switch by a ‘poising-and-bridging’ mechanism</title><p>Acquisition and switch of distinct cell identities are precisely and tightly controlled in both space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erclik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Red-Horse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schaub et al., 2015</xref>). Yet the molecular basis underlying the integration of spatial and temporal signals remain poorly understood. We posit that two molecular mechanisms may underlie the intersection of temporal and spatial cues: (1) the spatial cues restrict the expression/activity of the temporal pathway component(s), or vice versa. This strategy has been well exemplified in spatiotemporal control of border cell migration in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jang et al., 2009</xref>) and spatial restriction of neural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2014</xref>); and (2) the temporal and spatial pathways converge to induce the expression of a specific set of target genes. The molecular basis of the latter scenario remains enigmatic.</p><p>Interestingly, our results revealed that the spatial and temporal cues might intersect by an unexpected ‘poising and bridging’ mechanism to dictate the midgut-to-renal progenitor identity switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In this model, the spatial transcription factors (TF) bind a distal enhancer and prime it for a timely response to the temporal cues, whereas the temporal TF acts as a bridging factor that binds to both the distal enhancer and the promoter region and induces enhancer-promoter looping through its self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Meanwhile, the temporal TF is likely to also act as a transcription activator by physically interacting with the spatial TFs. Importantly, since protein dimerization or oligomerization occurs only when the protein concentration rises above certain threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marianayagam et al., 2004</xref>), such a protein-dimerization-based regulatory mechanism is ideal for integrating and translating gradual changes in temporal and spatial signaling strength into a timely and all-or-none biological event such as cell identity switch.</p><p>Although long-range chromatin looping has been found at numerous gene loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghavi-Helm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levine et al., 2014</xref>), the identity and mode of action of looping factors under developmental or physiological settings remain unclear. Our findings shed mechanistic insights into how a temporal factor might bridge the distal enhancer and the promoter of a master gene via protein dimerization in development. In light of recent studies implicating dimerization of TFs, such as CTCF, Yin Yang one and LDB1, in the organization of chromatin architecture either globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Phillips and Corces, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weintraub et al., 2017</xref>) or locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2012</xref>), it is conceivable that TF dimerization or multimerization might represent a precise and prevailing mechanism establishing chromatin loops in space and time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Xu and colleagues make an important contribution on a form of cell identity reprogramming that depends on the intersection of spatial information dictated by Wg signaling and a temporal cue downstream of ecdysone signaling during metamorphosis. Intersection of these cues leads to induction of the Cut homeodomain transcription factor and conversion of midgut progenitors to a renal progenitor identity. In addition to the insight into a mechanism of temporospatial control of cell identity specification, insights gained here regarding factors that control transcription factor expression may be broadly applicable to tissue reprogramming and stem cell biology.</p><p>Through immunofluorescence, the authors describe the molecular regulation of, and the role of, the cut gene during midgut to renal lineage conversion in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Cut and related genes had already been implicated in kidney development. Spatiotemporal regulation of the cut gene is now described here, where during metamorphosis some Esg<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells migrate from the midgut to the renal tubules where they express Cut to give rise to renal progenitor cells.</p><p>Immunofluorescent analyses found that Cut is not necessary for midgut to renal tubule cell migration. The loss of Cut was however lethal to the majority of flies. Escaper flies lacked the lower ureter region and gave rise to intestinal Pros+ Cut- EE cells in the renal tubules. These anomalies suggest that Cut modulates a key renal developmental step by acting as a master identity switch. Cut expression in APF cells near the midgut-hindgut boundary is minimally regulated by Wg and ecdysone signalling. Further experiments identify a novel enhancer element and a promoter-enhancer looping model is proposed.</p><p>The role of Cut throughout fly development is extensively shown. This part of the proposed model is supported by extensive images of developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> and makes use of robust genetic and cellular tools. These results alone may warrant publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Specific important comments that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The data to support the conclusion in the paper are strong, but an exception is the data to support a Broad-dependent promoter-enhancer looping mechanism. Although perfectly plausible (and even likely), the looping model is not well supported by the experiments. In order to support this idea to the extent that the authors claim, we think additional experiments would be required, such as a more direct experimental measure of the ability of Broad to loop DNA to pin down this proposed mechanism. If these experiments are not speedily feasible the conclusion on this looping mechanism should be alluded to in the Discussion section but removed from the Title and not presented in the text as bona fide.</p><p>2) Other experiments (such as the RNAi screen, and the identification of a new enhancer element) are short on detail and this part should be addressed.</p><p>3) Another substantial difficulty was that the inferences regarding developmental transitions that occur at the onset of metamorphosis. These were often difficult to follow and not written in a way that is easily grasped by non-experts. The same is true for the G-TRACE results. The authors run through these data fairly rapidly without making interim conclusions or putting their observations into context. There is a lot for the reader to keep track of cell name, cell position in the different organs, location of different organs and organ parts, ploidy, cut expression status, Esg status, developmental stage, and potentially unfamiliar acronyms build up quickly.

We agree with the reviewers that more direct evidence supporting the Broad-dependent-looping model, such as a 3C (chromatin confirmation capture) experiment using FACS-purified future renal progenitors at P0 stage, would be ideal. This is indeed some experiment that we have been thinking about as well. However, due to the small number of future renal progenitors in each fly pupal midgut, it would be too time-consuming and technically challenging to complete such 3C experiment in a timely manner. Therefore, we decided to follow reviewers’ insightful suggestions and tone down the language on this looping mechanism. The manuscript has been modified as following: (1) remove “via chromatin looping” from the title; (2) move the working model of cut enhancer-promoter looping to the Discussion section; (3) tone down our statements on this looping model throughout the text. As an example, “Our results therefore led us to propose an unexpected poising-and-bridging mechanism whereby spatial and temporal cues intersect via chromatin looping to turn on a master transcription factor and dictate efficient and precise lineage reprogramming” has been changed to “Our results therefore led us to propose an unexpected poising-and-bridging mechanism whereby spatial and temporal cues intersect, likely via chromatin looping, to turn on a master transcription factor and dictate efficient and precise lineage reprogramming” (Abstract).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Other experiments (such as the RNAi screen, and the identification of a new enhancer element) are short on detail and this part should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important point. For the RNAi screen, we have now added one paragraph describing the strategy and detailed procedure of this genome-wide RNAi-based screen (subsection “Adult renal stem cells specifically express homeodomain protein Cut”), as well as a supplemental figure panel (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) demonstrating the cut-RNAi-induced renal tubule phenotype that we initially observed while carrying out the screen.</p><p>As for the identification of the new cut enhancer element, we have now added a few sentences describing how the new enhancer was found: “Out of 22 cut enhancer-Gal4 driver lines from the Janelia Gal4 collection, in which Gal4 is expressed under the control of cut enhancer fragments (Pfeiffer et al., 2008) (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A), we identified one line, R35B08-Gal4, which drove UAS-CD8-RFP expression specifically in future RPs at metamorphosis (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B)”. We also added one new figure panel (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B) demonstrating that CD8-RFP driven by this newly-identified cut enhancer-Gal4 colocalizes with endogenous Cut in future renal progenitors at the onset of metamorphosis.</p><p>Furthermore, to provide more detailed information regarding how we decided the size and sequence of the EMSA probes, we have now added the consensus TCF-binding site, helper site and Br-Z2-binding site to the figure legend of Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another substantial difficulty was that the inferences regarding developmental transitions that occur at the onset of metamorphosis.

Since fly renal tubule is not a widely-used model system, its anatomy, cell composition and dynamic changes throughout developmental stages could cause potential difficulties for general readers. Therefore, to help increase the appeal of our manuscript to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, we have now carefully labelled the organ parts, such as midgut, hindgut, lower ureter, upper ureter and lower tubule, in most panels of main Figure 1 and 2.</p><p>As for the G-TRACE experiment, we have now added two new figure panels to show the genetic schema (Figure 3A) and experimental timeline (Figure 3B) of this lineage-tracing experiment. Furthermore, we included detailed description of the lineage-tracing strategy “We used temperature-sensitive esg-Gal4, UAS-CD8-GFP, tub-Gal80ts system to drive FLP (flippase) expression, transferred animals from permissive temperature (18°C) to restrictive temperature (29°C) at late 3rd instar larval stage and analyzed the renal phenotypes at early adult stages (Figure 3A,B). Upon esg-Gal4-driven expression of FLP recombinase, a transcriptional stop cassette flanked by FRT sites is excised, resulting in lacZ expression in Esg<sup>+</sup> progenitors and all their subsequent daughter cells (lineage expression; Figure 3A). Meanwhile, GFP reveals the real-time expression of esg-Gal4 (Figure 3A)” (subsection “RPs displayed MP characteristics upon Cut depletion”). Furthermore, in light of reviewers’ comments, we have now added an interim conclusion “These results strongly suggested that, upon cut depletion, Esg<sup>+</sup> progenitors migrate normally onto the renal tubules, yet fail to switch into renal identity and differentiate into midgut cells along renal tubules” (subsection “RPs displayed MP characteristics upon Cut depletion”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
