X-ray crystallography is a technique that is commonly used to determine these structures and involves directing a beam of X-rays at a crystal that was grown from the macromolecule of interest. The macromolecules in the crystal scatter the X-rays to produce a diffraction pattern, and the crystal is rotated to provide further diffraction images. It is then possible to work backwards from these images and elucidate the structure of the macromolecule in three dimensions.</p><p>X-ray beams are powerful enough to damage crystals, and scientists are developing new approaches to overcome this problem. One recent development uses ‘X-ray free electron lasers’ to circumvent the damage caused to crystals. However, early applications of this approach required many crystals and thousands to millions of diffraction patterns to be collected—largely because methods to process the diffraction data were far from optimal.</p><p>Uervirojnangkoorn et al. have now developed a new data-processing procedure that is specifically designed for diffraction data obtained using X-ray free electron lasers. This method was applied to diffraction data collected from crystals of three different macromolecules (which in this case were three different proteins). For all three, the new method required many fewer diffraction images to determine the structure, and in one case revealed more details about the structure than the existing methods.</p><p>This new method is now expected to allow a wider range of macromolecules to be studied using crystallography with X-ray free electron lasers, including cases where very few crystals are available.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05421.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05421.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>free electron laser</kwd><kwd>data processing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103393</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>William I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM095887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brewster</surname><given-names>Aaron S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sauter</surname><given-names>Nicholas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>William I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy (Department of Energy)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brewster</surname><given-names>Aaron S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sauter</surname><given-names>Nicholas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM102520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brewster</surname><given-names>Aaron S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sauter</surname><given-names>Nicholas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Post-refinement methods enable the use of X-ray free electron lasers for biological crystallography of systems in which sample quantity is a limitation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Radiation damage often limits the resolution and accuracy of macromolecular crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zeldin et al., 2013</xref>). Femtosecond X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses enable the possibility of visualizing molecular structures before the onset of radiation damage, and allow the dynamics of chemical processes to be captured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Solem, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Neutze et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, from the first XFEL operation at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) in 2009, there has been considerable effort dedicated to the development of methods to utilize this rapid succession of bright pulses for macromolecular crystallography, with the aim of obtaining damage-free, chemically accurate structures. Most of the structures reported from XFELs to date use a liquid jet to inject small crystals into the beam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DePonte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sierra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Weierstall et al., 2014</xref>), but diffraction data have also been measured from crystals placed in the beam with a standard goniometer setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirata et al., 2014</xref>). In both cases, the illuminated volume diffracts before suffering damage by a single XFEL pulse. Because the crystal is effectively stationary during the 10–50 fs exposure, ‘still’ diffraction patterns are obtained, in contrast to standard diffraction data collection where the sample is rotated through a small angle during the exposure.</p><p>Extracting accurate Bragg peak intensities from XFEL diffraction data is a substantial challenge. An XFEL data set comprises ‘still’ diffraction patterns generally containing only partially recorded reflections, typically from randomly oriented crystals. The full intensity then has to be estimated from the observed partial intensity observations. Most XFEL diffraction data processing approaches reported to date have approximated the full intensity by the so-called “Monte Carlo” method, in which thousands of partial intensity observations of a given reflection are summed and normalized by the number of observations, which assumes that these observations sample the full 3D Bragg volume. Because a single diffraction image—in which each observed reflection samples only part of each reflection intensity–contains much less information than a small continuous wedge of diffraction data (as used in conventional crystallography), this method requires a very large number of crystals to ensure convergence of the averaged partial reflection intensities to the full intensity value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kirian et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, shot-to-shot differences in pulse intensity and energy spectrum that arise from the self-amplified stimulated emission (SASE) process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kondratenko and Saldin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonifacio et al., 1984</xref>), along with differences in illuminated crystal volume, mosaicity, and unit-cell dimensions, contribute to intensity variation of the equivalent reflections observed on different images. These differences are assumed to be averaged out by the Monte Carlo method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hattne et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, accurate determination of these parameters for each diffraction image should, in principle, provide more accurate integrated intensities, and converge with fewer measurements. Furthermore, it is desirable to assemble a data set from as few diffraction images as possible, since the potential of XFELs has been limited by the very large amounts of sample required for the Monte Carlo method, compounded by severe limitations in the availability of beamtime.</p><p>In the 1970's, the Harrison and Rossmann groups developed ‘post-refinement’ methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rossmann et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Winkler et al., 1979</xref>), in which the parameters that determine the location and volume of the Bragg peaks are ‘post’-refined against a reference set of fully recorded reflections following initial indexing and integration of rotation data. Accurate estimation of these parameters, including the unit-cell lengths and angles, crystal orientation, mosaic spread, and beam divergence enables accurate calculation of what fraction of the reflection intensity was recorded on the image, i.e., its ‘partiality’, which is then used to correct the measurement to its fully recorded equivalent. Applied to virus crystals, for which only a few images can typically be collected before radiation damage becomes significant, post-refinement made it possible to obtain high-quality diffraction data sets collected from many crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rossmann et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Winkler et al., 1979</xref>).</p><p>The implementation of post-refinement for XFEL diffraction data poses unique challenges. Firstly, since XFEL diffraction data generally do not contain fully recorded reflections, the initial scaling and merging of images is difficult. Secondly, since the XFEL diffraction images are stills rather than rotation data, different approaches are required for the correction of measurements to determine the full spot equivalent. Other schemes for implementing post-refinement of XFEL diffraction data have been described previously, but thus far they have been only applied to simulated XFEL data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">White, 2014</xref>), and to pseudo-still images collected using monochromatic synchrotron radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kabsch, 2014</xref>).</p><p>We have developed a new post-refinement procedure specifically designed for diffraction data from still images collected from crystals in random orientations. We implemented our method in a new computer program, <italic>prime</italic> (<bold>p</bold>ost-<bold>r</bold>ef<bold>i</bold>nement and <bold>me</bold>rging), that post-refines the parameters needed for calculating the partiality of reflections recorded on each still image. We describe here our method and demonstrate that post-refinement greatly improves the quality of the diffraction data from XFEL diffraction experiments with crystals of three different proteins. We show that our post-refinement procedure allows complete data sets to be extracted from a much smaller number of diffraction images than that necessary when using the Monte Carlo method. Thus, this development will help make XFEL crystallography accessible to many challenging problems in biology, including those for which sample quantity is a major limiting factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Notation</title><p>Units are arbitrary unless specified in parenthesis.</p><p><italic>I</italic><sub><italic>obs</italic></sub>, observed intensity.</p><p><italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ref</italic></sub>, reference intensity.</p><p><italic>w</italic>, weighting term (inverse variance of the observed intensity).</p><p><italic>G</italic>, function of linear scale (<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) and resolution-dependent (<italic>B</italic>) factors that scales the different diffraction images to the reference set.</p><p><italic>Eoc</italic>, Ewald-offset correction function.</p><p><italic>r</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>, offset reciprocal-space distance from the center of the reflection to the Ewald sphere (Å<sup>−1</sup>).</p><p><italic>r</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, radius of the disc of intersection between the reciprocal lattice point and the Ewald sphere (Å<sup>−1</sup>).</p><p><italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, radius of the reciprocal lattice point (Å<sup>−1</sup>).</p><p><italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>, crystal rotation angles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; °).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05421.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Geometry of the diffraction experiment and calculation of the Ewald-offset distance, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A reciprocal lattice point intersects the Ewald sphere.

One can refine all parameters together, or selectively refine groups of parameters iteratively, starting from (1) a linear scale factor and a <italic>B</italic>-factor, (2) crystal orientations, (3) crystal mosaicity, beam divergence, and spectral dispersion, and (4) unit-cell dimensions. Space-group-specific constraints are used to limit the number of free parameters for the unit-cell refinement. A particular microcycle is completed when the target functions converge or when a specified number of iterations is reached; the program then generates the new reference intensity set to replace the current reference set for the next macrocycle. Finally, the program exits and outputs the latest merged reflection set either when the macrocycles converge or when a user-specified maximum number of cycles has been reached.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Preparation of the observed intensities</title><p>The starting point for our post-refinement method is a set of indexed and integrated partial intensities, along with their estimated errors, obtained from still images. For this study, diffraction data and their estimated errors were obtained from the <italic>cctbx.xfel</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sauter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hattne et al., 2014</xref>), although in principle integrated diffraction data from any other program can be used. Observed intensities on the diffraction image were classified as ‘spots’ by the program Spotfinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), which identifies Bragg spots by considering connected pixels with area and signal height greater than user-defined thresholds. By trial and error, we accepted reflections larger than 25 pixels with individual-pixel intensity more than 5 σ over background for myoglobin and hydrogenase (collected on a Rayonix MX325HE detector with pixel size of 0.08 mm and beam diameter [FWHM] of 50 μm). For thermolysin (collected on a Cornell-SLAC pixel array detector with pixel size of 0.1 mm and beam size of 2.25 μm<sup>2</sup>), where reflections are generally smaller, these values were 1 pixel and 5 σ. A full list of parameters is available on the <italic>cctbx.xfel</italic> wiki (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cci.lbl.gov/xfel">http://cci.lbl.gov/xfel</ext-link>). Separate resolution cutoffs for each image were applied by <italic>cctbx.xfel</italic>, at resolutions where the average <italic>I</italic>/<italic>σ</italic>(<italic>I</italic>) fell below 0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hattne et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Prior to post-refinement, the experimentally observed partial intensities need to be corrected by a polarization factor. The primary XFEL beam at LCLS is strongly polarized in the horizontal plane, and we calculate the correction factor as a function of the Bragg angle (<italic>θ</italic>) and the angle <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> between the sample reflection and the laboratory horizontal planes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kahn et al., 1982</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). For a stationary crystal and a monochromatic beam, a Lorentz factor correction is not applicable; the spectral dispersion of the SASE beam (δE/E ∼ 3 × 10<sup>−3</sup> for the data sets studied here) is accounted for by the γ<sub>e</sub> term (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Generating the initial reference set and initial parameters</title><p>An essential step to initiate post-refinement is the generation of the initial reference set <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ref</italic></sub> <italic>(initial).</italic> This reference set has to be estimated from the available unmerged and unscaled partial reflection intensities after application of the polarization correction. For the results presented here, linear scale factors for each diffraction image were chosen to make the mean intensities of each diffraction image equal. Since this procedure can be affected by outliers in the observed intensities, we select a subset of reflections with user-specified resolution range and signal-to-noise ratio (<italic>I/σ(I))</italic> cutoffs. From this selection, we calculate the mean intensity on each diffraction image and then scale each image to make the mean intensity of all images equal. We correct the scaled observed reflections to their Ewald-offset corrected equivalents using the starting parameters, and then merge the observations, taking into account the experimental <italic>σ(I</italic><sub><italic>obs</italic></sub><italic>)</italic>, to generate the initial reference set.</p><p>The initial values for crystal orientation, unit-cell dimensions, crystal-to-detector distance, and spot position on the detector were obtained from the refinement of these parameters by <italic>cctbx.xfel</italic>. The photon energy was that provided by the LCLS endstation system and is not refined. Initial values for the parameters of the reflection width model are described in the ‘Materials and methods’ section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Definition and comparison of data processing schemes</title><p>In order to separately assess the effects of scaling, the Ewald offset correction (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>), and post-refinement, we refer to three alternative schemes for processing the diffraction data sets: (1) ‘Averaged merged’, in which intensities were generated by averaging all observed partial intensities from equivalent reflections without Ewald-offset correction and scaling; (2) ‘Mean-intensity partiality corrected’, in which intensities were generated by scaling the reflections to the mean intensity and also applying the Ewald-offset correction determined from the initial parameters obtained from the indexing and integration program, followed by merging; and (3) ‘Post-refined’, in which intensities were from the final set of scaled and merged full reflections after the convergence of post-refinement. We note that although the ‘averaged merged’ process is similar to the original Monte Carlo method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kirian et al., 2010</xref>), the integrated, unmerged partial intensities used in our tests were obtained from the program <italic>cctbx.xfel</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hattne et al., 2014</xref>), which also refines various parameters on an image-by-image basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sauter et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Quality assessment of post-refined data</title><p>We tested our post-refinement method on experimental XFEL diffraction data sets from three different crystallized proteins of known structure: myoglobin, hydrogenase, and thermolysin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

If a full data set can be collected from a single crystal without a prohibitive level of radiation damage, diffraction data processing is a well-established and reliable process. In contrast, processing of XFEL diffraction data, which are collected from crystals in random orientations as ‘still’ diffraction images, requires new methods and implementations such as those described here. Improved data collection and processing methods, particularly those that can significantly reduce the amount of sample needed to assemble a complete and accurate diffraction data set, are important for making XFELs useful for certain challenging investigations in structural biology.</p><p>We developed a post-refinement method for still diffraction images, such as those obtained at XFELs, and implemented it in new computer program, <italic>prime</italic>, that applies a least-squares minimization method to refine parameters as defined in our partiality model. Other post-refinement methods for XFEL diffraction data have been described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kabsch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">White, 2014</xref>), but our implementation differs from these reports. Kabsch uses a partiality model in which an Ewald offset correction is defined as a Gaussian function of angular distance from the Ewald sphere. White used the intersecting volume between the reflection and the limiting-energy Ewald spheres defined by the energy spectrum for the partiality calculation, and calculates the initial reference data set by averaging all observations without scaling. Neither report describes an application to experimental XFEL diffraction data, so we cannot compare these methods to the results presented here.</p><p>We have demonstrated here that our implementation of post-refinement substantially improves the quality of the diffraction data from three different XFEL experiments. Moreover, the resulting structures can be refined to significantly lower <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>free</italic></sub> and <italic>R</italic> values, with electron density maps that reveal novel features more clearly, than those using non-post-refined XFEL data sets. A key feature of our method is that the parameters that define the diffracted spot are iteratively refined against the reference set. This approach is superior to methods that only consider each diffraction image individually. Moreover, our post-refinement procedure allows accurate diffraction data sets to be extracted from a much smaller number of images (average number of observations) than that necessary without post-refinement. Thus, this development will make XFEL crystallography accessible to many challenging problems in biology for which sample quantity is a major limiting factor.</p><p>At present, it is difficult to assess the relative quality of post-refined XFEL data studied here with conventional rotation data measured at a synchrotron. The comparison of myoglobin omit maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) suggests that the SR data are perhaps somewhat better, but more systematic studies will be needed to understand the relative merits of the different data sets. We suspect that rotation data would be better due to the ability to directly measure full reflections (at least by summation of partials) without modeling partiality, which is still a relatively crude process (see below). However, a comparison between still data sets measured at a synchrotron and an XFEL is needed to deconvolute the effect of rotation vs other differences between these sources.</p><p>Our formulation of post-refinement employs the simplifying assumption that reflections are spherical volumes. More sophisticated models consider crystal mosaicity to have three components, each with a distinct effect on the reciprocal lattice point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Juers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nave, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2014</xref>). First, the domain size (the average size of the coherently scattering mosaic blocks) produces reciprocal lattice points of constant, finite size: small domains produce large-sized spots, while large domains produce small spots, as there is an inverse (Fourier) relation between spot size and domain size. Second, unit-cell variation among domains produces reflections that are spheres whose radii increase with distance from the origin. <italic>In cctbx.xfel</italic>, mosaicity (modeled as isotropic parameter) and effective domain size are taken into account when predicting which reflections are in diffracting position prior to integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sauter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sauter, 2015</xref>). Third, orientational spread among mosaic domains produces spots shaped like spherical caps. Each cap subtends a solid angle that depends on the magnitude of the spread. In addition, anisotropy in crystal mosaicity is not considered; this would require refining separate parameters along each lattice direction. Finally, the rugged energy spectrum that results from the SASE process of the XFEL is not yet considered in our current model. These issues will require future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Partiality model</title><p>The observed intensity <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub><italic>(i)</italic> for observation <italic>i</italic> of Miller index <bold><italic>h</italic></bold> is a thin slice through a three-dimensional reflection.

ensure atomic model refinements against the various diffraction data sets were as comparable as possible, we used a standard semi-automated solution and refinement protocol. First, we performed molecular replacement phasing with known structures as search models (PDB ID 3U3E for myoglobin, 3C8Y for hydrogenase, and 2TLI for thermolysin) with all heteroatoms, water molecules, and ligands removed. Molecular replacement was carried out with Phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) using default settings, with r.m.s.d. set to 0.8. The resulting solutions were then refined using <italic>phenix.refine</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2012</xref>) in two cycles. In the first cycle, we carried out rigid body refinement, positional (xyz) refinement with automatic correction of Asn, Gln and His sidechain orientations, and atomic displacement parameter (ADP) refinement. We then used the difference density maps for missing ligands and heteroatoms obtained from this cycle to calculate real-space correlation coefficients using <italic>phenix.get_cc_mtz_pdb</italic> from the <italic>PHENIX</italic> software suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) for myoglobin and thermolysin and the program ‘Map Correlation’ from the CCP4 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Winn et al., 2011</xref>) for hydrogenase. These omit difference density maps are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>. In the second cycle, all ligands and heteroatoms were placed in the difference density maps and combined with the refined structure from the first cycle using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). The second cycle employed positional and ADP refinement with target weights optimization and water update was carried out with these complete models. The structures were validated by MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Final refinement statistics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl3 tbl4">Tables 2, 3, 4</xref>) were analyzed with <italic>phenix.polygon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Urzhumtseva et al., 2009</xref>) and found to be within acceptable range for other structures at similar resolutions. For the thermolysin structure obtained from anomalous diffraction data (processed keeping Friedel pairs separate), only one cycle of atomic model refinement was carried out. All figures were made in PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.4 Schrödinger, LLC.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Computer program</title><p>The computer program, <italic>prime</italic>, is implemented as a part of the <italic>cctbx</italic> computational crystallography toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grosse-Kunstleve et al., 2002</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Stephen Harrison, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript represents a substantial advance in the processing of XFEL diffraction data, through the introduction of postrefinement methods. Although it provides no direct comparison with other procedures (from Kabsch or White), data for the three test cases considered show considerably improved statistics. Moreover, the total number of frames required to compile a data set is very much smaller than with the so-called “Monte Carlo” method. The manuscript is well written and thorough (especially in the provision of equations in the Methods section). A possible, but forgivable, omission was the inclusion of a more challenging test case that could demonstrate a genuine increase in the effective resolution of a dataset from the new procedures.</p><p>The reviewers had the following modest concerns, questions and requests:</p><p>A. Theory:1) Sphere model for <italic>Eoc</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>. The basic idea of postrefinement is that the ratio of the intensity of a partially recorded reflection to its value in a properly corrected and scaled reference data set is a very sensitive measure of the orientation and unit-cell parameters of the crystal and of diffracting-range parameters such as mosaic spread, energy dispersion, and range of unit-cell parameters within the diffracting volume. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equations (1)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">(2)</xref> summarize the application to XFEL stills, with <italic>Eoc</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> as the critical function requiring definition and evaluation. The authors choose a sphere model for <italic>Eoc</italic>, which is reasonable for cases in which the diffracting range is dominated by energy dispersion and unit-cell variation. For a mosaic crystal with no variation in unit cell across the diffracting volume and mosaicity higher than the energy dispersion, the reciprocal-space shape of the diffraction spot will not be spherical; it will intersect the Ewald sphere as an arc, since the Bragg angle and hence the distance of any component of the spot from the origin of reciprocal space will be (ex hypothesi) invariant, while the range of azimuthal angles of the spot on the detector will depend on the mosaic spread (assumed to be non-zero). With cryopreserved crystals, the assumption that a combination of unit-cell variation and energy dispersion dominates is almost certainly a good one, but it may not hold for tiny crystals at ambient temperature in an injected beam. Anisotropy of some of the parameters may also make other shapes a better fit. The approach in the paper is, of course, generalizable to other shapes (with much “hairier” expressions for <italic>Eoc</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> and its derivatives). In any case, the authors should discuss the assumptions that go into the sphere approximation.</p><p>2) Lorentz factor. A clear discussion of Lorentz factor is important, to give the paper full archival value as a complete treatment of the intensity correction problem. Formally, there is no Lorentz factor for a still. This statement is easy to prove using the “sinc” formula given in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> of the cited article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kirian et al. (2010)</xref>. If two different relps lie precisely on the Ewald sphere, then the value of the sinc function is simply equal to the square of the number of unit cells, regardless of resolution or any other geometric factor. All that remains is the polarization (which is not a Lorentz factor) and the incident intensity, which is the same for every spot. The only terms that remain hkl-dependent are the structure factor F, and the solid angle subtended by a pixel. The latter has some semblance to a Lorentz factor, but disappears upon pixel integration if the detector is corrected to be spherical. The spreading out of the spot due to mosaic spread and spectral dispersion in reciprocal space could be considered a Lorentz factor, but in the context of the present work, this should be part of the “partiality”.</p><p>B. Questions:</p><p>1) In the test cases, the data quality for the subset of images (e.g. 2,000 for thermolysin) is clearly lower than using the entire dataset. Is there any indication of convergence when considering data quality metrics vs the number of images included, or does inclusion of all images always give the best data?</p><p>2) The Discussion section is relatively brief. Even with the improved processing, the data quality falls significantly short of what would be expected for conventional SR rotation data collection. Does the analysis provide any pointers to the remaining major sources of error?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (myoglobin data): For the high resolution terms, post-refinement appears to make the data worse as judged by the <italic>R</italic> and <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>free</italic></sub> metrics. Why?</p><p>4) There are many fewer spots per image for thermolysin than for the other two datasets. What is the definition of a “spot” in this context?</p><p>5) It is not clear if a separate resolution limit is applied to each image during the final merging step. Can this be clarified?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>: What is the second peak that is clearly visible when all images are used?

Why?</p><p>C. Request:</p><p>The paper should have a complete list of all the parameters and symbols in the equations and their definitions (as Acta Cryst may still do and certainly used to do). Many of the parameters (such as theta(x) and theta(y)) were defined only in the figures, and it might indeed clutter the text to define each of them immediately after their first appearance in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">equation (1)</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05421.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>A.

We had tried to follow the discussion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kabsch (2014)</xref> on this point, but now we explicitly note that there is no Lorentz correction for a still, and have removed the discussion of the Kabsch paper on this topic.</p><p><italic>B.

Is there any indication of convergence when considering data quality metrics vs the number of images included, or does inclusion of all images always give the best data</italic>?</p><p>In the last section of Results we now describe a comparison of thermolysin diffraction data sets merged using 2,000-12,000 images. To avoid potential differences arising from different levels of completeness, which would confound this analysis, we truncated the diffraction data at 2.6 Å to insure that each of these sets was 100% complete. Comparison of <italic>CC</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub> values, electron density maps and model <italic>R</italic> values shows that there is little improvement beyond 8,000 images.</p><p><italic>2) The Discussion section is relatively brief. Even with the improved processing, the data quality falls significantly short of what would be expected for conventional SR rotation data collection. Does the analysis provide any pointers to the remaining major sources of error</italic>?</p><p>This is an excellent question, but we do not feel that we can directly compare SR rotation and XFEL data at this point. The one comparison that we present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) suggests that the SR data are at least somewhat better, but it is difficult to quantify. It is likely that rotation data would be better due to the ability to directly measure full reflections (at least by summation of partials) without modeling partiality, which is still a relatively crude process. However, we believe that a comparison between still diffraction data sets collected at SR and XFELs is needed to deconvolute the effect of rotation vs. other differences between SR and XFEL sources. This will be a subject of future investigation. We have added a brief discussion of these issues to the new Discussion.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>(myoglobin data): For the high resolution terms, post-refinement appears to make the data worse as judged by the</italic> R <italic>and</italic> R<sub>free</sub> <italic>metrics. Why</italic>?</p><p>We assume that the question refers to the 100 image subset; the full post-refined 757 image set has lower or comparable <italic>R</italic> values in all bins. The 100-image set is the minimum number of images required for successful molecular replacement and an interpretable omit map (the heme group). While the <italic>R</italic> and <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>free</italic></sub> values of the 757-image set (97.7% completeness) improved in all resolution shells, they improved only to approximately 1.7 Å, where the completeness drops below 90%. We observed that completeness has an impact on post-refinement procedure and the post-refined data sets. We now note this effect in the last section of Results, “Effect of completeness”.</p><p><italic>4) There are many fewer spots per image for thermolysin than for the other two datasets.

We suggest that the second anomalous peak may indicate a second zinc ion: indeed, a previous thermolysin structure (PDB ID: 1LND; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holland et al., 1995</xref>) has two zinc ions bound to the same active site, and their locations match with the anomalous peaks observed in the post-refined maps of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. We re-refined the thermolysin structure with two zinc ions (the refined <italic>B</italic>-factors for the first zinc ion with occupancy 1.0 and the second zinc ion with occupancy 0.5 are 24.4 and 30.9, respectively). Interestingly, adding the second zinc ion resulted in an improvement of difference density of the dipeptide near the zinc sites (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> for updated refinement statistics). Thus, in addition to the missing dipeptide in the original structure (PDB ID: 4OW3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hattne et al., 2014</xref>), this adds another feature that was not clearly visible before the post-refinement procedures.</p><p><italic>7)</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3"><italic>Table 3</italic></xref><italic>: The hydrogenase data were collected with a seeded beam, and yet the term representing the energy dispersion γe is larger than that for thermolysin and almost as large as for the myoglobin data.

However, after conferring with the experimental team that collected the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>), we discovered that in fact the data were collected with the usual SASE spectrum; there was a hardware problem that prevented recording the energy spectrum per frame.
