ROS architecture is characterized by a stack of identically shaped and tightly packed membrane disks loaded with the visual receptor rhodopsin. A wide range of genetic aberrations have been reported to compromise ROS ultrastructure, impairing photoreceptor viability and function. Yet, the structural basis giving rise to the remarkably precise arrangement of ROS membrane stacks and the molecular mechanisms underlying genetically inherited diseases remain elusive. Here, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) performed on native ROS at molecular resolution provides insights into key structural determinants of ROS membrane architecture. Our data confirm the existence of two previously observed molecular connectors/spacers which likely contribute to the nanometer-scale precise stacking of the ROS disks. We further provide evidence that the extreme radius of curvature at the disk rims is enforced by a continuous supramolecular assembly composed of peripherin-2 (PRPH2) and rod outer segment membrane protein 1 (ROM1) oligomers. We suggest that together these molecular assemblies constitute the structural basis of the highly specialized ROS functional architecture. Our Cryo-ET data provide novel quantitative and structural information on the molecular architecture in ROS and substantiate previous results on proposed mechanisms underlying pathologies of certain PRPH2 mutations leading to blindness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>photoreceptor</kwd><kwd>rod outer segment</kwd><kwd>disk rim</kwd><kwd>protein scaffold</kwd><kwd>membrane curvature</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY030873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palczewski</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY030912</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palczewski</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems Magdeburg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pöge</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-electron tomography of close-to-native rod outer segments resolves connectors between disks and a scaffold at the disk rim enforcing the high membrane curvature of the unique long-range organization in these rhodopsin-rich light-sensitive subcellular organelles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rod photoreceptor cells are remarkably sensitive detectors for light. Phototransduction, the biochemical chain reaction that converts a light stimulus into a neuronal signal, is initiated when Rhodopsin (Rho) absorbs a single photon. Rho is a transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor that resides in a specialized cellular compartment in rods, the rod outer segment (ROS), which contains a stack of hundreds of identically shaped and precisely spaced membrane disks. Each disk is composed of two parallel membranes connected at their periphery by a hairpin-like disk rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sjostrand, 1953</xref>). Dependent on the species, the disk membranes are only interrupted by one or more clefts, so-called disk incisures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Makino et al., 2012</xref>). Approximately 50% of the ROS disk membrane area is occupied by Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palczewski, 2006</xref>). The light sensitivity of rods relies on the elaborate ROS membrane architecture, which seemingly evolved to maximize the surface area of the membranes, thereby maximizing the amount of Rho for photon capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pugh and Lamb, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The ultrastructure of ROS was described decades ago based on conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sjostrand, 1953</xref>; ). The ROS disk stacks exhibit two key structural features: (i) the close packing of adjacent disks and (ii) the high curvature of the disk rims. The molecular determinants that give rise to this elaborate structural organization, however, remained largely elusive due to limitations in maintaining fine structural detail in preparations that require chemical fixation, dehydration, and heavy metal staining. Previous studies suggested that disk stacking may be assisted by the continuity of neighboring disk membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robertson, 1965</xref>), while others suggested the existence of molecular connectors between adjacent disks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corless and Schneider, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roof and Heuser, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Usukura and Yamada, 1981</xref>), and between disk rims and the plasma membrane (PM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nickell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roof and Heuser, 1982</xref>). Furthermore, EM studies of fixed and stained ROS identified a molecular assembly at disk rims referred to as the ‘terminal loop complex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corless et al., 1987</xref>), which was proposed to enforce high membrane curvature. This complex is composed of a crescentic density located along the disk perimeter inside the disk lumen, which was observed to be linked by a transmembrane component to densities that connect neighboring disk rims. The ‘terminal loop complex’ appeared to form a 2D lattice. Yet, the molecular building blocks of the complex could not be identified with contemporary imaging technology. Mammalian ROS contain three abundant membrane proteins which localize exclusively to the disk rim: the rod cell-specific ATP binding cassette transporter ABCA4, which is important for the long-term viability of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsybovsky et al., 2013</xref>), and the two small transmembrane proteins, peripherin-2 (PRPH2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molday et al., 1987</xref>) and ROS membrane protein 1 (ROM1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bascom et al., 1992</xref>). PRPH2 and ROM1 are homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kevany et al., 2013</xref>) thought to associate non-covalently via dimers into homo- and hetero-tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldberg and Molday, 1996</xref>), which form higher oligomers stabilized through disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loewen and Molday, 2000</xref>). Isolated PRPH2-ROM1 complexes induce membrane curvature when reconstituted into lipid vesicles in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kevany et al., 2013</xref>), and heterologously expressed PRPH2 generates high curvature membranes in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milstein et al., 2017</xref>). Models for membrane curvature formation have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milstein et al., 2020</xref>) but no in situ structure of the ROS disk rim has become available.</p><p>Here, we sought to identify the key structural-molecular elements that support the formation of the mammalian ROS architecture, and to examine the validity of previous models for the native in situ structure. While many mutations leading to blindness are caused by distortions in ROS ultrastructure, or completely abolish ROS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daiger et al., 2013</xref>), the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unresolved. Recent advances in cryo-ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck and Baumeister, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turk and Baumeister, 2020</xref>) allowed us to obtain 3D molecular-resolution images of vitrified ROS in a close-to-native state providing further evidence for previously suggested mechanisms leading to ROS dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defining the structural organization of ROS membranes</title><p>Mouse ROS were extracted using a fast retinal detachment method, minimizing structural deterioration.

Cryo-EM 2D projections show similar patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). At a different tilt angle, however, the pattern is resolved into the disk incisure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Tomographic reconstruction confirmed that the membranes at these positions are not interconnected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

All three GARPs are exclusively localized to disk rims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Körschen et al., 1999</xref>) or to the adjacent PM. CNGCs mediate the cation conductance of the ROS PM in response to light. GARP1 and GARP2 are soluble proteins which are tightly bound to membranes under physiological conditions by a hitherto unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Körschen et al., 1999</xref>). While loss of CNGCs has only a minor impact on ROS architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hüttl et al., 2005</xref>), knockout of all three GARP isoforms destabilizes the diameter of the disks and results in the misalignment of disk rims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). This finding suggests a structural role of either GARP1, GARP2 or both. GARP1, however, is one order of magnitude less abundant in ROS than GARP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batra-Safferling et al., 2006</xref>) and cannot account for the estimated concentration of 190 disk rim connectors per μm<sup>2</sup> disk. Thus, we suggest that GARP2 molecules form the connectors at the disk rim and organize the alignment of rims throughout the disk stack. It is likely that GARP2 molecules form an oligomeric state for the following reasons: (i) the hydrodynamic radius of GARP2 monomers is ~5 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batra-Safferling et al., 2006</xref>) and therefore too small to establish ~12 nm long connectors measured at high precision in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>); (ii) GARP2 is known to be in equilibrium with dimeric and tetrameric species in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batra-Safferling et al., 2006</xref>); and (iii) we observe less disk rim connectors than expected, considering that GARP2 occurs with approximately 500 molecules per μm<sup>2</sup> disk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batra-Safferling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pugh and Lamb, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Absence of all GARP isoforms does not abolish disk stacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilliam et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that the connectors in the disk interior can partially compensate for the loss of GARPs. The most plausible candidate for these connectors is the enzyme phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6). The recently solved PDE6 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gulati et al., 2019</xref>) shows that these 15 nm-long complex can bridge the 14 nm gap between adjacent disks and its abundance matches the results of our segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pugh and Lamb, 2000</xref>). To our knowledge, no other ROS protein exhibits the size and abundance required to contribute to the connectors visualized in our data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwok et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skiba et al., 2013</xref>). Further investigations will be required to probe this idea.</p><p>GARP2 was previously proposed to form connectors between rims of disks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batra-Safferling et al., 2006</xref>) by directly interacting with PRPH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poetsch et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, we see no direct contact between the disk rim scaffold, which is likely composed of PRPH2-ROM1 oligomers, and disk rim connectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>, C). Furthermore, our subvolume average of disk rim connectors reveals no ordered transmembrane component linking the two structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>) as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corless et al., 1987</xref>). However, the quality of our averages is limited by the low number of a few hundred available subvolumes. The mechanism by which disk rim connectors bind to the membrane and what determines their contact site remain to be elucidated.</p><p>We could not observe connectors between disk rims and the plasma membrane in our tomograms as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nickell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roof and Heuser, 1982</xref>). These connectors were suggested to be formed by the GARP-part of the CNGC β-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batra-Safferling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poetsch et al., 2001</xref>), interacting with PRPH2 in disk rims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pearring et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poetsch et al., 2001</xref>). It is possible that the density of the intrinsically disordered GARP-part is not resolved as a clear connector in our tomograms. Furthermore, they would be expected to be present in only a few copies within the small field-of-view of our tomograms. Interestingly, while proteins for the experiments leading to the model were purified from mammalian sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batra-Safferling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poetsch et al., 2001</xref>), the model assumes a distance of 10 nm between the PM and disk rims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batra-Safferling et al., 2006</xref>). This value was derived from amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roof and Heuser, 1982</xref>) and deviates considerably from recent results 18 nm, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilliam et al., 2012</xref>) and from our current measurements in mice (~25 nm).</p><p>Our structural analysis of the ROS disk rim allowed us to resolve for the first time the crescentic rim density as part of the ‘terminal loop complex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corless et al., 1987</xref>) into a continuous protein scaffold. This disk rim scaffold is composed of three interconnected rows with clear repeats inside the disk lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To our knowledge, only three proteins exist in ROS which are abundant, localized to the disk rim, and contain large disk luminal domains; namely, the homologs PRPH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molday et al., 1987</xref>) and ROM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bascom et al., 1992</xref>) which form noncovalent homo- and hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldberg and Molday, 1996</xref>), and ABCA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Papermaster et al., 1978</xref>). Absence of ABCA4 does not significantly alter the structure of the disk rim scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and we therefore suggest that given the compact and ordered structure of the scaffold, ABCA4 is likely not a component of it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The luminal domain of ABCA4 is too large to be accommodated in the disk interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsybovsky et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, we propose ABCA4 resides next to the scaffold at the disk rim. However, whether ABCA4 interacts with the rim scaffold or locates at a distance from it remains unclear.</p><p>Isolated PRPH2-ROM1 complexes and heterologously expressed PRPH2 induce membrane curvature in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kevany et al., 2013</xref>) and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milstein et al., 2017</xref>), respectively. Furthermore, the shape of the repeats appears to be similar to the dimensions reported for isolated PRPH2-ROM1 tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kevany et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, AlphaFold2 has proven its ability to predict the 3D structure of not only monomeric proteins with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) but also that of small oligomeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirdita et al., 2021</xref>). An AlphaFold2 model predicted for the PRPH2 dimer closely resembles the V-shape and the size of the repeats observed in our disk rim average at a resolution of 18 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). The previously published low-resolution negative stain structure of PRPH2-ROM1 complexes interpreted as tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kevany et al., 2013</xref>) has approximately the same size as the predicted dimer structure. At this point, both observations are difficult to reconcile. Hence, we can only hypothesize that the repeats resolved in our average are smaller PRPH2-ROM1 complexes which oligomerize to form the disk rim scaffold and enforce the high membrane curvature at the disk rims. However, a density map with near-atomic resolution would be required to clarify whether the repeats are composed of PRPH2-ROM1 dimers or tetramers. At the current resolution, the disk rim scaffold appears to be C2 symmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>), which is compatible with the predicted model of PRPH2 dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>) and the C2 symmetry axis found for the negative stain structure of putative PRPH2-ROM1 tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kevany et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Non-covalently bound PRPH2-ROM1 complexes are known to form higher order oligomers stabilized by disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loewen and Molday, 2000</xref>), which are essential for normal disk morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milstein et al., 2020</xref>). The intermolecular disulfide brides are exclusively formed by the PRPH2-C150 and ROM1-C153 cysteine residues which are located in the luminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zulliger et al., 2018</xref>). We hypothesize that these disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), are responsible for the contacts across rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or between repeats of the peripheral rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Docking the predicted model of the PRPH2 dimer into the repeats of the central row, however, reveals that the two PRPH-C150 cysteine residues are not located where we observe these contacts but closer toward the inner membrane leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). This may be explained by errors in the prediction or the dimers assuming a different conformation upon oligomerization and embedding into the highly curved membrane environment of the disk rim.</p><p>PRPH2-ROM1 oligomers isolated from native sources exhibit varying degrees of polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loewen and Molday, 2000</xref>) and ROM1 is excluded from larger PRPH2 oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milstein et al., 2020</xref>). We could not resolve this heterogeneity as additional structures to sufficient quality by subvolume averaging, but in combination with the inherent flexibility of the disk rim, it might be the reason for the restricted resolution of our averages. A model involving V-shaped PRPH2-ROM1 tetramers for membrane curvature formation was proposed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milstein et al., 2020</xref>), but it comprises two rows of tetramers as basic building block of the disk rim scaffold which are linked in a head-to-head manner. Instead, our analysis in situ resolves three rows of repeats which are also linked by the luminal domain but are rather organized side-by-side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, our results raise the question whether the basic building blocks of the disk rim scaffold are PRPH2-ROM1 dimers or tetramers.</p><p>We propose a mechanism for disk rim curvature formation, where the two diverging transmembrane densities of V-shaped PRPH2-ROM1 complexes displace lipids in the inner membrane leaflet. While unlinked complexes are able to induce some membrane curvature, their oligomerization into three continuous rows is required to force the membrane into this elongated, highly curved geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milstein et al., 2020</xref>). Our data indicate that the luminal domains of complexes hold the disk rim scaffold together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which is consistent with the fact that most pathological mutations of PRPH2 affect its luminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberg et al., 2001</xref>). In good agreement with previous work, it is possible that these mutations impair the formation of complexes and their disulfide bond-stabilized oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zulliger et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, these alterations could impede or completely prevent disk morphogenesis which, in turn, would disrupt the structural integrity of ROS, compromise the viability of the retina and ultimately lead to blindness.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>ROS extraction and cryo-preparation</title><p>Five- to 8-week-old wild type (WT) mice (C57BL/6 J, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, USA) and mice lacking the photoreceptor-specific ATP binding cassette transporter ABCA4 (<italic>Abca4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weng et al., 1999</xref>), were used for the isolation of rod outer segments (ROS). To minimize the interval between dissection and plunge-freezing, only one mouse was used for each preparation. The mouse was euthanized by exposing it to CO<sub>2</sub> for 3–5 min followed by cervical dislocation. The first eyeball was excised with curved scissors and glued (Scotch Single-use super glue gel) with its sclera side down to a plastic Petri dish. The petri dish was filled with ice cold Ringer’s buffer (10 mM Hepes, 130 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 0.02 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) until the eyeball was fully covered. The eye was dissected as follows. First, a slit was made with a scalpel blade, and one blade of fine scissors inserted into the slit. The cornea was cut away and then the lens removed with fine forceps. To separate the retina from the retinal pigment epithelium, Ringer’s buffer was applied gently between the layers with a P200 pipette. The retina was transferred into a 1.5 ml tube using a P1000 pipet. To prevent damaging the retina during transfer, the opening of the pipet tip was widened by cutting off its tip. The same procedure was applied to the second eye. After collecting two retinas in one tube, Ringer’s buffer was removed and 25 μL of fresh Ringer’s buffer added. The retinas were vortexed at 3200 rpm for 1 min to detach ROS. The sample was centrifuged at 100 rcf for 1 min at 4 °C using an Eppendorf 5415 R Centrifuge with an F 45-24-11 rotor. The centrifugation step enriched ROS in the supernatant which was transferred into a fresh tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, B). To collect more ROS, 25 μL of Ringer’s buffer were added to the retinas, which were then subjected to the same ROS collection procedure.

During FIB operation, samples were kept constantly close to liquid nitrogen temperature using an in-house-developed open nitrogen-circuit 360° rotatable cryo-stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rigort et al., 2010a</xref>). To improve sample conductivity and to reduce curtaining artifacts during FIB-milling, the samples were first sputter-coated with platinum in the Quorum prep-chamber (10 mA, 30 s) and then coated with organo-metallic platinum using an in situ gas injection system (GIS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 26 °C, at 12 mm stage working distance and 7 s gas injection time. Lamellae were prepared using a Gallium ion beam at 30 kV. FIB-milling was performed in a stepwise manner using rectangle patterns following similar procedures as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffer et al., 2017</xref>. The initial step was conducted at a stage tilt angle of 25° with a beam current of 1 nA 10–20 µm away from the final lamella area. After rough milling, the stage was tilted to 20° and the ion current gradually reduced to lower currents as the thinning progressed (500 pA until 4 µm, 300 pA until 1 µm).

Tilt-series alignment and tomographic reconstructions were performed using the IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mastronarde and Held, 2017</xref>) software package (version 4.10.18). Platinum particles originating from the protective platinum layer which were deposited over the lamella surface during FIB-milling served as fiducials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Final alignment of the tilt-series images was performed using the linear interpolation option in IMOD.

The contours were generated in 3dmod by opening the tomographic volume in the Zap window and creating a new model. Each contour included two points spanning across at least two ROS disks. Cuboids were cropped along these contours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The base of the cuboids was square-shaped with an edge length a of 21 voxels (base edges labeled ‘a’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The cuboid voxels were averaged along the base area to obtain a 1D intensity profile of length h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The distances were measured from the points where the membrane signals reached 50% of the maximum intensity (marked as red circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>For the thickness calculation of the plasma membrane (PM) d<sub>PM</sub>, a total of 430 subvolumes were extracted from five tomograms along the PM, aligned, and subvolume averages were calculated for each tomogram. The PM thickness was determined in the 1D intensity profiles along <bold><underline>H</underline></bold> perpendicular to the PM where the signal was 50% of the maximum intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). A similar approach was used to compute the maximum diameter of the disk rim d<sub>DR</sub> parallel to the ROS cylinder axis. A total of 3000 subvolumes from six tomograms were aligned and averages calculated for each tomogram. The 1D intensity profile along <bold><underline>K</underline></bold> was used to determine d<sub>DR</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). To calculate the width of the cytosolic gap at the disk incisure d<sub>IN</sub> and the distance between the PM and the disk rim d<sub>PR</sub>, the refined coordinates of the disk rim subvolumes were utilized. The value of d<sub>Shift</sub> was determined as the distance from the center of the subvolume average to the outer periphery of the disk rim along <bold><underline>L</underline></bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The subvolumes were separated into three groups: group 1 and group 2 comprised subvolumes on opposite sides of the disk incisure; group three contained subvolumes close to the PM. The gap at the incisure d<sub>IN</sub> was computed as follows: d<sub>IN</sub> = d<sub>1</sub> – 2 d<sub>Shift</sub>, where d<sub>1</sub> is the shortest distance of a coordinate in group one to a plane defined by its nearest neighbors in group two and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>).</p><p>For the distance between PM and the disk rim d<sub>PR</sub>, the central plane of the PM was segmented with TomoSegMemTV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>).

Only the distance between neighboring disk rims (Distance G in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) was not directly measured in the tomograms but calculated as the difference between the unit cell distance and the maximum disk rim diameter (Distance B and H, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Besides subvolume averaging, the distance calculations and the required image processing steps were performed in MatLab aided by the TOM software toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nickell et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Connector segmentation</title><p>The segmentations were performed on 4 x binned tomograms (pixel size = 10.48 Å). More dense structures, like proteins, appear darker in tomographic slices which translates into a lower gray value. First, all ROS membranes were automatically segmented by tensor voting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>). The results of the automated segmentation and the original tomograms were loaded in Amira (v.6.2.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). By comparing the two volumes, segmented patches which did not correspond to membranes were identified and manually removed. Afterwards, neighboring disk membranes of adjacent disks were grouped into pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The results of the initial automated membrane segmentation correspond to the central membrane plane. By adding a layer of three voxels on either side of the central plane, the segmentation was grown to a thickness of 7 nm. This was then used to mask disk membranes with their apparent thickness of ~6.8 nm in raw tomograms. Additionally, these masks defined the borders of the cytosolic gap between disks which a connector must bridge. The cytosolic voxels between the membrane masks were normalized separately for each membrane pair to a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of one. This extinguished gradients in the gray value distribution throughout a tomogram caused by heterogeneous lamella thickness and compensated for contrast differences between tomograms. To pick the connectors, the Pyto software package was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lučić et al., 2016</xref>). The original Pyto workflow segments connectors between the membranes of adjacent disks by evaluating all cytosolic voxels between the membrane masks as described below. The algorithm runs a gray value ramp from a user-defined lowest gray value g<sub>min</sub> to a highest gray value g<sub>max</sub>, with a step size g<sub>step</sub> according to: g<sub>i</sub> = g<sub>min</sub> + (i – 1)g<sub>step</sub> ∩ i = 1, 2, 3, …, g<sub>max</sub>/g<sub>step.</sub></p><p>At each iteration i, the algorithm performs a connectivity segmentation by selecting j groups of voxels v<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> based on four conditions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>all voxels in the group v<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> have a gray value smaller or equal to g<sub>i</sub>,</p></list-item><list-item><p>the voxels of v<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> are in direct contact (face-to-face),</p></list-item><list-item><p>v<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> links the membrane masks of two adjacent disks,</p></list-item><list-item><p>no voxel of the group v<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> is in direct contact with any other voxel of a group v<sub>i</sub><sup>k</sup> with k ≠ j.</p></list-item></list><p>During the next iteration with the gray value threshold at g<sub>i+1</sub>, groups of voxels v<sub>i+1</sub><sup>j</sup> are selected that inevitably contain the v<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> with additional voxels of gray value g<sub>i</sub>&lt; g(v<sub>i+1</sub><sup>j</sup> - v<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup>) ≤ g<sub>i+1</sub> in direct contact with v<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup>. This defines a relationship among all connectors picked at the individual gray value steps. Connectors with v<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> ≠ v<sub>i</sub><sup>k</sup> are independent while connectors with v<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> ∈ v<sub>i+1</sub><sup>j</sup> are related by an ancestor-descendant relation. The connector segmentation as output contains only independent groups of voxels which do not have ancestors. The original Pyto workflow is sketched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Visual inspection of the segmented connectors and their comparison to the densities observed in the raw tomograms, however, revealed that fewer connectors with a higher volume than expected were segmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, D). This difference is caused by several interconnected elements which were segmented as one connector.</p><p>Therefore, we customized the original Pyto workflow by applying an additional mask to the tomographic volume prior to the connector segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). First, a binary mask was created that is one for all voxels with gray value below g<sub>max</sub>, and elsewhere zero. Second, this binary mask was subjected to watershed transform (Fernand Meyer Algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyer, 1994</xref> implemented in MatLab) with ‘catchment basins’ filled from the center between the two membranes. Third, a volume with the watershed lines set to zero and elsewhere one was multiplied with the binary mask. The resulting mask was applied to the original tomographic volume. Then Pyto was used to segment connectors in the masked tomogram. A sketch of the customized Pyto workflow and its processing steps applied to the data for one membrane pair are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and C, respectively. The threshold ramp for the original and the customized Pyto workflow was always started at the minimum gray value g<sub>min</sub> of –2 and ended at maximum gray value g<sub>max</sub> of –0.68 with a step size g<sub>step</sub> of 0.02.</p><p>The manual segmentation of connectors was performed as follows: initially, the membranes in the tomograms were masked as done for the automated segmentation. Tomographic volumes with the membrane mask applied were loaded into Amira (v.6.2.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and evaluated slice by slice. Groups of voxels that by visual inspection connect the membrane masks of adjacent disks were selected with the ‘Magic Wand’ tool (Amira v.6.2.0). The results of the connector segmentation and the membrane masks were visualized in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>To assess the quality of the customized Pyto segmentation approach, the results were compared to the manual segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>, D). Two major differences are apparent: First, the connectors selected automatically were bulkier than manually picked connectors. This is caused by the Pyto algorithm that picks voxels based on their gray value and their connectivity and evaluates all voxels at once, not in a slice-by-slice manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Second, fewer connectors were picked manually. This is likely due to inclined structures, which were not observed as continuous connectors in one single tomographic slice, but several successive slices. Consequently, they could be missed manually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Therefore, picking of connectors with the automated segmentation approach is more reliable than the manual segmentation. Ninety percent of the connectors were picked by both methods and the error of the determined connector coordinates was below 2 nm. This error is small compared to the pixels size of 1 nm and the size of membrane patches with diameters of 500–1000 nm. Therefore, the shape of the automatically segmented connectors may not be reliable, but their abundance and arrangement in 3D can be quantitatively analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of connector segmentation</title><p>A total of 7000 connectors were segmented in five VPP tomograms of wt ROS. The tomograms were selected based on a good IMOD tilt-series alignment scores and visual confirmation of well-resolved densities between ROS disks. The connectors and the membrane surface area were divided into two fractions. The disk rim fraction was within 40 nm from the outer periphery of disks rims. The remainder was considered the disk interior fraction. Based on this definition, 800 connectors were assigned as the disk rim connectors and 6200 as disk interior connectors.

A coordinate based on the center of mass of all connector voxels would result in off-center positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>) which would induce errors in the spatial analysis. Nearest-neighbor distances between connectors were calculated based on C<sub>con</sub>. To estimate the connector length L<sub>con</sub>, the two membrane contact points P<sub>mb1</sub> and P<sub>mb2</sub> of a connector with both disk membranes were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

The mean grey value was defined as the average gray value of all connector voxels. The statistical significance of differences between disk rim and disk interior connectors was established with the two-sample Kolmogorow-Smirnow test in MatLab.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Subvolume averaging</title><p>Initially, binned subvolumes were extracted from dose-weighted and, if possible, CTF-corrected tomograms. The initial alignments were performed with scripts based on TOM, AV3 and Dynamo as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wan et al., 2017</xref>. The alignment references were exclusively derived from the data itself and low-pass filtered to 30 Å. To describe the orientation of subvolumes within the tomograms, triplets of Euler angles in ‘ZXZ’ convention were used, comprising the angles Phi, Theta, and Psi. Phi is the angle of the first in-plane rotation around the z-axis. Theta describes the second rotation around the new x-axis, and Psi the third rotation around the new z-axis. Classification of 3D subvolumes and the final alignments were performed in RELION (version 3) with 2 x binned or unbinned subvolumes. For the WT<sub>conv</sub> dataset, unbinned subvolumes were extracted with Warp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tegunov and Cramer, 2019</xref>). Warp automatically generates a CTF model for each subvolume which is needed for RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tegunov and Cramer, 2019</xref>). For VPP tomograms a simple ‘fan’-shaped CTF model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bharat et al., 2015</xref>) was created which was one for all information-containing slices in Fourier space, and zero elsewhere. For the gray value representation of subvolume averages, the scale was inverted compared to the raw tomograms. Therefore, density in slices through subvolume averages appears bright, translating into a high grey value. Slices of subvolume averages were depicted in IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>), while isosurface representations and subvolume positions within the context of tomograms were displayed in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Subvolume averaging of connectors</title><p>Subvolume analysis of disk connectors was only performed in WT<sub>VPP</sub> tomograms. The initial subvolume extraction points of connectors were defined at their two membrane contact points P<sub>mb1</sub> and P<sub>mb2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>) as elucidated by the segmentation. Initial Euler angles for Psi and Theta were determined so that the subvolume z-axis was parallel to the local normal vector of the disk membrane. The Phi angles were randomized. First, subvolumes were extracted from 4 x binned tomograms (pixel size = 10.48 Å, box size = 64<sup>3</sup>) and aligned with shifts only allowed perpendicular to the membrane plane. For the disk interior connectors, the angle of the in-plane rotation was not searched, while for the disk rim connectors the whole 360° were covered to align the disk rims with respect to each other. The initial alignment brought the membranes into register and refined the initial orientations. The averages as a result of this alignment indicate a clear density protruding from the membrane into the cytosol, but it appears fuzzy compared to the membrane signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref> and D, for disk rim and disk interior connectors, respectively). Probably, this is caused by the heterogeneity of the densities which could not be sorted by classification of 3D subvolumes in RELION. Hence, a different classification approach was chosen.</p><p>First, 4 x binned subvolumes were re-extracted at the refined positions (pixel size = 10.48 Å, box size = 32<sup>3</sup>). Then, for each subvolume rotational averages around the z-axis were calculated and the resulting 2D images classified. For this, the ‘plane_align_class.py’ script was used as part of the PySeg package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2020</xref>). A cylindrical mask focused the classification on the cytosol between disks. Only a fraction of the subvolumes was assigned to classes with a clear connector-like density (40% and 6% for disk rim and disk interior connectors; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref> and E, respectively), while many appear as false-positives (more than 30% and 60%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref> and D, respectively) because they have no or only a small membrane-attached density. Subvolumes of classes indicating a density between the membranes were considered most promising (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). They were extracted from 2 x binned tomograms (pixel size = 5.24 Å, box size = 64<sup>3</sup>) and aligned in RELION. The alignments were performed with the built-in sphere masks (diameter = 200 Å). The resulting averages, however, remained featureless and revealed no further structural insights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>, F).</p><p>The high rate of putative false-positives indicated by the classification of the connector subvolumes suggests that our segmentation approach is error prone. Most likely, because the segmentation algorithm cannot distinguish two densities in close proximity protruding from opposite disks into the cytosol from an actual connector. On the other hand, we obtain classes with elongated densities that appear to link neighboring disks. Therefore, we assume that the two types of connectors indeed exist, yet at lower concentration than the initial segmentation determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Particularly, the disk rim connectors which are frequently seen in our tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) and have been observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corless et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roof and Heuser, 1982</xref>) are unlikely an artifact of the segmentation in the crowded environment of ROS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Subvolume averaging of disk rims</title><p>Subvolume analysis of disk rims was performed in WT<sub>conv</sub>, WT<sub>VPP</sub> and a<italic>bca4<sup>-/-</sup></italic><sub>VPP</sub> tomograms. Splines were manually picked along disk rims. For that, the tomographic volume was visualized in the 3dmod ZAP window, and a new model created. A new contour was defined for each disk rim by adding points along its outer periphery. Initial subvolume extraction points were set along the splines with 1 nm distance. Initial Euler angles for Psi and Theta were assigned so that the local spline direction dictated the orientation of the subvolume z-axis. The Phi angles of the in-plane rotation were randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Initially, 4 x binned subvolumes (pixel size = 10.48 Å, box size = 64<sup>3</sup>) were extracted. The initial average was composed of a strong density along the z-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). During the initial alignments, the translations along the spline were restricted to 1 nm and the entire Phi range was sampled, while the search range for Psi and Theta was restricted to ±15°. Later, this search was refined. For the initial reference, a subset of 300 subvolumes was aligned against the unstructured, first average. After several iterations, the symmetry was broken until the average converged into the hairpin-like structure of the disk rim. This initial reference was then used to align the whole dataset. During this step, the subvolume positions converged to the disk rims and a first estimate for all three Euler angles was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>2 x binned subvolumes were extracted (pixel size = 5.24 Å, box size = 64<sup>3</sup>) at the refined coordinates and aligned. The average revealed a periodic scaffold with a repeat of ~4 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and subvolume positions partially converging into the same points along the disk rim (lattice points) which had an average distance of ~4 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This information was used to perform so-called distance-cleaning. At each of the lattice points, the particle with the highest similarity to the subvolume average, as estimated by the cross-correlation score, was kept and all others were discarded, which resulted in a minimal distance of 4 nm between subvolume coordinates. To potentially take the symmetry of the repeats into account, the subvolumes were reoriented by rotating the subvolume z-axis to point toward the disk center into the disk lumen, and the y-axis parallel to the ROS cylinder axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The 4 x and 2 x binned subvolumes were aligned against references that were filtered to a resolution of 30 Å and all subvolumes were processed together. Only after distance cleaning, unbinned subvolumes (pixel size = 2.62 Å, box size = 128<sup>3</sup>) were extracted, split into half-sets, and independently processed in RELION. For this step, the tomograms of the WT<sub>conv</sub> dataset were preprocessed in Warp (version 1.0.9). Instead of using the entire preprocessing capabilities implemented in Warp, the motion corrected, non-CTF-corrected, and non-dose-filtered projections of the tilt-series were imported into Warp with the corresponding tilt-series alignment files. In the first step, the CTF parameters were calculated for each projection in Warp. The patch size for the CTF estimation was set to 512 × 512 pixels<sup>2</sup>, the spatial frequency range used for the fit was between 34 Å and 12 Å and the defocus value was searched within ±2 µm of the tilt-series’ target defocus. In a second step, the CTF was estimated for the whole tilt-series taking the tilted geometry of the individual projections into account. For this, the same settings as in the first CTF estimate were used, only the spatial frequency range was expanded to 7 Å.</p><p>As the previous alignment steps determined the orientations of the subvolumes with reasonable precision, the Euler angles in the RELION input star-file were set with a ‘Prior’ which allows restriction of the angular search around these angles. The alignment was focused on the central row of density with a wedge-shaped mask that covered four repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). After a first round of alignment, the subvolumes were classified without particle alignment, allowing 10–15 classes and ‘regularization parameter T’ was set to 0.1. Classes which indicated a highly ordered and symmetric disk rim scaffold were selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), distance-cleaned, and separately aligned in RELION. The averages obtained by processing two independent half-sets of unbinned subvolumes were used to calculate Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bharat and Scheres, 2016</xref>). The global resolution was estimated as the spatial frequency where the FSC drops to 0.143 according to the ‘gold-standard’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>), and according to the more conservative threshold of 0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hrabe et al., 2012</xref>).

Three cuboid masks were defined around the luminal densities, one for each row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> left panel). The voxels inside the masks were then averaged perpendicular to the rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref> right panel). The three resulting 1D intensity profiles were fitted to sine functions of the following shape: y(x) = y<sub>0</sub>+ A sin(w<sub>0</sub> x + p).</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>λ = Ps 2π/w<sub>0</sub>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The offset between the rows ∆λ as:</p></list-item><list-item><p>The repeat length λ is related to w<sub>0</sub> by:</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>∆λ = (p<sub>PR</sub> – p<sub>CD</sub>)/2π.</p></list-item></list><p>Here, p<sub>PR</sub> and p<sub>CD</sub> denote the phase shift of the peripheral and central rows, respectively, and the pixel size Ps of the subvolume average was 0.262 nm. The determined repeat length 4.1 nm is further supported by the subvolume positions after alignment which converged into lattice points where the nearest neighbor distances had increased populations at multiples of ~4 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the peripheral rows of the WT<sub>conv</sub> dataset were analyzed. To generate the initial extraction points, the coordinates as result of the alignment of unbinned subvolumes for the central row were modified. First, the peripheral rows were centered and rotated to adopt a similar orientation as the central row before. Additionally, clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) rows were aligned to each other. For the CW row, the orientation of CD was rotated by 63° around the y-axis. The CCW row required a 180° rotation of the CD orientation around the z-axis, followed by 63° around the y-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Subvolumes were extracted with Warp from unbinned tomograms and subjected to the same subvolume averaging pipeline as the central row. This included a first round of classification and alignment in RELION, tilt-series refinement in <italic>M</italic>, re-extraction of subvolumes from tomograms with refined tilt-series and a second round of classification and alignments in RELION. The alignment mask focused on four repeats along the peripheral row. All alignment steps were performed for CW and CCW separately, and both peripheral rows combined (CW + CCW). The global resolution of CW + CCW was with 18.2 Å slightly higher in comparison to the individual rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). The symmetry operation required to combine the CW and CCW as well as the higher quality of the combined average further indicate the C2 symmetry of the disk rim scaffold. The putative C2 symmetry, however, was not applied during subvolume analysis of the central row. The averages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were filtered to a resolution of 30 Å using the TOM function tom_filter2resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nickell et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our best disk rim averages have a rather low resolution (~18 Å) given the number of used subvolumes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) compared to previous results for other protein scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dodonova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schur et al., 2016</xref>). This is probably caused by the flexibility and the heterogeneity which is characteristic of many structures in cells. The flexibility of the disk rim scaffold is indicated by the varying rim diameters measured in the tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We tried to avoid the influence of flexibility by focusing the alignment on individual repeats instead of several repeats along a row. This did not improve the global resolution suggesting that the repeat itself is heterogeneous or flexible.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Structural prediction of PRPH2 oligomers</title><p>To further improve our model of the disk rim scaffold, we modeled 3D structures of PRPH2. Since there are no available homolog structures in PDB for conventional homology-based structure prediction, we relied on ColabFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirdita et al., 2021</xref>), a notebook environment based on AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). For the prediction, we used the sequence of mouse PRPH2 available in the UniProt database (P15499) and the default settings in the following, publicly available notebook: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/beta/AlphaFold2_advanced.ipynb">https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/beta/AlphaFold2_advanced.ipynb</ext-link>.</p><p>The resources provided by ColabFold allowed us to calculate predictions for PRPH2 monomers and dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>) but not for tetramers due to memory requirements. The three domains of PRPH2 can be readily assigned: The partially disordered, cytosolic C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ritter et al., 2005</xref>) exhibits the lowest predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) score across the sequence. It is followed by the transmembrane domain composed of four transmembrane segments typical for proteins of the tetraspanin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Termini and Gillette, 2017</xref>). The third domain resides inside the disk lumen and is dominated by the large extracellular loop 2 (EC2), which is also characteristic for tetraspanins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Termini and Gillette, 2017</xref>). Of the five predicted PRPH2 dimer models, four models were V-shaped and resembled the shape of the repeats resolved in our disk rim average. The best scoring model was docked into one repeat of the central density row of our disk average by ridged-body fitting using the fitmap command in Chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). Apart from the disordered C-terminal regions, this dimer model fits well into the repeats of the disk rim scaffold and appears to be C2-symmetric which is compatible with the putative C2 symmetry that we suggest for the disk rim scaffold. A similar implementation of AlphaFold2 on the computer cluster at the EMBL in Heidelberg could circumvent the memory issues and predict models for PRPH2 tetramers. None of the five predicted models, however, fit into either one single or two neighboring repeats of the disk rim scaffold because the tetramers were too large and of different shape. This result further supports the idea that the repeats are indeed PRPH2-ROM1 dimers and not tetramers.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>K.P. is Chief Scientific Officer of Polgenix Inc W.B. holds a position on the advisory board of Thermo Fisher Scientific.

I have a couple of suggestions to make the figures more clear for the general audience as well as a couple of questions:</p><p>For the disk rim, 3 averages are mentioned, namely the whole disk rim, CD focus and peripheral density focus.</p><p>1) Need to include in Table 1 the parameters for the whole disk average as well.</p><p>2) For clarity Figure 3 should first show the whole disk average currently B and C and then move to the CD focus average currently A. Also the membrane should be annotated in the CD average, for example by segmenting it in different colour. This figure should also include PR focus for completion.</p><p>3) Can the author comment on why the TMD is weaker for the PR compared to CD. Not visible at all in Figure 5 A/B left.</p><p>4) The authors suggest in their model that the CD and PR are made of the same complex protein, if that is the case why they didn't merge the data for CD and PR to have one average? are the differences they are expecting due to flexibility be observable in the resolution achieved?</p><p>As mentioned, a weakness of this manuscript is the direct identification of the densities observed.</p><p>1) The authors provided an average from a transgenic mouse without Abca4, however, that average is of lower resolution. Can the authors rule out any differences between WT and the mutant, e.g. in Figure 4 lower panels some differences can be seen. Were the averages in Figure 4 filtered to the same resolution?</p><p>2) Can the authors build homology models for PRPH2/ROM1 and GARP2 and try to fit in their map?</p><p>Data on PRPH2/ROM1 and GARP2 KO could have strengthen this manuscript substantially.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72817.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add missing citations to acknowledge previous work and tone down novelty claims (refer to reviewer 2 specific points 1 through 6).</p><p>The novelty of the current observation of two types of links is overstated, for example, in the abstract: &quot;Our data reveal the existence of two molecular connectors/spacers which likely contribute to the nanometer scale precise stacking of the ROS disks&quot; (Line 25). In fact, both of these links have been shown before (Usukura and Yamada, 1981; Roof and Heuser, 1982; Corless and Schneider, 1987; Corless et al., 1987; Kajimura et al., 2000). These previous studies deserve to be recognized. Of special note is the paper by Usukura and Yamada whose images of the disc rim connectors are by no means less convincing than shown in the current manuscript. On the other hand, the novelty and impact of the data related to peripherin appears to be understated, particularly in the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this detailed criticism.

First, we tried to model PRHP2 and ROM1 complexes based on molecular dynamics simulations and homolog structures in PDB without success. Hence, we performed structure prediction of PRPH2 oligomers (dimers and tetramers) with ColabFold, a notebook-based environment based on AlphaFold2. Four of the five predicted dimer models resembled the V-shape of the repeats resolved in the disk rim scaffold. Ridged-body fitting of the best scoring model into the repeat of the central density row appears reasonable at the 18 Å resolution of the average (see Figure 1B).</p><p>On the other hand, none of the tetramer models fits into a single repeat of the disk rim scaffold or into two neighboring repeats. Furthermore, the tetramer models are significantly bulkier than the negative stain structure of the putative PRPH2-ROM1 tetramer (Kevany et al., 2013).</p><p>This result contradicts the previous interpretation of the low-resolution negative stain structure of PRPH2-ROM1 complexes as tetramers, which also has a similar size and shape as the repeats of the disk rim scaffold resolved in our study. Therefore, the predicted model points to an error in our original interpretation and in previous publications where the putative non-covalently bound subunit of PRPH2 and ROM1 was studied. In these publications, particles of similar properties to those reported in Kevany et al., 2013, lay the foundation for the currently accepted PRPH2-ROM1 tetramer model (reviewed in Goldberg et al., 2016). The accompanying results of native gels and the hydrodynamic data that support the tetramer model may have been biased by the detergents used to purify PRPH2-ROM1 complexes (Triton X-100, Amphipol) or the non-globular shape of the complexes.</p><p>Therefore, we have introduced major changes to the manuscript. We added an additional Materials and methods section “Structural prediction of PRPH2 oligomers”. We added a supplementary figure and a video showing the fit of the predicted PRPH2 dimer structure into our subvolume average. We toned down our hypothesis that the repeats of the disk rim scaffold are composed of PRPH2-ROM1 tetramers and refer only to PRPH2-ROM1 complexes in the abstract, results and discussion. We now describe the discrepancy between the predicted PRPH2-dimer model and the negative stain structure of putative PRPH2-ROM1 tetramers and conclude that a high-resolution density map is required to elucidate whether the repeats are composed of dimers or tetramers. Furthermore, we changed the discussion of the disulfide bond forming PRPH2-C150 cysteine residues in light of the predicted model.</p><p>Another key point raised in the essential revisions point 2 is to make it clear that our assignment of PRPH2-ROM1 complexes to the repeats of the disk rim scaffold are hypothetical. We agree it is important to highlight that we don’t have direct experimental evidence to document this interpretation. We changed the abstract in lines 28-30:</p><p>“We further provide evidence that the extreme radius of curvature at the disk rims is enforced by a continuous supramolecular assembly and provide evidence that it is composed of peripherin-2 (PRPH2) and…”.</p><p>and the discussion is revised in lines 358-360:</p><p>“Hence, we hypothesize that the repeats resolved in our average are smaller PRPH2-ROM1 complexes which oligomerize to form the disk rim scaffold …”.</p><p>We also absolutely agree that data on knockout mice could strengthen our manuscript, and we appreciate this suggestion. Four knockouts are of special interest for us. Our putative candidates for the disk rim and disk interior connectors are (i) GARP2 and (ii) PDE6, respectively; and (iii) PRPH2 and (iv) ROM1 are proposed as potential building blocks of the disk rim scaffold. Unfortunately, PRPH2 and PDE6 knockouts lead to complete retinal degeneration. Hence, ROS of these strains cannot be investigated by cryo-ET. The <italic>Cngb 1</italic> locus encodes three proteins, namely, the β-subunit of the CNGC-channel and the spliced isoforms GARP1 and GARP2. To our knowledge there is no knockout of only GARP2. In addition, GARP2 is predicted to be largely unstructured (Batra-Safferling et al., 2006). Therefore, structural modeling of the disk rim connectors is not possible. For <italic>Cngb 1</italic> or ROM1 knockout mice, ROS can form, as revealed by conventional plastic embedded EM (Zhang et al., 2009, Clarke et al., 2000, respectively). However, ROS are destabilized in both strains and their architecture is highly disorganized (Clarke et al., 2000, Zhang et al., 2009). ROM1 KO mice are indeed commercially available, and the analysis of their ROS by cryo-ET is possible, but not feasible within a reasonable time frame for our revisions. We hope the reviewers will find that the structural models now included in the manuscript help substantiate our hypothesis on the identity of the disk rim scaffold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Clarify aspects of the data, for example regarding the curvature of the membrane in the rim complex (see reviewer 1, point 4), and the relationship between various averages of the rim complex (see reviewer 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewers made us aware of this somewhat confusing description. Before we answer the specific points of reviewers #1 and #3 we want to clarify the relationship among various averages. We analyzed three datasets in our work, namely, WT<sub>conv</sub>, WT<sub>VPP</sub> and Abca4<sup>-/-</sup><sub>VPP</sub>. For every dataset, an average of the disk rim was calculated with a mask focused on four repeats along the central row in the final alignment. Even though the alignment focused only on a small fraction of the disk rim – its central row – the subvolume averages contain the signal of the whole disk rim. Dependent on what we wanted to show, we either displayed the whole, unmasked average or the average with the alignment mask applied. The unmasked average shows best the organization of the whole disk rim in 3 rows of repeats (Figure 3B, C, Figure 4, Video 7), and it was used to measure the repeat length in all three rows and the offsets of the repeats in the central and peripheral rows with respect to each other (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 C). The average in Figure 3A with the alignment mask applied highlights the connections of the central row to the peripheral rows and the TMDs. Apart from the masking, it is the same average as in Figure 3B and C. The transition from whole, unmasked average to masked average is shown in Video 8. For the WT<sub>conv</sub> dataset, we also calculated an independent subvolume average of the peripheral row. Here, we used a similar representation as for the central density of the WT<sub>conv</sub> dataset: In Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, we show slices of the whole, unmasked PR average and in Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, C the masked PR average is shown to highlight TMDs and the connections between adjacent repeats. The transition between whole, unmasked average and masked average of the peripheral row is illustrated in Video 9.</p><p>To better explain the relationship among averages in the text, we added a new paragraph starting at line 802:</p><p>“Even though the resulting CD average was obtained by focusing the alignment on 4 repeats along the central row of density, the average comprised the signal of the whole disk rim scaffold. We used different representations of this average to highlight certain aspects of the disk rim scaffold. The unmasked CD average shows the organization of the three interconnected rows of density (Figure 3B, C and Video 7), while the alignment mask applied to the CD average reveals the signal of the transmembrane densities (Figure 3A, Video 8).”</p><p>Furthermore, we changed the legends of Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 3, Figure 4 and Video 7 through 9, accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The quality of the imaging and subtomogram averaging is of the highest level that can be achieved by cellular cryoET.

Also the membrane should be annotated in the CD average, for example by segmenting it in different colour. This figure should also include PR focus for completion.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope, given the previous explanation, it becomes clear that the unmasked CD average is the same as the CD average with alignment mask applied, to which reviewer #3 referred to as whole average and CD focus, respectively. Therefore, data of all four averages shown in our manuscripts is contained in Table 1. Furthermore, we did not rearrange Figure 3. But as suggested, we marked the signal of the inner and outer membrane leaflet in the front views of the isosurface representations of the averages. Hence, we changed Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can the author comment on why the TMD is weaker for the PR compared to CD. Not visible at all in Figure 5 A/B left.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5A, B we show an isosurface representation of the whole, unmasked CD average. At the threshold used, we clearly see the TMD of the central row, but do not in the PR. The grey scale values slice in Figure 3B shows faint indications of the PRs TMD. However, the reviewer is correct that the TMD in the PR average are less well resolved than in the CD and appear less ordered (compare video 8 and 9). We think that the central row is in a more stable conformation as it is fixed in position by the PRs on each side. In turn, the PRs which have the support of the scaffold only on one side by the CD, are more flexible. This is supported by the fact that we have 5x more subvolumes for the PR, but achieved a similar resolution as for the CD (Table 1). Nevertheless, focused alignments on the PRs as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 provides clear densities for their TMDs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors suggest in their model that the CD and PR are made of the same complex protein, if that is the case why they didn't merge the data for CD and PR to have one average? are the differences they are expecting due to flexibility be observable in the resolution achieved?</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed tried to merge the densities to improve the structural analysis. However, in line with the comment above, the repeats of CD and PR exhibit different conformations as they are linked differently to their neighbors (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3), and therefore this attempt did not result in better averages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As mentioned, a weakness of this manuscript is the direct identification of the densities observed.</p><p>1) The authors provided an average from a transgenic mouse without Abca4, however, that average is of lower resolution. Can the authors rule out any differences between WT and the mutant, e.g. in Figure 4 lower panels some differences can be seen. Were the averages in Figure 4 filtered to the same resolution?</p></disp-quote><p>The averages in Figure 4 were not filtered to the same resolution, which we agree is necessary for a fair comparison. We adjusted this Figure by filtering all three CD averages to a resolution of 30 Å. Now the similarity among all three averages is even more striking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors build homology models for PRPH2/ROM1 and GARP2 and try to fit in their map?</p><p>Data on PRPH2/ROM1 and GARP2 KO could have strengthen this manuscript substantially.</p></disp-quote><p>Homology modeling is an exquisite suggestion. First, we tried to model PRHP2 and ROM1 complexes based on molecular dynamics simulations and homolog structures in PDB without success. Hence, we performed structure prediction of PRPH2 oligomers (dimers and tetramers) with ColabFold, a notebook-based environment based on AlphaFold2. Four of the five predicted dimer models resembled the V-shape of the repeats resolved in the disk rim scaffold. Ridged-body fitting of the best scoring model into the repeat of the central density row appears reasonable at the 18 Å resolution of the average (see Figure 14).</p><p>On the other hand, none of the tetramer models fits into a single repeat of the disk rim scaffold or into two neighboring repeats. Furthermore, the tetramer models are significantly bulkier than the negative stain structure of the putative PRPH2-ROM1 tetramer (Kevany et al., 2013).</p><p>This result contradicts the previous interpretation of the low-resolution negative stain structure of PRPH2-ROM1 complexes as tetramers, which also has a similar size and shape as the repeats of the disk rim scaffold resolved in our study. Therefore, the predicted model points to an error in our original interpretation and in previous publications where the putative non-covalently bound subunit of PRPH2 and ROM1 was studied. In these publications, particles of similar properties to those reported in Kevany et al., 2013, lay the foundation for the currently accepted PRPH2-ROM1 tetramer model (reviewed in Goldberg et al., 2016). The accompanying results of native gels and the hydrodynamic data that support the tetramer model may have been biased by the detergents used to purify PRPH2-ROM1 complexes (Triton X-100, Amphipol) or the non-globular shape of the complexes.</p><p>Therefore, we have introduced major changes to the manuscript.
