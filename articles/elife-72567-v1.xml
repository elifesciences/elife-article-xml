However, whilst an extensive empirical literature exists on the behaviour exhibited during and immediately after interactions with rivals, only very few observational studies have considered the cumulative fitness consequences of outgroup conflict. Using a cooperatively breeding fish, the daffodil cichlid (<italic>Neolamprologus pulcher</italic>), we conducted the first experimental test of the effects of chronic outgroup conflict on reproductive investment and output. ‘Intruded’ groups received long-term simulated territorial intrusions by neighbours that generated consistent group-defence behaviour; matched ‘Control’ groups (each the same size and with the same neighbours as an Intruded group) received no intrusions in the same period. Intruded groups had longer inter-clutch intervals and produced eggs with increasingly less protein than Control groups. Despite the lower egg investment, Intruded groups provided more parental care and achieved similar hatching success to Control groups. Ultimately, however, Intruded groups had fewer and smaller surviving offspring than Control groups at 1-month post-hatching. We therefore provide experimental evidence that outgroup conflict can decrease fitness via cumulative effects on reproductive success, confirming the selective potential of this empirically neglected aspect of sociality.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Neolamprologus pulcher</italic></kwd><kwd>fitness consequences</kwd><kwd>conspecific rivals</kwd><kwd>social evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>682253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radford</surname><given-names>Andrew N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Outgroup conflict can negatively impact general reproductive behaviour, egg investment, and parental care, resulting in decreased reproductive output even in the absence of physical confrontations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In social species, conspecific outsiders often challenge groups and their members for resources and reproductive opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Birch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Braga Goncalves and Radford, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kitchen and Beehner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>). This ‘outgroup conflict’—conflict with one or more outsiders, of which ‘intergroup conflict’ (that between two groups) is a subset—is theorised to be a driving force in the evolution of territoriality, social structure, group dynamics, and cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bowles, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gaston, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rusch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wrangham, 1980</xref>). Empirical research in non-human animals has traditionally focussed on aggressive outgroup contests, such as factors determining which individuals participate, their level of contribution, and who wins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arseneau-Robar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Green et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kitchen and Beehner, 2007</xref>), as well as the immediate fitness costs arising from loss of life, breeding position, or territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Goodall, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Morris-Drake et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Spong et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, studies have begun to explore the effects of outgroup conflict beyond periods of active confrontation, documenting short-term behavioural changes (e.g. increased within-group affiliation) in the aftermath of single interactions with rivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Birch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Braga Goncalves and Radford, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mirville et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Preston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radford, 2008</xref>). However, the cumulative build-up of threat posed by outsiders is also likely a potent stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Eckardt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Samuni et al., 2019</xref>) and may disrupt within-group relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hellmann and Hamilton, 2019</xref>), potentially generating long-term fitness consequences even in the absence of immediate direct effects from individual aggressive contests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Braga Goncalves et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Morris-Drake et al., 2022</xref>). Three observational studies have found associations between outgroup conflict and reproductive success, beyond the direct death of offspring during aggressive interactions: greater intergroup conflict during pregnancy was associated with improved foetal survival in both crested macaques (<italic>Macaca nigra</italic>) and banded mongooses (<italic>Mungos mungo</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kerhoas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>), but with longer inter-birth intervals and reduced infant survival in chimpanzees (<italic>Pan troglodytes verus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lemoine et al., 2020</xref>). However, to test a causal link between outgroup conflict and reproductive success—that is to rule out potential confounding explanations associated with natural observations—experiments are needed.</p><p>Here, we use the daffodil cichlid (<italic>Neolamprologus pulcher</italic>), a model species for the study of sociality, to test experimentally the reproductive consequences of chronically elevated outgroup conflict. <italic>N. pulcher</italic> is a highly territorial, cooperatively breeding fish species native to Lake Tanganyika. In the wild, groups comprising a breeding pair and 0–20 subordinates of both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wong and Balshine, 2011</xref>) defend territories from predators, heterospecific competitors, and conspecific intruders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Desjardins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Taborsky and Limberger, 1981</xref>), with multiple small, contiguous territories often clustered together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Taborsky, 1984</xref>). Although individuals develop dear–enemy relationships with neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Frostman and Sherman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sogawa et al., 2016</xref>), aggressive disputes at shared borders are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balshine et al., 2001</xref>) and intruding neighbours can be attacked by all group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balshine-Earn et al., 1998</xref>). Single intrusion events are known to cause short-term changes in within-group behavioural interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Braga Goncalves and Radford, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Bruintjes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taborsky, 1985</xref>). Crucially, <italic>N. pulcher</italic> is a highly tractable experimental system—they are easily maintained in captive conditions, where groups display natural behaviour and breed regularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Heg and Hamilton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jindal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wong and Balshine, 2011</xref>)—allowing controlled manipulations and detailed monitoring over extended periods.</p><p>To investigate the cumulative effect of elevated outgroup conflict on reproductive rate, investment (in eggs and parental care) and output, we simulated intrusions by neighbours at territorial borders in two long-term, laboratory experiments. We predicted that because repeated territorial intrusions are likely stressful and may destabilise social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arseneau-Robar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Morris-Drake et al., 2022</xref>), there would be effects on breeding and investment decisions as parents are selected to respond to prevailing ecological (environmental and social) conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carlisle, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McGinley et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Roff, 1992</xref>). For instance, organisms faced with prolonged challenging conditions may maximise survival at the cost of other functions such as reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beldade et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jørgensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Love and Williams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schreck et al., 2001</xref>), so we predicted a negative impact of outgroup conflict on reproductive rate in terms of spawning likelihood, latency to spawn, number of clutches produced, and inter-clutch interval. Female fish can modify egg investment depending on current intrinsic (e.g. maternal state and stress) and extrinsic (e.g. ecological) factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Faria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McCormick, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schreck, 2010</xref>), with trade-offs between egg number and quality apparent in stressful conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Faria et al., 2018</xref>). So, we predicted an effect of outgroup conflict on egg number, size (weight and volume), and nutritional (lipid and protein) content. Parental care extends the opportunity for adjustment of reproductive investment, allowing compensation for lower offspring quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carlisle, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Clutton-Brock, 1991</xref>) and poorer environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Östlund and Ahnesjö, 1998</xref>). So, we predicted an effect of outgroup conflict on clutch visits and egg caring effort. Since maternal and early-life stress, initial egg size and quality, and parental care can all influence offspring characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boogert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jonsson and Jonsson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McCormick, 1998</xref>), we predicted that outgroup conflict would directly or indirectly have a negative effect on reproductive output in terms of offspring survival, behaviour, and size.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In both our experiments (which used different fish), 30 tanks with breeding shelters were arranged linearly in triplets: the end ‘focal’ tanks (one for each of two treatments: 10 ‘Intruded’ and 10 ‘Control’ tanks per experiment) contained a dominant pair and a subordinate; the middle tank contained a dominant pair who comprised the shared neighbours used as intruders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Within each triplet, the same-sex dominants in all tanks and the subordinates in focal end tanks were size matched (using standard body length) at the start (see Materials and methods).

During intrusions, the focal group and the intruder were physically separated by a transparent partition that precluded adversaries from injuring each other and cannibalism of focal group young by intruders. Focal groups typically respond to the presence of intruders with aggressive behaviours, including attacks (rams and bites) and displays (aggressive postures, frontal displays, and fast approaches); intruders reciprocate with aggressive displays and attacks, but also with submissive postures and displays and by turning away from the focal group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reddon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sopinka et al., 2009</xref>). Control groups did not receive intrusions but did experience the same procedural disturbances as Intruded groups, in terms of the placement and removal of barriers (see Materials and methods). The aim of Experiment I was to assess the effects of chronic outgroup conflict on reproductive rate, parental care of eggs, hatching success, and offspring survival, behaviour, and size. So, following the first three intrusions (and equivalent time in Control groups), we allowed each group to raise all clutches produced over a 13-week period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Experiment II was a complement to Experiment I, aiming to assess how chronic outgroup conflict impacts reproductive investment in terms of egg size and nutritional content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); these are measures that can only be obtained by removing clutches. We therefore collected the first clutch produced by each group following 13 days of treatment, which represents approximately half of a reproductive cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jindal et al., 2017</xref>); the experiment ended for a focal group once that clutch was collected. For all response measures analysed, we provide in the main text the effect of treatment (Intruded and Control) and, where significant or near-significant, the interaction between treatment and treatment duration, as the factors of core interest. Full model outputs including all tested variables (significant or not) are detailed in the Supplementary files.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defensive behaviour</title><p>To assess whether the presence of a neighbour in their territory was perceived as an intrusion, we recorded defensive behaviour by focal groups in Experiment 1. Intruded groups exhibited 4.5 times more defensive actions than Control groups at the start of the study (Wilcoxon signed-ranked test: <italic>V</italic> = 0, <italic>n</italic> = 20, p = 0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); this difference persisted until the end of the experiment (4.7 times more defence; paired <italic>t</italic>-test: <italic>t</italic><sub>9</sub> = 4.33, p = 0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our protocol was therefore likely to have elevated the perceived level of outgroup conflict throughout the experimental period, as intended. Within the Intruded treatment, dominant individuals but not subordinates, increased their defensive efforts between the start and the end of the study (Wilcoxon signed-ranked test, DF: <italic>V</italic> = 4.5, <italic>n</italic> = 20, adjusted-p = 0.043; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, DM: <italic>t</italic><sub>9</sub> = 3.50, adjusted-p = 0.020; subordinates: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub> = −0.05, p = 0.963; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); this pattern was not driven by any significant changes in intruder responsiveness to the focal group (<italic>t</italic><sub>9</sub> = 0.55, p = 0.594). Greater defensive efforts by dominant individuals at the end of the study may be a by-product of age- or size-mediated behavioural changes—a positive effect of body size on defensive efforts has been documented in at least dominant males in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ligocki et al., 2019</xref>)—or may have been due to the presence of offspring that need safeguarding from intruders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dyble et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Defensive actions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Group defensive actions displayed per 10-min trial, towards a transparent partition (blue) or the intruding female neighbour (red) in weeks 1 and 11 of Experiment I (<italic>N</italic> = 20 groups).

The smaller size at 1 month of age indicates that outgroup conflict hinders early-life growth, despite unlimited access to food.

In the daffodil cichlid in particular, adult body size is a key determinant of lifetime reproductive success because it correlates positively with fecundity in females and with dominance acquisition in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Heg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wong and Balshine, 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our experimental results show that chronic elevation of outgroup conflict negatively affected inter-clutch intervals and investment in egg quality; whilst there was a compensatory positive influence on parental care, an increased outgroup threat ultimately resulted in fewer offspring of smaller size surviving to 1 month of age. Our findings are in-line with previous correlational work showing that greater levels of intergroup threat were associated with reductions in chimpanzee reproductive rate and offspring survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lemoine et al., 2020</xref>), but contrast the observational studies of crested macaques and banded mongooses that found a positive correlation between intergroup conflict and foetal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kerhoas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>). Tests of causal links between outgroup conflict and reproductive success have previously been lacking due to the inherent difficulties of carrying out long-term manipulations that allow cumulative fitness impacts to be assessed. We overcame this by using a model fish species that enables both extended manipulations in controlled conditions and the collection of behavioural and reproductive data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wong and Balshine, 2011</xref>). In doing so, we demonstrated that chronic outgroup conflict likely negatively impacts the fitness of multiple generations: adults suffer reductions in current reproductive output, whilst the lower quality of surviving offspring means that they are potentially less likely to achieve dominance and thus direct reproductive success later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Royle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wong and Balshine, 2011</xref>).</p><p>We uncovered outgroup-conflict effects in several aspects of reproductive investment and output that became stronger the longer the experimental treatment continued. These findings highlight that, to ascertain the full fitness consequences in social animals, it is important to consider both direct and indirect effects and to assess cumulative impacts in addition to those arising from single contests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Morris-Drake et al., 2022</xref>). Since outgroup conflict can be a potent social stressor, capable of stimulating acute and chronic stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Samuni et al., 2019</xref>), stress is a likely mechanism underpinning the reproductive consequences seen. Studies examining natural stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beldade et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Creel et al., 2009</xref>), and experimental manipulations of glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ensminger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Eriksen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McCormick, 1998</xref>), have demonstrated how stress can affect adult reproductive measures in ways similar to those uncovered in our work. For instance, chronic anemone bleaching and predation risk led to increased levels of stress hormones and reduced reproductive rates in the anemonefish, <italic>Amphiprion chrysopterus</italic>, and in elk, <italic>Cervus elaphus</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beldade et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Creel et al., 2009</xref>). Experimental increases in maternal cortisol levels negatively impacted egg protein content of Eastern fence lizards and larval length of the coral reef fish <italic>Pomacentrus amboinensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ensminger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McCormick, 1998</xref>). Higher rates of territorial defence have previously been associated with elevated cortisol levels in <italic>N. pulcher</italic> dominant females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Culbert et al., 2021</xref>), so treatment effects on maternal physiology could plausibly have contributed to the effects seen in our study. Likewise, early-life stressors can have long-lasting effects on offspring phenotypes and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antunes and Taborsky, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jonsson and Jonsson, 2014</xref>), so both direct and indirect effects may be important. Some of the fitness costs that we document here may also have been indirectly caused by outgroup conflict-mediated disruptions to within-group social relationships. Within-group aggression is promoted by the mere presence of neighbours in complex time-, rank-, and sex-dependent ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hellmann and Hamilton, 2019</xref>) and may be further dependent on the extent of interactions between residents and neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hamilton and Heg, 2005</xref>). Additionally, territorial intrusions can cause (at least) short-term changes to within-group social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Braga Goncalves and Radford, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Bruintjes et al., 2016</xref>). Cumulative effects of outgroup conflict are likely to have a wide influence, beyond reproductive success, and thus deserve further research attention moving forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Morris-Drake et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>There are obvious trade-offs in conducting captive versus field studies. In the context of cumulative outgroup-conflict consequences, long-term experimental manipulations are logistically and ethically challenging, which is why the few previous studies have reported only correlational data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kerhoas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lemoine et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>). Our captive experiments allowed for tight control of the environment and close monitoring of a variety of response measures, but consideration is needed of the ecological validity of the intrusion regime. Whilst intrusions in the wild might be, on average, shorter than our 10-min experimental presentations, there are several reasons to believe that outgroup conflict could be more severe in natural conditions. In the wild, <italic>N. pulcher</italic> groups are often surrounded by several adjacent groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Taborsky, 1984</xref>), so that territories are intruded from any direction by neighbours and outsiders from further afield. Therefore, intrusions likely take place several times daily, requiring continuous vigilance and quick behavioural responses, risking potential physical injury and leaving residents more vulnerable to predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balshine-Earn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balshine et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hess et al., 2016</xref>). Our setup also precluded individuals from injuring each other, the intruder from committing infanticide, sneaking a breeding attempt or taking-over part or all the territory, and individuals from having to trade-off foraging time against vigilance efforts (due to plentiful food availability), all in the absence of predation. Thus, relative to wild conditions, our laboratory intrusions were likely longer but less frequent and came from only one pair of neighbours, and posed relatively low threat to focal groups within an overall less challenging environment. Whilst we chronically increased the perception of outgroup conflict, allowing us to assess cumulative indirect effects of outgroup conflict (beyond injury, death, and infanticide), our findings are potentially conservative. Ultimately, future field experiments are needed to confirm the causal impact of chronic outgroup conflict on reproductive success, but many challenges will need to be overcome first.</p><p>We demonstrate that chronically increased outgroup conflict can reduce reproductive success, even in the absence of physical fights with rivals that may also result in injury, death, or loss of territory or breeding position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Goodall, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Spong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>), or cause offspring death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dyble et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>). Outgroup conflict can clearly, therefore, influence fitness in myriad ways, lending support to the theory that it is likely a powerful selective force in social evolution with respect to, for example, group dynamics, social structure, and cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bowles, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gaston, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wrangham, 1980</xref>).

In Experiment I, the 20 focal groups included 12 with female helpers and 8 with male helpers; within a triplet, experimental groups had same-sex helpers. In Experiment II, the 20 focal groups all had female helpers. Female helpers were favoured because although all subordinates face increasing risks of eviction as they grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taborsky, 1985</xref>), males are more likely to parasitise reproductive events resulting in eviction from the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dierkes et al., 1999</xref>) rendering groups less stable, and group size has been shown to affect egg parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Taborsky et al., 2007</xref>). To minimise same-sex aggression and to aid individual identification, we ensured that each dominant was at least 5 mm larger than the same-sex subordinate in the focal group (mean ± SE size difference, Experiment I: 10.7 ± 1.0 mm; Experiment II: 22.4 ± 1.3 mm). To minimise potential size-difference effects between treatments, and control for the influence of female size on reproductive measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Heg et al., 2011</xref>), we size-matched (in standard length) breeders in all tanks in a triplet to each other. At the start of Experiment I, focal-group dominant males were 55.2 ± 1.3 mm, dominant females were 53.4 ± 0.9 mm, subordinate males were 41.8 ± 0.9 mm and subordinate females were 44.3 ± 1.3 mm long, while males were 59.3 ± 2.6 mm and females were 54.8 ± 1.6 mm long in the middle-tank breeding pairs. At the start of Experiment II, focal-group dominant males were 73.1 ± 1.3 mm, dominant females were 64.4 ± 0.8 mm and subordinate females were 41.8 ± 1.0 mm long, while males were 71.4 ± 2.7 mm and females were 63.6 ± 1.8 mm long in the middle-tank breeding pairs.</p><p>For each triplet, we randomly allocated (by flip of a coin) the side tanks to one of two experimental treatments, Control and Intruded; the central tank provided the intruders used in the Intruded treatment. Experiment I spanned 13 weeks to allow for multiple spawning bouts; we destroyed clutches produced before groups had experienced at least three intrusions (Control = 1 clutch, Intruded = 2 clutches) as groups would likely not have been significantly affected by treatments within such a short timeframe. In Experiment II, following eight intrusions during the first 13 days, the first clutch produced by each group marked the end of treatment for that group; 2 weeks represents approximately half the time of a regular breeding cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Desjardins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jindal et al., 2017</xref>). Eleven clutches were destroyed during the initial 13 days of treatment (Control = 8 clutches, Intruded = 3 clutches). Previous destruction of a clutch had no significant impact on egg dry weight (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 0.21, p = 0.650), egg volume (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 0.05, p = 0.833), lipid content (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 0.16, p = 0.692), or protein content (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 0.89, p = 0.345). Experiment II was run for 11 weeks to maximise the number of focal groups that produced a clutch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Simulated territorial intrusions</title><p>We selected the side of the focal Intruded tank where each intrusion took place (near or far from the neighbour tank) and the identity of the intruder (male or female neighbour) pseudo-randomly: by flip of a coin, but no more than four of the same side or sex in a row. In the wild, dominant individuals of both sexes undertake regular forays to nearby territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jungwirth et al., 2015</xref>) and may, thus, return to their own territories from any direction. At the start of an intrusion (or equivalent in the Control tanks), we slid down one transparent and one opaque flexible partition (0.75 mm white ViPrint) through single-channel PVC tracks glued to the long walls, 8 cm from the tank edge, creating a side compartment at the edge of the territory of the focal group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Braga Goncalves et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Braga Goncalves and Radford, 2019</xref>). Then, we netted out the pre-selected neighbour and placed it in the side compartment of the focal tank, obscured from view of the resident group for a 5-min settling period. Brief handling experiences do not affect behaviour adversely in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Braga Goncalves and Radford, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mileva et al., 2009</xref>). After the settling period, we removed the opaque partition in the focal tank to reveal the intruder to the resident group for 10 min, a trial duration that falls comfortably with the range (5–20 min) often used in laboratory and field studies in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Desjardins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jungwirth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reyes-Contreras et al., 2019</xref>). At the end of the intrusion period, we replaced the opaque partition in the focal tank and placed another opaque partition between the focal and neighbour tanks, netted the intruder and transferred it back to the neighbour tank out of sight of the focal group. Concurrently, in the matching Control group, we conducted the same sequence of placement and removal of opaque and transparent partitions as in the Intruded tank, but in the absence of an intruder. To minimise the impact of human presence on the behaviour of the experimental subjects, the experimenter hid behind a curtain during the period that the intruder was visible to the resident group.</p><p>In Experiment I, we filmed (Sony Handycam HDR-XR520) two simulated intrusions, one at the start (week 1) and another towards the end (week 11) of the study, to assess how focal groups responded to the presence of a neighbour in their territory, and how their response changed over time. For consistency, all filmed intrusions had the female neighbour as intruder placed on the side of the tank closest to the neighbour tank. Similarly, we filmed the behavioural responses of the Control groups to the presence of the transparent partition in their territory. Subordinate sample size was smaller (<italic>N</italic> = 12) at the end of the study due to deaths unrelated to the experiment (fish jumped out of tank) and evictions (Control = 4, Intruded = 4). Following previously established protocols for this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reddon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sopinka et al., 2009</xref>), we recorded using JWatcher (v1.0; Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia) the frequencies of aggressive behaviours, including attacks (rams and bites) and aggressive displays (aggressive postures, frontal displays, and fast approaches), directed at the intruder or the transparent partition by each group member. From the Intruded videos, we also recorded intruder responsiveness towards the focal group, by assessing proportion of time active and facing the focal group, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Braga Goncalves and Radford, 2019</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Reproductive rate</title><p>To assess the impact of outgroup conflict on the likelihood of spawning, latency to spawn, number of clutches produced, and mean inter-clutch interval (Experiment I), we scanned all focal tanks every day for new clutches.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Investment in eggs</title><p>To evaluate the impact of outgroup conflict on clutch size, we photographed all clutches in Experiment I (<italic>N</italic> = 34) the day after they were laid and counted the numbers of eggs using ImageJ (version 1.46r, National Institutes of Health, USA). Hatching success could only be assessed in a subset of clutches (<italic>N</italic> = 21) because the hatchlings of several clutches took cover on the sand or on the plant and could not be counted reliably.</p><p>To evaluate the impact of outgroup conflict on egg size and nutritional content, we separated from each clutch in Experiment II: (1) 10–12 eggs for assessment of egg size; (2) two samples of 6–11 eggs for lipid analysis; and (3) two samples of 5 eggs for protein analysis. Two clutches (1 Control, 1 Intruded) were laid over 2 days; we collected two samples for egg-size assessment from these clutches. Samples (2) and (3) were stored at −20°C until extraction.</p><p>Using the egg-size sample, we measured the length and width of each egg with a stereo microscope (×2 magnification) and a graticule. We then calculated the effective diameter of each egg (i.e. the diameter if it were perfectly round) as the cube root of the length multiplied by the square of the width, and used the effective diameter to calculate the volume assuming a spherical shape (as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Coleman, 1984</xref>). We used all egg volumes from each sample in the analysis. After the eggs were individually measured, all eggs from the same clutch were placed together in a petri dish with wax paper and dried in a heating cupboard at 70°C for 48 hr, weighed twice (ME5, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany), returned to the heating cupboard for another 24 hr and weighed twice again; all four measurements were used in the analysis.</p><p>To assess the total lipid content of eggs, we used the colorimetric sulfo-phosphato-vanillin method for microquantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alqurashi et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, we dried the samples at 70°C for 24 hr and weighed them twice to the nearest microgram (CPA26P, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). We transferred the samples into 15 ml round-bottom glass test tubes (16 × 150 mm) and crushed them with a glass rod before adding 10 ml of chloroform–methanol solution (1:1, vol/vol). We extracted 0.5 ml of supernatant from each sample into new test tubes and placed them in a dry bath (LSE single block digital; Corning Ltd, Barry, UK) at 100°C for 15 min to evaporate the solvent. After, we added 0.2 ml of sulphuric acid to the samples and placed them in the dry bath for a further 10 min. Once the samples had cooled to room temperature, we added 4.8 ml of vanillin- ortho-phosphoric acid 85% reagent (1.2 g/l), thoroughly mixed the samples for 30 s with a vortex mixer (Bibby Scientific, Stone, UK), and transferred 1 ml of the solution into 1 ml polystyrene semi micro cuvettes. Using a spectrophotometer (WPA Biowave UV/Vis; Biochrom Ltd, Cambridge, UK) at 525 nm, calibrated with a vanillin/phosphoric acid only blank, we took three absorbance readings from each sample and calculated their mean. The mean sample absorbance values were plotted against a standard curve to extrapolate their total lipid content (µg). The standard curve was prepared using eight serial dilutions of analytical soybean oil solution (0.917 g/ml, Sigma Aldrich) in methanol:chloroform (1:1).</p><p>To assess the total protein content of eggs, we used the Bradford method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bradford, 1976</xref>) following specifications by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alasmari and Wall, 2020</xref>. The egg samples were transferred into 15 ml round-bottom borosilicate glass test tubes (16 × 150 mm) and crushed with a glass rod. We added 0.5 ml of phosphate buffer (100 mM of monopotassium phosphate [KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>], 1 mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 1 mM of dithiothreitol dissolved in distilled water), mixed with an aqueous solution of potassium phosphate dibasic (K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) to achieve pH = 7.4 to dissolve the sample, followed by another 0.5 ml of buffer to clean the glass rod. After, we thoroughly mixed the samples for 30 s with a vortex mixer (Bibby Scientific, Stone, UK), we transferred 0.1 ml into new tubes, added 2.9 ml of buffer, and vortexed the new solutions for another 30 s to perform 1:30 dilutions. From these dilutions, we transferred 1 ml of the solution into a new tube, added 1 ml of Bradford reagent, and vortexed the resulting solution for 1 min. After waiting 5 min at room temperature, we transferred 1 ml of the solution into 1 ml polystyrene semi micro cuvettes and read the absorbance values on a spectrophotometer at 595 nm, calibrated with a buffer and Bradford reagent-only blank. Each sample was measured three times and the mean value was plotted against a standard curve to extrapolate the total protein content in the sample. The standard curve was prepared using eight serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml, Sigma) between 0 and 50 µl diluted in buffer to a total volume of 1 ml. Protein content estimates were multiplied by 30 to express protein content per egg (µg).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Investment in parental care</title><p>To assess the impact of outgroup conflict on parental care, we filmed (Sony Handycam HDR-XR520) each focal group in Experiment I for 10 min on the morning after a clutch was laid, before they experienced an intrusion that day. Parental care at the egg stage, consisting of fanning and cleaning the eggs, aids embryonic development and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Taborsky, 1984</xref>). From the videos, we recorded the number of clutch visits (visits to within a body length of the clutch) and parental-care behaviours (egg-cleaning and clutch-fanning combined) displayed by all group members, as well as the total time spent in clutch visits and in parental-care behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Reproductive output</title><p>To assess the impact of outgroup conflict on offspring survival, we visually counted the number of surviving fry on the day that they reached 1-month post-hatching in Experiment I (<italic>N</italic> = 32 broods). To count offspring numbers in larger clutches reliably, we temporarily divided the tanks into three sections using transparent partitions and counted the number of offspring in each section separately. All counts were done twice to confirm totals; where values differed, we counted young a third time and either took the confirmed number of young or calculated the mean number from the three counts.</p><p>To assess the impacts of outgroup conflict on offspring activity levels and response to a sudden stimulus, we tested offspring at 1-month post-hatching. At this age, offspring actively explore the territory (i.e. swim around the tank) and, when they perceive a conflict, they sink to the substrate and remain immobile to blend with the sandy background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Taborsky, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Watve and Taborsky, 2019</xref>). A sample of 5–10 offspring (<italic>N</italic> = 21 clutches) was transferred from their home tank to a test container (20 × 20 × 10 cm), filled with 3 l of water from their home tank, and left to settle for 30 min before the commencement of a trial. Each trial was filmed (Sony Handycam HDR-XR520) from above. After an initial 5 min undisturbed, pre-stimulus period, we released a small glass marble in a 60-cm plastic tube placed at a right angle relative to and touching the side of the container, so that the marble produced sudden vibrations and noise as it hit the container. We then filmed offspring behaviour for a 5-min post-stimulus period. We calculated mean offspring activity level pre-stimulus by observing 3 s of film every 20 s and recording how many offspring were actively swimming during that period. We also took screenshots every 20 s during the 5 min pre-stimulus period, from which we measured the mean nearest-neighbour distance of the offspring. From the post-stimulus period, we recorded the latency for all individuals to become immobile in response to the stimulus and the latency for the first offspring to become active again.</p><p>After the startle-stimulus trials, we euthanised the offspring with an overdose of tricaine methanesulfonate (MS222, 12 ml/ 100 ml tank water) and stored them in a 30% ethanol freshwater solution, shown to be adequate for simultaneously preserving body tissues and minimising shrinkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gagliano et al., 2006</xref>). We measured offspring standard length (from the tip of the snout to the end of the caudal peduncle, ±0.01 mm) using Leica Application Suite (version 4.4.0 [Build:454], Leica Microsystems Limited, Switzerland) connected to a camera (Greenough Stereozoom ×0.8 manual) mounted on a stereo microscope (EZ4 HD, eyepiece ×10/21B). Immediately after measuring the offspring, we dried them for 36 hr at 70°C before weighing them individually on a Mettler scale (AE260, Delta Range, ±0.1 mg). We then used the individual measurements to calculate mean offspring standard length and dry weight per clutch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using RStudio (version 1.2.5033, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">RStudio, 2020</xref>). In Experiment I, we used paired <italic>t</italic>-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (depending on whether datasets met the assumptions of parametric testing or not, respectively) to assess intruder behaviour and defensive contributions between treatments and within individuals at the start and end of the study; the latter were adjusted using the Bonferroni–Holm sequential method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dobson and Barnett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Holm, 1979</xref>). We used a McNemar test and a Wilcoxon rank sum test to assess treatment differences in the likelihood of spawning and in the number of clutches produced, respectively.</p><p>For all other analyses, we used mixed-effects models. We visually assessed model assumptions and performance using the package ‘performance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lüdecke et al., 2021</xref>). Where appropriate, we fitted LMMs with Gaussian error distributions to the raw data (package ‘lme4’ version 1.1-21, 99). Where datasets did not fit the assumptions of linear models, we fitted appropriate GLMMs where possible: a GLMM with negative binomial error distribution and log-link function (package ‘glmmTMB’ version 1.1.2.3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brooks et al., 2017</xref>) for the analyses of the number of nest visits and clutch caring events; and a GLMM with Gaussian error distribution and log-link function (package ‘lme4’ version 1.1-21, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) for the analyses of time spent on clutch care. We log<sub>10</sub>-transformed latency to spawn to conform with linearity assumptions. The analysis of number of offspring to survive to 1 month of age included clutch size at laying as an offset. All models included tank-triplet identity and, where relevant, focal-group identity nested within tank-triplet identity as random factors to control for the shared neighbours within each triplet and for repeated observations for groups, respectively. Our main fixed factors of interest were treatment (Intruded and Control) and its interaction with treatment duration (covariate); we controlled for the effects of several covariates in different models as appropriate (full details of factors used in each analysis are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>In each model, we assessed term significance by comparing a model with and without the specific term using likelihood ratio tests (chi-square tests using R function ‘anova’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dobson and Barnett, 2008</xref>). Non-significant interaction terms were removed to enable us to assess the effects of the main factors independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dobson and Barnett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Engqvist, 2005</xref>); the resulting final models contained all mains factors and significant interaction terms. The effects of significant interactions between treatment and treatment duration were teased apart by analysing the effect of treatment duration on each treatment separately.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Dyble (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Eliminate stepwise model selection procedure to minimize the risk of false positives. Report either betas and p-values from the full model, or via removal of the effect of interest from the full model, followed by comparison of model fit (e.g., using likelihood ratio tests).</p><p>2) Explain the experimental paradigm early in the manuscript to facilitate interpretation by readers. Key points include the fact that the intrusion paradigm involved no actual physical contact, and that in Experiment 2, all clutches prior to Day 13 were destroyed. Clearly motivate the analyses that are later presented in the Results section by reference to description of the experimental paradigm.</p><p>3) Intergroup conflict effects on the number of surviving offspring, the closest proxy to fitness used here, are one of the most important results of the paper. If possible, present a straightforward comparison of this outcome for the treatment versus control groups across the duration of the experiment, along with a simple analysis of the magnitude of this difference (e.g., using a paired t-test). Clarify the degree to which conflict effects on surviving offspring are magnified over time (e.g., in terms of the % of additional surviving offspring in the control group, across a given number of days since the start of the experiment).</p><p>4) Pay close attention to the reviewer recommendations on statistical analysis below, especially consistency in declaring effects &quot;significant&quot;/&quot;near significant&quot; and reporting of &quot;near-significant&quot; effects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– To address my concern about stepwise model reduction, the authors should report the significance of each effect by comparing the fit of a full model to that of a model without that effect. A second option would be to remove only non-significant interaction terms, if the goal is mainly to investigate the fixed effects (Enqvist 2005 An. Beh., but see Shielzeth 2010 Meth. Ecol. Evo.). I often take the second approach in my own work, but am realizing that the first approach may be more appropriate.</p><p>– To address my concern about a lack of clear hypotheses, the authors could outline why each specific metric was measured and why each relates to fitness early on (e.g., at the beginning of each paragraph or at the end of the Introduction).</p><p>Comments below are line-by-line</p><p>Title: &quot;outgroup conflict&quot; might be a less widely-used term than &quot;intergroup conflict&quot; in this literature. For example, the titles of most of the first 10 references in this paper use &quot;intergroup&quot; instead of &quot;outgroup&quot;. Consider using &quot;intergroup&quot; instead of &quot;outgroup&quot;.</p><p>– Line 43: consider citing Green et al., 2020, which is a review of intergroup contest studies and how they focus on factors like the determinants of intergroup contest success. Green PA, Briffa M, Cant MA. 2020. Assessment during intergroup contests Trends Ecol Evol. 36(2):139-150.</p><p>– Line 47: consider citing Preston et al., 2020, which looked at short-term and longer-term (3 days) changes in grooming and aggressive behavior within groups after simulated intergroup conflict. Preston EFR, Thompson FJ, Ellis S, Kyambulima S, Croft DP, Cant MA. 2020. Network‐level consequences of outgroup threats in banded mongooses: Grooming and aggression between the sexes. J Anim Ecol.</p><p>– Lines 54-55: I had trouble telling whether there was a timescale difference in these three studies. Did the studies truly differ in a focus on &quot;foetal survival&quot; (first two) versus &quot;infant survival&quot; (third)?</p><p>– Lines 56-57: It would be useful to have some more detail about why we really need these experiments. What is missing from those observational studies that an experimental study could really help us learn? Put another way, can you give more details on the importance of this &quot;causal link&quot;?</p><p>– Lines 88-96: It's unclear to me from these results and Figure 2 why a Wilcoxon test versus a t-test was used for certain tests. My assumption is that this relates to the normality of the data distributions. Perhaps a simpler way to get at the same question would be to build a linear mixed model predicting # of defensive behaviors from treatment, time, and individual type (dominant male/female, subordinate)?</p><p>– Results in general: I'm a bit confused as to why significant effects are reported for certain interaction terms, and then also for each level of the interaction. For example, lines 180-184 detail the significant interaction (and associated P-value from a Chi-squared test), as well as reporting t-values and P-values from each level of the interaction (e.g., treatment duration effects within each treatment). I believe just reporting the P-value from the Chi-squared test for the interaction term shows that the interaction is significant, which should then be followed by simpler reporting of the estimate for each level of the interaction. It seems unnecessary to test whether each level of the interaction is also significant.</p><p>– Results in general: There are several examples where the authors report &quot;trending&quot; or nearly-significant results that match their predictions (e.g., lines 161-163; 193-194; 216-217; 266). However, there are also instances in the reporting of the statistical models in which similarly trending factors were removed from statistical models (e.g., Table S2; S4; S6; S8; S9). I believe some of these removed values were reported in the results (e.g., line 266 matches to Table S9). However, it is confusing to understand why certain terms were removed from the statistical models, especially if they are reported in the Results (i.e. we can assume the authors consider these are important). See above for comments regarding statistical analyses.</p><p>– Figure 3 and all scatterplots: are these lines showing best fit from the LMM, i.e. the estimates from the LMM? Or are they plotting simply using a function like geom_smooth in ggplot? Showing the actual predicted estimates from the model on the scatterplot would give the reader a better idea of both the raw data (from the points) and the model estimates (from the lines and associated ribbons of confidence intervals). There are also methods to do this for boxplots. All of these methods can be accomplished using the &quot;effects&quot; package in R.</p><p>– Lines 166-168: This is a bit confusing, because I thought the protein and lipid analyses were only conducted in Experiment II on eggs from the first clutch? So, how can conclusions about protein/lipids in the eggs from later clutches be made if only the first clutch was analyzed? Or, is this because clutches were analyzed across groups, i.e., several clutches for a given focal group were not analyzed, but across the entire experiment the first clutch from each group gave a time effect?</p><p>– Figure 4B: There appears to be an outlier with an incredibly high number of cleaning events at approximately 60 days treatment duration in the Intruded group. It would be useful to know if there are any biological differences between this observation and the others. Also, if this is a statistical outlier, it would be useful to know whether removing it affects the results. While I don't suggest the removal of statistical outliers simply because they're outliers (i.e., there should be a biological reason for data to be removed), it's important to take not of any outlier values like this.</p><p>– Lines 219-224: I might be being dense here, but I'm unsure of what this sentence is saying. How is the relationship (or lack thereof) between the number of hatched fry and the number of offspring reaching 1 month of age not offspring survival? It seems from Table S7 that there was a difference between offspring survival to 1 month and survival from hatching to one month. I guess I'm having trouble understanding why we need both of these measures.</p><p>– Lines 257-259: Could another interpretation of the return to activity data be regarding boldness? That is, offspring from Intruded groups were bolder later on in the experiment?</p><p>– Lines 277-280: However, your results are counter to those of other studies you described in the Introduction, which found no or positive effects of intergroup conflict on reproduction and survival. Consider re-reporting that work here, as well, for consistency and clarity.</p><p>– Paragraph lines 311-340: I'm a bit confused as to the point of this paragraph. I understand the authors may want to compare the pros and cons of their experimental approach to a more field-based, correlational approach. However, the result of this comparison mainly convinces me that the experiment under-stressed the study animals, as compared to what they might experience in the wild. Further, the reporting of the lack of impacts on adult body mass, egg mass, etc… essentially make the point that the treatment did not affect groups much. This is counter to the rest of the paper's point, showing that groups were significantly affected. Do the authors have any hypotheses as to why they found specific results for the variables they did (e.g., egg protein, but not egg mass)? Do the authors have any thoughts or data on the relative reproductive success of these experimental groups compared to groups in the wild? I.e., are these experiments actually replicating stressors in the wild?</p><p>Methods line-by-line</p><p>– Lines 408-411: If one of the points of the present experiment was understanding the effects of short- versus long-term intergroup conflict, why destroy clutches produced before three intrusions? Wouldn't these give valuable information on short-term effects (or the lack thereof)?</p><p>– Line 549: was the number of offspring in the experiment considered as a factor predicting responses? In Table S8, I believe &quot;number of offspring&quot; is used as a fixed effect, but I was unclear as to whether that was number of offspring produced, or number used in the startle experiment. One might expect that the experimentally-designed groups with 10 offspring were different from those with 5.</p><p>– Lines 550-551: Was there any sand in the bottom of this startle tank? I would imagine that offspring sinking responses, if meant to blend into the substrate, would be different if there were no substrate to blend in to.</p><p>– Lines 585-589: Stepwise model reduction has come under heavy criticism in the past 15 years. See, for example, Forstmeier and Schielzeth (2011), Mundry and Nunn (2009), and Harrison et al., (2018). This process can greatly increase the likelihood of false-positive results, and can inflate parameter estimates. From my knowledge, removal of non-significant interaction terms is OK, if one is interested in achieving accurate parameter estimates for main effects. However, it is rarely advised to remove main effects. Ideally, the authors would report significance tests from the full model, or use information-theoretic approaches. However, the authors could consider removing only non-significant interaction terms, as a means of getting better estimates for the main effects (Engqvist 2005).</p><p>Forstmeier W, Schielzeth H. 2011.

It's very unclear to me why you wouldn't simply fit an appropriate response variable distribution in the initial model fitting step. For example, why not just use a Poisson distribution for the number of caring events response variable? This reads as though all response variables were forced into a Gaussian distribution. Other distributions are appropriate for other types of data, and do not require this step. I might be misunderstanding, however.</p><p>– Lines 609-612: I'm unclear as to why these clutches with zero hatching success were removed. The reasons these clutches had zero hatching success seem incredibly relevant to the study: if a clutch was eaten it seems evidence of cannibalism by the focal group (see lines 227-230 for a statement relevant to cannibalism in this species). If the clutch had a fungal infection, it would seem that the focal group's lack of care could have resulted in an infection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My recommendations are superficial. My main comment is that I was frustrated by the cursory description of the experimental set up prior to the results. I know the <italic>eLife</italic> format is for the methods to go at the end of the manuscript but I really do think that at the very least the authors ought to explain how the simulated intrusions were enacted.

Clarifying the set of behaviors coded as &quot;defensive action&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I think the authors have done a great job of addressing my and the other reviewers' concerns. I am glad that the statistical suggestions have helped simplify the message, which is still an engaging and exciting one. I also greatly appreciate the laying out of predictions and the details of the methods early on. This will hopefully help readers get oriented. I have one main point, which I lay out first, and then a few line-by-line comments. I don't believe any of these comments are likely to change the main message of the manuscript.</p><p>Main comment:</p><p>On line ~680-681 in the Methods, the authors say they &quot;provide significant parameter estimates…in the main text.&quot; However, looking at the Supplemental Tables in comparison to what is reported in the main text, only some significant effects are reported in the main text, not all. I'm curious as to why this is. For example, in the analysis of inter-clutch interval (Supp Table 1), female size had a highly significant effect (P = 0.017) but only the effect of treatment was discussed in the Results (lines 180-181). Similarly, in the analysis of egg investment, only the near-significant effect of the interaction between treatment and treatment duration was discussed (lines 195-197), but not the significant fixed effect of treatment. Also, an effect of clutch size on protein content and an effect of treatment x female size on protein content (Supp Table 3) were unreported in the Results. If these significant, but unreported, effects are not of interest, then one might ask why they were included in the model in the first place (aside from where necessary, like the treatment main effect when there is an interaction of interest). Or, are these omissions due to space constraints? There is likely a simple way to include a fuller reporting of these results. E.g., around line 195 the authors could report that &quot;…there was a significant effect of treatment duration on clutch size (STATS HERE). This was likely driven by the interaction between treatment and treatment duration, in which Intruded females….&quot; Or, an alternative would be in the Methods to state clearly that the authors only report selected results relevant to their hypotheses, but that some significant findings are reported only in the Supplementary Tables.</p><p>Line by line:</p><p>Lines 103 and 107: For the other predictions the authors make directional predictions, e.g. a negative effect. Can they specify the direction of the effect here? Or, are there no directional predictions?</p><p>Lines 132-151: These details are incredibly helpful! Thanks for including them.</p><p>Figure 3D: There are two red points at the end of treatment duration, right in the path of the line for the control (blue) effect. Are these points miscolored? It could just be an incredible chance that the line for control goes right through these intruded points, but I would also expect the 95% CI ribbon for intruded to be wider if these points are from the intruded treatment.</p><p>Supp Table 4A, Figure 4A, and lines 656-663: I could be wrong, but I would imagine that the number of clutch visits analysis should also be done using negative binomial error distribution, or a Poisson distribution. It is also count data, just like the number of clutch caring events.</p><p>All figures with categorical predictors (e.g., &quot;treatment&quot;): It would be useful to include some type of asterisk system (e.g., * = P &lt; 0.05, ** = P &lt; 0.01, NS = P &gt; 0.05…) for delineating P values in these figures. Especially in Figure 5, where 5C is significant (P = 0.028) and 5D is not (P = 0.089), the reader cannot see these differences at a glance. The authors do something like this in Figure 2, but not in other figures. Of course, we can discuss issues about whether P values really represent biological significance, but since that's the framework we're working under here, it would be useful to reflect in the figures.</p><p>Lines 332-336: Though I think this point is likely correct, the authors did not actually show how the experiment impacted the later dominance and reproductive success of the offspring. Therefore, I might suggest revising this to &quot;…outgroup conflict likely negatively impacts the fitness of multiple generations….&quot;</p><p>Methods lines 534-536: This is incredibly nit-picky, but I'm mostly curious. Why were there such varying numbers of eggs removed for the lipid versus protein analyses?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I enjoyed reading this paper again, and the authors now do a much better job of explaining the experimental set-up prior to the results. The only thing I still think is missing is a brief description (prior to the results) of how the animals behave during the experimentally induced conflicts and a definition of what &quot;defensive actions&quot; involve. A few small additions should suffice, and add important context. I would suggest promoting the descriptions of the behaviours coded as defensive (headbutting, displays, etc) from L514 to the results paragraph starting at L129. It would also be good to hear a little more about the behaviour of the &quot;intruder&quot;. Did they frequently antagonise their neighbours, or exhibit aggressive displays or attacks?</p><p>Otherwise, the authors have satisfactorily addressed my comments and, for my part, I see no reason that this paper shouldn't be published – it is very interesting!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72567.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Eliminate stepwise model selection procedure to minimize the risk of false positives.

We have included the reason for each of the experiments, in terms of what response measurements were obtained in each case (Experiment I: lines 135–137; Experiment II: lines 139–141).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Intergroup conflict effects on the number of surviving offspring, the closest proxy to fitness used here, are one of the most important results of the paper. If possible, present a straightforward comparison of this outcome for the treatment versus control groups across the duration of the experiment, along with a simple analysis of the magnitude of this difference (e.g., using a paired t-test). Clarify the degree to which conflict effects on surviving offspring are magnified over time (e.g., in terms of the % of additional surviving offspring in the control group, across a given number of days since the start of the experiment).</p></disp-quote><p>In redoing our analyses (see response to point 1 above), the storyline relating to number of offspring surviving became simpler: the absolute number of offspring surviving decreased with treatment duration in the Intruded treatment but not in the Control treatment (lines 260–265). This provides a very straightforward comparison (see Figure 5A). [NB It is not possible to use a simple t-test because several groups produced multiple clutches with offspring surviving to 1-month, hence our use of mixed models.] We have provided a simple indicator of the reduced offspring survival likelihood in Intruded groups cf. Control groups across time (lines 265–267).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Pay close attention to the reviewer recommendations on statistical analysis below, especially consistency in declaring effects &quot;significant&quot;/&quot;near significant&quot; and reporting of &quot;near-significant&quot; effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made sure that we are consistent in the presentation of results. We have made it clear that in the main text we are presenting the main treatment effect (whether significant or not) and, when significant or near-significant, the interaction between treatment and treatment duration (lines 144–147); these are the factors of core interest. All other factors in models are those that we are controlling for and so are provided in full in the Supplementary Tables (lines 147–148).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– To address my concern about stepwise model reduction, the authors should report the significance of each effect by comparing the fit of a full model to that of a model without that effect. A second option would be to remove only non-significant interaction terms, if the goal is mainly to investigate the fixed effects (Enqvist 2005 An. Beh., but see Shielzeth 2010 Meth. Ecol. Evo.). I often take the second approach in my own work, but am realizing that the first approach may be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the second approach suggested by the reviewer, because our main terms of interest were the factor ‘treatment’ and its interaction with the ‘treatment duration’, and thus we wanted to be able to assess to effect of treatment on its own, when interactions involving treatment were found to be not significant. We have explained this approach in the Methods (lines 663–670).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To address my concern about a lack of clear hypotheses, the authors could outline why each specific metric was measured and why each relates to fitness early on (e.g., at the beginning of each paragraph or at the end of the Introduction).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new paragraph at the end of the Introduction (line 86ff.) providing explicit reasons for specific predictions relating to our response variables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments below are line-by-line</p><p>Title: &quot;outgroup conflict&quot; might be a less widely-used term than &quot;intergroup conflict&quot; in this literature.

Did the studies truly differ in a focus on &quot;foetal survival&quot; (first two) versus &quot;infant survival&quot; (third)?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that there is a difference between these studies. Our understanding is that all three of them considered (at least as part of their studies) the impact of intergroup conflict during pregnancy (which is the focus of our sentence; lines 60). Whereas Kerhoas et al., 2014 and Thompson et al., 2017 found positive correlations of prenatal intergroup conflict with foetal survival, Lemoine et al., 2020 did not obviously consider that response measure but did find a negative correlation of prenatal intergroup conflict on inter-birth intervals and post-birth (infant) survival. So, we have left this sentence as is.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 56-57: It would be useful to have some more detail about why we really need these experiments. What is missing from those observational studies that an experimental study could really help us learn? Put another way, can you give more details on the importance of this &quot;causal link&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>It is a fundamental tenet of scientific research that correlations found in observational data could arise due to confounding effects. For instance, a positive correlation between outgroup conflict and improved foetal survival might be because groups with better-quality territories engage in more interactions with neighbours (who are after those resources) but those resources mean that mothers are in better condition; outgroup conflict per se is not necessarily driving the reproductive effect seen. Experiments are needed to test causality because they can isolate the effect of a particular variable (in this case, outgroup conflict). We have added a sentence to the Introduction explaining the general need for experiments (lines 64–66).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 88-96: It's unclear to me from these results and Figure 2 why a Wilcoxon test versus a t-test was used for certain tests. My assumption is that this relates to the normality of the data distributions. Perhaps a simpler way to get at the same question would be to build a linear mixed model predicting # of defensive behaviors from treatment, time, and individual type (dominant male/female, subordinate)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we chose the most appropriate statistical test (parametric vs non-parametric) depending on consideration of the relevant assumptions (lines 638–639). We were specifically interested in whether any or all categories of individuals had shown signs of having habituated to our simulated intrusions. The fact that none of the categories of individuals decreased their defensive contributions—indeed, both dominants increased their defensive actions towards the intruder—shows that groups did not habituate to our treatment and that they continued to perceive the intruded in their territory as a threat (lines 158–159). Using a linear mixed model with a three-way interaction term would not, in our view, be a simpler way of considering this; since this is also not the core aspect of the paper, but rather a check that intruders were indeed viewed as a threat throughout the experiment, we would rather leave this as is.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results in general: I'm a bit confused as to why significant effects are reported for certain interaction terms, and then also for each level of the interaction. For example, lines 180-184 detail the significant interaction (and associated P-value from a Chi-squared test), as well as reporting t-values and P-values from each level of the interaction (e.g., treatment duration effects within each treatment). I believe just reporting the P-value from the Chi-squared test for the interaction term shows that the interaction is significant, which should then be followed by simpler reporting of the estimate for each level of the interaction. It seems unnecessary to test whether each level of the interaction is also significant.</p></disp-quote><p>Testing each level of treatment is key to interpreting the results of the main analyses; without testing the treatments separately following a significant treatment*treatment duration interaction, it is not possible to state conclusively whether and how the simulated intrusions impacted the groups over time. For instance, while egg volume increases over time in the Control treatment but remains stable in the Intruded treatment (Figure 3C), egg protein content remains stable in the Control treatment but decreases significantly over time in the Intruded treatment (Figure 3D). Reporting just a significant interaction does not by itself describe the nature of the effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results in general: There are several examples where the authors report &quot;trending&quot; or nearly-significant results that match their predictions (e.g., lines 161-163; 193-194; 216-217; 266). However, there are also instances in the reporting of the statistical models in which similarly trending factors were removed from statistical models (e.g., Table S2; S4; S6; S8; S9). I believe some of these removed values were reported in the results (e.g., line 266 matches to Table S9). However, it is confusing to understand why certain terms were removed from the statistical models, especially if they are reported in the Results (i.e. we can assume the authors consider these are important). See above for comments regarding statistical analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>In redoing our analyses in light of earlier comments, this issue has been resolved (see earlier responses).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3 and all scatterplots: are these lines showing best fit from the LMM, i.e. the estimates from the LMM? Or are they plotting simply using a function like geom_smooth in ggplot? Showing the actual predicted estimates from the model on the scatterplot would give the reader a better idea of both the raw data (from the points) and the model estimates (from the lines and associated ribbons of confidence intervals). There are also methods to do this for boxplots. All of these methods can be accomplished using the &quot;effects&quot; package in R.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replotted all result figures in light of the feedback. We plotted figure 2 panels using the package “ggPaired” that allowed us to connect the datapoints from the same group/individual.

To visualise main treatment effects (or lack thereof), we used the package “jtools” to plot predicted means and associated 95% confidence intervals alongside the raw data (Figure 3A, Figure 4C, Figure 5C, D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 166-168: This is a bit confusing, because I thought the protein and lipid analyses were only conducted in Experiment II on eggs from the first clutch? So, how can conclusions about protein/lipids in the eggs from later clutches be made if only the first clutch was analyzed? Or, is this because clutches were analyzed across groups, i.e., several clutches for a given focal group were not analyzed, but across the entire experiment the first clutch from each group gave a time effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We have resolved this confusion by clearly delineating results arising from Experiment I and Experiment II, and not combining them in the same sentence. It is correct that protein and lipid analyses were only from Experiment II (lines 139–141); these results can be found in a Results paragraph relating only to that Experiment (line 203ff.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4B: There appears to be an outlier with an incredibly high number of cleaning events at approximately 60 days treatment duration in the Intruded group. It would be useful to know if there are any biological differences between this observation and the others. Also, if this is a statistical outlier, it would be useful to know whether removing it affects the results. While I don't suggest the removal of statistical outliers simply because they're outliers (i.e., there should be a biological reason for data to be removed), it's important to take not of any outlier values like this.</p></disp-quote><p>There was nothing noteworthy about this group or this particular clutch to justify its removal from the dataset: it was the third clutch produced by the female during the study, was the 8<sup>th</sup> largest clutch recorded and had the 13<sup>th</sup> highest hatching success; only three fry survived to 1 month (so no behavioural data were collected), but they were of average size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 219-224: I might be being dense here, but I'm unsure of what this sentence is saying. How is the relationship (or lack thereof) between the number of hatched fry and the number of offspring reaching 1 month of age not offspring survival? It seems from Table S7 that there was a difference between offspring survival to 1 month and survival from hatching to one month. I guess I'm having trouble understanding why we need both of these measures.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that including both these measures was superfluous and somewhat confusing. In redoing our analyses in the ways suggested (see above), a simpler story emerged in relation to offspring survival. We thus now simply present one, clear-cut analysis (lines 260–267) and associated figure (Figure 5A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 257-259: Could another interpretation of the return to activity data be regarding boldness? That is, offspring from Intruded groups were bolder later on in the experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>In principle, repeated territorial intrusions could lead to the production of increasingly bolder offspring. However, we did not find any complementary evidence for boldness (e.g., greater pre-stimulus activity levels or increased nearest-neighbour distances) so do not think there is strong justification for including this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 277-280: However, your results are counter to those of other studies you described in the Introduction, which found no or positive effects of intergroup conflict on reproduction and survival. Consider re-reporting that work here, as well, for consistency and clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included explicit mention of those other studies at this point in the Discussion (lines 320–322).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Paragraph lines 311-340: I'm a bit confused as to the point of this paragraph. I understand the authors may want to compare the pros and cons of their experimental approach to a more field-based, correlational approach. However, the result of this comparison mainly convinces me that the experiment under-stressed the study animals, as compared to what they might experience in the wild. Further, the reporting of the lack of impacts on adult body mass, egg mass, etc… essentially make the point that the treatment did not affect groups much. This is counter to the rest of the paper's point, showing that groups were significantly affected. Do the authors have any hypotheses as to why they found specific results for the variables they did (e.g., egg protein, but not egg mass)? Do the authors have any thoughts or data on the relative reproductive success of these experimental groups compared to groups in the wild? I.e., are these experiments actually replicating stressors in the wild?</p></disp-quote><p>We have simplified the message here. The core point of our paper is that the experimental tests showed various impacts of outgroup conflict on reproduction, ultimately resulting in fewer and smaller young surviving to 1 month of age. Whilst our experimental intrusions were possibly longer than would be seen in the wild, there are several reasons to expect greater effects in the wild (lines 373–375). Ultimately, future studies would beneficially conduct wild-based experiments, although those are logistically very challenging and have important ethical considerations (lines 390–392).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods line-by-line</p><p>– Lines 408-411: If one of the points of the present experiment was understanding the effects of short- versus long-term intergroup conflict, why destroy clutches produced before three intrusions? Wouldn't these give valuable information on short-term effects (or the lack thereof)?</p></disp-quote><p>At the outset, our main aim was comparing reproductive rate, investment and output between the two treatments (Intruded and Control). So, we decided to remove the clutches produced before at least three intrusions had occurred because we assumed groups would not have been substantially affected by our treatment in that period and would have reduced our ability to assess the effect of treatment on response variables such as latency to spawn. In analysing our data, we sometimes found that the interaction between treatment and treatment duration was important, but this had not been the core focus when we set up the experiments. Only three clutches were destroyed in Experiment I (line 458–461)—two on the morning of the first day, before the groups had experienced any intrusions, and one on the second day, before the group has experienced its second intrusion—so there is likely no great loss in terms of understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 549: was the number of offspring in the experiment considered as a factor predicting responses? In Table S8, I believe &quot;number of offspring&quot; is used as a fixed effect, but I was unclear as to whether that was number of offspring produced, or number used in the startle experiment. One might expect that the experimentally-designed groups with 10 offspring were different from those with 5.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the factor “number of offspring” refers to the number of individuals used in the test, and not the number of surviving offspring. We have clarified this point in Supplementary Table S8 by using the term ‘number of offspring in test’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 550-551: Was there any sand in the bottom of this startle tank?

It is possible that the lack of sand could have influenced the offspring behaviour, but the vast majority of individuals did display sinking behaviour in response to the startle stimulus, and we expect that the lack of sand in the bottom of the tank would have affected offspring from Control and Intruded groups alike.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 585-589: Stepwise model reduction has come under heavy criticism in the past 15 years. See, for example, Forstmeier and Schielzeth (2011), Mundry and Nunn (2009), and Harrison et al., (2018). This process can greatly increase the likelihood of false-positive results, and can inflate parameter estimates. From my knowledge, removal of non-significant interaction terms is OK, if one is interested in achieving accurate parameter estimates for main effects. However, it is rarely advised to remove main effects. Ideally, the authors would report significance tests from the full model, or use information-theoretic approaches. However, the authors could consider removing only non-significant interaction terms, as a means of getting better estimates for the main effects (Engqvist 2005).</p><p>Forstmeier W, Schielzeth H. 2011.

It's very unclear to me why you wouldn't simply fit an appropriate response variable distribution in the initial model fitting step.

Other distributions are appropriate for other types of data, and do not require this step. I might be misunderstanding, however.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that other distributions may be more appropriate for some datasets and have revised out analyses accordingly. To this effect, the number of caring events has been analysed using a GLMM with a negative binomial distribution, and time spent caring was analysed using a GLMM with a Gaussian distribution and log-link function (lines 650–655); results were qualitatively the same as before. For latency to spawn, the GLMM with a γ distribution had computational issues that could not be fixed so we log<sub>10</sub>-transformed the raw data before using a LMM (lines 649–654).

I also greatly appreciate the laying out of predictions and the details of the methods early on. This will hopefully help readers get oriented. I have one main point, which I lay out first, and then a few line-by-line comments. I don't believe any of these comments are likely to change the main message of the manuscript.</p><p>Main comment:</p><p>On line ~680-681 in the Methods, the authors say they &quot;provide significant parameter estimates…in the main text.&quot; However, looking at the Supplemental Tables in comparison to what is reported in the main text, only some significant effects are reported in the main text, not all. I'm curious as to why this is. For example, in the analysis of inter-clutch interval (Supp Table 1), female size had a highly significant effect (P = 0.017) but only the effect of treatment was discussed in the Results (lines 180-181). Similarly, in the analysis of egg investment, only the near-significant effect of the interaction between treatment and treatment duration was discussed (lines 195-197), but not the significant fixed effect of treatment. Also, an effect of clutch size on protein content and an effect of treatment x female size on protein content (Supp Table 3) were unreported in the Results. If these significant, but unreported, effects are not of interest, then one might ask why they were included in the model in the first place (aside from where necessary, like the treatment main effect when there is an interaction of interest). Or, are these omissions due to space constraints? There is likely a simple way to include a fuller reporting of these results. E.g., around line 195 the authors could report that &quot;…there was a significant effect of treatment duration on clutch size (STATS HERE). This was likely driven by the interaction between treatment and treatment duration, in which Intruded females….&quot; Or, an alternative would be in the Methods to state clearly that the authors only report selected results relevant to their hypotheses, but that some significant findings are reported only in the Supplementary Tables.</p></disp-quote><p>We explicitly state in lines 149–152 that we only provide in the main text the effect of treatment and, where significant or near-significant, the effect of the interaction between treatment and treatment duration, because these are the factors of core interest. We have included in the additional sentence there that the Supplementary files contain full model outputs including all tested variables, whether significant or not (lines 152–153). We have amended the sentences in the Methods to clarify that only those core results are detailed in the main text and that all model results are detailed in the Supplementary files (lines 676–680). Other factors such as female size and clutch size are included in some models because these traits are known to affect some response variables. Their inclusion allows us to assess the effect of our treatment above and beyond their expected influence on the response variable, but any discussion of such significant confounding effects would be tangential to our main story and thus we have not included it in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line by line:</p><p>Lines 103 and 107: For the other predictions the authors make directional predictions, e.g. a negative effect.

Especially in Figure 5, where 5C is significant (P = 0.028) and 5D is not (P = 0.089), the reader cannot see these differences at a glance. The authors do something like this in Figure 2, but not in other figures. Of course, we can discuss issues about whether P values really represent biological significance, but since that's the framework we're working under here, it would be useful to reflect in the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added p-values to all panels in Figures 3–5, in line with Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 332-336: Though I think this point is likely correct, the authors did not actually show how the experiment impacted the later dominance and reproductive success of the offspring.

The only thing I still think is missing is a brief description (prior to the results) of how the animals behave during the experimentally induced conflicts and a definition of what &quot;defensive actions&quot; involve. A few small additions should suffice, and add important context. I would suggest promoting the descriptions of the behaviours coded as defensive (headbutting, displays, etc) from L514 to the results paragraph starting at L129. It would also be good to hear a little more about the behaviour of the &quot;intruder&quot;. Did they frequently antagonise their neighbours, or exhibit aggressive displays or attacks?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information as requested (lines 133–137). Intruders often respond with aggressive postures and occasional attacks, but also with submissive postures and displays, and with evasive behaviour. We did not quantify these behaviours for the intruder and therefore cannot comment on the frequency of the different behaviours.</p></body></sub-article></article>
