LKB1<italic>-</italic>deficiency induces constitutive activation of cAMP/CREB-mediated transcription by a family of three CREB-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTC1-3). However, the significance and mechanism of CRTC activation in promoting the aggressive phenotype of LKB1-null cancer remain poorly characterized. Here, we observed overlapping CRTC expression patterns and mild growth phenotypes of individual CRTC-knockouts in lung cancer, suggesting functional redundancy of CRTC1-3. We consequently designed a dominant-negative mutant (dnCRTC) to block all three CRTCs to bind and co-activate CREB. Expression of dnCRTC efficiently inhibited the aberrantly activated cAMP/CREB-mediated oncogenic transcriptional program induced by LKB1-deficiency, and specifically blocked the growth of human and murine LKB1-inactivated lung cancer. Collectively, this study provides direct proof for an essential role of the CRTC-CREB activation in promoting the malignant phenotypes of LKB1-null lung cancer and proposes the CRTC-CREB interaction interface as a novel therapeutic target.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>non-small cell lung cance</kwd><kwd>LKB1</kwd><kwd>CRTC coactivators</kwd><kwd>therapeutic target</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA234351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Lizi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE023641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Lizi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008275</institution-id><institution>UF Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Lizi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z1AES103311-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeMayo</surname><given-names>Francesco J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007698</institution-id><institution>University of Florida</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gatorade Trust</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaye</surname><given-names>Frederic J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting aberrant CRTC-CREB activation blocks the growth of LKB1-inactivated lung cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in the United States and worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Torre et al., 2016</xref>). Global cancer statistics estimated 1,761,007 deaths due to lung cancer in 2018, contributing to about 20% of all cancer deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bray et al., 2018</xref>). In 2020, there were an estimated 228,820 newly diagnosed lung cancer cases and 135,720 lung cancer deaths in the United States alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer cases and includes the major subtypes: lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herbst et al., 2018</xref>). While small-molecule inhibitors targeted at driver gain-of-function gene mutations have achieved improved clinical outcomes over conventional cytotoxic therapy, they are currently available for only a subset of patients with lung cancer harboring specific mutations such as EGFR and ALK mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howlader et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koivunen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paez et al., 2004</xref>). Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as one of the newest treatment options for NSCLC; however, the recent use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as those blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint pathway, offer durable tumor responses to only a small population of patients generally with high tumor PD-L1 expression and/or high tumor mutational burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herbst et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reck et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, effective treatments for the majority of lung cancer patients remain lacking.</p><p>Comprehensive genomic profiling has revealed the genetic landscape of lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2008</xref>), identifying inactivating somatic <italic>STK11</italic> gene mutations as a common event in NSCLC. Somatic <italic>STK11</italic> mutations arise preferentially in lung adenocarcinoma where they have been detected in up to 30% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanchez-Cespedes et al., 2002</xref>). In addition to gene mutations, <italic>STK11</italic> can be inactivated by epigenetic silencing, post-translational modifications, or alterations in its interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boudeau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esteller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>STK11</italic> gene encodes a serine-threonine kinase, commonly known as liver kinase B1 (LKB1). Lung cancer with LKB1 deficiency exhibits resistance to chemotherapy, targeted therapeutics and especially to immune checkpoint inhibitors in preclinical models and/or human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carretero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skoulidis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schabath et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rizvi et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the absence of targeted therapies and the lack of benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitors for this common aggressive lung cancer subtype require an urgent search for new therapeutic strategies.</p><p><italic>STK11</italic> was first identified as the cancer susceptibility locus for familial Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which is characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation and gastrointestinal hamartoma with an increased cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hemminki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giardiello et al., 1987</xref>). Somatic inactivation of LKB1 has now been observed in a variety of human cancers besides lung cancer. Importantly, LKB1 loss has been shown to promote cancer progression and increase metastatic potential in the genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and endometrial cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hermanova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ji et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peña et al., 2015</xref>). Also, <italic>STK11</italic> mutations are associated with the suppressive immune milieu of the lung tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schabath et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koyama et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, <italic>STK11</italic> is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene. A better understanding of the pathogenic downstream signaling induced by LKB1 inactivation will facilitate the identification of rational therapeutic approaches.</p><p>The LKB1 kinase is essential for the activation of 14 downstream AMPK family members, such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</xref>). Therefore, LKB1 regulates multiple signaling pathways through its various substrates and plays critical roles in regulating cell polarity, metabolism, and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</xref>). Consequently, LKB1 inactivation has the potential to promote tumorigenesis by deregulating downstream cell signaling, such as the defective LKB1-AMPK-mediated energy stress response which has been the focus of many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</xref>). However, unlike loss of LKB1, loss of AMPK was found to reduce the growth of murine oncogenic Kras G12D-driven lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eichner et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that AMPK does not mediate LKB1’s tumor suppression function. To identify key signaling pathway(s) impacted by LKB1 inactivation in lung cancer, we previously performed an unbiased global gene expression profiling analysis and discovered that multiple cAMP/CREB-regulated targets, such as <italic>LINC00473</italic>, <italic>INSL4</italic>, <italic>NR4A1-3</italic>, and <italic>PTGS2</italic>, were highly expressed in human LKB1-null lung cancer cell lines and primary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). The induction of these cAMP/CREB-mediated targets was linked with aberrant hyper-activation of the CRTC (<italic>C</italic>REB-<italic>r</italic>egulated <italic>t</italic>ranscription <italic>c</italic>o-activator) family in the context of LKB1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, we previously generated an LKB1-null gene signature from 53 lung cancer cell lines to screen the Broad Institute Connectivity Map (CMAP) drug response database and the top 17 compounds that positively correlated with the LKB1-null gene signature were all compounds directly associated with CRTC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2015</xref>). The CRTC family consists of three members, <italic>CRTC1</italic>, <italic>CRTC2,</italic> and <italic>CRTC3</italic>, which play important roles in metabolism, aging, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altarejos and Montminy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iourgenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conkright et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tonon et al., 2003</xref>). These three CRTC proteins function as latent transcriptional co-activators and are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm. In response to cAMP and/or calcium signals, the family of three salt-inducible kinases (SIK1, 2, 3) are inactivated and/or phosphatases become activated, leading to CRTC dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylated CRTCs subsequently translocate to the nucleus and interact with the transcription factor CREB, activating CRE (<underline>c</underline>AMP-<underline>r</underline>esponsive <underline>e</underline>lement)-containing promoters. Since SIKs are dependent on LKB1 for its kinase activity, LKB1 deficiency impairs SIKs to phosphorylate CRTCs and consequently leads to an elevated level of unphosphorylated CRTCs, resulting in CRTC nuclear translocation and activation of CREB-mediated transcription. Therefore, the aberrant activation of the SIK-CRTC-CREB signaling axis may serve as a core driver event that underlies the aggressive phenotypes of LKB1-inactivated lung malignancies. This notion is further supported by recent CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing studies revealing that knock-outs of SIK1 and SIK3, but not of other AMPK family members, increased tumor growth in a mouse model of oncogenic KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollstein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murray et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, SIKs mediate the major tumor suppressive effects of LKB1 in NSCLC. Moreover, CRTC2 was reported to promote tumor growth in LKB1-deficient NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodón et al., 2019</xref>). However, the relative contributions of the three CRTC co-activators were not yet defined. Importantly, the role of the aberrant CRTC-CREB activation in LKB1-inactivated lung cancer and its underlying molecular mechanisms remained to be characterized.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the significance and mechanisms of CRTC co-activators in lung cancers using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts of individual CRTCs and a pan-CRTC inhibitor that blocks all three CRTC co-activators’ ability to interact with the CREB transcription factor. Our in vitro and in vivo data provide direct evidence that CRTC activation plays an essential role in the growth of LKB1-deficient lung cancer cells and revealed that targeting gain-of-function CREB activation by interfering with the CRTC-CREB interaction is a potential effective strategy in treating LKB1-inactivated lung cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Three CRTC co-activators were expressed at varying levels in lung cancer cells</title><p>To assess the individual functional contributions of the three CRTC family members in lung malignancies, we first evaluated their expression patterns by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses of SV40-transformed, non-tumorigenic human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), 7 LKB1-wt and 6 LKB1-null NSCLC cell lines. We observed that the three CRTC genes were all expressed at varying levels, with <italic>CRTC2</italic> and <italic>CRTC3</italic> having higher relative expression than <italic>CRTC1</italic> at the transcript level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Also, there were variable CRTC protein levels in all the cell lines examined and protein levels did not tightly correlate with their RNA transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting potential post-transcriptional regulation. CRTC1 and CRTC2 exhibited predominantly faster migrating bands in all six LKB1-null cancer cells, consistent with enrichment of dephosphorylated forms in the setting of LKB1 deficiency. However, the mobility of CRTC3 appeared relatively unchanged in 4/6 LKB1-null cancer cell lines, suggesting a distinct pattern of post-translational regulation. Therefore, we detected variable levels of expression of all three CRTC genes in immortalized human lung epithelial cells and lung cancer cells, suggesting the potential for both functional redundancies and unique properties. To confirm that LKB1 loss results in the de-phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of CRTCs, two essential steps for CRTC transcriptional activation of CREB target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iourgenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conkright et al., 2003</xref>), we determined the phosphorylation status and subcellular localization of the three CRTC proteins by performing phosphatase treatment and subcellular fractionation followed by western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, endogenous CRTC1, CRTC2, and CRTC3 proteins showed slow migration patterns in LKB1-expressing lung cancer cells (H322). Upon treatment of phosphatase, the mobility of the endogenous CRTC proteins in LKB1-expressing lung cancer cells was shifted to the underphosphorylated forms, which matched the mobility patterns of CRTCs in the LKB1-null lung cancer cells. These data demonstrate that endogenous CRTCs are predominantly phosphorylated in LKB1-expressing cells and dephosphorylated in LKB1-null cells. Further immunoblot analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions revealed that the CRTC proteins were predominantly detected as dephosphorylated, nuclear forms in LKB1-null cells and phosphorylated, cytoplasmic forms in LKB1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Reintroduction of LKB1 to LKB1-null A549 cells led to an increase in the levels of phosphorylated CRTCs, which correlated with a decrease in nuclear CRTCs and an increase in cytoplasmic CRTCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further, LKB1 knockout in LKB1-expressing H322 cells caused an increase in dephosphorylated, nuclear forms of CRTCs and a decrease in phosphorylated, cytoplasmic forms of CRTCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). All these data validate LKB1 regulation of CRTC phosphorylation and subcellular localization, further supporting the existing model where LKB1-dependent SIKs mediate phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of CRTCs. Since all three dephosphorylated, nuclear CRTCs can be detected in LKB1-deficient cells that are capable of co-activating CREB-mediated transcription, we would need to inactivate each gene individually or all three together to determine the contribution of the CRTC co-activation to the transcriptional program in lung cancer cells with LKB1 deficiency.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Three members of the CRTC co-activator family, <italic>CRTC1</italic>, <italic>CRTC2,</italic> and <italic>CRTC3</italic>, are expressed at varying levels in human lung epithelial and cancer cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The transcript levels of the three CRTC genes were determined by RT-qPCR assays.

The CRTC co-activators contain a highly conserved N terminal CREB-binding domain (CBD) that is responsible for interacting with the transcription factor CREB, and a C terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) that is essential for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altarejos and Montminy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We, therefore, established a dominant negative approach of blocking the functions of all three CRTC co-activators by competing with endogenous CRTCs for CREB binding. Specifically, we generated a retroviral pMSCV-based dominant negative CRTC (dnCRTC) construct that expresses the CRTC1-CBD-nls-GFP chimeric protein, which contains the CBD of CRTC1 (1–55 aa) followed by a nuclear localization signal (nls, ‘PKKKRKV’) and EGFP. This CRTC1-CBD-nls-GFP protein was predicted to bind to CREB but lacks transcriptional activation, consequently interfering with the functions of endogenous CRTC co-activators through competitive CREB binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We infected human LKB1-null lung cancer A549 cells with the CRTC1-CBD-nls-GFP or GFP (control) retroviruses and observed that CRTC1-CBD-nls-GFP was predominantly localized in the nuclear compartment, while the control GFP showed diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The CRTC1-CBD-nls-GFP chimeric protein showed an expected size of ~33 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and suppressed the ability of the three CRTC co-activators to activate the CREB-dependent transcription in cAMP response element (CRE)-containing promoter luciferase reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, the CRTC1-CBD-nls-GFP chimeric protein functions as a dominant negative mutant for CRTC (dnCRTC), capable of blocking all three CRTCs to co-activate CREB-mediated transcription.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A dominant negative CRTC mutant (dnCRTC) interacted with CREB on the target gene promoters and blocked CRTC co-activation of CREB transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram of CRTC co-activator and dnCRTC was shown.

By incorporating a recently published ChIP-sequencing study that investigated the genome-wide binding profiles of CREB and CRTC2 in LKB1-null A549 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodón et al., 2019</xref>), we found that the dnCRTC-DEGs exhibited significant enrichment in CREB and CRTC2 binding around their transcription start sites (TSS), while the binding of CREB and CRTC2 was reduced upon reintroduction of LKB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This analysis revealed 97 of 274 (~35%) dnCRTC-DEGs (60 down-regulated and 37 up-regulated) having CREB-binding and CRTC2-binding peaks within −3 kb to 300 bp from TSS; and 73 of 274 (~27%) dnCRTC-DEGs (45 down-regulated and 28 up-regulated) having both the CREB and CRTC2 binding peaks within −500 bp to 100 bp from TSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).

Several oncogenic gene signatures, such as Shh-regulated gene set, RB loss/E2F1-regulated gene set, NFE2L2-regulated gene set, PDGF-regulated gene set, KRAS-regulated gene set, were found to be significantly altered with negative enrichment scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>), indicating that a majority of genes in these oncogenic gene sets were significantly under-expressed in dnCRTC-expressing cells. Therefore, our dnCRTC mutant serves as a useful tool for blocking the extensive CRTC/CREB transcriptional program and oncogenic signaling. These data also suggest that dnCRTC expression has the potential to negatively impact the malignant behaviors of LKB1-deficient lung cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>LKB1-null, but not LKB1-wt, NSCLC cells were sensitive to dnCRTC-induced inhibition of CRTC co-activators in vitro</title><p>To determine whether LKB1-null lung cancer cells depend on CRTC-CREB activation for growth and survival, we next assessed the functional impact of blocking the CRTC-CREB interaction via dnCRTC by analyzing the effect on lung cancer cell growth. We first performed competition assays using two LKB1-null (A549 and H157) and two LKB1-wt (H322 and H522) NSCLC cells. These cells were transduced with dnCRTC or control GFP retroviruses at an infection rate of ~40–60%, and then the percentages of GFP-positive cell populations were quantified at 3-day intervals over a total of 24 days starting at day 3 following viral infection. We observed a progressively reduced percentage of LKB1-null cells (A549 and H157) that expressed dnCRTC, while the percent of the GFP-control cells remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, the percentage of LKB1-positive cells (H322 and H522) was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These results showed that dnCRTC expression has a negative effect on the proliferation of LKB1-null tumor cells, but not of LKB1-positive cells, indicating that CRTC activation is critical for LKB1-null cell growth. We also sorted the GFP +populations from dnCRTC- and GFP-transduced cells and performed functional comparisons. Expression of dnCRTC and GFP was first confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We observed that dnCRTC expression induced a significant inhibition of cell growth in LKB1-null cells (A549 and H157), but not in LKB1-positive cells (H322 and H522) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Since replacing loss-of-function tumor suppressor mutations is challenging, drug therapeutic efforts have been directed towards identifying and understanding the effector pathways that mediate LKB1 tumor suppression in order to uncover new therapeutic strategies. An important function of LKB1 is its ability to activate SIKs which then phosphorylate and negatively regulate the family of three CREB-regulated transcriptional co-activators (CRTC). We and others have shown that the loss of LKB1 directly leads to CRTC activation and extensive, elevated CRTC1-CREB-mediated transcription in human lung cancer cells and primary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollstein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murray et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodón et al., 2019</xref>). More recently, studies of genetically engineered mouse models of oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic>-induced lung cancer revealed that SIKs, but not other AMPK family members, mediate the major tumor suppression function of LKB1 (40, 41). These molecular and genetic data support the model that aberrant CRTC-CREB transcriptional activation mediates the major LKB1-null malignancy. However, direct evidence for the importance of CRTC activation in promoting tumorigenesis was lacking. Also, whether there is a specific role for individual CRTC 1–3 family members was unknown. In this study, we showed overlapping expression and the potential for functional redundancy of three CRTC co-activators in lung cancers. Therefore, we designed and validated a pan-CRTC dominant negative inhibitor as a useful tool for blocking all three CRTC co-activator function. Our new mechanistic and functional data demonstrated an essential, general role for CRTC activation in maintaining the malignant phenotypes of LKB1-inactivated lung cancer and identified the CRTC-CREB interaction as a valuable molecular target for development of new therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 deficiency.</p><p>The findings in this study further emphasize the importance of CRTC activation in tumorigenesis. We initially identified CRTC1 as a fusion partner with the Notch transcriptional co-activator MAML2, due to a t(11;19) chromosomal translocation in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), the most common salivary gland malignancies and lung tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tonon et al., 2003</xref>). This fusion event leads to a chimeric CRTC1-MAML2 protein which is composed of the CREB-binding domain (CBD) of CRTC1 (42aa) fusing to the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of MAML2 (983aa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tonon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). The CRTC1-MAML2 fusion binds to CREB via the CRTC1 CBD and potently activates CREB-dependent transcription through its MAML2 TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coxon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), which contribute to the fusion’s major oncogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). These data demonstrate a critical role of CRTC activation in MEC tumorigenesis. In our previous studies, we also showed that LKB1-deficiency led to CRTC activation of many CREB-dependent genes, including NR4A2, PTGS2 (aka COX-2), LYPD3, INSL4, and LINC00473, which play important roles in cancer cell growth, survival or invasive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Komiya et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, other groups reported that SIKs were the major AMPK family members that mediate LKB1 tumor suppression and SIK knockouts enhanced CRTC target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollstein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murray et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, CRTC2 downregulation inhibited the growth of LKB1-deficient NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodón et al., 2019</xref>). All these data support a new model that LKB1-SIK genetic alterations represent a distinct mechanism for the constitutive CRTC-CREB activation that is critical for the tumorigenesis and progression of NSCLC. In this study, we performed expression and functional assays to determine the relative contributions of three CRTC co-activators in lung cancer cells. Our data showed that all three CRTC co-activators (CRTC1-3) are expressed at various levels in lung cancers and that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts of individual CRTCs only partially reduced the LKB1 target gene expression and had very moderate impact on lung cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and anchorage-independent growth. It should be noted that a recent study reporting CRTC2 shRNA knockdown or knockout in polyclonal cells impaired soft agar formation but did not affect cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodón et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, two CRTC2 KO single clones only showed minimal inhibition of cell proliferation and soft agar colony formation; this discrepancy could be explained by the upregulation of CRTC1 in the CRTC2 KO clones. Therefore, these data indicate the presence for functional redundancy of the three CRTC co-activator family members in driving aberrant CREB transcriptional program and lung cancer malignant phenotypes, thus suggesting that general inhibition of all CRTCs is required for blocking the aberrant CRTC-induced transcriptional program and lung tumorigenesis.</p><p>We subsequently developed a dominant negative mutant dnCRTC to block all three CRTC function. This dnCRTC binds to CREB but is defective in transcriptional activation, consequently forming an inactive transcriptional complex with CREB and interfering with the ability of all three CRTCs to co-activate CREB-mediated transcription.Expression of this pan-CRTC inhibitor efficiently and extensively inhibited the aberrantly activated CREB-mediated transcriptional program induced by LKB1 deficiency, including INSL4, CPS1, NR4A1-3, LINC00473, PTGS2, SIK1, PDE4B, and PDE4D. It should be noted that SIK1 is a transcriptional target induced by cAMP-CREB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wein et al., 2018</xref>) and it was upregulated in LKB1-null cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). SIK1 downregulation by dnCRTC was only observed in LKB1-null, but not LKB1-wt cancer cells in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is unlikely to have functional consequences as SIK1 kinase is impaired in LKB1-null cancer cells. Integrated analysis of the dnCRTC-regulated DEGs from our gene expression profiling with the published ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodón et al., 2019</xref>) revealed the direct target genes downstream of CRTC activation, which include known and potential novel mediators of aberrant CRTC activation in LKB1-inactivated cancer. Future studies of these mediators of CRTC activation and their potential cross-talk with other signaling pathways will enhance our molecular understanding of the loss-of-LKB1 tumor suppression in lung cancer. Since dnCRTC acts as a pan-CRTC inhibitor, it has the potential to serve as an invaluable research tool for dissecting the role of deregulated CRTC activation in various disease settings, such as cancers with aberrant CRTC activation (e.g. LKB1 deficiency, the CRTC1-MAML2 fusion), diabetes with CRTC activation that contributes to high blood glucose levels as well as neurological conditions such as depression and memory.</p><p>In this study, we utilized this pan-CRTC inhibitor to probe the functional impact of blocking the CRTC-CREB activation on the growth of multiple NSCLC cell lines and xenograft models. We showed that dnCRTC expression caused significant growth inhibition in LKB1-null, but not LKB1-wt cancer cells and normal lung epithelial cells. The growth and lung colonization of LKB1-null lung cancer cells were specifically susceptible to inhibition of CRTC coactivators. These results demonstrate an essential role of aberrant CRTC activation in supporting the malignant phenotypes of LKB1-inactivated lung cancers. This current study focused on addressing the impact of dnCRTC expression on cancer cells using human lung cancer cell lines and xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice. Since LKB1 loss in lung cancer are associated with immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and the resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in preclinical models and clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skoulidis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kitajima et al., 2019</xref>), future research examining the effect of CRTC inhibition in lung cancer genetic mouse models is needed to elucidate the role of CRTC co-activators in lung cancer progression, tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic responses.</p><p>As the malignant phenotype of LKB1-inactivated lung cancers are specifically dependent on aberrant CRTC co-activation of the oncogenic CREB transcriptional program, targeting the CRTC-CREB interaction, hence, the active CRTC-CREB transcription complex, may selectively inhibit LKB1-deficient tumors with minimal effects on normal cells as demonstrated by our data. The strategy of blocking the assembly of active CRTC-CREB transcriptional complex and subsequently inhibiting extensive CRTC target genes has the advantage of simultaneously inhibiting multiple deleterious cell signals which predicts a greater challenge for resistant cancer cell clones to emerge. We propose that inhibition of the CRTC-CREB interaction should reverse the oncogenic activity of CRTC activation. For instance, peptides and peptide-like molecules designed to recapitulate a critical interaction motif will have the potential in selectively targeting the CRTC/CREB interaction interface and consequently inhibit lung cancer growth. The crystal structural analysis has provided important molecular information of the core CRTC/CREB transcriptional complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Song et al., 2018</xref>), revealing that CRTC CBD interacts with CREB basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain forming a 2:2 complex on CRE-containing DNA. CRTC interacts with both CREB and DNA through highly conserved residues are crucial for the complex assembly and CREB stabilization on DNA. With insights from the crystal structural studies and further understanding of the assembly and composition of the CRTC/CREB transcriptional complex, new approaches can be developed to inhibit the oncogenic CRTC/CREB transcriptional program and block the progression of lung cancers.</p><p>Collectively, our study provides direct proof for a critical role of the CRTC-CREB activation in maintaining the malignant phenotypes of LKB1-inactive lung cancers and reveals direct inhibition of the CRTC-CREB transcriptional complex via targeting the CRTC-CREB interface as a novel, promising therapeutic approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

lung cancers bearing mutations in LKB1. The experiments demonstrating specific impact of pan-CRTC inhibition in suppressing LKB1-mutated lung cancer provide a rationale for the use of inhibitors of CRTC-CREB signaling as therapies for a difficult to treat molecular subtype of non-small cell lung cancer.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dependency of LKB1-inactivated lung cancer on aberrant CRTC-CREB activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Erica Golemis as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Barbie (Reviewer #1); Humam Kadara (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. In Figure 1 have the authors looked at cytoplasmic vs nuclear levels of any of the CRTC family members in LKB1 null vs wt cells? Existing models suggest that SIK mediated phosphorylation of CRTCs results in nuclear translocation. Thus, while total levels do not appear to be different between the 2 classes of cell lines, is there differential nuclear translocation of CRTC2, for example, in LKB1 null cells?</p><p>2. The most compelling data supporting specificity of their dnCRTC construct is the data in Figure 4, with unbiased RNAseq data identifying CREB target genes as the among the top downregulated genes. But this is only proven in a single cell line. Are similar target genes downregulated by qPCR in H157 cells, which they use as their other model? This is important to establish</p><p>3. Moreover, they show that these downregulated genes are upregulated in KRAS-LKB1 mutant tumors in TCGA, supporting the idea that CRTC-CREB is driving their expression uniquely in this context. But it would also be useful to look at the same subset of target genes in their KRAS-p53 mutant cell lines expressing dnCRTC (H322 and H522), to compare the relative overall expression and the degree to which dnCRTC suppresses them in the non-LKB1 mutant context.</p><p>4. Finally, isogenic LKB1 mutant cells are typically utilized to prove specificity of downstream signaling. For example if they KO LKB1 in one of their KRAS-TP53 mutant cell lines, what happens to CRTC levels/translocation and expression of these target genes? And if technically feasibly it would be most convincing if LKB1 loss specifically resensitized these cells to their dnCRTC construct.</p><p>5. In Figure 1, the authors state that expression of CRTC mRNAs is normalized to that of CRTC1. How is this being done? Is there a single probe used that recognizes all 3 CRTC isoforms? If so, this is not stated in the methods – if not, it is not possible to normalize based on PCR cycles, given the efficiency of different probes. It is also puzzling that CRTC1 appears to be much more abundant in LKB1 wt cells.</p><p>6. In Figure 1, the authors make inferences about phosphorylation – and hence activity – of CRTC isoforms in LKB-minus versus wt cells based on the migration of the protein. This is not sufficient, particularly as the Western shown indicates proteins are running in a curve. These experiments need to be supplemented by data showing migration change following phosphatase treatment of lysates, and/or by cell fractionation data showing more nuclear CRTC proteins in LKB1-minus cells.</p><p>7. The dominant negative construct dnCRTC is an essential tool for the study. The authors use ChIP to show that it associates with CREB. However, they do not show that it displaces the wt forms of CRTC from interaction with CREB. This is an important control.</p><p>8. On page 11, &quot;we identified a list of direct dnCRTC-regulated genes, which represent an extensive set of the potential critical mediators for CRTC-CREB activation in promoting lung cancer cell growth&quot; is a significant overstatement, and should be toned down or removed, unless validation data is provided for the importance of some of the genes identified.</p><p>9. Prior reference 42, which the authors frequently cite, note importance of overexpressing CRTC2 for activation of ID1, with validation included. What happens to ID1 expression in cells overexpressing dnCRTC?</p><p>10. On page 12, there is description of results from GSEA, but no data is shown, no statistical significance of results is provided, and the described findings are very vague. The data need to be provided and the data more accurately described, or this section should be removed.</p><p>11. Various studies have shown that LKB1-mutated lung tumors are immune muted or privileged. In fact, in the past couple of years, studies have shown that a muted immune response is a key, if not the most prominent, feature of LKB1-mutated lung cancers relative to LKB1-wild type tumors or those with other driver alterations. Indeed, LKB1-mutated tumors were shown to be non-responsive, or at best, weakly responsive to immune checkpoint blockade. A major weakness in the study is the sole dependency on immune compromised animal models. It would be important to determine the impact of dcCRTC inhibition on the immune microenvironment, in light of previous reports linking CREB, and immune infiltration/function. At least this weakness should be acknowledged and discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>12. The data in Supplementary Figure 2 showing the association of ddCRTC target genes with LKB1 mutations in NSCLC are not clear and difficult to visualize. This conclusion would benefit from statistical analysis that supports the association of dnCRTC target genes with LKB1 mutations.</p><p>13. As the authors discussed in the Introduction section, LKB1 deficiency was shown to impair salt-inducible kinases (SIK1,2, and 3) leading to phosphorylation/activation of CRTCs. It is worthwhile for the authors to discuss their finding on reduced SIK1 expression by dnCRTC (Figure 4).</p><p>14. The group discusses oncogenic gene signatures that were negatively enriched in dnCRTC-expressing versus control GFP-expressing A549 cells (page 12) but these data are not provided.</p><p>15. The H&amp;E staining of mouse lungs colonized with A549 (Figure 7C) are not clear (strong background).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Zhou et al. explore the role of downstream CRTC-CREB activation in KRAS-LKB1 mutant lung adenocarcinoma. First, they characterize expression of the 3 different CRTC family members across LKB1 null vs wt lung cancer cells, observing variable expression with generally higher levels of CRTC2 (previously implicated as a dependency in this setting) and CRTC3. Since KO of each family member was limited by functional reduncancy to some degree, they then engineered a dominant negative model by fusing the common CREB binding domain to GFP, and expressed this in A549 cells. Nicely, RNA-seq confirmed specific downregulation of CRTC-CREB targets in these cells, which was associated with impaired proliferation that was preferentially observed in LKB1 null cells. Finally, they demonstrate that subcutaneous implantation of dnCRTC expressing LKB1 null cells impaired tumor xenograft growth as well as metastatic lung colonization. Overall this is a well conducted study which builds upon an emerging literature highlighting the importance of SIK signaling, CRTC2, and CREB in KRAS-LKB1 mutant cancer, which still lacks effective therapy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this article, Zhou et al. investigate the requirement for the three isoforms of CRTC (CRTC1-3) in pathogenesis of LKB1-mutant lung cancers. CRTC proteins serve as co-activators of CREB; LKB1 loss reduces activity of SIK kinases, which normally phosphorylate and cytoplasmically sequester CRTCs; in the absence of LKB1, unphosphorylated CRTCs enter the nucleus and associate with CREB. Previous work has noted that upregulation of CRTC2 is common in lung cancer, and showed elevated CRTC2 promotes lung cancer growth – however, that study found little effect of reducing CRTC2 expression. The present work investigates all three CRTCs, showing depletion of each, alone, has little effect, but simultaneous inhibition of all CRTCs through expression of a dominant negative construct that competes with CRTCs for CREB binding, but fails to activate transcription, specifically blocks the growth of LKB1-deficient but not LKB1-wt lung cancer, in vitro and in vivo. The work also suggests specific CREB transcriptional targets that may contribute to the transforming activity of CRTC-CREB. Overall, the work is carefully performed and makes a useful contribution to the field. However, some points need to be further elucidated. These include better characterization of the relative expression and modification of CRTC proteins, confirmation that the biological activity of the dominant negative construct efficiently displaces CRTCs from interaction with CREB on gene promoters, and more thorough description of the downstream transcriptional consequences of use of dominant negative CRTC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study by Zhou and colleagues investigates the role of aberrant activation of CREB-regulated transcription co-activators (CRTCs 1, 2 and 3) and CREB in LKB1-mutated (inactivated) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previous work has shown that LKB1-inactivated lung cancer exhibits increased CRTC-CREB activation, yet the relative contributions of the three CRTC co-activators are still not determined. Here, the study evaluated the effects of a pan-CRTC inhibitor on the malignant phenotype of LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells and tumors. The study first shows that expression levels of the different CRTCs are variable across LKB1-wild type and-inactivated lung cancer cells and that targeting each CRTC alone does not lead to decreased cell growth and progression of LKB1-inactivated lung cancer cells. In contrast, they find that a pan-CRTC inhibitor (dnCRTC) decreased global CREB target gene expression and specifically inhibited in vitro growth of LKB1-inactivated but not LKB1-wild type lung cancer cells. The group also shows that dnCRTC significantly decreases the growth of subcutaneously xenotransplanted human LKB1-inactivated A549 and H157 lung cancer cells in NOD/SCID mice. Also, dnCRTC inhibited lung colonization of A549 and H157 cells intravenously injected in NOD-SCID mice. The study is in general carefully designed and clearly shows the significance of aberrant CRTC-CREB signaling in the growth of LKB1-inactivated lung cancer cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66095.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have performed new experiments to validate that LKB1 loss results in CRTC de-phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, two essential steps for CRTC activation of CREB-mediated transcription. Specifically, we assessed the phosphorylation status and subcellular localization of the three CRTC proteins by performing phosphatase treatment and subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, endogenous CRTC1, CRTC2, and CRTC3 proteins showed slow migration patterns in LKB1-expressing lung cancer cells (H322). Upon treatment of phosphatase, the mobility of the endogenous CRTC proteins in LKB1-expressing lung cancer cells was shifted to the underphosphorylated forms, which matched the mobility patterns of CRTCs in the LKB1-null lung cancer cells. These data demonstrate that endogenous CRTCs are predominantly phosphorylated in LKB1-expressing cells and dephosphorylated in LKB1-null cells. Further immunoblot analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions revealed that CRTC proteins were predominantly detected as dephosphorylated, nuclear forms in LKB1-null cells and phosphorylated, cytoplasmic forms in LKB1-expressing cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Reintroduction of LKB1 to LKB1null A549 cells led to an increase in the levels of phosphorylated CRTCs, which correlated with a decrease in nuclear CRTCs and an increase in cytoplasmic CRTCs (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Further, LKB1 knockout in LKB1-expressing H322 cells caused an increase in dephosphorylated, nuclear forms of CRTCs and a decrease in phosphorylated, cytoplasmic forms of CRTCs (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). All these data validate LKB1 regulation of CRTC phosphorylation and subcellular localization, further supporting the existing model where LKB1-dependent SIKs mediate phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of CRTCs. Therefore, there is differential nuclear translocation of CRTCs in LKB1deficient cells in comparison to LKB1-wt cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We also analyzed ID1, a gene recently identified as the CRTC2/CREB-regulated target. As shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, all the analyzed genes except for <italic>INSL4</italic> and <italic>PDK4</italic> were also downregulated in H157 cells.

For example if they KO LKB1 in one of their KRAS-TP53 mutant cell lines, what happens to CRTC levels/translocation and expression of these target genes? And if technically feasibly it would be most convincing if LKB1 loss specifically resensitized these cells to their dnCRTC construct.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions. We established LKB1-positive H322 cells that were transduced with lentiviruses containing non-targeting gRNA (gNT), or gRNA targeting LKB1 and performed phosphatase treatment and subcellular fractionation experiments. The results showed that LKB1 knockout resulted in enhanced dephosphorylated CRTCs and increased nuclear CRTC levels (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). We also observed that LKB1 knockout led to a significant up-regulation of multiple target genes by RT-qPCR assays, although not to the extent that was observed in the naturally occurring human LKB1-null lung cancer cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Consistent with effects on the target genes, we did not observe changes in cell proliferation in H322-LKB1 KO cells (not shown).</p><p>Since malignant phenotypes of these lung cancer H322 cells are not driven by the loss of LKB1 and not dependent on dnCRTC (Figure 5), it remains unclear whether they can become sensitive to dnCRTC. One possibility for the mild observed effects after LKB1 knockout is that the target genes could be regulated by other factors depending on cellular context, which would require further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 1, the authors state that expression of CRTC mRNAs is normalized to that of CRTC1. How is this being done? Is there a single probe used that recognizes all 3 CRTC isoforms? If so, this is not stated in the methods – if not, it is not possible to normalize based on PCR cycles, given the efficiency of different probes. It is also puzzling that CRTC1 appears to be much more abundant in LKB1 wt cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry that we did not explain our analysis clearly. We used individual primer sets for detecting <italic>CRTC1</italic>, <italic>CRTC2</italic>, and <italic>CRTC3</italic> and normalized their expression against an internal control, the housekeeping gene GAPDH. For the analysis, we first normalized all three CRTC transcript levels against the level of the GAPDH transcript, individually. For the data presentation, we assigned the expression level of CRTC1 in BEAS-2B as 1, and presented the expression levels for the three CRTCs in various cell lines as relative values to that of CRTC1 in BEAS-2B. We have provided the original data and further explained the analysis in the Figure legend. We agree with the reviewer that different primer sets could have different PCR efficiency, and we did our best to consider this possibility when we designed the primers. The data from this experiment only provides us a general idea of the relative expression levels of three CRTC genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 1, the authors make inferences about phosphorylation – and hence activity – of CRTC isoforms in LKB-minus versus wt cells based on the migration of the protein. This is not sufficient, particularly as the Western shown indicates proteins are running in a curve. These experiments need to be supplemented by data showing migration change following phosphatase treatment of lysates, and/or by cell fractionation data showing more nuclear CRTC proteins in LKB1-minus cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions. This is a similar comment as Comment #1. In brief, we performed CIP treatment and subcellular fractionations followed by immunoblotting analysis of three CRTCs using LKB1-null and LKB1-expressing cells, LKB1-addback cells, and LKB1 knockout cells. Our new results (Figure 1—figure supplement 1-3) demonstrate that enhanced levels of nuclear, dephosphorylated CRTCs in LKB1-null cancer cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The dominant negative construct dnCRTC is an essential tool for the study. The authors use ChIP to show that it associates with CREB. However, they do not show that it displaces the wt forms of CRTC from interaction with CREB. This is an important control.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. Since the interaction of CRTC and CREB requires DNA (Luo et al., PNAS 2012, PMID: 23213254), we evaluated the effect of dnCRTC expression on the enrichment of endogenous CRTC proteins in the dnCRTC-target gene promoters by ChIP assays. Specifically, we crosslinked A549-GFP vs A549-dnCRTC cells and extracted chromatin for immunoprecipitation with anti-CRTC1 (Bethyl A300-769A), anti-CRTC2 (Bethyl # A300-637A), anti-CRTC3 antibodies (Bethyl A302-703A) or control IgG. The ChIP DNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR to detect the target gene promoter sequences that encompass the cAMP responsive element (CRE) site. As shown in the new Figure 3G, there was a significant reduction in the levels of endogenous CRTC1-3 proteins that were associated with the promoters of LINC00473 and NR4A2 genes that encompass the CRE sites. These data demonstrate that dnCRTC displaces endogenous CRTC1-3 proteins from the target gene promoters in LKB1-null lung cancer cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. On page 11, &quot;we identified a list of direct dnCRTC-regulated genes, which represent an extensive set of the potential critical mediators for CRTC-CREB activation in promoting lung cancer cell growth&quot; is a significant overstatement, and should be toned down or removed, unless validation data is provided for the importance of some of the genes identified.</p></disp-quote><p>Several dnCRTC-regulated target genes identified in this study have been previously studied by our group and others, which included LINC00473 (Chen et al. J Clin Invest 2016, PMID 2714039), INSL4 (Yang et al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2019, PMID 30423141), CPS1 (Kim et al. Nature 2017 PMID 28538732; Celiktas et al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2017 PMID: 28376202), NR4A2 (Oncogene 2010 PMID:20010869), and PTGS2 (Cao et al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2015 PMID: 25465874). The expression of these genes was found to be up-regulated in LKB1inactivated lung cancer cell lines and patient tumors. The down-regulation of these genes individually reduced the growth and survival of LKB1-inactivated lung cancers, indicating that they are important in mediating the loss of LKB1 tumor suppression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Prior reference 42, which the authors frequently cite, note importance of overexpressing CRTC2 for activation of ID1, with validation included. What happens to ID1 expression in cells overexpressing dnCRTC?</p></disp-quote><p>In our gene expression profiling experiment, <italic>ID1</italic> was down-regulated but did not meet the cutoff criteria we used (FC&gt;=2.0, p &lt;0.05), as <italic>ID1</italic> expression had a fold change of -1.72 (FDR p&lt;0.05) in dnCRTC-expressing A549 cells as compared with the control cells.</p><p>We further analyzed that ID1 expression by RT-qPCR and observed that <italic>ID1</italic> expression was also downregulated by dnCRTC in two LKB1-null lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H157), but not in two LKB1-expressing lung cancer cells (H322 and H522). Interestingly, we noted that the levels of <italic>ID1</italic> transcripts were similar in 4 cell lines we tested. The data are now presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. On page 12, there is description of results from GSEA, but no data is shown, no statistical significance of results is provided, and the described findings are very vague. The data need to be provided and the data more accurately described, or this section should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the data from GSEA analysis in Supplementary file 1b (the former Supplemental Table 2 is now shown in Supplementary file 1c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Various studies have shown that LKB1-mutated lung tumors are immune muted or privileged. In fact, in the past couple of years, studies have shown that a muted immune response is a key, if not the most prominent, feature of LKB1-mutated lung cancers relative to LKB1-wild type tumors or those with other driver alterations. Indeed, LKB1-mutated tumors were shown to be non-responsive, or at best, weakly responsive to immune checkpoint blockade. A major weakness in the study is the sole dependency on immune compromised animal models. It would be important to determine the impact of dcCRTC inhibition on the immune microenvironment, in light of previous reports linking CREB, and immune infiltration/function. At least this weakness should be acknowledged and discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this very important point. We agree with the reviewer about the importance of immune characteristics associated with LKB1-inactivated lung cancer since LKB1 mutations were shown to confer immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and the resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in preclinical models and clinical trials. This current study focused on addressing the impact of dnCRTC expression on cancer cells using human lung cancer cell lines and xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice, which did not allow us to investigate its impact on tumor immune microenvironment. We have now acknowledged this limitation in the discussion (Page 19, Line 433-439). For the future study, we plan to generate mouse models of lung cancer driven by oncogenic KRAS and loss of LKB1, in combination with expression of dnCRTC, to determine the effects of dnCRTC on tumor progression, tumor microenvironment, and therapy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The data in Supplementary Figure 2 showing the association of ddCRTC target genes with LKB1 mutations in NSCLC are not clear and difficult to visualize. This conclusion would benefit from statistical analysis that supports the association of dnCRTC target genes with LKB1 mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have downloaded the data from TCGA human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) from cbioportal.org. and performed statistical analysis to compare expression levels of the 12 top dnCRTCregulated target genes, including INSL4, CPS1, NR4A2, PDK4, LINC00473, NR4A1, TM4SF20, NR4A3, PTGS2, SIK1, PDB4B and PDE4D in LKB1-wt and LKB1-mut cohorts.</p><p>Our results revealed high expression of the majority of these target genes in LKB1-mutant vs LKB1-wt tumors. We have presented these results as Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and the original Supplementary Figure 2 was removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. As the authors discussed in the Introduction section, LKB1 deficiency was shown to impair salt-inducible kinases (SIK1,2, and 3) leading to phosphorylation/activation of CRTCs. It is worthwhile for the authors to discuss their finding on reduced SIK1 expression by dnCRTC (Figure 4).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have added several sentences to discuss the reduced SIK1 by dnCRTC (Page 18, Line 413-416). “It should be noted that SIK1 is a transcriptional target induced by cAMP-CREB signaling (53) and it was up-regulated in LKB1-null cancer cells (34). SIK1 down-regulation by dnCRTC was only observed in LKB1-null, but not LKB-wt cancer cells in this study (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), which is unlikely to have functional consequences as SIK1 kinase is impaired in LKB1-null cancer cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14.
