leading to periodic disruptions in breathing. Upper airway patency is governed by genioglossal nerve activity that originates from the hypoglossal motor nucleus. Mice with targeted deletion of the gene <italic>Hmox2,</italic> encoding the carbon monoxide (CO) producing enzyme, heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), exhibit OSA, yet the contribution of central HO-2 dysregulation to the phenomenon is unknown. Using the rhythmic brainstem slice preparation that contains the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) and the hypoglossal nucleus, we tested the hypothesis that central HO-2 dysregulation weakens hypoglossal motoneuron output. Disrupting HO-2 activity increased the occurrence of subnetwork activity from the preBötC, which was associated with an increased irregularity of rhythmogenesis. These phenomena were also associated with the intermittent inability of the preBötC rhythm to drive output from the hypoglossal nucleus (i.e. transmission failures), and a reduction in the input-output relationship between the preBötC and the motor nucleus. HO-2 dysregulation reduced excitatory synaptic currents and intrinsic excitability in inspiratory hypoglossal neurons. Inhibiting activity of the CO-regulated H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzyme, cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), reduced transmission failures in HO-2 null brainstem slices, which also normalized excitatory synaptic currents and intrinsic excitability of hypoglossal motoneurons. These findings demonstrate a hitherto uncharacterized modulation of hypoglossal activity through mutual interaction of HO-2/CO and CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S, and support the potential importance of centrally derived gasotransmitter activity in regulating upper airway control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep apnea</kwd><kwd>motoneuron</kwd><kwd>upper airway</kwd><kwd>hydrogen sulfide</kwd><kwd>carbon monoxide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 HL144454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prabhakar</surname><given-names>Nanduri R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS107421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Alfredo J</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA057767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Alfredo J</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL163965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Alfredo J</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological analyses reveal interactions between gasotransmitter enzymes and their respective products that regulate hypoglossal motoneuron excitability and may drive changes in upper airway tone in obstructive sleep apnea and perturb behaviors such as vocalization and swallowing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sporadic airway collapse is a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a prevalent breathing disorder estimated to affect nearly a billion people throughout the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lyons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Malhotra et al., 2021</xref>.

It is, however, unknown how HO-2 signaling at the level of the preBötC and the hypoglossal nucleus influence these factors contributing to upper airway tone and patency.</p><p>We tested the role of central HO-2 signaling in influencing hypoglossal motor output using a combination of electrophysiological, genetic, and pharmacological approaches in rhythmic medullary brainstem slice preparations. Dysregulated HO-2 activity increased the occurrence of subnetwork activity in the preBötC, which was associated with an increased cycle-to-cycle irregularity of rhythmogenesis. In hypoglossal motoneurons, excitatory synaptic drive currents and intrinsic excitability were reduced by HO-2 dysregulation. These phenomena also coincided with circuit level effects. HO-2 dysregulation diminished the input-output relationship and increased the likelihood of transmission failure between the preBötC activity and the hypoglossal nucleus. These effects of HO-2 dysregulation could be mimicked by exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S and mitigated by either pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of CSE. Together these observations indicate that centrally derived HO-2/CO and CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S signaling interact as important modulators of hypoglossal output contributing to upper airway tone.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypoglossal neurons express hemeoxygenase-2 (HO-2)</title><p>We assessed whether hypoglossal neurons express HO-2.

A reduction of input-output relationship between preBötC and the hypoglossal nucleus has been previously associated with increased transmission failure, which is defined by the inability of preBötC activity to produce hypoglossal output at the network level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia et al., 2016</xref>. The reduced I/O ratio in ChrMP459 was, indeed, associated with increased transmission failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, Baseline: 94.130±1.27% vs. ChrMP459: 75.100 ± 3.43%, p&lt;0.0001). Examining the relationship between failed transmission and the burst area in the preBötC revealed that while the many transmission failures were associated with subnetwork preBötC activity (i.e. integrated burst areas ≤ 50%), these events were not restricted to subnetwork activity but rather, occurred across a range of integrated burst areas from the inspiratory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

HO-2 dysregulation promoted subnetwork activity and irregularities in rhythmogenesis from the preBötC while also disturbing excitatory synaptic drive currents and intrinsic excitability of inspiratory hypoglossal neurons. Our investigations indicate that these phenomena contribute to a reduction in the input-output relationship and an increased propensity for transmission failure between the preBötC and the hypoglossal motor nucleus. Blocking CSE activity mitigated many effects caused by HO-2 dysregulation; whereas, using an H<sub>2</sub>S donor mimicked the impairments to the input-output relationship and intermittent failures observed with HO-2 dysregulation. Together these findings demonstrate a role for centrally-derived interactions between HO-2 and CSE activity in regulating motoneuron output responsible for maintaining upper airway patency.</p><p>We used two approaches to dysregulate HO-2 activity in the rhythmic brainstem slice preparation. First, pharmacologically, by using the pan HO inhibitor, ChrMP459 in wild-type slices; and second, by performing experiments in slices from HO-2 null mice. Using these two approaches produced some empirical differences. The frequency of rhythmogenesis in the preBötC was faster and the hypoglossal IrS<sub>AMP</sub> was larger in HO-2 null networks when compared to wild-type networks. However, ChrMP459 did not impact these metrics. Despite these differences, both approaches produce similar effects on subnetwork preBötC activity, the I/O ratio, rate of transmission between preBötC and the hypoglossal nucleus and on synaptic drive currents in hypoglossal motoneurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Like that of IH, HO-2 dysregulation increases cycle to cycle irregularity of preBötC burst amplitude and produces subnetwork activity in the preBötC that often failed to produce measurable hypoglossal output. The failure to generate measurable output from the motor pool also occurred with larger preBötC bursts, albeit in a smaller percentage of occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) suggesting the impact of HO-2 dysregulation was not restricted to effects on the preBötC.</p><p>Simultaneous triple recordings from the preBötC, premotor field, and the hypoglossal nucleus demonstrated that in ChrMP459, premotor activity corresponding to the preBötC rhythm was reliable; whereas, hypoglossal activity often failed. These experiments suggested that HO-2 dysregulation produced deficits in synaptic physiology between intermediate premotor neurons and the hypoglossal nucleus and possibly affected the postsynaptic excitability of hypoglossal motoneurons. Patch clamp recordings demonstrated that ChrMP459 reduced postsynaptic action potential generation and intrinsic excitability of inspiratory hypoglossal neurons. Reduced motoneuron excitability also corresponded with HO-2 dysregulation mediated reduction in synaptic drive currents in hypoglossal neurons. Although these experiments did not resolve the contribution of changes in presynaptic or postsynaptic properties to suppressing synaptic drive, the phenomenon appeared independent of effects related to inhibition as these experiments were performed in the presence of blockers for fast GABAergic and glycinergic receptors.</p><p>While HO-2 expression was not documented in either premotor neurons or the preBötC, HO-2 dysregulation impacted the respiratory network promoting subnetwork preBötC activity and increasing the irregularity of the rhythm. While the disinhibition experiments in ChrMP459 indicated that HO-2 dysregulation promotes a network state favoring synaptic inhibition to promote subnetwork activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), disinhibition in HO-2 null slices neither improved the IrS<sub>AMP</sub> of the preBötC nor reduced the occurrence of subnetwork preBötC activity (<italic>data not shown</italic>). These divergent outcomes raise the possibility that long-term loss of HO-2 activity during development may have a broader impact on mechanisms of governing rhythmogenesis that cannot be corrected by acutely blocking synaptic inhibition in the brainstem network.</p><p>Based on prior observations demonstrating that lost HO-2 dependent CO activity enhances CSE-dependent H2S production and leads to respiratory disturbances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peng et al., 2018</xref>, it was predicted that the provision of CO or blockade CSE activity would improve subnetwork activity and amplitude irregularities of rhythmogenesis from the preBötC. While using, the CO donor, CORM-3 and blocking CSE activity in HO-2 null slices, on average, reduced both subnetwork activity and the IrS<sub>AMP</sub> in the preBötC, both phenomena were still statistically similar to that observed in preBötC rhythms recorded from unmanipulated HO-2 null slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings suggests that HO-2 dysregulation may also involve actions that are independent from CO and CSE / H2S activities. In addition to CO, biliverdin-bilirubin and ferrous iron are bioactive molecules generated from activity of heme oxygenases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Snyder and Barañano, 2001</xref>. Bilirubin acts as antioxidant protecting neurons from oxidative injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doré et al., 1999</xref>, whereas ferrous iron can promote an oxidative state and cause injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutteridge and Halliwell, 2018</xref>. These molecules generated from HO-2 activity may be important to maintaining redox state and stable rhythmogenesis from the preBötC during development. Indeed, reactive oxygen species have specific and different actions on rhythmogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia et al., 2011</xref> while the promote of a pro-oxidant state in the preBötC can lead to irregular rhythmogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia et al., 2016</xref>. Further work is needed to resolve the potential role for different bioactive molecules derived from HO-2 activity on neurophysiology of the preBötC.</p><p>Although we did not resolve potential differences in HO-2 expression among specific motoneurons that innervate different upper airway muscles, such as genioglossal neurons, divergent effects of ChrMP459 on non-inspiratory and inspiratory hypoglossal neuronal properties were observed. ChrMP459 decreased rheobase among non-inspiratory neurons, whereas in inspiratory hypoglossal neurons, it decreased the magnitude of drive currents, increased rheobase, and diminished the number of action potentials generated during preBötC bursting. While these findings illustrate the potential for HO-dysregulation to differentially impact inspiratory and non-inspiratory hypoglossal neurons, these findings also emphasize a need to further resolve how HO-2 activity impacts different hypoglossal neurons innervating various muscle groups of the upper airway.</p><p>In the HO-2 null mouse, the incidence of OSA is absent with co-inhibition of CSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peng et al., 2018</xref>, which is consistent with reports that CO generated by HO-2 inhibits CSE-dependent H<sub>2</sub>S production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prabhakar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morikawa et al., 2012</xref>. After documenting CSE expression in hypoglossal neurons and demonstrating an increased abundance of H<sub>2</sub>S in the hypoglossal nucleus of HO-2 null mice, we demonstrated that a CO donor improves transmission and the input-output relationship between the preBötC and hypoglossal nucleus in HO-2 null slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Furthermore, using a H<sub>2</sub>S donor also increased transmission failures and reduced the I/O ratio similar to dysregulating HO-2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). Endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S activity could originate from other H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzymes, such as cystathionone β-synthase (CBS) that is expressed primarily in astrocytes throughout the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Enokido et al., 2005</xref>; yet CBS inhibition appears to have limited impact on inspiratory activity from the hypoglossal nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">da Silva et al., 2017</xref>. Additionally, our experiments manipulating CSE activity, by either treating HO-2 null mice with L-PAG or using HO-2:CSE null slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7D–E ,</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), improved the I/O and reduced transmission failure from preBötC to the hypoglossal nucleus. Larger synaptic drive currents were also observed in HO-2 null hypoglossal neurons after treatment with L-PAG. Thus, in contrast to that in the preBötC, where HO-2 dysregulation may involve actions that independent from CSE / H2S, the mutual interaction between HO-2/CO and CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S appears to have a major role in regulating hypoglossal output by both modulating excitatory synaptic drive currents received by hypoglossal motoneurons and impacting their intrinsic excitability.</p><p>How might enhanced H<sub>2</sub>S signaling reduce excitatory synaptic currents and excitability of hypoglossal neurons? While it is possible that H<sub>2</sub>S may impact presynaptic release of glutamate from intermediate premotor neurons and/or postsynaptic receptor activity of hypoglossal neurons, the ChrMP459 mediated increase in rheobase among inspiratory hypoglossal neurons implicated the involvement of non-synaptic conductance(s) downstream of H<sub>2</sub>S-based signaling caused by perturbations in HO-2 activity. H<sub>2</sub>S can enhance both K<sub>ATP</sub> and SK<sub>Ca</sub> activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mustafa et al., 2011</xref>. In the hypoglossal neurons, K<sub>ATP</sub> is dynamically active causing periodic adjustment of neuronal excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haller et al., 2001</xref> while SK<sub>Ca</sub> also regulates excitability and firing properties of hypoglossal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lape and Nistri, 2000</xref>. In ChrMP459, tolbutamide had a limited effect normalizing transmission as it improved the I/O ratio, but did not reduce transmission failure. Tolbutamide neither increased excitatory synaptic currents nor enhanced intrinsic excitability of hypoglossal neurons in ChrMP459. In contrast, apamin normalized synaptic drive currents and increased excitability of inspiratory hypoglossal neurons in ChrMP459. These results indicated that blockade of K<sub>ATP</sub> was limited in countering the effects on HO-2 dysregulation in the hypoglossal nucleus, whereas that blockade of SK<sub>Ca</sub> sufficiently mitigates many aspects of HO-2 dysregulation in hypoglossal neurons associated with preBötC activity.</p><p>In addition, the occurrence of obstructive apnea in HO-2 null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng et al., 2017</xref>, spontaneous hypertensive rats exhibit an increased incidence of apneas and hypopneas that are associated with reduced CO levels due to a reduction in HO-2 activity and increased H<sub>2</sub>S generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peng et al., 2014</xref>. While in both cases, these effects have been linked to interactions between CO and H<sub>2</sub>S in the peripheral nervous system, our findings indicate that central HO-2 dysregulation may also contribute to the incidence of apneas. Loss of HO-2 activity causes irregular rhythmogenesis from the preBötC while also reducing synaptic drive and intrinsic excitability in hypoglossal motoneurons. In the hypoglossal nucleus, the impact of this dysregulation appears to be largely normalized by blocking CSE activity suggesting that the interaction between HO-2 dependent CO production and CSE-dependent H<sub>2</sub>S activity have an important role in regulating hypoglossal activity.

The combination of increased chemoreflex sensitivity, imbalanced <underline>preBötC excitation/inhibition activity,</underline> and reduced hypoglossal motoneuron excitability caused by disturbed HO-2 activity could all contribute to the increased loop gain that perpetuates transmission failures in respiratory motor output and disrupt upper airway patency in HO-2 null mice and OSA patients. Moreover, this interaction may extend beyond apneas and may also be important for regulating the genioglossus and other muscle groups of the tongue during behaviors such as swallowing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fregosi and Ludlow, 2014</xref> and vocalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wei et al., 2022</xref>, particularly when considering the potential for rapid signaling via CO and H<sub>2</sub>S. Furthermore, should mutual interactions between these gasotransmitters and their respective enzymes exist in other motoneuron pools, our findings may be relevant to a variety of clinical conditions such as fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity syndrome (i.e. wooden chest syndrome), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury where upper airway control may be affected. Thus, while this study demonstrates the potential importance of central HO-2/CO and CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S interactions in regulating hypoglossal motoneurons, future work is needed to fully understand the role of gasotransmitters in the physiology of the hypoglossal nucleus and other motoneuron pools.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study approval</title><p>In accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines, all animal protocols were performed with the approval of the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Chicago (ACUP 72486, ACUP 71811).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Experiments were performed using neonatal (postnatal day 6 to postnatal day 12) wild-type mice (C57BL/6; Charles River), HO-2 null mice (from S.

The hypoglossal nucleus and control (inferior olive nucleus) brainstem tissue punches were made from the slices using a chilled micro-punch needle. Hypoglossal tissue from a single brainstem was not sufficient for effectively measuring H<sub>2</sub>S levels; therefore, we pooled bilateral micro punched tissue from two mice for each sample where H<sub>2</sub>S levels measured.

The preBötC and XIIn was retained in a single transverse brainstem slice (thickness: 560±40 μm). The slice was transferred into the recording chamber (~6 mL volume) where it was continuously superfused with recirculating aCSF (flow rate: 12–15 mL/min).

Whole cell patch clamp recordings of hypoglossal motoneurons were obtained using the blind-patch technique with a sample frequency of 40 kHz. Recordings were made with unpolished patch electrodes, pulled from borosilicated glass pipettes with a capillary filament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia et al., 2016</xref>. The electrodes had a resistance of 3.5–8 MΩ when filled with the whole cell patch clamp pipette solution containing (in mM): 140 K-gluc acid, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 10 HEPES. Neurons located at least two to three cell layers (about 75–250 μm) rostral from the caudal surface of the slice were recorded. The liquid junction potential was calculated to be –12 mV and was subtracted from the membrane potential. The series resistance was compensated and corrected throughout each experiment. In voltage clamp experiments, membrane potential was held at –60 mV. Current clamp experiments used a holding potential between 0 and –100 pA to establish the baseline resting membrane potential between –55 and –70 mV. In some cases, we determined rheobases using a ramp protocol in our current clamp recordings. This ramp protocol consisted of a hyperpolarizing step (–100 pA) succeeded by the injection of a ramping depolarizing current (122 pA/sec; peak current 600 pA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Unless otherwise explicitly stated elsewhere, each n value represents an individual animal that served as a biological replicate for a given measurement.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jeannie Chin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ralph Fregosi (Reviewer #2); Silvia Pagliardini (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The evidence for transmission failure with ChrMP459 is somewhat weak (Figure 1E), though the data comparing WT and HO KOs is more convincing. Some discussion of these differences is warranted.</p><p>2) I am not sure how you can conclude that transmission uncoupling between premotor and XIIMNs is postsynaptic &quot;These results suggested that dysregulated HO-2 modulates is a postsynaptic phenomenon in the hypoglossal nucleus.&quot; What if the gases also change excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to hypoglossal Motoneurons (e.g., from GABAergic and/or glutamatergic neurons)?</p><p>3) Related to the above, the use of the term &quot;intrinsic properties&quot; in this context needs to be defined, otherwise, it may lead to confusion. Most consider intrinsic properties to be relatively stationary, at least on short timescales.</p><p>4) The rheobase data in Figure 4C is not convincing-did you run a stat test without the outliers?</p><p>5) Please indicate how tissue punches for H2S detection were collected in the methods- from fresh or fixed tissue? Following electrophysiological recordings or in naïve mouse tissue?</p><p>6) Figure.1 HO-2 immunostaining images do not have a particularly high resolution and appear blurry. Can the authors produce an image with a higher quality of staining?</p><p>7) Figures 1 and 3. Because the study is related to the pathway from the preBötC to the hypoglossal motoneurons, and previous work indicates the presence of central apneas in these mice, it would be helpful to determine the anatomical expression of HO-2 and CSE not only in the XII MN but also in the preBötC and XII premotoneurons. (If these data are not available, please consider discussing this as a limitation. Additional experiments are not required – MLB).</p><p>8)Figure 1B – failed transmission events are linked to events in PBC where peak amplitude appears to be reduced. Can the authors comment on this? Also, inspiratory output variability appears to be increased (and frequency reduced) following bath application of ChrMP. Were these parameters assessed?</p><p>9) Figure.1D. I find the heat maps a bit tricky to read. If it is an Input/Output ratio between PBC and motor nucleus for each respiratory-like event (baseline cycle number on the X axis), wouldn't you have an alternation between 0 and 1 (motor output happens or not)? Why then arbitrary units are indicated? Please clarify, maybe include more details on figure legends or methods section since this information is key for a better understanding of the results.</p><p>10) Figure.2 HO-2 null mice present also with a reduced respiratory frequency in addition to failed transmission. Was this quantified in medullary slices? Also, given the potentially wider effect of ChrMP pharmacological action (i.e., block of other enzymes), was the drug tested in HO-2 null mice?</p><p>11) Figure.6B, I may be wrong, but up to figure 5 all figures with the Heat maps demonstrate that disruption of CO production causes a decrease in the I/O ratios (figures 1D, 2B, 3C) with a reduction in transmission rate. Here, in Figure 6B with CORM3 you still have a decrease in the I/O ratios but an increase in transmission rate. Can you please clarify?</p><p>12) Figure. 7D1 Traces from PBC appear to be very different, can you comment on this?</p><p>Line 387. What about the data reported in Figure 3.C that include the connection with premotor neurons?</p><p>13) The contribution of the gas transmitters to our understanding of homeostatic plasticity would broaden the appeal of your work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81978.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The evidence for transmission failure with ChrMP459 is somewhat weak (Figure 1E), though the data comparing WT and HO KOs is more convincing.

In many of the later experiments throughout the study, the same protocols were used but the effects of either ChrMP459 or the HO-2 null slices on the parameters were not reported in the original figure (i.e., Figures 1 &amp; 2).</p><p>In this revision, we have now aggregated results from all experiments across the study for ChrMP459 and the HO-2 null slices and report their respective effects on the preBötC rhythm; extracellular hypoglossal activity; transmission failure; and the input-output relationship between preBötC and hypoglossal nucleus. In HO-2 null slices, the instantaneous frequency of rhythmogenesis in the preBötC was faster, and the irregularity of burst amplitude (IrS<sub>AMP</sub>) in the hypoglossal nucleus larger compared to the respective metrics from unperturbed wild-type slices (see: Figure 2 and Table 1); whereas, these metrics were unaffected in the ChrMP459 experiments (see Figure 1 and Table 1).</p><p>Given the Reviewer’s comment, we performed a meta-analysis comparing the findings from ChrMP459 and HO-2 null experiments (See Table 2). At the level of preBötC, the occurrence of subnetwork activity, burst amplitude and IrS<sub>AMP</sub> were similar between ChrMP459 and HO-2 null experiments. The I/O ratio and rate of transmission failure were also similar between approaches. Finally, the size of inspiratory synaptic drive currents in hypoglossal neurons were not difference between ChrMP459 and HO‑2. Thus, while HO-2 null slices showed faster rhythms and more irregularity at the level of hypoglossal nucleus, this meta-analysis demonstrates that both approaches to dysregulate HO-2 activity produced similar and consistent outcomes at the network and individual neuron levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am not sure how you can conclude that transmission uncoupling between premotor and XIIMNs is postsynaptic &quot;These results suggested that dysregulated HO-2 modulates is a postsynaptic phenomenon in the hypoglossal nucleus.&quot; What if the gases also change excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to hypoglossal Motoneurons (e.g., from GABAergic and/or glutamatergic neurons)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment and have removed the original statement and replaced it with a more in-depth analysis and discussion of factors contributing dysregulation of the hypoglossal nucleus, including HO-2 modulation of the preBötC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the above, the use of the term &quot;intrinsic properties&quot; in this context needs to be defined, otherwise, it may lead to confusion. Most consider intrinsic properties to be relatively stationary, at least on short timescales.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We have revised and now use the term intrinsic excitability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The rheobase data in Figure 4C is not convincing-did you run a stat test without the outliers?</p></disp-quote><p>While there are two data points which appear larger than much of the baseline rheobase data, they were included in the data analysis as these baseline rheobase values did not exceed two standard deviations from the mean. Performing statistical analyses without these outliers still reveal a significant difference in rheobase before and after ChrMP459 application (P=0.01, Baseline: 123.2 ± 20.32 pA; ChrMP459: 254.0 ± 54.35 pA).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please indicate how tissue punches for H2S detection were collected in the methods- from fresh or fixed tissue? Following electrophysiological recordings or in naïve mouse tissue?</p></disp-quote><p>Tissue punches for H<sub>2</sub>S detection were collected from naive flash-frozen tissue (i.e., not fixed or fresh). We have revised the Results section and methods to make this clear.</p><p>“Anaesthetized mice (urethane, 1.2g•kg<sup>−1</sup> <italic>i.p.</italic>) were rapidly euthanized by decapitation. Following rapid removal of the brainstem, the tissue was flash frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Flash frozen tissues were stored at -80<sup>o</sup>C until coronal brainstem sections (300μm thick) were cut with a cryostat at –20°C and tissue punches of desired tissue were procured for immediate H<sub>2</sub>S measurements. The hypoglossal nucleus and control (inferior olive nucleus) brainstem tissue punches were made from the slices using a chilled micro-punch needle. Hypoglossal tissue from a single brainstem was not sufficient for effectively measuring H<sub>2</sub>S levels; therefore, we pooled bilateral micro punched tissue from two mice for each sample where H<sub>2</sub>S levels measured.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure.1 HO-2 immunostaining images do not have a particularly high resolution and appear blurry. Can the authors produce an image with a higher quality of staining?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this issue was related a file conversion problem. We have rectified this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figures 1 and 3. Because the study is related to the pathway from the preBötC to the hypoglossal motoneurons, and previous work indicates the presence of central apneas in these mice, it would be helpful to determine the anatomical expression of HO-2 and CSE not only in the XII MN but also in the preBötC and XII premotoneurons. (If these data are not available, please consider discussing this as a limitation. Additional experiments are not required – MLB).</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, immunohistological expression of neither CSE nor HO-2 were examined at the level of the preBötC. As the recommended by the reviewer, we now recognize this limitation in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 1B – failed transmission events are linked to events in PBC where peak amplitude appears to be reduced. Can the authors comment on this? Also, inspiratory output variability appears to be increased (and frequency reduced) following bath application of ChrMP. Were these parameters assessed?</p></disp-quote><p>Our revision now includes an extensive analysis related to the preBötC (see Figures 1 and 2, and Table 1 and Figure 8—figure supplement 2:). Both ChrMP459 and HO-2 null experiments increased irregularity score of burst amplitude in the preBötC. This was associated with an increased the occurrence of subnetwork preBötC activity (defined as network bursts having ≤50% burst area). Many failed transmission events coincided with subnetwork preBötC activity; however, transmission failures were observed across the continuum burst areas in the preBötC in both ChrMP459 and HO-2 null experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure.1D. I find the heat maps a bit tricky to read. If it is an Input/Output ratio between PBC and motor nucleus for each respiratory-like event (baseline cycle number on the X axis), wouldn't you have an alternation between 0 and 1 (motor output happens or not)? Why then arbitrary units are indicated? Please clarify, maybe include more details on figure legends or methods section since this information is key for a better understanding of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>The heat maps illustrating the cycle-to-cycle variability of the input-output relationship for up to 25 consecutive cycles in the two-minute analysis window. The x-axis reflects cycle number while the y-axis represents an individual biological replicate of the slice experiment. The I/O ratio is a non‑binary number value reflecting the relative strength for preBötC activity to that of corresponding hypoglossal activity. We have now included the expanded description (provided below) in the methods section to improve clarity for the reader.</p><p>“The input-output (I/O) ratio for each inspiratory event (defined by a network burst in preBötC) was calculated as the ratio of preBötC burst area to corresponding hypoglossal burst area as previously described<sup>28</sup>. Calculation of the I/O ratio, was performed using the following equation:</p><p>IO<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> = ∫BA<sub>XII<italic>n</italic></sub> / ∫BA<sub>preBötC<italic>n</italic></sub></p><p>where IO<sub>n</sub> is the I/O ratio of the n<sup>th</sup> cycle, ∫BA<sub>XII<italic>n</italic></sub> is the integrated burst area in the hypoglossal nucleus of the n<sup>th</sup> cycle and ∫BA<sub>preBötC<italic>n</italic></sub> the integrated burst area in the preBötC of the n<sup>th</sup> cycle. In cycles where preBötC did not correspond with hypoglossal output, ∫BA<sub>XII<italic>n</italic></sub> was assigned a value of 0. Prior to the calculation of the I/O ratio, each ∫BA<sub>XII</sub> was normalized to the mean hypoglossal integrated burst area of the analysis window, and each ∫BA<sub>preBötC</sub>, was normalized to the mean preBötC integrated burst area of the analysis window.”</p><p>As illustrated by the equation provided, I/O ratio is a unitless value. As factors such as electrode positioning and recording tip size, can impact integrated burst area from, the normalization steps prior to calculation allow for unbiased comparison across individual slice experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure.2 HO-2 null mice present also with a reduced respiratory frequency in addition to failed transmission. Was this quantified in medullary slices? Also, given the potentially wider effect of ChrMP pharmacological action (i.e., block of other enzymes), was the drug tested in HO-2 null mice?</p></disp-quote><p>The original representative trace from Figure 2 did not accurately reflect the mean frequency of rhythmogenesis in HO-2 null mice. Our analyses (see: Table 1) indicate that HO2-null preBötC rhythms are faster than corresponding wild‑type rhythms. We have now replaced the representative traces to more accurately reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure.6B, I may be wrong, but up to figure 5 all figures with the Heat maps demonstrate that disruption of CO production causes a decrease in the I/O ratios (figures 1D, 2B, 3C) with a reduction in transmission rate. Here, in Figure 6B with CORM3 you still have a decrease in the I/O ratios but an increase in transmission rate. Can you please clarify?</p></disp-quote><p>Using the pharmacological CO donor CORM-3 increased the I/O ratio when applied to preparations where HO-2 was dysregulated the data illustrates this, please see line 352.</p><p>“Dysregulated HO-2 activity, caused by either pharmacological (ChrMP459) or genetic (HO-2 null mice) manipulation, is improved by CORM-3 as indicated by larger I/O ratios (Figure 6B, n=8; dysregulated HO-2: 0.70 ± 0.09 vs. CORM-3: 1.05 ± 0.07, P=0.01) and improved transmission (Figure 6C, dysregulated HO-2: 75.05 ± 6.3% vs. CORM-3: 94.21 ± 2.67%, P=0.02).”</p><p>Upon inspection, we found that the I/O heat map images for Dysregulated HO-2 and the CORM-3 rescue were flipped, this has now been rectified and the proper images conveying this data are in place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure. 7D1 Traces from PBC appear to be very different, can you comment on this?</p><p>Line 387. What about the data reported in Figure 3.C that include the connection with premotor neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>The screen captures of representative traces in Figure 7D1 and Figure 3C were obtained using different parameters which caused the appearance of differences between in preBötC traces. We revised these figures to better show the resulting comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The contribution of the gas transmitters to our understanding of homeostatic plasticity would broaden the appeal of your work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention and agree with the sentiment for broadening the appeal of our study. However, as our study does not directly test aspects of homeostatic plasticity (i.e., the capacity of neurons to regula), we felt that including too much discussion of this section such discussion may be overreaching, but we have recrafted many aspects of the manuscript in an attempt to broadening the importance of our work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
