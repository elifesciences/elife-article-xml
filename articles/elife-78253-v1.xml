PCNA is loaded around DNA by the ATP-dependent clamp loader replication factor C (RFC), which acts at single-stranded (ss)/double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) junctions harboring a recessed 3’ end (3’ ss/dsDNA junctions) and at DNA nicks. To illuminate the loading mechanism we have investigated the structure of RFC:PCNA bound to ATPγS and 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions or nicked DNA using cryogenic electron microscopy. Unexpectedly, we observe open and closed PCNA conformations in the RFC:PCNA:DNA complex, revealing that PCNA can adopt an open, planar conformation that allows direct insertion of dsDNA, and raising the question of whether PCNA ring closure is mechanistically coupled to ATP hydrolysis. By resolving multiple DNA-bound states of RFC:PCNA we observe that partial melting facilitates lateral insertion into the central channel formed by RFC:PCNA. We also resolve the Rfc1 N-terminal domain and demonstrate that its single BRCT domain participates in coordinating DNA prior to insertion into the central RFC channel, which promotes PCNA loading on the lagging strand of replication forks in vitro. Combined, our data suggest a comprehensive and fundamentally revised model for the RFC-catalyzed loading of PCNA onto DNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>PCNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hite</surname><given-names>Richard K</given-names></name><name><surname>Remus</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM107239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remus</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM127428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remus</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM132081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castaneda</surname><given-names>Juan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schrecker</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Josie Robertson Investigators Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hite</surname><given-names>Richard K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-particle cryo-EM structures reveal a multistep process of how DNA is loaded into the DNA sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen by the canonical clamp loader replication factor C.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential co-factor in DNA metabolic processes critical for the maintenance of eukaryotic chromosomes. Initially characterized as a processivity factor for replicative DNA polymerases, PCNA has since been shown to be an interaction hub for a wide array of proteins involved in DNA replication, the repair or bypass of DNA damage, chromatin assembly, chromosome cohesion, and cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boehm et al., 2016</xref>). Integral to PCNA function is its ability to topologically encircle DNA and act as a sliding clamp. PCNA forms homotrimeric complexes in which the subunits are arranged head-to-tail to form a closed ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gulbis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishna et al., 1994</xref>). The outer ring surface is shaped by globular β-sheet domains and harbors the protein interaction sites, while the ring interior is lined with α-helices featuring positively charged surface residues that can engage in electrostatic interactions with the DNA phosphate backbone. With an inner diameter of ~34 Å the PCNA ring can comfortably accommodate B-form DNA (~20 Å diameter), facilitating the ability of PCNA to slide along DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, PCNA also forms stable rings free in solution, preventing its spontaneous binding to DNA in the absence of free DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhuang et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, PCNA loading onto DNA is facilitated by clamp loader complexes belonging to the AAA+ family of ATPases that open the PCNA ring and close it around DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kelch, 2016</xref>). Two related clamp loaders, RFC and Ctf18-RFC, can load PCNA onto DNA. RFC is essential for cell growth and considered the canonical PCNA loader, while Ctf18-RFC is non-essential and appears to perform more specialized roles in replication checkpoint signaling and chromosome cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbel et al., 2021</xref>). The DNA substrate specificity of clamp loaders is critical to prevent random and futile clamp loading along chromosome arms and target clamps to relevant sites instead. Accordingly, RFC loads PCNA specifically at single-stranded (ss)/double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) junctions harboring a recessed 3’ end (3’ junctions) or at DNA nicks, DNA structures that are commonly formed at sites of DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bylund and Burgers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ellison and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsurimoto and Stillman, 1991</xref>). However, how RFC recognizes 3’ junctions, opens the PCNA ring, and inserts DNA into the PCNA ring remains unclear due to a lack of structural information on the RFC:PCNA:DNA complex.</p><p>The overall structural organization of RFC has been revealed by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM analyses of the yeast and human complexes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaubitz et al., 2020</xref>). RFC is composed of four small AAA+ subunits, Rfc2-5, and one large AAA+ subunit, Rfc1, which assemble head-to-tail into a two-tiered partially open ring structure. The N-terminal tier contains the AAA+ domains and the unique A’ domain of Rfc1 (note: yeast nomenclature is used throughout this paper). The C-terminal tier, in contrast, forms a rigid collar composed of α-helical domains provided by Rfc1-5. As is characteristic for AAA+ ATPases, ATP is bound at RFC subunit interfaces with catalytic residues at each ATPase site contributed by adjacent protomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>). However, Rfc5 lacks residues critical for ATP hydrolysis and does not form a composite active site due to its position at the gap in the AAA+ tier. Mutational studies suggest that all four ATPase sites in RFC are required for normal RFC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sakato et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmidt et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marzahn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Podust et al., 1998a</xref>). Biochemical studies moreover suggest that ATP-binding to RFC promotes sequential PCNA binding, PCNA opening, and DNA binding by the RFC:PCNA complex, while ATP hydrolysis induces the release of closed PCNA on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhuang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomes et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakato et al., 2012b</xref>). The structural basis for these ATP-driven events is not clear.</p><p>In previous structural studies, which lacked DNA, RFC adopts an inactive or autoinhibited conformation in complex with a closed PCNA ring in which the ATPase sites are incompletely formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaubitz et al., 2020</xref>). In these structures, PCNA contacts Rfc1, -4, and -3, but is freely suspended over Rfc2 and -5. However, PCNA clamp opening is thought to involve interactions with all RFC subunits, which was suggested to force the closed planar PCNA ring into an open spiral conformation that matches the pitch of the spirally arranged RFC subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>). Such an out-of-plane clamp-opening mechanism is supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the PCNA ring and structural analyses of homologous clamp loader:clamp:DNA complexes from bacteriophage T4 and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kazmirski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miyata et al., 2005</xref>). In this model, PCNA will form a gap of &lt;10 Å, which would preclude the insertion of dsDNA. However, by analogy to the clamp loader complexes from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and bacteriophage T4, and in accordance with previous DNase footprinting and mutational analyses, RFC is thought to bind to the duplex region of 3’ junctions inside its central channel, loading PCNA onto the adjacent dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsurimoto and Stillman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Simonetta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yao et al., 2006</xref>). A ‘screw-cap model’ that reconciles the narrow gap predicted for the open RFC-PCNA complex with PCNA loading over dsDNA was proposed in which the open RFC-PCNA complex initially threads onto ssDNA and subsequently slides toward the 3’ junction for functional positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>). Direct evidence for this model is currently lacking.</p><p>In addition to the AAA+ and collar domains, Rfc1 contains unique N- and C-terminal extensions that are absent in Rfc2-5. The C-terminus of Rfc1 contains the A’ domain that is situated between the AAA+ domains of Rfc1 and Rfc5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaubitz et al., 2020</xref>). The structural organization of the Rfc1 N-terminal domain (NTD) in the context of the RFC complex is not known. It has been noted early on that a region of the Rfc1 NTD exhibits significant homology to domains found in prokaryotic DNA ligases and PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bunz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burbelo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fotedar et al., 1996</xref>). Subsequent sequence analysis suggested that the Rfc1 NTD encompasses a single BRCT domain that forms a distinct BRCT subclass with single BRCT domains found in prokaryotic DNA ligases and PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bork et al., 1997</xref>). This prediction was confirmed by NMR analysis of the human Rfc1 BRCT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kobayashi et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kobayashi et al., 1997b</xref>). Surprisingly, unlike tandem BRCT domains in eukaryotes that mediate phosphorylation-dependent protein interactions, the BRCT domain of Rfc1 was found to harbor a structure-specific DNA-binding activity that has increased affinity for dsDNA featuring a recessed and phosphorylated 5’ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burbelo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fotedar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kobayashi et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The functional significance of the Rfc1 NTD has remained enigmatic. On the one hand, biochemical studies with truncated RFC complexes have demonstrated that the Rfc1 NTD is not essential for PCNA loading in vitro or for normal growth of budding yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uhlmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Podust et al., 1998b</xref>). Moreover, RFC lacking the Rfc1 NTD was found to exhibit even greater activity in vitro than the full-length protein, which has been variably attributed to the greater protein stability or the loss of non-specific DNA-binding activity of RFC lacking the Rfc1 NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uhlmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Podust et al., 1998b</xref>). On the other hand, mutations in the Rfc1 NTD cause a cold-sensitive growth defect in budding yeast, while both truncation and mutation of the Rfc1 NTD increase sensitivity of budding yeast cells to the DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McAlear et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xie et al., 1999</xref>). Truncation of the NTD in human RFC1 has also been associated with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). Combined with the high degree of conservation of the Rfc1 NTD across eukaryotes, these data suggest that the Rfc1 NTD performs an important but undefined function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cullmann et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>To address the mechanism of PCNA loading by RFC, we have reconstituted the budding yeast RFC:PCNA complex bound to a DNA substrate harboring a recessed 3’ junction and examined its structure using cryogenic electron microscopy. Contrary to previous models, our data reveal that PCNA is opened in a largely planar fashion and that PCNA closing around DNA can occur in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. Moreover, by resolving multiple DNA-bound states of the RFC:PCNA complex, we uncover the mechanism by which dsDNA is inserted into the central channel formed by RFC:PCNA. Finally, we resolve the DNA-bound structure of the N-terminal BRCT domain in the context of RFC:PCNA:DNA complexes and demonstrate that this domain promotes PCNA loading at replication forks in vitro. Combined, our data suggest a novel and comprehensive model for the RFC-catalyzed loading of PCNA at 3’ junctions that refutes previous models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of RFC:PCNA in an active state</title><p>We expressed and purified the full-length RFC complex composed of Rfc1-5 from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells, and trimeric PCNA and the replication factor A (RPA) complex from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ATPase activity of purified RFC was stimulated by the presence of PCNA and DNA containing a 3’ ss/dsDNA junction, indicating that the purified components are functional. RPA has been shown to promote the loading of PCNA by RFC specifically at 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayner et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, to resolve the structure of RFC actively loading PCNA onto DNA, we preincubated RPA with a DNA substrate containing a 20-base double-stranded segment and a 50-base 5’ overhang, then assembled the full RFC:PCNA:DNA complex in the presence of saturating ATPγS, separated intact complexes by glycerol gradient centrifugation, and collected cryogenic electron microscopic images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Image analysis revealed the presence of multiple distinct conformations of RFC:PCNA in the presence of a 3’ ss/dsDNA junction at resolutions from 2.9 to 2.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In all of the conformations, RFC:PCNA is composed of three layers: a bottom layer comprised of the collar domains of the five RFC subunits, a middle layer of the AAA+ domains of the five RFC subunits, and the C-terminal A’ domain of Rfc1 and a top layer of the PCNA homotrimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>). Despite being present in the vitrified sample, no unassigned densities are present in the map, indicating that RPA is not associated with either RFC or PCNA in a stable manner. The most notable difference between the three conformations is the arrangement of the PCNA ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). In classes 1 and 2, PCNA is dilated in a planar fashion compared to crystal structures of closed PCNA rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gulbis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishna et al., 1994</xref>). In class 1, the space between PCNA protomers measures 22 Å, which is wide enough to accommodate dsDNA. The gap in class 2 is much narrower and unable to accommodate dsDNA. In class 3, PCNA is fully closed and resembles structures of PCNA alone and in complex with RFC in an inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishna et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>).

Due to a mismatch between heteropentameric RFC and homotrimeric PCNA, there are several different types of interfaces between the subunits of RFC and PCNA. Rfc1, Rfc3, and Rfc5 bind in the hydrophobic grooves between the N- and C-terminal domains of PCNA<sub>A</sub>, PCNA<sub>B</sub>, and PCNA<sub>C</sub>, respectively. Rfc4 and Rfc2 bind at the inter-subunit interfaces between PCNA<sub>A</sub> and PCNA<sub>B</sub>, and PCNA<sub>B</sub> and PCNA<sub>C</sub>, respectively. The contacts established by Rfc1, Rfc3, and Rfc5 are larger and are comprised of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, while those established by Rfc4 and Rfc2 at the inter-subunit interfaces are smaller and largely hydrophilic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Unique among the RFC subunits, Rfc1 forms a second interaction with PCNA via its C-terminal A’ domain, resulting in each PCNA protomer associating with two RFC subunits in the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Also different are the positions of the AAA+ domains of RFC. In the autoinhibited structures, the AAA+ domains of RFC adopt a spiral configuration, whereas the AAA+ domains are arranged in a largely planar fashion in RFC:PCNA bound to a 3’ ss/ds DNA junction. The rearrangement of the AAA+ domains of RFC coincides with the conserved arginine finger from the neighboring subunits moving into direct contact with the ATPγS bound to the catalytic Rfc1, Rfc4, Rfc3, and Rfc2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). By contrast, GDP rather than an adenine nucleotide is bound in the nucleotide-binding site of Rfc5, which lacks residues important for ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmidt et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cai et al., 1998</xref>). Reprocessing of a recent data set of Rad24-RFC in complex with 9-1-1 and a 5’ ss/dsDNA junction yielded a 2.1 Å reconstruction of the open state that revealed that Rfc5 also binds GDP in the Rad24-RFC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>). In both structures, the specificity for Rfc5-binding guanine rather than adenine nucleotides is imparted by Rfc5-Arg52, which coordinates the C6 carbonyl and the N7 of the guanine base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the open state of RFC represents an active, pre-hydrolysis state of RFC with which PCNA is fully engaged.</p><p>Compared to the open state, the PCNA<sub>A</sub> and PCNA<sub>C</sub> protomers in the closed state rotate inward as rigid bodies in a planar fashion by 15° and 25°, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). The inward movement of PCNA<sub>C</sub> disengages it from RFC. In absence of its interaction with PCNA, the PCNA-binding site of Rfc5 adopts an alternative conformation in which it instead binds to the N-terminus of Rfc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the open state, the loop following the α4 helix, which we call the α4 loop that is comprised of residues 120–135, extends up and inserts into the hydrophobic groove of PCNA<sub>C</sub>, establishing a large interface. In the closed state, the α4 loop bends down and is sandwiched between the AAA+ domain of Rfc5 and the N-terminus of Rfc2. The α4 loop of Rfc5 also undergoes a conformational change during the opening of the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>). However, the conformations resolved in the presence of PCNA are distinct from those resolved in Rad24-RFC:9-1-1 as the α4 loop adopts a β-hairpin in the open Rad24-RFC:9-1-1 structure and is disordered in closed Rad24-RFC:9-1-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, flexibility within its α4 loop allows Rfc5 to bind to two distinct DNA clamps – PCNA and 9-1-1 – and stabilize them in their open states during loading.</p><p>While the inward movement of PCNA<sub>C</sub> results in its disengagement from RFC in the closed state, PCNA<sub>A</sub> remains tightly associated with RFC despite also pivoting inward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The interface between PCNA<sub>A</sub> and Rfc1 is unchanged in the closed state because Rfc1 also rotates compared to the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The inward rotation of Rfc1 yields a 10 Å movement of Rfc1-Phe405, which is inserted into the hydrophobic groove of PCNA<sub>A</sub> in both the open and closed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Indeed, Rfc1-Phe405 is inserted into the central groove of all known structures of RFC in complex with PCNA, indicating that it plays a central role in stabilizing the RFC:PCNA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>In the intermediate state, PCNA adopts a conformation that is a mixture of protomers that adopt open-like and closed-like states. In the intermediate state, PCNA<sub>C</sub> disengages from RFC to adopt a closed-like conformation. In contrast, Rfc1 and PCNA<sub>A</sub>, which move together as a single unit in all of the structures, are only slightly rotated and adopt more open-like positions that prevent PCNA<sub>A</sub> from binding to PCNA<sub>C</sub> and closing of the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Notably, the conformational changes in RFC in the closed and intermediate states do not arise from changes in nucleotide-binding state. Densities corresponding to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-coordinated ATPγS are resolved in the nucleotide-binding sites of Rfc1, Rfc4, Rfc3, and Rfc2 in the closed and intermediate maps as is a GDP in the nucleotide-binding site of the non-catalytic Rfc5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on comparisons between the open, intermediate, and closed states, we propose a two-step mechanism for the opening of PCNA when complexed with ATP-bound RFC. In the first step, Rfc1 and PCNA<sub>A</sub> together pivot outward, separating PCNA<sub>A</sub> from PCNA<sub>C</sub> to form an intermediate state. In the absence of its interaction with PCNA<sub>A</sub>, PCNA<sub>C</sub> can rotate freely and sample a range of conformations, including the open conformation where it binds to Rfc5. Once PCNA<sub>C</sub> contacts with Rfc5, the flexible α4 loop becomes ordered and binds in the hydrophobic groove of PCNA<sub>C</sub>, stabilizing PCNA in the open state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>3’ ss/dsDNA junctions bind to RFC:PCNA at multiple sites</title><p>In the maps for all three states, densities were sufficiently well resolved for us to model a portion of the 3’ ss/dsDNA junction. In the closed and intermediate states, the double-stranded region of the DNA is resolved extending from the bottom of the central chamber of RFC through to PCNA, while the 5’ overhang on the template strand passes through the opening between the AAA+ and A’ domains of Rfc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). When bound at this position, which we call site 1, the double-stranded region of the DNA in the central chamber is coordinated by Rfc1, Rfc4, Rfc3, and Rfc2. The backbone of the template strand binds to conserved isoleucine and arginine residues on helix α5 of Rfc4, Rfc3, and Rfc2 and to the side chains of Rfc1-Ser384 and Rfc1-Thr386, while the backbone of the primer strand binds to the side chain of Rfc5-Asn80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Binding to RFC:PCNA partially melts the double-stranded region of the DNA near the junction and we resolve density for unpaired bases on the primer strand that extend into an opening between the AAA + domains of Rfc1 and Rfc4 that is continuous with the bulk solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The last paired base of the double-stranded region of the primer strand binds to the side chain of Rfc1-Trp638, which serves a role analogous to the separation pin of helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baretić et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Büttner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee and Yang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Manthei et al., 2006</xref>). The unpaired region of the primer strand is stabilized through both hydrophobic and polar interactions. The first unpaired base of the primer strand binds to Rfc1-Phe582, while the phosphate backbone of the second and third unpaired bases are coordinated by Rfc4-Arg272 and Rfc4-Lys275, respectively. Notably, additional density is resolved extending from the last modelled base of the primer strand that could not be modelled, indicating that the number of unpaired bases on the primer strand varies among the imaged particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 5’ overhang of the template strand is guided through the opening between the AAA+ and A’ domains of Rfc1 through polar and hydrophobic interactions with Rfc5-Asn103, Rfc1-Asn459, Rfc1-Pro461, Rfc1-Arg464, Rfc1-Phe552, Rfc1-Arg632, Rfc1-Gln636, Rfc1-Phe666, Rfc1-Trp669, and Rfc1-Leu670.</p><p>In the open state, the 3’ ss/dsDNA junction binds between the collar, AAA+, and A’ domains of Rfc1, which we call site 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The 3’ junction binds to a hydrophobic surface at the interface between the collar and A’ domains of Rfc1 formed by Phe666, Trp669, and Leu670, with Phe666 serving as the separation pin for the template strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The unpaired bases on the 5’ overhang of the template strand bind to Asn459, Phe552, and Arg663 of Rfc1. While the precise positions of bases cannot be determined due to disorder, we can follow densities corresponding to a portion of the 5’ overhang on the template strand in a 5 Å low-pass filtered map as it wraps around the outside of the collar domain of Rfc1 and re-enters RFC through the opening between the AAA+ domains of Rfc1 and Rfc4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). There, several bases are again sufficiently ordered for modelling, and we observe that two of the bases occupy the same positions as the unpaired bases of the primer strand in the closed and intermediate states, indicating that it is a high-affinity binding site for ssDNA.</p><p>Eight base pairs of the double-stranded region of the DNA in site 2 are resolved in the density map, extending from the junction through the gap between the AAA+ and A’ domains of Rfc1 toward the opening in the PCNA ring between PCNA<sub>A</sub> and PCNA<sub>C</sub>. The backbone of the template strand in site 2 is coordinated by Ser674, Lys675, Lys678, and Arg681 on the A’ domain of Rfc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). While the gap between PCNA<sub>A</sub> and PCNA<sub>C</sub> is sufficiently wide to accommodate dsDNA, the minimum distance between the AAA+ and A’ domains of Rfc1 is only 15 Å. For a DNA to bind at site 2, it must adopt a highly distorted conformation. Indeed, the fourth and fifth bases of the double-stranded region base stack on the opposing strand and do not adopt canonical Watson-Crick base pairing to enable the DNA to access to the narrow opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In several of the maps, in addition to the well-resolved DNA densities at site 1 or 2, weak densities resembling a second segment of dsDNA are present between the AAA+ and collar domains of Rfc1. To better resolve these densities and potentially model a third DNA-binding site, we assembled and collected cryo-EM images of RFC:PCNA in complex with a second DNA substrate that contains a longer, 30 base-pair double-stranded DNA segment and a shorter, 10-base 5’ overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Rfc1 binds to both strands at the junction, with Phe552 interacting with the last base of the primer strand in a manner analogous to separation pins in helicases, while His556 and Ile664 interact with the last base of the template strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Several bases of the 3’ overhang of the primer strand are well resolved and bind to a hydrophobic region of Rfc1 formed by Phe552, Phe587, Phe666, and Leu670 that guides the overhang toward the central chamber of RFC. Extending away from the junction, both strands of the double-stranded region form contacts with residues on the outside of the AAA+ domain of Rfc1. The primer strand is coordinated through interactions with the backbone nitrogen of Arg477 and the side chains of Asn459, Gln474, and Arg477, while the template strand is coordinated by interactions with the backbone of Lys314 and Gly315 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The ss/dsDNA junctions in nicked DNA bind to RFC:PCNA at multiple sites</title><p>The 3’ end of the primer strand in site 3 is located immediately adjacent to the 5’ phosphate of the last resolved base at the 5’ end of the template strand in site 1. Together the DNA junctions in sites 1 and 3 thus resemble two segments of dsDNA connected by a short single-stranded segment. RFC has been demonstrated to load PCNA at DNA nicks in vitro, which is relevant for RFC-PCNA function in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bylund and Burgers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pluciennik et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that RFC can bind and load PCNA at nicked DNA by binding one of the double-stranded segments to site 1 and the second segment to site 3. We confirmed that our purified RFC could indeed load PCNA on nicked plasmid DNA using a DNA pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). To visualize PCNA loading at DNA nicks, we assembled and collected cryo-EM images of RFC:PCNA in complex with a 50 base-pair nicked dsDNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Image analysis revealed open and closed states at resolutions from 2.4 to 2.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Among these classes were open and closed states in which the nicked DNA was coordinated with one double-stranded segment in the central chamber at site 1 and the second double-stranded segment between the AAA+ and collar domains at site 3 connected by a single-stranded region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). These double-stranded segments are coordinated by Rfc1 in an identical fashion to how it coordinates 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions in sites 1 and 3 with Trp582 and Gln636 binding to the last paired bases of the double-stranded region of the nicked DNA that occupies site 1 and Phe552, His556, and Ile664 binding the last bases of the double-stranded region of the nicked DNA that occupies site 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Moreover, both double-stranded regions of nicked DNA are melted and the 3’ and 5’ overhangs bind to the same residues of RFC as do the 3’ and 5’ overhangs of the 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions that bind to RFC at sites 1 and 3, respectively. The 5-base single-stranded segment of the nicked DNA connecting the two double-stranded regions is coordinated by interactions with Phe552, Phe587, Arg632, Phe666, Trp669, and Leu670. Thus, RFC employs the same mechanism to load PCNA onto nicked DNA and 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The Rfc1 NTD facilitates PCNA loading at replication forks</title><p>Adjacent to the double-stranded portion of DNA in site 3, we observed additional protein densities in a subset of the particles with the second substrate into which we built the NTD of Rfc1, which is absent or poorly resolved in the maps determined with the first and third substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thr166, Gly167, Arg174, and Lys 209, which are all universally conserved among Rfc1 orthologs, form a binding site for the 5’ phosphate of the last modelled base. The phosphate-binding site, which was initially predicted based on comparison of a solution structure of a fragment of the NTD of human Rfc1, is remarkably similar to the structure of the phospho-peptide-binding site of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clapperton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Extending away from the 3’ ss/dsDNA junction, both strands of the double-stranded section of the DNA in site 3 bind to the Rfc1 NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Like RFC-WT, the ATPase activity of RFC-1ΔN is maximally stimulated in the presence of both DNA and PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), indicating that the catalytic activity of RFC-1ΔN is not grossly affected by the absence of the NTD. To directly observe PCNA loading onto DNA, we monitored the association of PCNA with nicked circular plasmid DNA immobilized via biotin-linkage on paramagnetic streptavidin beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). In this assay, the association of PCNA with DNA is dependent on both ATP and RFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), demonstrating that it is due to bona fide PCNA loading onto DNA. Importantly, under these conditions, RFC-1ΔN did not exhibit a noticeable PCNA loading defect, indicating that the Rfc1 NTD is not essential for PCNA loading at DNA nicks, as has also been noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pluciennik et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, RFC-1ΔN appeared to be slightly more active for PCNA loading in this assay than RFC-WT. However, as noted before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomes et al., 1997</xref>), full-length RFC has a greater propensity to form aggregates compared to RFC variants lacking the Rfc1 NTD and we, therefore, attribute the reduced PCNA loading activity of full-length RFC in this assay to its potentially enhanced aggregation on the DNA beads. Alternatively, the reduced PCNA loading activity of full-length RFC relative to RFC-1ΔN observed in this assay may be due to the previously noted non-specific dsDNA-binding activity of full-length RFC, which may limit RFC turnover at 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uhlmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Podust et al., 1998b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The Rfc1 N-terminal domain is required for efficient proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) loading.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE analysis of purified RFC-WT and RFC-1ΔN.

In these conditions, RFC-WT consistently exhibited a greater ATPase activity over the range of DNA concentrations tested than RFC-1ΔN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This data suggests that the Rfc1 NTD indeed promotes PCNA loading at 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions.</p><p>We reasoned that a defect in PCNA loading in the absence of the Rfc1 NTD may cause defects in lagging strand synthesis at replication forks as primer extension during Okazaki fragment synthesis is mediated by Pol δ, which is strictly dependent on PCNA for processive DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kunkel and Burgers, 2017</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA replication reactions on ARS-containing circular plasmid DNA templates in vitro in the absence of RFC or in the presence of varying concentrations of RFC-WT or RFC-1ΔN using the reconstituted budding yeast DNA replication system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devbhandari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Devbhandari and Remus, 2020</xref>). To differentiate leading and lagging strand products, reactions were carried out in the absence of Cdc9 (DNA ligase 1) and Fen1, which prevents nascent strand ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). As we have shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devbhandari et al., 2017</xref>), in the absence of RFC, Okazaki fragments are synthesized by Pol α or Pol α and Pol ε, resulting in a globally reduced Okazaki fragment length. As expected, addition of RFC-WT at a concentration as low as 10 nM resulted in a marked increase in Okazaki fragment length, consistent with Pol δ carrying out the bulk of primer extension on the lagging strand. In contrast, full Okazaki fragment extension required four to eight times higher concentrations of RFC-1ΔN, indicating impaired Pol δ activity due to a PCNA loading defect in the absence of the Rfc1 NTD. Moreover, we note that leading strands, which normally terminate at the point of fork convergence at the plasmid pole opposite the replication origin, on average reached greater than half-unit lengths in the absence of RFC or at low concentrations of RFC-1ΔN. Since leading strand synthesis terminates at the 5’ end of the lagging strand of an opposing fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dewar and Walter, 2017</xref>), this effect could further indicate a defect in lagging strand synthesis in the absence of full RFC activity, allowing leading strands to be synthesized significantly beyond the point of sister replisome convergence. Alternatively, since PCNA is known to stabilize Pol ε on the leading strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yeeles et al., 2017</xref>), the stochastic stalling or slowing of one of the two forks emanating from the replication origin may shift the site of termination beyond the midpoint between the two opposing forks. Irrespective, the data is consistent with the Rfc1 NTD promoting PCNA loading at replication forks.</p><p>Since the strand-displacement activity of Pol δ, which is absent in Pol α and Pol ε, is essential for Okazaki fragment ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devbhandari et al., 2017</xref>), defects in PCNA-dependent Pol δ activity are expected to result in a corresponding defect in Okazaki fragment ligation. To test this prediction, we carried out in vitro replication reactions in the presence of Cdc9 and Fen1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>). In the absence of RFC, nascent strand ligation is severely compromised, as evidenced by the absence of covalently closed plasmid daughters, which can be detected as plasmid supercoils by native agarose gel analysis in the presence of ethidium-bromide (EtBr), and the presence of largely unligated nascent strands in the denaturing gel analysis. In contrast, as little as 5 nM RFC-WT results in the formation of a significant fraction of covalently closed plasmid daughters and the generation of full-length or near full-length nascent strands in the denaturing gel analysis, indicative of efficient nascent strand ligation. Conversely, native gel analysis of the replication products obtained after addition of 5–40 nM RFC-1ΔN results in a greatly reduced formation of covalently closed plasmid daughters and a concomitant increase in nicked or gapped plasmid daughters, while a prominent smear of partially ligated nascent strands is evident across the same range of RFC-1ΔN concentrations by denaturing gel analysis. In summary, we conclude that the Rfc1 NTD mediates efficient PCNA loading at replication forks, which is required for normal Okazaki fragment synthesis and ligation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In previous structural studies, the RFC:PCNA complex was captured in an autoinhibited state off DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaubitz et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the flexible NTD of Rfc1 was deleted in those studies to improve protein yield and solubility, precluding its structural and functional characterization. Therefore, to advance our insight into the PCNA loading process, we have reconstituted RFC:PCNA:DNA complexes bound to ATPγS with full-length proteins and analyzed their structure using cryo-EM, which allowed us to capture RFC:PCNA in an active state. We observe that PCNA can adopt both open and closed conformations in the presence of RFC, DNA, and ATPγS. The open state is consistent with previous biochemical studies demonstrating that ATP binding, but not ATP hydrolysis, is required for PCNA opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhuang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gomes and Burgers, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hingorani and Coman, 2002</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, the PCNA ring opens in a largely planar fashion, generating a gap of ~22 Å that aligns with the gap in RFC between the AAA+ and A’ domains of Rfc1 and is wide enough for the passage of dsDNA. The wide opening of PCNA during loading is similar to that which we observed for the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp by Rad24-RFC and also consistent with MD simulations and biochemical FRET studies suggesting that PCNA opens an ~30 Å gap during loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhuang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tainer et al., 2010</xref>). However, the wide opening of PCNA refutes a previous model implicating the adoption of a right-handed spiral conformation with a &lt;10 Å gap by PCNA that was inspired by the spiral configuration of the RFC AAA+ domains observed in the crystal structure of autoinhibited RFC bound to PCNA and supported by MD simulations on the isolated PCNA clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kazmirski et al., 2005</xref>). A spiral configuration for PCNA may be more prevalent in the absence of DNA, as our data suggests that the planar RFC-PCNA conformation is stabilized by DNA, which we discuss below. In any case, the open PCNA state observed here is compatible with the direct loading of PCNA around dsDNA and obviates the need to invoke ssDNA threading for RFC:PCNA positioning at 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions, which agrees with the ability of RFC to load PCNA at DNA structures lacking extensive stretches of ssDNA, such as DNA nicks.</p><p>Closure of the PCNA ring occurs through a two-step process involving release of one protomer from Rfc5 and the concerted inward movement of a second protomer together with Rfc1. Notably, ATPγS remains actively coordinated in all four RFC catalytic sites in the closed PCNA state, demonstrating that PCNA closure is not mechanistically coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Instead, the open and closed states of PCNA appear to exist in a dynamic equilibrium that is driven by the binding energies of RFC-PCNA contacts. As kinetic studies have suggested that ATP hydrolysis precedes PCNA closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakato et al., 2012b</xref>), it is, therefore, possible that ATP hydrolysis will drive PCNA ring closure by disrupting the wide-planar conformation of RFC. In addition, analogously to Rad24-RFC, we anticipate that ATP hydrolysis will induce PCNA release via an out-of-plane motion of Rfc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>). However, due to potential differences in the conformational landscape of RFC-PCNA in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATPγS and that of RFC-PCNA in the presence of hydrolyzable ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhuang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiraniya et al., 2013</xref>), future studies will be necessary to understand the precise role of ATP hydrolysis by RFC and how hydrolysis is coupled to conformational change and PCNA release.</p><p>Our observation that Rfc5 in both RFC and Rad24-RFC binds GDP instead of ADP was highly unexpected, as AAA+ proteins generally utilize ATP and ATP is sufficient to fuel clamp loading by both RFC and Rad24-RFC. Moreover, as no guanine nucleotides were added during either purification, the GDP is likely to have been co-purified with Rfc5 and thus be a very high affinity ligand. To date, only one other AAA+ protein, the McrB motor subunit of the <italic>E. coli</italic> McrBC restriction endonuclease complex, is known to utilize GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Niu et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of Rfc5, future studies will be necessary to determine if Rfc5 is a functional GTPase or if GDP instead serves a structural role.</p><p>The Rfc2-5 core can associate with four distinct large subunits, respectively, to form RFC (RFC), which contains Rfc1, or three RFC-like complexes, Ctf18-RFC, Rad24-RFC, and Elg1-RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee and Park, 2020</xref>). Each clamp loader complex performs specific functions in the cell that are associated with a distinct DNA substrate specificity. For example, RFC loads PCNA specifically at 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions and DNA nicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bylund and Burgers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ellison and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayner et al., 2014</xref>), Ctf18-RFC loads PCNA at 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions but not at DNA nicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bylund and Burgers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermudez et al., 2003</xref>), Rad24-RFC loads the 9-1-1 clamp at 5’ ss/dsDNA junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ellison and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Majka et al., 2006</xref>), and Elg1-RFC appears to unload PCNA from dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kubota et al., 2015</xref>). It is, therefore, likely that the DNA substrate specificity of clamp loaders is determined by DNA-protein contacts involving the large subunit. Consistent with this notion, we have recently found that the 5’ ss/dsDNA junction is exclusively coordinated by Rad24 in Rad24-RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, we find here that 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions are exclusively coordinated by Rfc1 in RFC. However, unlike in Rad24-RFC:9-1-1, where the DNA binds to a single site, we observe that DNA binds to three distinct sites in RFC:PCNA. In each case, the 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions are positioned at distinct sites along a hydrophobic ridge on the surface of the Rfc1 collar domain. Intriguingly, several base pairs of the 3’ ss/dsDNA junction are melted at each of these sites, utilizing distinct separation pin residues. While DNA junction unwinding by RFC was recently reported at site 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaubitz et al., 2022</xref>), it was not observed in the Rad24-RFC:9-1-1:DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>) and thus may be unique feature of RFC. Because melting is independent of ATP hydrolysis, it does not involve a helicase mechanism. Instead, it appears to be promoted by hydrophobic-binding forces between DNA bases and hydrophobic side chains on the surface of RFC. As described below, our data suggests that junction unwinding drives the insertion of the DNA duplex into the central RFC channel at an intermediate step. In this regard, junction unwinding may aid RFC:PCNA binding particularly at DNA nicks or short gaps by extending the ssDNA stretch in the template strand. Notably, Phe582 and Trp638, which promote base flipping at site 1, are not essential for growth in yeast and thus future studies will be required to understand the precise role of DNA base flipping and unwinding by RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaubitz et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>DNA site 1 is located in the center of the clamp loader, analogous to the binding sites resolved in the structures of the bacteriophage T4 and <italic>E. coli</italic> clamp loaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Simonetta et al., 2009</xref>). In this site, the phosphate backbone of the DNA duplex template strand forms interactions with conserved residues on all five clamp loader subunits, including those in the Rfc2-5 core that coordinate the ssDNA in Rad24-RFC, explaining how the Rfc2-5 core can be adapted to bind either ssDNA or dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, we find that RFC can bind dsDNA in its central channel because Rfc1 lacks the loop that protrudes from the AAA+ domain of Rad24 that occludes dsDNA from binding in the central channel of Rad24-RFC. In agreement with the notion that the PCNA clamp exists in a dynamic equilibrium between open and closed states prior to ATP hydrolysis, we observe both states when DNA is present in the central channel. DNA binding at site 1 thus represents the final stage of the DNA loading reaction.</p><p>The second site is located between the AAA+, collar, and A’ domains of Rfc1. When bound to this site, the double-stranded portion of the DNA extends between the AAA+ and A’ domains of Rfc1 toward the opening in PCNA and thus can only be occupied in the open state. DNA site 2, therefore, corresponds to the DNA-binding site at an intermediate state that precedes occupation of DNA site 1. Interestingly, the gap between the Rfc1 AAA+ and collar domains is not wide enough to accommodate normal B-form DNA, causing a significant distortion in the DNA duplex as it transits into the central RFC channel. The energetic penalty associated with the dsDNA distortion indicates that the gap between the AAA+, collar, and A’ domains of Rfc1 acts as a gate. Rotation of the DNA induced by the unwinding of the 3’ ss/dsDNA junction at the base of the gate may help push the DNA through the constriction of the gate, aided by the conformational flexibility of the open interface between the AAA+, collar, and A’ domains.</p><p>The third binding site is similar to the DNA junction-binding site resolved in Rad24-RFC:9-1-1:DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>), located between the AAA+ and collar domains of Rfc1 and with the double-stranded region of the DNA extending away from the clamp loader. Also contributing to the third binding site is the BRCT domain of Rfc1, which contacts the phosphate backbone of the double-stranded DNA. Previous studies have demonstrated that the BRCT domain of RFC1 forms an autonomous dsDNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burbelo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fotedar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kobayashi et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen, 1997</xref>). The BRCT domain is anchored on the side of the Rfc1 AAA+ domain via a long linker helix and bridging DNA contacts. The BRCT domain and linker helix appear to form a rigid unit that is flexibly tethered to the AAA+ domain via a short linker. The flexible association of the BRCT domain promotes its ability to explore the 3D space around RFC for DNA targets, thus promoting the recruitment of RFC to the DNA substrate. Accordingly, while not being essential for RFC:PCNA binding to DNA at non-limiting concentrations of RFC or DNA substrate, the Rfc1 NTD is expected to increase the efficiency of RFC:PCNA:DNA complex formation. Consistent with this notion, we observe that the Rfc1 NTD promotes Okazaki fragment synthesis at replication forks, which likely requires rapid turnover of RFC. In addition, we note that simultaneous coordination of the DNA substrate at multiple DNA-binding sites distributed across the BRCT, AAA+, and collar domains of Rfc1 may help restrain the conformational flexibility of Rfc1 and thus promote the active and planar conformation of RFC-PCNA, which in turn may underlie the observation that both DNA and PCNA stimulate ATP binding to RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomes et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakato et al., 2012b</xref>). DNA site 3 thus appears to be involved in the early stages of RFC:PCNA:DNA complex formation.</p><p>Among several weak BRCT-DNA contacts, which may aid a role for the BRCT domain in DNA scanning and handover to DNA site 2, we also observe discrete hydrogen bonds between a highly conserved TG motif of the BRCT domain and a backbone phosphate in the template strand near the 3’ ss/dsDNA junction. This interaction may be responsible for the increased affinity of the Rfc1 BRCT domain for 5’-phosphorylated dsDNA fragments noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kobayashi et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen, 1997</xref>) and may help position and stabilize RFC at the junction. Notably, the interaction of the TG motif with the DNA phosphate backbone appears to be conserved in the homologous PARP1 BRCT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rudolph et al., 2021</xref>). As has been noted previously, residues corresponding to the Rfc1 TG motif in tandem BRCT domains mediate the interaction with the phosphate moiety of phospho-peptides, indicating that the phospho-peptide-binding activity of tandem BRCT domains has evolved from the ancestral DNA-binding activity of single BRCT domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kobayashi et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kobayashi et al., 1997b</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest the following model for PCNA loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): RFC-PCNA initially adopts an autoinhibited and partially engaged conformation that searches for a DNA substrate using the flexible NTD of Rfc1 to probe the surrounding space. Binding of DNA to the BRCT domain then promotes occupation of DNA site 3 and induction of an active planar RFC:PCNA conformation. While PCNA can adopt an open configuration when bound to RFC in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaubitz et al., 2022</xref>), adopting the active planar conformation shifts the equilibrium between the closed to open states of PCNA toward the open state. Driven by binding energy, the DNA substrate is released from DNA site 3 and subsequently transfers to DNA site 2 to initiate insertion into the central RFC:PCNA channel. By sliding and rotating over the hydrophobic surface of the Rfc1 collar domain, the DNA shifts into position at DNA site 1. DNA binding to site 1 then promotes ATP hydrolysis by RFC, which promotes PCNA closure by disrupting the planar RFC:PCNA interaction surface and consequently the dynamic interaction of PCNA with Rfc2 and -5 in the open state. In addition, ATP hydrolysis is expected to eject PCNA from RFC via an out-of-plane motion of Rfc1. Finally, inactivated RFC releases from the DNA and re-enters the cycle by recruiting PCNA free in solution.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Loading for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA by replication factor C (RFC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model for PCNA loading onto 3’ single-stranded (ss)/double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) junctions.

While not being essential for RFC-DNA binding, the Rfc1 NTD promotes the initial interaction of RFC with DNA. Based on the MMS sensitivity of yeast cells lacking the Rfc1 NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomes et al., 1997</xref>), which may indicate a defect in the post-replicative processing of nicks or gaps in the DNA, we had initially hypothesized that the NTD is specifically required for PCNA loading at DNA nicks. However, we are unable to detect a defect in PCNA loading at DNA nicks in vitro in the absence of the Rfc1 NTD, which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the proficiency of RFC lacking the Rfc1 NTD in loading PCNA at DNA nicks during mismatch repair in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pluciennik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dzantiev et al., 2004</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesize that PCNA loading at DNA nicks follows the same step-wise DNA-binding mechanism as at 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions with a single-stranded 5’ overhang. However, our data do not discriminate between a transition of the 3’ double-stranded segment from site 3 to site 2 or its direct binding of the second double-stranded region in site 2, while maintaining the interaction of the 5’ segment in site 3. Through either pathway, RFC-PCNA will be bound to both the 3’ and 5’ junction of a DNA nick, as observed in our structural analysis here. Future studies will be necessary to elucidate the precise conformational transitions that nicked and gapped DNA undergo to yield the doubly bound, pre-ATP hydrolysis states that we captured.</p><p>In conclusion, our study reveals the structural basis for the loading of PCNA at 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions by RFC, providing a framework for future studies aimed at understanding the mechanism of PCNA loading and unloading by RFC-like complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>PCNA, RFC, and RPA were purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devbhandari et al., 2017</xref>).

a ring-shaped clamp protein and binds DNA to promote the deposition of the clamp around a nucleic acid duplex to support chromosomal replication. The paper is important in that it reports new findings on how different regions of the clamp loader bind to and open a clamp, and how the enzyme engages single-stranded and double-stranded regions of target DNAs. Different conformational states of the clamp loader and the clamp are observed, providing a molecular picture of several steps in the clamp loading cycle.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78253.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.09.479782">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.09.479782v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Multistep loading of PCNA onto DNA by RFC&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some of the conclusions need to toned down a bit, the conclusions regarding the requirement for ATP hydrolysis for ring closure in particular. As pointed out in the reviews, ring closure may occur slowly in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. Just because the PCNA can close on RFC with ATPgS doesn't mean that ATP hydrolysis isn't important for closure. ATP hydrolysis may well speed up clamp loading to a rate needed to keep up with the replication fork.</p><p>2) As described below, some revisions should be made to make this work a bit more accessible to a general audience.</p><p>3) To rule out the possibility that ATPgS isn not slowly hydrolyzed (or Mg++ ions are dissociating), a better figure for the ATPase sites needs to be included, showing the cryo-EM density for each catalytic center associated with each RFC conformational state.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. A central claim of the paper is that nucleotide hydrolysis is not required for clamp closure. Because ATPgS can be hydrolyzed by some proteins, active site density for nucleotide status of *each* RFC subunit needs to be shown for the closed, intermediate and open forms, along with modeling of the nucleotide and Mg++.</p><p>2. Even if it turns out that unhydrolyzed nucleotide is indeed present in all active sites throughout all stages, this does not necessarily prove that ATP hydrolysis does not lead to clamp closure under normal operating conditions; e.g., the kinetics of clamp closure may be much faster when hydrolysis can occur. Regardless of the outcome of point 1, the language around this conclusion should be tempered accordingly.</p><p>3. The first two sections and first two figures of the Results section describe the RFC-PCNA complex as if DNA isn't present, leading one to think that these perhaps correspond to views of PCNA engagement and opening by RFC prior to DNA binding. However, DNA *is* present and bound to the complex. As a consequence, the implications of the structures as described in the text feel misleading – they really correspond to pre- and post-DNA encirclement states, and as such, they fit into the final model very differently. This distinction needs to be better described and qualified in the text.</p><p>4. Lines 170-172. By what evidence are the prior yeast and human RFC-PCNA states really 'inactive', as opposed to corresponding to some kind of pre-clamp opening state? Also, a figure should be included showing how planarity of the RFC ring here differs from one of these states.</p><p>5. P. 16. There is a disconnect between the higher PCNA loading activity of RFC-∆N on DNA (as compared to WT RFC) and the higher ATPase activity of WT RFC compared to RFC-∆N. Although this dichotomy is explained away as being due to aggregation of WT RFC on DNA beads, the explanation doesn't fully hold up. The 'dilute' concentrations used for the ATPase assay are the same as those used at the high of the RFC titration in the loading experiments, so why should aggregation be any different? And if aggregation is a problem with the bead assay, then why doesn't it seem to be an issue with the replication assays, where the concentrations of RFC are higher?</p><p>6. Figure 6. The mechanistic model implies that the BRCT domain binds DNA on its own, prior to engaging the rest of RFC. This should be tested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are a few points that need some clarification:</p><p>1) This study reports the first structure of RFC with full-length Rfc1.

As pointed out in the reviews, ring closure may occur slowly in the absence of ATP hydrolysis.

ATP hydrolysis may well speed up clamp loading to a rate needed to keep up with the replication fork.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 6 and added some discussion describing the potential role of ATP hydrolysis in ring closure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As described below, some revisions should be made to make this work a bit more accessible to a general audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Figures and text as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To rule out the possibility that ATPgS isn not slowly hydrolyzed (or Mg++ ions are dissociating), a better figure for the ATPase sites needs to be included, showing the cryo-EM density for each catalytic center associated with each RFC conformational state.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the suggestion as it helped to uncover the unique nucleotide specificity of Rfc5. We have added a Figure Supplement showing the density for the bound nucleotides in all states. For Rfc1, Rfc4, Rfc3 and Rfc2, the densities in the high-resolution (&gt;2.4 Å) open and closed states are unambiguously ATPgS. Because the P-S bond is longer than the P-O bond, we can distinguish the two oxygen atoms from the one sulfur atom bound to the γ phosphate. For the Rfc5 subunit, which we had initially modelled as an ADP, we noticed that the density corresponding to nucleotide did not completely agree in high-resolution maps, suggesting that the ligand may have been incorrectly assigned. By comparing the density with other potential nucleotides, we now model the nucleotide as a GDP rather than an ADP. The guanine base is coordinated by the side chain of Rfc5-Arg52, which would be unable to make similarly favorable interactions with an adenine base. As no guanine nucleotides were added to the sample, the GDP is likely to have been co-purified from the yeast. We therefore reasoned that GDP would likely also be present in the Rfc5 subunit of the Rad24-RFC complexes that we recently published (Castaneda et al., 2022). We reprocessed the images and obtained a 2.1 Å reconstruction of Rad24-RFC in complex with 9-1-1. In the improved Rad24-RFC-9-1-1 open state map, we can now unambiguously resolve the ATPgS bound to Rad24, Rfc4, Rfc3 and Rfc2 and GDP bound to Rfc5. On the basis of these structures, we now propose that Rfc5 binds GDP and have revised the text to note the unique nucleotide specificity of Rfc5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. A central claim of the paper is that nucleotide hydrolysis is not required for clamp closure. Because ATPgS can be hydrolyzed by some proteins, active site density for nucleotide status of *each* RFC subunit needs to be shown for the closed, intermediate and open forms, along with modeling of the nucleotide and Mg++.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and greatly appreciate their suggestion. We have added Figure 2—figure supplement 2. showing the density for the bound nucleotides in all states. For Rfc1, Rfc4, Rfc3 and Rfc2, the densities in the high-resolution (&gt;2.4 Å) open and closed states are unambiguously ATPgS.

Even if it turns out that unhydrolyzed nucleotide is indeed present in all active sites throughout all stages, this does not necessarily prove that ATP hydrolysis does not lead to clamp closure under normal operating conditions; e.g., the kinetics of clamp closure may be much faster when hydrolysis can occur. Regardless of the outcome of point 1, the language around this conclusion should be tempered accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and raise this possibility in the discussion (lines 478 – 486) along with relevant references. We have revised Figure 6 to highlight the possible role of ATP hydrolysis in clamp closure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The first two sections and first two figures of the Results section describe the RFC-PCNA complex as if DNA isn't present, leading one to think that these perhaps correspond to views of PCNA engagement and opening by RFC prior to DNA binding. However, DNA *is* present and bound to the complex. As a consequence, the implications of the structures as described in the text feel misleading – they really correspond to pre- and post-DNA encirclement states, and as such, they fit into the final model very differently. This distinction needs to be better described and qualified in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the correspondence between PCNA conformation and DNA state was not clear in the initial submission. As the reviewer states, the open conformation of the complex in the presence of DNA1 presented in Figures 1 and 2 corresponds to a pre-DNA encirclement state. However, we do resolve structures in the presence of DNA2 or nicked DNA in which the DNA is located in site 1 (central chamber), yet the PCNA ring remains open (Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 6). In addition, recent work from Brian Kelch’s group (as mentioned by Reviewer 2 below) showed that ring can adopt an ensemble of open and closed configurations in the absence of DNA (Gaubitz et al., 2022b). Taken together, these data indicate that PCNA can adopt an ensemble of conformations when bound to RFC.</p><p>To clarify that the complexes presented in Figures 1 and 2 were determined in the presence of DNA, we have added the DNA to Figure 1C-E and noted in the figure legend for Figure 2 that DNA is removed for clarity. We have also clarified the text on lines 582-584 to note that PCNA can adopt an ensemble of conformations, including the open, intermediate, and closed states when bound to RFC in the presence of ATPgS and that while DNA substrates binding at sites 1, 2 or 3 may alter the equilibrium between these states, it is not required for PCNA opening.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Lines 170-172. By what evidence are the prior yeast and human RFC-PCNA states really 'inactive', as opposed to corresponding to some kind of pre-clamp opening state? Also, a figure should be included showing how planarity of the RFC ring here differs from one of these states.</p></disp-quote><p>The ’inactive’ state, which has also been referred to as ‘autoinhibited’ in the literature (Gaubitz et al., 2020), refers to the catalytically incompetent active site conformations observed in previous structures of yeast and human RFC:PCNA complexes off DNA. We agree with the reviewer that this state may very well be on the pathway to clamp loading, preceding clamp opening. We now clarify this point in the introduction (lines 78-80) where we first introduce this state and use the term autoinhibited in the text in figures for consistency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. P. 16. There is a disconnect between the higher PCNA loading activity of RFC-∆N on DNA (as compared to WT RFC) and the higher ATPase activity of WT RFC compared to RFC-∆N. Although this dichotomy is explained away as being due to aggregation of WT RFC on DNA beads, the explanation doesn't fully hold up. The 'dilute' concentrations used for the ATPase assay are the same as those used at the high of the RFC titration in the loading experiments, so why should aggregation be any different? And if aggregation is a problem with the bead assay, then why doesn't it seem to be an issue with the replication assays, where the concentrations of RFC are higher?</p></disp-quote><p>The PCNA loading assay utilizes DNA immobilized on paramagnetic beads, whereas ATPase and replication assays utilize DNA free in solution. We have noticed that RFC has a tendency to stick non-specifically to the beads, which we hypothesize may explain the disconnect between the PCNA loading and ATPase data for full-length RFC.</p><p>Moreover, in preliminary ATPase assays, we noticed that the degree of stimulation of RFC activity by both PCNA and DNA is inversely correlated with RFC concentration. Based on the fact that previous studies had noted stability issues of RFC (e.g. on page 17 we reference a study by the Burgers laboratory [Gomes et al., JBC, 2000] to highlight this fact), we reasoned that this observation may be due to the potential aggregation of RFC at higher concentrations. Consistent with this notion, we observe a reduction in replication activity at increased RFC concentration (e.g. compare lanes 4 + 5 in Figures 5 C+E).</p><p>Alternatively, the reduced PCNA loading activity of full-length RFC relative to RFC-1DN may be due to the increased non-specific DNA binding activity of full-length RFC, as has been suggested before. We now include the following statement in the Results section (page 17, lines 394-397) to acknowledge this possibility: “Alternatively, the reduced PCNA loading activity of full-length RFC relative to RFC-1DN observed in this assay may be due to the previously noted non-specific dsDNA binding activity of full-length RFC, which may limit RFC turnover at 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions (Gomes et al., 2000; Podust et al., 1998; Uhlmann et al., 1997)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 6. The mechanistic model implies that the BRCT domain binds DNA on its own, prior to engaging the rest of RFC. This should be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies with the isolated RFC1 BRCT domain of various organisms have demonstrated that this domain binds DNA on its own, supporting our model. To highlight this fact, we now include the following statement in the Discussion (page 22, line 507): “Previous studies have demonstrated that the BRCT domain of RFC1 forms an autonomous dsDNA binding domain (Allen et al., 1998; Burbelo et al., 1993; Fotedar et al., 1996; Kobayashi et al., 2006).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are a few points that need some clarification:</p><p>1) This study reports the first structure of RFC with full-length Rfc1.
