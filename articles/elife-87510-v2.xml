However, the mechanisms through which metastatic genes regulate lipid metabolism remain unclear. Here, we describe a new oncogenic–metabolic feedback loop between the epithelial–mesenchymal transition transcription factor ZEB2 and the key lipid enzyme ACSL4 (long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4), resulting in enhanced cellular lipid storage and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to drive breast cancer metastasis. Functionally, depletion of ZEB2 or ACSL4 significantly reduced lipid droplets (LDs) abundance and cell migration. ACSL4 overexpression rescued the invasive capabilities of the ZEB2 knockdown cells, suggesting that ACSL4 is crucial for ZEB2-mediated metastasis. Mechanistically, ZEB2-activated ACSL4 expression by directly binding to the ACSL4 promoter. ACSL4 binds to and stabilizes ZEB2 by reducing ZEB2 ubiquitination. Notably, ACSL4 not only promotes the intracellular lipogenesis and LDs accumulation but also enhances FAO and adenosine triphosphate production by upregulating the FAO rate-limiting enzyme CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 isoform A). Finally, we demonstrated that ACSL4 knockdown significantly reduced metastatic lung nodes in vivo. In conclusion, we reveal a novel positive regulatory loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4, which promotes LDs storage to meet the energy needs of breast cancer metastasis, and identify the ZEB2–ACSL4 signaling axis as an attractive therapeutic target for overcoming breast cancer metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ACSL4</kwd><kwd>lipid metabolism</kwd><kwd>lipid droplets</kwd><kwd>cancer metastasis</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>ZEB2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010256</institution-id><institution>Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202201020240</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Na</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003785</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A2021112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Na</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81602434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Na</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Agreement between South China University of Technology and Guangzhou First People's Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D9194290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Yuyou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81972594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010256</institution-id><institution>Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023A04J0632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ZEB2/ACSL4 axis acts as a novel metastatic metabolic pathway that stimulates both lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, resulting in enhanced breast cancer invasion and metastasis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>More than 90% of breast cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fahad Ullah, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2022</xref>). Current treatments, including endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, are ineffective in preventing breast cancer metastasis and remain the greatest clinical challenge for breast cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barzaman et al., 2020</xref>). Cancer metastasis is associated with a process called epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mittal, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lüönd et al., 2021</xref>). EMT is a pre-metastatic state in which epithelial cells lose their tight junctions and convert to migratory mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dongre and Weinberg, 2019</xref>). Metastatic invasion is a highly energy-intensive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mosier et al., 2021</xref>). It has become increasingly recognized that metabolic reprogramming during the EMT process contributes to metastasis and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sciacovelli and Frezza, 2017</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that lipid metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in meeting the energy requirements of metastatic invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Snaebjornsson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). Elucidating the mechanism by which reprogrammed lipid metabolism helps us exploit novel and attractive targets for metastatic therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Lipid metabolism includes a complex network of pathways that regulate fatty acids (FAs) synthesis, storage, and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maan et al., 2018</xref>). For lipid anabolism, FAs are stored in a dynamic organelle called a lipid droplet (LD), which is composed of a monolayer of phospholipids that covers a hydrophobic core containing neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesterol esterase (CE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruz et al., 2020</xref>). lipid droplets (LDs) accumulation is associated with aggressiveness in many cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antunes et al., 2022</xref>), including breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zembroski et al., 2021</xref>), brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taïb et al., 2019</xref>), liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Niu et al., 2021</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jin and Yuan, 2020</xref>), and prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the aggregation of FAs in LDs is considered a priming state to prepare for metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rozeveld et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Senga et al., 2018</xref>). In the case of need, FAs can be released and oxidized for energy support. For example, it has been reported that FAs stored in LDs were a crucial resource in fueling the metastatic process in pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rozeveld et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, previous studies have suggested that metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) depends on FAO to produce high adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camarda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wright et al., 2017</xref>). Although lipid metabolism is crucial for cancer metastasis, the signaling pathway that regulates lipid metabolic reprogramming during breast cancer metastasis remains unclear.</p><p>Dysregulation of lipid metabolic enzymes has been documented in cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luo et al., 2017</xref>). Long-chain fatty acyl synthetase 4 (ACSL4) belongs to the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase ligase enzyme family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rossi Sebastiano and Konstantinidou, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quan et al., 2021</xref>). ACSL4 catalyzes the conversion of long-chain FAs to acyl-CoAs, a necessary step for free long-chain FAs to enter the next metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuwata and Hara, 2019</xref>). The increased expression and activity of ACSL4 have been observed in many cancer types and it is well-known biomarkers of ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doll et al., 2017</xref>). Although it has been reported that ACSL4 is a tumor suppressor that activates ferroptosis, many studies have suggested that ACSL4 is an oncogene that contributes to tumor progression. For example, ACSL4 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation and metastasis via lipogenesis and LDs accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Niu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). In prostate cancer, ACSL4 promotes cell growth, invasion, and hormonal resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). The function of ACSL4 in breast cancer has been implicated in hormone therapy resistance involving the regulation of energy-dependent transporter expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Orlando et al., 2019</xref>). However, regulation of lipid metabolism by ACSL4 during breast cancer invasion remains unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrate a novel positive feedback loop between the EMT transcription factor ZEB2 and the essential lipid metabolic enzyme ACSL4, resulting in enhanced cellular LDs accumulation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to drive breast cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, ZEB2 activates ACSL4 expression by directly binding to the ACSL4 promoter. ACSL4 stabilizes and upregulates ZEB2 via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In addition, we also provide evidence that overexpression of ZEB2 or ACSL4 is associated with worse prognosis in advanced breast cancer. Our findings provide insights into lipid metabolic mechanisms during the EMT process and reveal a novel oncogenic–metabolic pathway critical for breast cancer EMT and metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZEB2 and ACSL4 are overexpressed and correlated in highly invasive breast cancer cells</title><p>To explore the molecular mechanism of highly invasive breast cancer, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis of wild-type and two drug-resistant luminal breast cancer cell lines. Significant changes in 6155 genes were found (p &lt; 0.05). Notably, EMT and stemness genes such as ZEB2, SNAIL, TWIST, Gli2, WNT, and AKT3, which are overexpressed in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), were significantly upregulated in drug-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, differentiated genes such as FOXA1, ERα, E-cadherin, and GATA3, which are highly expressed in the luminal subtype, were significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that drug-resistant cells underwent EMT and became stem-like cells. We noticed that the rate-limiting enzymes of FA metabolism, long-chain fatty acyl synthetase 4 (ACSL4), and EMT transcription factor ZEB2 were among the top 200 upregulated (&gt;twofold) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To verify these findings in the clinical sample, we analyzed ZEB2 and ACSL4 expression in TCGA database and found that ACSL4 expression was positively correlated with ZEB2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>r</italic> = 0.7657, p &lt; 0.001) and inversely correlated with ERα expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>r</italic> = −0.3312, p &lt; 0.001). by using the TCGA database, we compared the overall survival between ACSL4 or ZEB2 high- and low-expression breast cancer patients. We found that patients with higher ACSL4 or ZEB2 expression, especially those with simultaneous high expression had worse prognosis than those with lower expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The expression and relationship of ZEB2 and ACSL4 in breast cancer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmaps of the 38 upregulated epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes detected by RNA-seq analysis in the paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 cell line (TAXOL) and epirubicin-resistant MCF-7 cell line (EPI) compared to wild-type MCF-7 cell line.

Untargeted lipidomic analyses revealed that ACSL4 knockdown breast cancer cells had a reduced ability to incorporate long-strain monounsaturated (18:1, 17:1, 22:1, 24:1, and 26:1) and saturated FAs (16:0, 18:0, 24:0, and 26:0) into TG and phospholipids, indicating that ACSL4 promotes the incorporation of long-chain monounsaturated and saturated FAs into TG and phospholipids in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). Moreover, all these lipids, including TG, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters, had decreased incorporation of several polyunsaturated FAs, such as 22:6, 20:4, 22:4, and 22:5, in ACSL4-depleted cells as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doll et al., 2017</xref>).

ZEB2 overexpression significantly enhanced the luciferase activity of all five E-box-containing segments of the ACSL4 promoter, whereas no significant change was observed in the control segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To examine whether ZEB2 directly binds to the ACSL4 promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using four sets of primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Primer set 1, which covered segment 1, consistently exhibited apparent ZEB2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G</xref>). However, no binding was detectable using the other three sets of primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), indicating that ZEB2 binds to the E-box located at nucleotides −184 to −295 of the ACSL4 promoter.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>ZEB2 activates ACSL4 expression by directly binding to its promoter.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative mRNA levels of ZEB2 and ACSL4 in control or ZEB2 knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells.

We then performed quantitative PCR and immunoblotting and observed that both ZEB2 mRNA and protein levels were reduced after the depletion of ACSL4 in the two BCSC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). A previous study has reported that ACSL4 regulates c-Myc protein stability in HCC. Our RNA-seq data revealed that some ubiquitin E3 ligases were significantly reduced in ACSL4 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We reasoned that ACSL4 might regulate the stability and ubiquitin of ZEB2. Therefore, we performed a ubiquitination assay to investigate whether ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 protein stability via ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin and myc-ZEB2 expression vectors along with either an empty vector or an ACSL4 overexpression vector. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, the expression of ACSL4 caused a significant decrease in the ubiquitination of ZEB2. Conversely, we observed a increasing ubiquitination of ZEB2 in ACSL4 silencing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting that ACSL4 attenuated the ubiquitin proteolysis of ZEB2. Notably, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays and GST pull down assays revealed a specific interaction between ACSL4 and ZEB2 proteins, supporting the notion that ZEB2 and ACSL4 are present in a protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Immunofluorescence assay revealed that ACSL4 and ZEB2 were co-localized in some certain regions of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). To further confirm the role of ACSL4 in the regulation of ZEB2 proteolysis, cycloheximide was added to the cell medium to block the synthesis of new proteins. Interestingly, endogenous ZEB2 protein levels were almost completely suppressed in ACSL4 knockdown cells from 0 to 8 hr time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G, H</xref>). This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that ZEB2 mRNA levels were significantly suppressed by the ACSL4 knockdown. Conversely, ZEB2 protein maintained a relatively steady level at 6 hr in ACSL4 overexpressing cells compared with control cells that undergone obvious ZEB2 proteolysis at 4 hr after adding CHX, indicating an increased ZEB2 protein stability in ACSL4 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I, J</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that ACSL4 not only stabilizes the ZEB2 protein by attenuating its ubiquitination but also upregulates ZEB2 mRNA expression. Therefore, ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 mRNA expression and protein stability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative mRNA levels of ZEB2 and ACSL4 in control or ACSL4 silencing MDA-MB-231 cells.

Taken together, these data suggest that ACSL4 promotes the lung metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The rewiring of metabolic pathways during EMT has only recently been recognized. In addition to glycolysis, dysregulated lipid metabolism has been shown to contribute to cancer invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soukupova et al., 2021</xref>). Many EMT-driving factors have been found to reprogram the lipid metabolic pathways by regulating metabolic enzymes. For example, Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (TGF-β), a major driver of EMT, activates fatty acid synthase (FASN) and forms a FASN–TGFβ1–FASN-positive loop in cisplatin-resistant cells, resulting in EMT induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hua et al., 2020</xref>). However, the direct regulation of lipid enzymes by EMT factors remains to be elucidated. Herein, we demonstrated that the lipid rating enzyme ACSL4 is a direct downstream target of the EMT transcription factor ZEB2 in controlling lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, ZEB2 activates ACSL4 mRNA expression by directly binding to its promoter, which contains four ZEB2 consensus sequences. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation between ZEB2 and ACSL4 expression levels in clinical breast cancer samples. ACSL4 re-expression rescues the migration ability of ZEB2-depleted cells. These observations indicated that ACSL4 is crucial for ZEB2-mediated metastasis.</p><p>We also demonstrated that ACSL4 directly binds to and stabilizes ZEB2 by reducing its ubiquitination. Our results are consistent with a recent report that ACSL4 stabilizes the oncoprotein c-Myc via the ubiquitin–proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). We propose that as an LDs enzyme, ACSL4 may participate in the protein degradation system of LDs. This is likely to be a novel function of ACSL4. Interestingly, a recent study reported that LDs recruit Numb through the AP2A/ACSL3 complex to promote Numb degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, it is likely that LDs act as a platform for protein degradation. Interestingly, our RNA-seq data revealed that some ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as FBXO4, UBE3C, NEDD4, and RBX1 were significantly reduced in ACSL4 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result indicated that ACSL4 may reduce the ubiquitin of ZEB2 via downregulating ubiquitin E3 ligase. Additionally, we found that ACSL4 promoted ZEB transcription as the mRNA level of ZEB2 was significantly reduced after ACSL4 knockdown. A recent study reported that LDs-derived lipolysis provide acetyl-CoA for the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ippolito et al., 2022</xref>). We observed that ACSL4 can also promote FAO, which generates acetyl-CoA for the epigenetic regulation. It is likely that ACSL4 regulates the ZEB2 mRNA level via lipid-epigenetic reprogramming mechanism, which is worth studying in the future. Therefore, ACSL4 regulates ZEB2 not only via a post-transcriptional mechanism but also via a transcriptional mechanism. Notably, the relationship between ZEB2 and ACSL4 could form a positive feedback loop: ZEB2 transcriptionally activates ACSL4, and conversely, ACSL4 stabilizes the ZEB2 protein by reducing its ubiquitination. Amplification of either gene might therefore lock this loop in an active state, resulting in the enhanced invasive and metastatic capabilities of breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have reported that ACSL4 could act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene, depending on the specific cancer type and tissue environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grube et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, ACSL4 could either be located at the cytomembrane or at the LDs and endoplasmic reticulum membrane, indicating the different functions of ACSL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quan et al., 2021</xref>). The cytomembrane ACSL4 is likely responsible for dictating ferroptosis sensitivity by shaping the plasma membrane lipidome, whereas ACSL4 localized to LDs has other functions. We provide evidence that ACSL4, which is located in LDs, is a pro-metastatic factor that promotes invasion and migration. Notably, we demonstrated that ACSL4 depletion significantly suppressed the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ACSL4 and ZEB2 were found to be preferentially expressed in BLBC cells and clinical samples that lacked ERα expression. Survival analysis revealed that breast cancer patients with high expression of both ACSL4 and ZEB2 are associated with worse overall survival than those patients with low expression. Thus, ACSL4 and ZEB2 could specifically be used as prognostic markers for breast cancer, and this axes hold promise as a new metabolic therapeutic target for highly invasive breast cancer.</p><p>Although ACSL4 has been shown to play an essential role in metastasis in many types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maloberti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sánchez-Martínez et al., 2017</xref>), its mechanism of ACSL4-mediated metastasis is not fully understood. ACSL4 is a member of the long-chain fatty acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme family that catalyzes FAs to their active form, acyl-CoA, which can be directed to anabolism or catabolism, depending on the cellular background. We observed that the knockdown of ACSL4 significantly reduced the number and size of LDs, indicating that FAs were directed to anabolism to form LDs by ACSL4. Indeed, it has been shown that fatty acids are stored in LDs before entering FAO, and the formation of LDs is required for FAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Welte and Gould, 2017</xref>). This is in line with our observation that exogenous FAs (OA) significantly enhance LDs accumulation and migration. Importantly, lipidomic analysis revealed that the knockdown of ACSL4 significantly decreased the incorporation of both saturated and unsaturated FAs into different species of lipids, including TAG, phospholipids (PE and PC), and cholesteryl esters (CE). Consistently, frozen tissue sections from a metastatic animal model confirmed that high ACSL4 expression was accompanied by apparent LDs accumulation. These results suggest that ACSL4 is a crucial regulator that promotes lipid storage during breast cancer metastasis. Interestingly, knockdown of ACSL4 restored the expression of E-cadherin, an essential adhesion molecule, indicating that ACSL4 promotes tumor invasion through multiple mechanisms.</p><p>Reprogramming of lipid metabolism is an essential step in metastasis. LDs are highly dynamic monolayer membrane-bound organelles involved in energy utilization, signal transduction, and cancer invasion. The number and size of LDs are associated with cancer aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruz et al., 2020</xref>). We observed that highly invasive breast cancer cells were enriched with LDs. Using fluorescence microscopy, we noticed that the number of LDs was significantly reduced after cell migration. Our findings are in line with a recent study showing that LDs undergo lipolysis during the process of migration in pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rozeveld et al., 2020</xref>). It is likely that FAs are released from LDs and form acyl-CoA, which enters OXPHOS to support the energy needed for metastasis. Therefore, these data support the notion that increased LDs accumulation is a priming state prior to metastasis, and that LDs are crucial resources to fuel the process of metastasis.</p><p>In addition, we observed that ACSL4 also participates in FA catabolism, as the long-chain FA-derived OCR and ATP production were significantly reduced in ACSL4-depleted cells, indicating that ACSL4 is essential for FAO stimulation. Our results are in line with a recent study that reported that hexokinase 2 enhances tumorigenicity by activating the ACSL4-mediated FA β-oxidation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, the expression of CPT1, a rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, was significantly reduced in the ACSL4-depleted cells. Among the three isoforms of CPT1, CPT1A is the only isoform regulated by ACSL4. We proposed that ACSL4 promotes FAO and ATP production by upregulating CPT1A, thereby providing energy support for breast cancer metastasis. Our results reveal the mechanism of previous findings that FAO is a critical energy pathway in TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camarda et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that lactate levels did not change after ACSL4 knockdown, suggesting that glycolysis is not involved in ACSL4-mediated energy metabolism. Therefore, we propose a model in which cell migration is a multistep process accompanied by dynamic cellular lipid metabolic changes. At the pre-metastatic stage, ACSL4 enhances LDs accumulation by promoting lipogenesis. During metastasis, ACSL4 stimulates FAO to generate ATP.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide insights into the mechanistic links between EMT and lipid metabolism and identify the ZEB2/ACSL4 axis as a novel metastatic metabolic pathway that stimulates both lipogenesis and FAO, resulting in enhanced breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Importantly, our results demonstrate that ACSL4 is a direct downstream target of ZEB2 in controlling lipid storage and LDs accumulation, which are important steps and energy pools for metastasis. Clinically, our findings identified ZEB2–ACSL4 signaling as an attractive therapeutic target for overcoming breast cancer metastasis. Elevated ACSL4 levels can be used as an effective marker for predicting cancer progression in patients with advanced breast cancer. The limitation of this study is the clinical samples is only 45. The future study should expand the clinical samples and cases to provide more clinical evidence for the crucial role of ACSL4 in breast cancer metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Breast cancer cell lines and clinical specimens</title><p>Breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and BT549 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Beijing Zhongyuan Ltd, Beijing, China).

The extracted cell lysates were immersed in liquid nitrogen and frozen for 5 min. The extracted cell lysates were placed in a 2 ml adapter, and the above steps were repeated twice. Samples were then centrifuged to pellet the proteins (5 min, 12,000 rpm), and the supernatant was stored for analysis in a vacuum centrifugal concentrator. The sample was dissolved in 200 μl isopropanol, filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane, and detected by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The lipidomics data were analyzed using LipidSearch software (version 4.0). The software identified intact lipid molecules based on their molecular weight and fragmentation pattern using an internal library of predicted fragment ions per lipid class. The spectra were then aligned based on retention time and the MS1 peak areas were quantified across the sample conditions. Excel 2010 was used to calculate intensity, and the R program (version 3.2.5) was used for data manipulation and statistical analyses, including unsupervised hierarchical clustering and heatmap visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNAs was synthesized from total RNA using the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Perfect Real Time, Takara).

The authors also claimed that ZEB2 activated ACSL4 expression by directly binding to its promoter, while ACSL4 in turn stabilized ZEB2 by blocking its ubiquitination. While the topic is interesting, there are several concerns with the study:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. My concern regarding the absence of appropriate thresholds or False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustments for the RNA-seq analysis has not been addressed, leading to incorrect thresholds and erroneous identification of significant signals.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the concern about the RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq data was analyzed by the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate. The procedure of RNA-seq bioinformatic analysis is as follows:For data analysis, raw data of fastq format were firstly processed through in-house perl scripts. In this step, clean data were obtained by removing reads containing adapter, reads containing N base and low quality reads from raw data. All the downstream analyses were based on the clean data with high quality. Index of the reference genome was built using Hisat2 v2.0.5 and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using Hisat2 v2.0.5. FeatureCounts v1.5.0-p3 was used to count the reads numbers mapped to each gene, and then FPKM of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene. Differential expression analysis of two conditions/groups was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.20.0). The resulting P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate. Genes with an adjusted P-value (&lt;0.05) found by DESeq2 were assigned as differentially expressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 3B and C, it appears that the knockdown efficiency of ACSL4 is inadequate in these cells, which contradicts the Western blot results presented in Figure 2F.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the concern. In figure 3B and 3C, we use the shRNA for the knockdown experiment and in Figure 2F we use siRNA for the knockdown experiment, so the efficiency of them were different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Regarding Figure 6, the discovery of consensus binding sequences (CACCT) for ZEB2 alone is insufficient evidence to support the direct binding of ZEB2 to the ACSL4 promoter.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the concern. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which examines the direct interaction between DNA and protein, to test if ZEB2 directly binds to the ACSL4 promoter. The results showed that the primer set 1, which covered -184 to -295 of ACSL4 promoter region exhibited apparent ZEB2 binding (Fig. 6F). Moreover, the mutant sequence (AAAA) of ACSL4 promoter showed significant decreased luciferase activity (Fig. 7H). All these evidences suggest that ZEB2 directly bond to the consensus sequence of ACSL4 promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

In Figure 7C, the author claimed to have used 293T cells for the ubiquitin assay, which are not breast cancer cells. Moreover, the efficiency of over-expression differs between ZEB2 and ACSL4 in 293T cell lines. Performing the experiment in an unrelated cell line to justify an important interaction is not acceptable.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the concern. We also performed the ubiquitination assay in MDA-MB-231 cells in Fig 7D (Author response image 2), The results confirm that knockdown of ACSL4 obviously enhanced the ubiqutination of ZEB2. We also have performed the IP experiment in MDA-MB-231 cells in Author response image 3 (Fig 7F). The results confirmed the interaction between ZEB2 and ACSL4:</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The ubiquitination assay in MDA-MB-231 cells.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87510-sa4-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>The IP experiment in MDA-MB-231 cells.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87510-sa4-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors validated a positive feedback loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4 in breast cancer, which regulates lipid metabolism to promote metastasis.</p><p>Overall, the study is original, well structured, and easy to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comments from the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Lin et al. reveals a novel positive regulatory loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4, which promotes lipid droplets storage to meet the energy needs of breast cancer metastasis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comments from the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I still have some points that should be addressed by the Authors:</p><p>The interaction between ACSL4 and ZEB2 is still not convincing, due to the cellular localization of ACSL4 and ZEB2 is different.

We performed GST pull-down assay to examine whether ZEB2 and ACSL4 form a complex. GST pull-down assay confirmed the interaction of ZEB2 and ACSL4 (Figure 7—figure supplement 2).
