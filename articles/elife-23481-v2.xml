mediators of mammalian immunity. In vertebrates, these factors derive from diverse cellular sources. Sea urchins share a molecular heritage with chordates that includes the IL17 system. Here, we characterize the role of epithelial expression of IL17 in the larval gut-associated immune response. The purple sea urchin genome encodes 10 IL17 subfamilies (35 genes) and 2 IL17 receptors. Most of these subfamilies are conserved throughout echinoderms. Two IL17 subfamilies are sequentially strongly upregulated and attenuated in the gut epithelium in response to bacterial disturbance. IL17R1 signal perturbation results in reduced expression of several response genes including an IL17 subtype, indicating a potential feedback. A third IL17 subfamily is activated in adult immune cells indicating that expression in immune cells and epithelia is divided among families. The larva provides a tractable model to investigate the regulation and consequences of gut epithelial IL17 expression across the organism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23481.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23481.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23481.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To protect themselves from the constant invasion of harmful microbes, animals have evolved complex immune systems. The gut is one of the most active sites of the immune system and plays a key role in regulating immune responses. In mammals, cells lining the gut wall can sense the presence of harmful bacteria and communicate this information to tissues across the body by producing specialized proteins called Interleukin-17 (IL-17). IL-17 proteins are important for regulating inflammation and are thought to activate specific immune cells in an infected area.</p><p>Some aspects of immune systems are similar between different animal species, which can provide clues of how immunity evolved and how it is regulated. For example, sea urchins, which evolved 400-600 million years ago, begin life as simple larvae consisting of a few thousand cells. As oceans harbor a multitude of bacteria and viruses, sea urchin larvae need an efficient immune system to defend themselves. These larvae can respond to specific types of bacteria within a few hours after the microbes have entered their gut by modifying gene expression in distant cells. As these changes occur in cells that are removed from the bacteria, it is thought that the gut cells that initially sense the bacteria, somehow communicate this information.</p><p>Now, Buckley et al. exposed sea urchin larvae to a marine bacterium and measured the responses of the cells and their gene expression. The infection affected several types of cells, and in the first 24 hours, a subset of immune cells changed shape and started migrating to the gut wall. In addition, IL-17 gene expression changed significantly in gut cells in the early phases of the larval immune response. Buckley et al. identified three types of IL-17 proteins involved in sea urchin immunity: two that are important for the immune response in the gut during the larval stage, and a third that is only present in adults. These findings suggest that IL-17 signaling is an ancient and central element of gut-associated immune response, which even exists in animals that evolved long before humans.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that the sea urchin larva represents a unique and ideal experimental model to study immune responses in a living organism that is more closely related to mammals than some other models, like fruit flies or worms. By understanding the fundamental mechanisms that mediate gut health, this work may highlight new drug targets to treat conditions like Crohn’s disease and colon cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23481.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23481.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic></kwd><kwd>gut immunity</kwd><kwd>echinoderm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP74667</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rast</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>312221</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rast</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Expression of two highly regulated subfamilies of the complex multigene family encoding IL-17 cytokines in the purple sea urchin are sequentially activated in a larval gut-associated inflammation model and modulate downstream gene expression in the gut epithelium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gut epithelial cells deploy an elaborate suite of signals to transmit information about the state of the gut lumen to the wider organism. These communication networks can be difficult to interpret in the context of vertebrate systems, which exhibit complexity at both morphological (e.g. vertebrate guts are multilayered tissues that interact with many types of peripheral immune cells) and molecular levels. The gut is an ancient site of intense immune activity, and core aspects of the regulatory circuitry in this tissue are likely to be conserved across phyla. Consequently, invertebrate animals provide alternative models to investigate the fundamental mechanisms that control the connections between the gut lumen and the distributed immune system. Some of these organisms are morphologically and genetically simple, which provides unique experimental advantages, including reduced microbiota diversity, optical transparency and efficient transgenesis.</p><p>The difficulty in identifying homologs of mammalian cytokines, even within other vertebrate classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Secombes et al., 2011</xref>), remains a long-standing barrier to this approach. As central mediators of the immune response, cytokines are key targets for pathogen mimicry or co-option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elde and Malik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Epperson et al., 2012</xref>) and are subject to high levels of evolutionary pressure and sequence diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koyanagi et al., 2010</xref>). An exception to this trend is the IL17 cytokine family. These proteins are characterized by a cysteine-knot fold structure that is formed through interactions among four conserved cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hymowitz et al., 2001</xref>). This structural constraint provides a means to computationally identify IL17 homologs across phyla. IL17 cytokines have been functionally characterized in jawed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kolls and Lindén, 2004</xref>) and jawless vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2015</xref>), and orthologs have been identified also in invertebrate deuterostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hibino et al., 2006</xref>) molluscs, nematodes and arthropods (<italic>Daphnia</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, IL17 factors are absent from available genome sequences of insects and non-bilaterian metazoans. The broad phylogenetic distribution of this signaling system underscores the fundamental role of the IL17 family in animal biology and highlights the opportunity to glean understanding of this system using experimentally accessible invertebrate models.</p><p>Most mammalian genomes encode six IL17 family members (IL17A-F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kolls and Lindén, 2004</xref>), of which the most widely studied are the closely related IL17A and IL17F. These two highly expressed cytokines define subsets of effector T cells (Th17 cells and γδ17 cells) and innate lymphocyte-like cells (ILCs) and induce strong inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Korn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lockhart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gladiator et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, IL17 expression is not restricted to lymphocytes or other mesodermal immune cells. Three members of the IL17 family (IL17B, IL17C, and IL17E [also known as IL-25]) are expressed by epithelial cells, including those in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reynolds et al., 2015</xref>). In this context, IL17C is a key factor in the early intestinal immune response where it regulates the expression of many innate immune genes. In colonic epithelial cells, IL17E promotes inflammation through the IL17RB receptor, while IL17B competitively binds with IL17RB to interfere with this signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reynolds et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, within humans and mice, the IL17 cytokines are produced from a variety of cellular sources and have wide-ranging functions and downstream transcriptional consequences, some of which are just beginning to be understood.</p><p>To investigate the role of IL17 in the gut-associated immune response within the context of a morphologically simple organism, the larval stage of the purple sea urchin (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>) provides a unique model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ch Ho et al., 2016</xref>). The purple sea urchin genome sequence encodes an expansive set of immune receptors and effectors as well as conserved signaling pathways downstream of pattern recognition receptors and homologs of a suite of transcription factors that have key roles in modulating the immune response and hematopoiesis in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hibino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sodergren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rast et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Messier-Solek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckley and Rast, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Solek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schrankel et al., 2016</xref>). This genetic heritage is shared within the deuterostomes (e.g. echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates), providing a context in which to investigate IL17 function in a simple invertebrate for comparison to mammals.</p><p>Purple sea urchins undergo indirect development with a bilaterally symmetric, planktonic larval form that metamorphoses into a pentameral adult. Over 5 days, embryos synchronously develop to form free-swimming larvae that feed for 10–12 weeks before settling and metamorphosis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McClay, 2011</xref>]). At 10 days post-fertilization (dpf), larvae are 300–400 µM in length and consist of about 4000 cells. Larvae have a tripartite gut composed of an epithelial monolayer separated by two sphincters into a pharynx, midgut and hindgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Larvae have several types of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ch Ho et al., 2016</xref>) including a granular cell population known as ‘pigment cells’ and a heterogeneous suite of several types of ‘blastocoelar cells’ that populate the body cavity (blastocoel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Solek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tamboline and Burke, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson and Burke, 1985</xref>). Collectively, these cells mediate the larval immune response through surveillance-like motility, phagocytosis, expression of immune effectors and regulatory cell-cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ch Ho et al., 2016</xref>). The simplicity and optical transparency of the sea urchin larva allows visualization and quantification of the immune response on an organism-wide scale at single-cell resolution.</p><p>We have developed a model for gut-associated immune response in which larvae are exposed to the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Vibrio diazotrophicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ch Ho et al., 2016</xref>). This marine bacterium was first isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of the congeneric green sea urchin, <italic>S. droebachiensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guerinot et al., 1982</xref>). Other <italic>Vibrio</italic> species have been implicated as causative disease agents in several adult sea urchins species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2008</xref>). Upon exposure to <italic>V. diazotrophicus</italic>, larvae exhibit a synchronous and robust set of cellular responses over a period of 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ch Ho et al., 2016</xref>). The most notable of these is that a subset of pigment cells change shape from a stellate to a rounded form, disengage from their typical positions apposed to the aboral ectoderm, and migrate to the gut epithelium. Some blastocoelar cell types exhibit changes in cell motility and increasingly frequent cell-cell interactions with each other and with the gut epithelium. Additionally, gut morphology is affected: the epithelial wall thickens to constrict the midgut, suggesting that the animals cease feeding. By 24 hr, bacteria are evident within the blastocoel, where they are phagocytosed by filopodial blastocoelar cells. Early changes in gene activity are most evident within the gut epithelium within 2 hr of exposure, which is well before bacteria penetrate the gut lumen. Transcriptional affects are also apparent in peripheral immune cells. These observations suggest that the system-wide response is regulated by recognition of microbial disturbance at the gut epithelium and is mediated in part by signals that transmit the state of the gut lumen to cells distributed throughout the organism.</p><p>Through comprehensive surveys of larval gene activity during infection, we find that two small subfamilies of <italic>IL17</italic> genes emerge as highly regulated factors during the early response. Here, we address the genomic repertoire, expression and function of the IL17 cytokines and receptors in the purple sea urchin immune response. We also present the diversity of IL17 sequences within the purple sea urchin genome with reference to other echinoderms. Expression of the sea urchin <italic>IL17</italic> genes is evident only after bacterial exposure and is restricted to the gut epithelium in this infection model, as assessed by both <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and transgenic reporters. In the larva, exposure to <italic>V. diazatrophicus</italic> does not elicit expression of IL17 in mesodermally derived immune cells. In contrast, a third subfamily of <italic>IL17</italic> is acutely expressed in the adult by circulating immunocytes in response to immune challenge and injury. The parallel roles of these IL17 subfamilies within the sea urchin immune response mirror the similar division of labor among vertebrate IL17 factors and highlight fundamental aspects of animal immunity. Functional data in the larva indicate that disruption of IL17 signaling leads to decreased expression of several immune regulators and effector genes in the gut epithelium, including some of the IL17 factors. Collectively, these findings indicate that epithelial expression of IL17 family regulators is central to an ancient aspect of gut immunity</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genome-wide survey identifies IL17 factors as an acutely upregulated signal in immune response</title><p>Seawater exposure to the marine bacterium <italic>V. diazotrophicus</italic> (<italic>V.d.</italic>) induces a distinct cellular response in sea urchin larvae that includes the migration of pigment cells to the gut epithelium, changes in cell behavior and altered gut morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ch Ho et al., 2016</xref>).

From this analysis, a small group of <italic>IL17</italic> genes emerge as the most upregulated genes in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Notably, these transcripts are completely absent from transcriptomes assembled from unchallenged (presumably immunoquiescent) larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tu et al., 2012</xref>). The acute upregulation of these genes suggests that this group of IL17 genes may play a role in initiating the larval response to perturbation of lumenal bacteria. As a foundation for functional study of these cytokines, we next characterized the purple sea urchin IL17 complement from a genomic perspective.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IL17 homologs encoded in the purple sea urchin genome</title><p>Our surveys of the original <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> genome assembly (v2.1) identified 30 IL17-like factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hibino et al., 2006</xref>). However, because many of these homologs were distantly related to each other and also IL17 sequences in other species, we reanalyzed the current genome assembly (v4.2; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.echinobase.org">www.echinobase.org</ext-link>). Using these sequences as queries in BLAST searches, and HMMER analyses to identify IL17 domains (PF06083) in the translated genome sequence, 34 IL17 homologs were identified. Of these, 22 correspond to previously annotated gene models (gene model numbers and coordinates are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In addition to BLAST (which requires primary sequence similarity) and HMMER (which can be complicated by intron sequences), we scanned uncharacterized but transcriptionally active regions of the genome to identify divergent IL17 factors. RNA-Seq reads were analyzed as they mapped to the genome without consideration of the established gene or transcript models. Genomic regions that exhibited changing expression levels (e.g. were expressed in infected larvae but not in uninfected controls) and lacked any previously described genes were selected. Candidate regions were translated and searched for domains common to immune proteins. One of these expressed, unannotated regions contained a partial IL17 domain. Using the transcriptome data to guide the prediction of coding sequence, a second nearby exon was identified and experimentally confirmed using RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The spliced sequence (which is the single member of the <italic>SpIL17-4</italic> subfamily) is divergent relative to the other sea urchin IL17 genes and was not identified using BLAST searches.</p><p>The <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> genome (v4.2) thus contains 35 homologs of <italic>IL17</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>SpIL17</italic>). Five of these sequences appear to be either pseudogenes that contain premature stop codons or frame shifts (these were verified by reference to raw unassembled trace sequence), or are truncated within the genome assembly due to sequence ambiguity. Phylogenetic analysis of the 30 remaining sequences indicates that this family of genes is comprised of 10 subgroups (designated <italic>SpIL17-1-10</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As a complementary analysis to define the echinoderm <italic>IL17</italic> subfamilies and to provide phylogenetic context for the <italic>SpIL17</italic> sequences, we identified <italic>IL17</italic> homologs in five additional echinoderm species that represent a range of taxonomic distances (divergence times of 5–480 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pisani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biermann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2006</xref>); <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

In contrast, two other sea urchins (the euechinoid <italic>Lytechinus variegatus</italic> and the cidaroid <italic>Eucidaris tribuloides</italic>) and the asteroid <italic>Patiria miniata</italic> each have fewer IL17 genes (7-23; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of the echinoderm IL17 genes indicates that representatives of the 10 subfamilies are present within each of the euechinoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The more distant <italic>E. tribuloides</italic> genome also contains orthologs of most of the <italic>SpIL17</italic> subfamilies (with the exception of groups 3, 9, and 10). The conservation of these families over 260 million years may reflect conserved roles within the immune response.

The short, highly divergent <italic>IL17</italic> sequences preclude robust phylogenetic analysis beyond the echinoderm lineage.

Analysis of these data reveals that the activation of the <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> and <italic>−4</italic> genes is one of the first transcriptional events in the larval immune response. Many changes in expression levels are evident by 6 hr of exposure or later (e.g. <italic>tnfaip3, nfkbiz,</italic> and <italic>cebpα</italic>). Of the 23 genes assayed, a similarly early activation was evident only for <italic>ets4</italic> (SPU_008528, a homolog of the human Prostate-derived Ets transcription factor; PDEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rizzo et al., 2006</xref>]). The early and rapid activation of these cytokines suggests that they may be involved in the initiation of the immune response. Notably, although <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the RNA-Seq reads recovered spliced transcripts from the <italic>SpIL17-2, −5,–6,</italic> and <italic>−9</italic> families, RT-qPCR analysis indicates that these genes are expressed at very low levels and expression is not affected by immune challenge. No expression of genes within the other <italic>SpIL17</italic> subfamilies was evident during the larval immune response. Furthermore, the <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> and <italic>−4</italic> transcripts were not present in unchallenged larvae. IL17 domains are also absent from the extensive sea urchin transcriptome databases, which are generated from immunoquiescent tissues and animals. Expression of <italic>SpIL17</italic> genes is therefore tightly regulated and restricted to specific immune challenge conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SpIL17 expression is restricted to the larval gut epithelium during the immune response to <italic>V. diazotrophicus</italic></title><p>To localize the expression of the <italic>SpIL17</italic> genes within the larval immune response, whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WMISH) was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>). Data from these analyses are consistent with the temporal kinetics during larval infection described above. No expression of either the <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> or <italic>−4</italic> genes was evident in WMISH with uninfected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a1,b1</xref>). <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> expression was observed in the midgut and hindgut of larvae collected at 6 hr of infection (70% of larvae; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c</xref>). These data suggest that individual larva express the <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> genes for a very short period of time, and the overall increase in expression at 6 hr is the average rate of expression over thousands of larvae. Similarly, expression of <italic>SpIL17-4</italic> is primarily restricted to the mid- and hindguts of larvae exposed to <italic>V.d.</italic> for 6 hr, although some expression is evident at 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b2, b3</xref>). Fluorescent in situ hybridization using probes for both <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> and <italic>−4</italic> indicate that the two IL17 factors are largely co-expressed within the gut epithelium, however, the two transcripts do not always completely overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).</p><p>Many of the finer details of the larval morphology are lost during the fixation process for WMISH. Thus, to localize expression of the <italic>SpIL17</italic> genes <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated BAC-based fluorescent reporter constructs to recapitulate endogenous expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e-i</xref>). BAC R3-17F18 spans a 140 kb genomic region that encompasses the eight <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> genes and <italic>SpIL17-10a</italic> on Scaffold1147 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using homologous recombination, the GFP coding sequence was inserted into the coding sequence in exon 1 of the <italic>SpIL17-1d</italic> gene (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

By 16 hr of infection, however, fluorescent signal was evident within a few cells within the mid- and hindgut epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f,g</xref>). The lag in visualizing GFP compared to endogenous <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> transcription is consistent, at least in part, with the time required to accumulate and fold the GFP protein. RT-qPCR quantitation of GFP transcript levels normalized to incorporated transgene copy number confirms that the kinetics of GFP expression are similar to that of endogenous <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> expression, with a sharp increase in expression by 8 hr that is attenuated at 24 hr of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, a BAC reporter construct was generated for the <italic>SpIL17-4</italic> transcripts.

This reporter construct also recapitulates endogenous <italic>SpIL17-4</italic> expression. No fluorescence was observed in uninfected larvae, but by 24 hr of infection, GFP was evident in midgut epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h,i</xref>), which is delayed relative to <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> as is the endogenous <italic>SpIL17-4</italic>.</p><p>Together, these data confirm that the <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> and <italic>−4</italic> genes are expressed exclusively in the epithelial cells of the larval mid- and hindgut, and that expression of these genes is tightly regulated and dependent upon bacterial challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A third SpIL17 subfamily is upregulated in adult immune cells</title><p>To investigate the role of the <italic>SpIL17</italic> gene family in the adult sea urchin immune response, we analyzed RNA-Seq data collected from adult immune cells (phagocytic coelomocytes) and gut tissues isolated following immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckley and Rast, 2012</xref>). The tissues used in this experiment were collected from a single animal that was injected intracoelomically with bacteria isolated from the gut lumen of another individual. This complex challenge mimics a gut perforation and generally increases the expression of many genes involved in immunity. Analysis of the RNA-Seq data indicated that while <italic>SpIL17</italic> expression was not detected in the gut tissue, genes within a third subfamily, <italic>SpIL17-9</italic>, were expressed at low levels in coelomocytes at 12 hr after challenge.</p><p>To determine whether this low level of expression reflected a larger transcriptional response to immune challenge, adult animals were challenged by intracoelomic injection of either <italic>V.d.</italic> or sham controls (seawater injection).

Expression of the sea urchin immune response genes <italic>185/333</italic> were used to assess immune activation. This echinoid-specific family of diverse defense genes is strongly upregulated in response to several types of immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2010</xref>). RT-qPCR analysis indicates that the <italic>SpIL17-9</italic> genes are strongly upregulated within 3 hr of infection in both animals injected with bacteria (red bars; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Expression peaks at 6 hr, and then returns to lower levels. This timing precedes expression of the <italic>185/333</italic> genes, which are slightly upregulated at 3 hr of infection, but exhibit high levels of expression by 9 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). In the animal that received the sham seawater injection, expression of the <italic>SpIL17-9</italic> genes also increased, but often more slowly (expression peaked at 12 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). This is consistent with a later activation of the <italic>185/333</italic> genes in this animal (24 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). A slower, more attenuated response is typical in sham-injected animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rast et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, in the experiments described here, the repeated needle sticks during the time course sampling may also elicit an acute injury response even in the absence of injected bacteria.

Vertebrate IL17 receptors are characterized by a conserved cytoplasmic Sef/IL17 receptor (SEFIR) domain (PF08357) that is structurally similar to the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Novatchkova et al., 2003</xref>) but is uniquely associated with IL17 signaling. The SEFIR domain mediates intracellular signaling through interactions with the adaptor molecule Act1, which also contains a SEFIR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qian et al., 2007</xref>). Mammalian IL17RA is also characterized by a TIR-like loop (TILL) domain, and a loosely defined C/EBPβ activation domain (CBAD) that are C-terminal to the SEFIR domain and are required for downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maitra et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We find that two sea urchin genes encode SEFIR domains (SpIL17R1 and SpIL17R2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). Each of these genes encodes a signal sequence, a long putative extracellular region (535 or 662 amino acids), a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic SEFIR domain. This structure is consistent with IL17 receptors in other lineages. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of the sea urchin SEFIR domains supports homology with IL17 receptors in other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have confirmed these sequences by amplifying the receptors using PCR and sequencing. A TIR-like loop (TILL) sequence is present in SpIL17R1 directly C-terminal to the SEFIR domain but is absent in SpIL17R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Exon 16, which encodes the sequence between the transmembrane region and the SEIFR domain is alternatively spliced and is absent from some transcripts.

Translation blocking morpholinos generally do not affect message prevalence of their targets in the absence of regulatory feedbacks (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rast et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidson et al., 2002</xref>]). To confirm the effect of this splice-blocking MASO, we amplified and sequenced the <italic>SpIL17R1</italic> exons 14 through 17 from transcripts expressed in larvae (10 dpf) subjected to MASO<sub>S</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Analysis of these sequences indicates that treatment with the MASO<sub>S</sub> produces incorrectly spliced <italic>SpIL17R1</italic> transcripts, in which an alternative donor site within exon 14 is spliced directly to exon 16, resulting in a frame shift and premature stop codon. The subsequently translated protein does not encode a transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). To assess the efficacy of this MASO, qPCR was performed on larvae using oligonucleotides that bind to a series of <italic>SpIL17R1</italic> exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3g</xref>). The MASO<sub>S</sub> specifically affects the transcription of exons 14 and 15, such that amplification between exons 14/15, 15/16 and 15/17 is significantly lower than in control larvae, whereas amplification between exons 3/4 and 16/17 is unaffected. The MASO<sub>s</sub> does not exhibit complete penetrance, however, as low levels of exon 15 transcript amplification are evident in perturbed larvae. This may result in a partial effect on the transcription of downstream genes. Perturbation of SpIL17R2 was developmentally lethal and therefore not pursued in this study (data not shown). This phenotype, however, is consistent with previously described developmental functions for IL17-RD (Sef) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ron et al., 2008</xref>),</p><p>Perturbation of IL17 signaling during the larval immune challenge does not significantly affect pigment cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3h</xref>); however, it does affect the message prevalence of several genes that were chosen as candidate response genes from the timing of their upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Notably, this includes <italic>SpIL17-4</italic>, which is upregulated relative to uninfected larvae, but at 2–5-fold lower levels than in larvae injected with control MASO. This decreased expression, in addition to the fact that <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> expression consistently lags that of peak <italic>SpIL17-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>) suggests that the SpIL17-1 signaling may be involved in upregulating <italic>SpIL17-4</italic>. Additionally, transcript levels of <italic>tnfaip3</italic>, <italic>soul1</italic>, <italic>nfkbiz</italic>, <italic>cebpα</italic>, and <italic>cebpγ</italic> are reduced in larvae exposed to the SpIL17R1 MASOs compared to control MASO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data begin to delineate how early expression of SpIL17 factors in response to bacterial challenge mediates the expression of downstream genes in an intact organism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Tightly regulated IL17 expression is central to initiating the immune response</title><p>We present here a characterization of the sea urchin larval immune response to microbial perturbation in the gut from a transcriptional perspective. RNA-Seq screens of larvae exposed to bacteria reveal that two subfamilies of IL17 act as key components of this immune response. The <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> genes are acutely upregulated during the earliest phases of immune response. This change in gene expression (~90 fold higher at 6 hr of exposure to <italic>V.d</italic>. relative to unexposed controls that have minimal <italic>SpIL17-1</italic> transcript prevalence) is greater than any other gene at any time point. This early expression pattern may point to a role in activating the downstream immune response and communicating the state of the gut lumen to both other cells of the gut epithelium and to the wider organism. In addition to the IL17 cytokine family, we have characterized two orthologs of IL17 receptors within the <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> genome. Perturbation of these receptors using antisense reagents results in reduced expression of immune genes and transcription regulators, including the <italic>SpIL17-4</italic> genes. These results further support the role of <italic>IL17</italic> signaling at the initiation of the sea urchin larval gut-associated immune response. Finally, the purple sea urchin IL17 subfamily structure is conserved throughout a phylogenetic range of representative echinoderm species, suggesting an ancient origin for the sequence diversity of the echinoderm IL17 sequences.</p><p>The conservation of the IL-17 subfamilies may indicate functional compartmentalization for these genes within the echinoderm immune response. This is supported by the tightly regulated expression of the <italic>SpIL17</italic> genes both spatially (gut epithelium in the larva and immune cells of the adult) and temporally (expression is strictly dependent on immune challenge or injury). Of the 10 <italic>SpIL17</italic> subfamilies, genes within three families (<italic>SpIL17-1, −4</italic>, and <italic>−9</italic>) are expressed in the context of either the larval or adult immune systems. It is likely that genes with the remaining subfamilies are expressed under different conditions of immune challenge or stress. This is particularly true for subfamilies <italic>SpIL17-2, −5,</italic> and <italic>−6,</italic> which can be detected as spliced transcripts from the larval transcriptome assembly, although RT-qPCR indicates that these are present at very low levels. The <italic>SpIL17</italic> transcripts are virtually absent under immunoquiescent conditions. We have analyzed available transcriptome data from 16 developmental stages (egg through juvenile) and six adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tu et al., 2012</xref>) and find no evidence for expression of any of the <italic>SpIL17</italic> subfamilies. Furthermore, despite the availability of large EST databases (there are &gt;350,000 echinoderm ESTs from several adult tissues and developmental time points), no ESTs have been identified that correspond to the <italic>SpIL17</italic> sequences. This lack of <italic>SpIL17</italic> expression in non-challenged tissues correlates with our observations and underscores the importance of analyzing transcriptional activity under varied conditions of challenge when targeting immune-related genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sea urchin genomes encode moderately expanded IL17 families</title><p>Data presented here indicate that genome sequences from echinoderms (particularly the strongylocentrotids) have an unusually large number of genes encoding IL17 homologs. Mammals typically have six IL17 orthologs and the genomes of teleost fish that have been analyzed contain between four and seven IL17 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Secombes et al., 2011</xref>). The presence of 35 IL17 genes within the genome of the purple sea urchin suggests that this gene family has been expanded within this lineage. Although the driving forces behind this expansion remain unknown, it is consistent with other large immune-related gene families within the purple sea urchin genome that have both pathogen recognition and regulatory functions. The purple sea urchin genome contains expanded families of pattern recognition receptors that are 10-fold larger than their vertebrate counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rast et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Messier-Solek et al., 2010</xref>). High multiplicity is also apparent among gene families that encode immune effector genes (<italic>e.g.,</italic> the <italic>185/333</italic> gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2010</xref>] and the perforin-like Macpf family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hibino et al., 2006</xref>]).</p><p>Most of the echinoid IL17 subfamilies are conserved at least to the last common cidaroid-euechinoid ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the <italic>L. variegatus</italic> genome has fewer IL-17 genes, homologs representative of each of the subfamilies are retained.

Broader phylogenetic comparisons (<italic>e.g.,</italic> comparing the echinoderm and chordate IL17 sequences) are rendered uninformative by the relatively short and divergent sequences.

More recent work, however, has shown the importance of epithelial expression of another IL17 ortholog, IL17C, in directing immune responses in the gut. IL17C is produced by the gut epithelium where it acts in an autocrine manner to activate expression of genes involved in the innate immune response, including proinflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2011</xref>). This is observed in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis models as well as infection with <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>. Members of the IL17 family have been implicated in inducing neutrophil migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ye et al., 2001</xref>), regulating tight junction formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kinugasa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reynolds et al., 2012</xref>) and stimulating mucin production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). IL17C plays a role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity by regulating the expression of occludin, a tight junction protein in colonic epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reynolds et al., 2012</xref>). IL17C expression in the gut epithelium has also been linked to autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2011</xref>) and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Song et al., 2014</xref>). This cytokine is thus a primary mediator in mammalian gut-associated immune response.</p><p>Data on IL17 function remain limited outside of the jawed vertebrates.

In the oyster, which is the only protostome in which the IL17 response has been characterized, the single IL17 homolog is expressed by circulating hemocytes in response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roberts et al., 2008</xref>). In the work presented here, we show that in the sea urchin larva, SpIL17 expression is restricted to gut epithelial cells, with no evidence of expression in mesodermally derived immune cells in response to <italic>V.d.</italic> challenge. This function is potentially homologous to the mammalian epithelial expression and suggests that the role of IL17 in modulating mucosal immunity is an ancient and fundamental component of immunity.</p><p>It is notable that, although there is a strong expression of <italic>SpIL17-9</italic> in adult coelomic immune cells in response to immune challenge, over the course of many <italic>V.d. </italic> challenge experiments, we have never observed <italic>SpIL17</italic> expression in any larval mesodermal immune cells.

This suggests that the sea urchin IL17 receptors signal through an Act1-independent mechanism. One potential mechanism identified in mammals is the direct activation of STAT5 that occurs in vertebrate IL17RB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). The recruitment of STAT5 depends on phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the IL17RB cytoplasmic region. Specifically, STAT5 recruitment is mediated by tyrosine residues 444 and 454. These residues are both conserved in the SpIL17-R1 sequence. There are 13 additional tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region of SpIL17R1 and six in SpIL17R2 that may serve similar functions. Alternatively, a novel mechanism may function within the echinoderm SpIL17 system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Potential interactions within the larval IL17 system</title><p>Several observations are consistent with feedback in the larval gut epithelial system. The IL17R1 is expressed in the gut epithelial cells consistent with the possibility that neighboring cells in the epithelium could communicate using the IL17-1 signal. In addition, the single <italic>IL17-4</italic> gene is consistently activated to peak levels several hours after the IL17-1 genes in immune challenge experiments even when these vary in time of initial expression. Reduction of IL17-4 expression in IL17R1 MASO perturbed embryos supports a causal linkage between IL17-1 activation and later IL17-4 expression. Thus, IL17-4 may in some way modify signaling initiated by IL17-1. These possibilities can be explored in future perturbation experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings reveal that epithelial IL17 signaling is an ancient and central element of the gut associated immune response.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wendy Garrett (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a guest Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Anthony De Tomaso (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript by Jonathan Rast's group, the authors describe a detailed analysis of immunity in the purple sea urchin (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>). Very little is known about immune responses in this organism, especially at mucosal sites, and the authors use elegant and in-depth evolutionary genomics approaches to identify and classify genes induced during an immune response. Here, the authors describe development of a model for gut-associated immunity in which they infect larvae with Gram-negative bacteria that are trophic for sea urchins (<italic>Vibrio diazotrophicus</italic>, Vd). In identifying genes induced during the early response to infection, they identify a striking upregulation of cytokine-like genes with homology to IL-17 family members. These are analysed temporally and spatially within the organism, and using BAC clones with GFP reporter genes they are able to track protein expression in vivo during infections as well. The authors classify these genes not only within sea urchins, but other types of marine animals, and present this data within the overall evolutionary context. They also identify IL-17 receptor-like molecules, and show that blockade with morpholinos limits immune responses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A concern was raised that the infection experiments have not been sufficiently replicated to allow robust conclusions to be drawn about the temporal regulation of the IL17 genes. For their work with larvae, the authors used pools of larvae, which does address genetic variation between individuals. However, none of the infection experiments themselves are replicated, or at least not as indicated in the text. With respect to adult urchins, data for only three adults is presented for SpIL17-9 (two infected and one sham), and there is considerable variation in the dynamics of the two treatments. Again, this complicates interpretation of the results. In the morpholino experiments, the translational MASO is missing from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, despite being referred to in the text and figure legend. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> panel E, the data are normalized twice and result in only modest differences in expression, making it difficult to draw conclusions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>, it appears that the translational MASO has no effect on IL17 expression, but there is an effect on several downstream signaling molecules. How can this be explained? Also in this figure, why are some MASOs missing from some panels? In several places the authors referred to data in the text that doesn't appear in the paper. See, for example, subsection “A third SpIL17 subfamily is upregulated in adult immune cells”, first paragraph (RNA-seq analysis), subsection “Interfering with IL17 signaling affects downstream gene expression”, third paragraph (analysis of publicly available data), subsection “IL17 Receptors”, first paragraph (missing in situ data).</p><p>In a revision, the authors need to (1) clarify the measures used to ensure reproducibility, (2) ensure that all data presented in the paper is in the correct place in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23481.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>A concern was raised that the infection experiments have not been sufficiently replicated to allow robust conclusions to be drawn about the temporal regulation of the IL17 genes.

We have been characterizing this <italic>Vibrio-</italic>based infection model for many years and have measured changes in cell behavior and gene expression for countless batches of larvae. These results are described in part in Ho, et al., Immunology and Cell Biology, 2016. The kinetics of <italic>IL17</italic> gene expression in response to bacterial challenge have been measured in numerous independent infection experiments and assessed qualitatively in many separate in situhybridization experiments. In addition, these data are consistent with results of analyses of IL17 fluorescent protein reporter transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We present here representative results from two independent infection experiments (the RNA-Seq data [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>] and a separate experiment on larvae from an independent mate pair assessed by QPCR [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>]). Consistent quantitative measurements of transgene message prevalence from an additional larval sample are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. To clarify the reproducibility of these data, we have added a more detailed explanation to the Results section.</p><p><italic>With respect to adult urchins, data for only three adults is presented for SpIL17-9 (two infected and one sham), and there is considerable variation in the dynamics of the two treatments.

We have added data from an additional, independent experiment to the figure to support the reproducibility of these results. Additionally, in this manuscript, the primary conclusions from the adult experiments are that 1) a unique subfamily of <italic>il17</italic> genes (<italic>spil17-9</italic>) is expressed in adult mesodermally derived immune cells, and 2) this expression is not observed in immunoquiescent animals, but is instead dependent on immune stimulation (either bacterial or through injury). The data are consistent on these points and we have clarified the conclusions in the text.</p><p><italic>In the morpholino experiments, the translational MASO is missing from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, despite being referred to in the text and figure legend.</italic> </p><p>We have removed this reference from the text and figure legend, and instead refer the readers to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>.

The figure was intended to show that there may be a moderate differential change in the expression levels of the two splice forms over the course of infection. However, because the measurements are complex and the conclusion is an aside in the paper, we have removed this data and will revisit it in future studies.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>, it appears that the translational MASO has no effect on IL17 expression, but there is an effect on several downstream signaling molecules. How can this be explained? Also in this figure, why are some MASOs missing from some panels?</italic> </p><p>We have clarified this experiment in the text to explain the two types of perturbation; the translation MASO does not affect IL17R1 mRNA prevalence (top row, left most panel). Translation blocking MASOs have been used extensively in the sea urchin system by us and many other laboratories (in particular, to generate the data use to construct the endomesodermal gene regulatory network). Except in special cases of regulatory feedback, translation-blocking MASOs most often do not affect mRNA levels of their targets. The results shown are therefore consistent with many translation blocking MASOs. The splice blocking MASO specifically interferes with splicing of exons 15 and 16 (we have added a sequence analysis to this effect to in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. This can be assessed directly by qPCR and compared to other exons junctions (e.g., exons 3 and 4) to demonstrate MASO efficacy.</p><p><italic>In several places the authors referred to data in the text that doesn't appear in the paper.
