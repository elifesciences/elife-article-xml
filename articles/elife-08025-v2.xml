The most abundant ganglion cell type in mice, the so-called W3 ganglion cell, selectively responds to movements of small objects. Where and how object motion sensitivity arises in the retina is incompletely understood. In this study, we use 2-photon-guided patch-clamp recordings to characterize responses of vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3)-expressing amacrine cells (ACs) to a broad set of visual stimuli. We find that these ACs are object motion sensitive and analyze the synaptic mechanisms underlying this computation. Anatomical circuit reconstructions suggest that VGluT3-expressing ACs form glutamatergic synapses with W3 ganglion cells, and targeted recordings show that the tuning of W3 ganglion cells' excitatory input matches that of VGluT3-expressing ACs' responses. Synaptic excitation of W3 ganglion cells is diminished, and responses to object motion are suppressed in mice lacking VGluT3. Object motion, thus, is first detected by VGluT3-expressing ACs, which provide feature-selective excitatory input to W3 ganglion cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08025.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08025.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08025.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals can use their eyes to detect moving objects, which helps them to avoid predators and other threats, and to spot potential prey or allies. Visual information from the eyes is sent to the brain, which processes the information to form a coherent picture of how the objects are moving. This processing has to be able to account for movements of the head, eyes, and body—which can cause the image of an object on the retina within the eye to move even if the object itself remains stationary.</p><p>Within the retina, light is converted into electrical signals by cells called rods and cones. A layer of cells called bipolar cells relay these signals to the ‘ganglion’ cells, which in turn pass them on to the brain. In mice, a type of ganglion cell called the W3 ganglion cell has been shown to respond selectively to small moving objects, but exactly how these cells acquire their motion sensitivity remained unclear.</p><p>Kim et al. now reveal that cells called amacrine cells, which regulate the transfer of signals from the bipolar cells to ganglion cells, supply the information needed for motion detection. The mouse eye contains up to 50 different types of amacrine cells. One of these—called the VG3-amacrine cell—increases its activity whenever an object moves relative to its background, but decreases its activity whenever the object and background move together. The overall effect is that the cells respond selectively to the presence of small moving objects.</p><p>Most amacrine cells regulate the transfer of signals within the retina by inhibiting the activity of ganglion cells. But, Kim et al. show that VG3-amacrine cells release a molecule called glutamate to activate W3 ganglion cells when a moving object is detected. These unusual and specialized cells are, thus, an essential component of a circuit in the nervous system that supports motion detection. It is possible that some other types of amacrine cells may also play specialized roles in the detection of other features in the visual world.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08025.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08025.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>retinal circuitry</kwd><kwd>amacrine cell</kwd><kwd>feature detection</kwd><kwd>VGluT3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY021855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kerschensteiner</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness (RPB)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kerschensteiner</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY 023341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kerschensteiner</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mouse visual system is able to detect small moving objects due to the activity of VG3-amacrine cells, an unusual type of modulatory cell that uses the transmitter glutamate to activate retinal output cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A diverse array of circuits in the retina processes signals from photoreceptors and parses information into spike trains of 20–30 types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), each encoding distinct aspects of the visual scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Masland, 2012</xref>). The most abundant RGC type in the mouse retina (W3-RGC) was recently shown to respond selectively to movements of small—in terms of size on the retina—objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Detecting object motion is a challenging task as head, body, and eye movements frequently shift the retinal image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinez-Conde et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakatani and Isa, 2007</xref>). To distinguish movements of objects and the background, object motion sensitive (OMS) RGCs respond to differences in the timing of texture movements in their receptive field center and surround (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olveczky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). W3-RGCs share key properties with OMS RGCs in rabbit and salamander, but, due to stronger surround suppression, do not respond at the border of larger objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). This feature is reminiscent of local-edge-detector RGCs described in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levick, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roska et al., 2006</xref>). W3-RGCs, thus, appear to be in the intersection of OMS and local-edge-detector RGCs. Although postsynaptic inhibition and spike thresholds sharpen the tuning of W3-RGCs, similar to other OMS and local-edge-detector RGCs, key response properties appear to be inherited from their excitatory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Wyk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baccus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russell and Werblin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that feature selectivity arises presynaptic to W3-RGCs. Where and how object motion is first detected remains to be determined.</p><p>Typically, RGCs receive excitatory input from bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Euler et al., 2014</xref>) and inhibitory input from amacrine cells (ACs). ACs are the most diverse class of neurons in the retina, encompassing 30–50 cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacNeil and Masland, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>) that serve task-specific functions in vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dacheux and Raviola, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Munch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grimes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Li, 2012</xref>). Although most ACs release γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine, a wide range of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators can be found in different cell types including one expressing the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3) (gene: <italic>Slc17a8</italic>, protein: VGluT3, AC: VG3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fyk-Kolodziej et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haverkamp and Wassle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>). VG3-ACs are conserved from rodents to primates. Recent studies found that VG3-ACs respond to light increments (ON) and decrements (OFF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grimes et al., 2011</xref>), show strong surround suppression, and following optogenetic or electrical stimulation can release glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). However, what specific features of the visual world VG3-ACs detect and how, as well as their interactions with RGCs during sensory processing remain unknown.</p><p>Here, we generate and obtain transgenic mouse lines to genetically label VG3-ACs and target them under 2-photon guidance for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in retinal flat mount preparations. We find that VG3-ACs, like W3-RGCs, combine properties of OMS and local-edge-detector neurons and selectively detect movements of small objects. Using biolistics, we show that many excitatory synapses on W3-RGCs are apposed by boutons of VG3-ACs, and in whole-cell recordings from W3-RGCs, find that properties of their excitatory input match VG3-AC responses. Finally, we show amplitude and object motion preference of synaptic excitation and spike responses of W3-RGCs are reduced in VGluT3 knockout mice (<italic>VGluT3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seal et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we identify VG3-ACs as object motion detectors, characterize the synaptic mechanisms underlying this computation, and show that VG3-ACs provide feature-selective excitatory input to W3-RGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To analyze the morphology of VG3-ACs, we generated bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing a ligand-activated Cre recombinase under control of regulatory sequences of the <italic>Slc17a8</italic> gene (<italic>VG3-CreERT2</italic> mice) and crossed them to a fluorescent reporter strain (<italic>Ai9</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). After tamoxifen injection, a subset of VG3-ACs expresses tdTomato in <italic>VG3-CreERT2 Ai9</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neurites of VG3-ACs stratify broadly in the center of the inner plexiform layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grimes et al., 2011</xref>), occupy medium-sized lateral territories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, 7662 ± 211 μm<sup>2</sup>, n = 39), and as a population, cover the retina approximately seven times (coverage: 6.88). To characterize light responses, we obtained <italic>VG3-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grimes et al., 2011</xref>) in which all VG3-ACs express Cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), crossed them to <italic>Ai9</italic>, and targeted fluorescent somata in the inner nuclear layer (INL) for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Consistent with previous results, we find that VG3-ACs respond transiently to light increments and decrements, depolarizing to small and hyperpolarizing to large stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that this switch in response polarity is caused by a combination of pre- and post-synaptic surround inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Excitatory and voltage-response receptive fields are well fit by Difference-of-Gaussians models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McMahon et al., 2004</xref>), whereas a single Gaussian is sufficient to describe the monotonic rise of inhibition with stimulus size. For all components, OFF responses exceed ON responses, and for voltage responses and excitatory inputs, ON receptive fields are larger in diameter than their OFF counterparts. We characterized the temporal tuning of VG3-AC responses and underlying synaptic inputs in more detail using white noise stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08025.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Morphology and receptive field properties of VG3-ACs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Orthogonal maximum intensity projections of a confocal image stack through a representative VG3-amacrine cells (ACs) labeled in <italic>VG3-CreERT2 Ai9</italic> mice.

Third order neurons that receive convergent rectified input from bipolar cells can detect motion and other changes in patterns with structure on the scale of bipolar cells' receptive fields even when the average luminance across their own receptive fields does not change (i.e., nonlinear spatial integration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Victor and Shapley, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demb et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>). To evaluate input rectification of VG3-ACs, we presented sinusoidally modulated split-field stimuli in which the receptive field center was divided evenly or in a biased manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We then compared the power of excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) responses at once (F1) and twice (F2) the frequency of modulation (2 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Excitatory input to biased split-field stimuli is modulated primarily at the stimulus frequency and recapitulates the OFF-preference of VG3-ACs. The F2-dominant responses to even split-field stimulation indicate that this excitatory input is provided by rectified bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grimes et al., 2014</xref>). To test whether inhibition, like excitation, is driven by rectified receptive field subunits and to measure their spatial extent, we sinusoidally modulated square-wave gratings with different bar widths in an annular region overlaying the receptive field surround (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) show frequency-doubled (F2) responses characteristic of rectified input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>). F2 power increases in a step-like fashion between bar widths of 25 μm and 50 μm, suggesting that bipolar cells are likely the cellular substrate for nonlinear subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Victor and Shapley, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demb et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we evaluated voltage responses and synaptic inputs of VG3-ACs in differential motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baccus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and edge detection stimulus paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levick, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Wyk et al., 2006</xref>).

Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that this response pattern is caused by preferential excitation during center-only motion and strong inhibition elicited whenever motion includes the surround (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E,D</xref>). Since the average luminance in center and surround regions does not change in this stimulus, the observed responses provide further evidence that both are composed of rectified subunits, allowing VG3-ACs to detect when an object moves at a different time than the background irrespective of the precise spatial patterns involved, a defining feature of OMS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olveczky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baccus et al., 2008</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08025.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Detection of object motion by VG3-ACs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating texture motion stimuli.

Narrow dark bars moving across the receptive fields of VG3-ACs elicited transient depolarizations as leading and trailing edges cross the receptive field center. Robust edge responses were observed over a wide range of motion speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>) and were indistinguishable for leading and trailing edges in spite of the opposite polarity of the associated temporal contrast. Responses of VG3-ACs are not directionally selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to voltage recordings, transient EPSCs and IPSCs were observed during edge transits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). EPSCs and IPSCs were larger at leading than trailing edges and showed a preference for the faster speeds tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). However, the ratio of excitation and inhibition remained relatively constant across these conditions, which likely accounts for the greater constancy of edge responses observed in voltage recordings. Local edge detectors are typically stimulated robustly by narrow contrast edges, but not by expansive ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levick, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roska and Werblin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Wyk et al., 2006</xref>). We, therefore, recorded responses of VG3-ACs to bars of varying heights moving across their receptive field at a constant speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Edge responses were strongly suppressed for bar heights above 200 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L,M</xref>). Trailing edge responses to the smallest bars were lower than leading edge responses, likely a consequence of the asymmetric size of VG3-ACs' ON and OFF receptive field centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Similar to voltage responses, excitatory synaptic inputs showed edge response suppression for larger stimuli, whereas inhibition rose and plateaued with increasing bar height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N,O</xref>), corroborating that surround inhibition acts both pre- and post-synaptic in VG3-ACs. VG3-ACs, thus, show key response features of OMS and local-edge-detector neurons, and through the synaptic mechanisms outlined above, selectively detect movements of small objects.</p><p>The data presented so far suggest that pre- and post-synaptic surround inhibition cancel responses of VG3-ACs to global scene shifts and movements of large objects. Surround suppression of the excitatory input to W3-RGCs was found to rely on spiking ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). To test whether surround suppression of VG3-ACs is similarly mediated by spiking ACs and to assess its importance to feature detection, we tested the effect of the sodium channel blocker TTX on VG3-ACs' responses in differential motion and edge detection stimulus paradigms. In the presence of TTX, VG3-ACs depolarized to global motion as well as differential center motion, and hyperpolarizations observed during surround stimulation were abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Edge responses elicited by narrow bars moving across the receptive fields of VG3-ACs at a variety of speeds were not changed by TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), but the suppression observed for larger bars was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Surround inhibition, thus, is critical for the feature detection of VG3-ACs and appears to be mediated by spiking ACs. The use of spikes to signal surround motion likely improves temporal coincidence of inhibitory input with bipolar cell depolarization and excitatory input to VG3-ACs during coherent motion, leading to more effective cancellation of center signals by the surround.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08025.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Spiking ACs mediate surround suppression of VG3-ACs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative voltage traces recorded from a VG3-AC during presentation of the texture motion stimulus illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> in control conditions (<italic>top, black</italic>) and in the presence of TTX (<italic>bottom, blue</italic>).

Removal of VGluT3, which in the retina is only expressed by VG3-ACs, affected neither gross morphological development of the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) nor dendritic patterns of W3-RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). EPSCs elicited by differential center motion were reduced by approximately 50% in W3-RGCs of <italic>VGluT3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> compared to wild-type (<italic>WT</italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). By contrast, excitation during global motion and tonic excitation revealed by differential surround stimulation were unchanged. A similar pattern was observed in the spike responses of W3-RGCs, which were selectively decreased for differential center but not global motion stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). Similarly, EPSCs and spike responses evoked by edges of narrow moving bars (height: 100 μm) were suppressed across a wide range of speeds in <italic>VGluT3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–L</xref> and <italic>data not shown</italic>), whereas excitation and spike responses elicited by broader moving bars remained intact in <italic>VGluT3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–L</xref>). In agreement with anatomical results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), VG3-ACs, thus, appear to provide approximately half of the excitatory input to W3-RGCs. Importantly, feature selectivity of this VG3-input is more sharply tuned than the excitatory input remaining in <italic>VGluT3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice—likely provided by ON and OFF bipolar cells—and is required for normal spike responses of W3-RGCs.</p><p>In the OMS circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), VG3-ACs serve to amplify and sharpen the tuning of responses to object motion. Multi-tiered inhibition combined with delayed excitation, and successive threshold nonlinearities likely contribute to sharpening. Surround inhibition acts at three levels: bipolar axon terminals, VG3-ACs, and W3-RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Key features—transient ON and OFF input driven by rectified subunits—are similar at all three stages, arguing that inhibition is provided by a single AC type or a shared set of AC types, which remain to be identified. The added level of inhibition onto VG3-ACs compared to conventional pathways through bipolar cells likely contributes to the more complete surround suppression in the OMS circuit. Moreover, channeling of excitation through VG3-ACs introduces a delay not shared by the inhibitory input, which could improve cancellation of center signals by the surround, for example, during global image motion. The sequential arrangement of three thresholding nonlinearities—glutamate release from bipolar cells, glutamate release from VG3-ACs, and spike generation in W3-RGCs—likely further contributes to the increasing selectivity for narrow vs broad edges and differential center vs global texture motion at successive stages of the OMS circuit. Finally, our results support the notion that the diversity of AC types and circuit motifs in which they participate are integral to the diversity of features encoded in the signals the retinal sends to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Masland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jadzinsky and Baccus, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mice</title><p>We used homologous recombination to introduce the CreERT2 DNA recombinase into a BAC containing regulatory sequences of the <italic>Slc17a8</italic> gene, which encodes the VGluT3.

The average intensity of all stimuli was kept constant at ∼3000 R*/rod/s or ∼2500 M*/M-cone/s and their position centered on the soma of the recorded cell.</p><p>To measure area response functions of VG3-ACs and W3-RGCs, the intensity of a circular area with varying radii was square-wave modulated at 0.125 Hz (Michelson contrast: 96%). Circles of different size were presented in different pseudorandom sequences for each cell, and the first stimulus in the sequence repeated at its end to confirm stability of the recording. Temporal response functions and filter properties were analyzed using Gaussian white noise stimulation in which the intensity of a circular region over the receptive field center (voltage, excitation) or an annular region covering its surround (inhibition) was chosen at random from a normal distribution (RMS contrast: 40%) and updated at 30 Hz for 10 min. The properties of spatial integration were tested using sine-wave modulated (2 Hz) contrast-reversing square-wave gratings (varying spatial frequency) masked to preferentially stimulate the center (excitation) and surround (inhibition) regions of a receptive field. To test the sensitivity of VG3-ACs and W3-RGCs to differential or coherent luminance-neutral motion stimuli in their receptive field center and surround, the respective parts of square-wave gratings (bar width: 50–75 μm) were moved separately or in unison. A gray annulus was included in the spatial layout of the stimulus to reliably separate movement in the center and surround. Edge detection properties were tested by moving dark and light bars of different heights (50–600 μm) and constant width (800 μm) across the receptive fields of VG3-ACs and W3-RGCs at a variety of speeds (100–800 μm/s).

Receptive field sizes were measured as the diameter of the respective Gaussians at 1 SD. To analyze of VG3-ACs, we recovered separate ON and OFF filters from responses to Gaussian white noise stimulation. First, overlapping stimulus segments were weighted by their ensuing baseline-subtracted response (voltage or conductance) to compute the response-weighted stimulus ensemble, analogous to the spike-triggered stimulus ensemble frequently used in the characterization of RGC responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>). We then identified the dimension of highest variance in the response-weighted stimulus ensemble by principle components analysis and separated response-weighted stimulus segments in two groups based on their projection onto this first principle component (positive = ON, negative = OFF). ON and OFF segments were averaged to determine ON and OFF filters, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The amplitudes of these linear filters were scaled such that their sum equaled the sum of the global response-weighted stimulus average.

To characterize spatial integration, Fourier amplitudes of responses at once (F1, 2 Hz) and twice (F2, 4 Hz) the frequencies of sine wave modulation of contrast-reversing square-wave gratings over the receptive field center (excitation) or surround (inhibition) were analyzed. Edge detection tuning was measured from response amplitudes as leading and trailing edges of dark or bright bars of different heights moving at a variety of speeds crossed the receptive field center. Similarly, response amplitudes during selective (center or surround) or global (center and surround) luminance-neutral motion stimuli were compared to reveal differential motion sensitivity.</p><p>Synaptic connectivity between VG3-ACs and W3-RGCs was analyzed in confocal image stacks of retinas from <italic>VG3-Cre Ai9</italic> mice in which a sparse subset of RGCs (incl. W3-RGCs) expressed CFP and PSD95-YFP following biolistic transfection. Using local thresholding W3-RGC dendrites, PSD95 puncta and VG3-AC neurites were masked separately in Amira (FEI Company). Excitatory synapses on W3-RGCs formed by VG3-ACs were defined as PSD95 clusters with a center of mass within 0.5 μm from a VG3-AC neurite. We confirmed that varying this distance from 0.25 to 1 μm did not qualitatively change the results. Given the size of synaptic puncta, this range implies overlap or direct apposition of signals from PSD95-YFP and tdTomato in VG3 neurites. To compare the input fraction (i.e., fraction of PSD95 puncta apposed by a VG3 neurite) to chance levels, positions of PSD95 puncta were randomized within the synaptic layer in Monte Carlo simulations. Territories occupied by neurites of VG3-ACs and dendrites of W3-RGCs were measured by the area of the smallest convex polygon to encompass the respective arbors in a z-axis projection of image stacks acquired in flat-mounted retinas. To analyze soma distributions of VG3-ACs, we used a previously described algorithm to automatically identify cell positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soto et al., 2012</xref>) and calculated the density recovery profiles of these positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodieck, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Throughout this study, paired and unpaired t-tests were used to assess statistical significance of observed differences.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Kerschensteiner Lab for helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript.
