The presence of a specific leaf meristem is debated, as anatomical features typical of meristems are not present in leaves. Here we demonstrate that multiple NGATHA (NGA) and CINCINNATA-class-TCP (CIN-TCP) transcription factors act redundantly, shortly after leaf initiation, to gradually restrict the activity of a leaf meristem in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> to marginal and basal domains, and that their absence confers persistent marginal growth to leaves, cotyledons and floral organs. Following primordia initiation, the restriction of the broadly acting leaf meristem to the margins is mediated by the juxtaposition of adaxial and abaxial domains and maintained by WOX homeobox transcription factors, whereas other marginal elaboration genes are dispensable for its maintenance. This genetic framework parallels the morphogenetic program of shoot apical meristems and may represent a relic of an ancestral shoot system from which seed plant leaves evolved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15023.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15023.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>meristem</kwd><kwd>leaf development</kwd><kwd>leaf evolution</kwd><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP110100070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez</surname><given-names>John Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Furumizu</surname><given-names>Chihiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>863-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez</surname><given-names>John Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Eshed</surname><given-names>Yuval</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006031</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3767-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez</surname><given-names>John Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Eshed</surname><given-names>Yuval</given-names></name><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP130100177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez</surname><given-names>John Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Furumizu</surname><given-names>Chihiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP160100892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez</surname><given-names>John Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>185-2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Efroni</surname><given-names>Idan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A meristem acting at the margins of Arabidopsis leaves is suppressed by factors acting primarily in leaves and other determinate organs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Traditionally, plant organs are divided into organs with indeterminate growth such as shoots, roots and vascular cambia, whose growth is maintained by meristems, groups of pluripotent cells, and organs with determinate growth such as leaves or floral organs. Fossil evidence indicates that seed plant leaves evolved from ancestral shoot systems, and further, the dichotomous morphology of early seed plant leaves suggests growth via a persistent apical meristem (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kenrick and Crane, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Floyd and Bowman, 2010</xref>]). However, as anatomical features typical of apical or vascular meristems are not present in leaves, whether developing leaves grow from a localized meristem has been debated for nearly a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hagemann and Gleissberg, 1996</xref>).</p><p>In one of the first detailed examinations of development at the plant shoot apex Caspar Wolff described the leaf lamina arising from the margins of <italic>Brassica 'capitata'</italic> (cabbage) leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolff, 1759</xref>). Subsequently, Avery suggested that early lamina growth of <italic>Nicotiana tabaccum</italic> was initiated by a row of subepidermal initial cells located at the upper-lower (adaxial-abaxial) leaf boundary that he termed the 'marginal meristem' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery, 1933</xref>). However, it had already been noted that later protracted growth in leaves occurs in tissues that are not marginal, but rather within the developing lamina in a region described as a 'plate meristem' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schüepp, 1918</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">1926</xref>). Thus, early views of leaf development were perceived to consist of two growth phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster, 1936</xref>). An early ephemeral phase of cell divisions without cell expansion produces the characteristic 6–10 cell layers of the leaf thickness via submarginal periclinal cell divisions and epidermal anticlinal divisions. This is followed by a later prolonged growth phase where the bulk of two-dimensional lamina growth is produced via a plate meristem in which cell divisions are predominantly anticlinal. Analyses of leaf development in the middle of the 20th century sought to identify patterns of submarginal cell divisions to identify initial cells, but the patterns of cell division were highly variable between species casting doubt on the presence of specific initials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster, 1936</xref>).</p><p>More recently, examination of mitotic indices during leaf development revealed that a higher rate of cell division is observed in submarginal (i.e. plate meristem) regions of the leaf as compared to the margins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maksymowych and Erickson, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchs, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thomasson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubuc-Lebreux and Sattler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jéune, 1981</xref>). Furthermore, sector analysis of leaf development in several eudicot species, including <italic>N. tabacum</italic>, revealed that most clonal sectors were located between the midrib and the margin, with only a minority extending all the way to the margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulieu, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poethig and Sussex, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dolan and Poethig, 1998</xref>), indicating that leaves do not grow from the margins sensu stricto, and calling into question the concept of the leaf marginal meristem. However, noting the overall lack of organized cell division patterns in plants, Hagemann and Gleissberg argued that the defining features of meristems are their organogenetic potential and cytohistological state rather than specific cell division patterns. Thus, in their view the marginal meristem (or ‘blastozone’, as they refer to it) is responsible for primary morphogenetic events, e.g. lamina initiation, but is used up early in leaf development, with most lamina expansion occurring during a later leaf differentiation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hagemann and Gleissberg, 1996</xref>). Although this is a compelling model, evidence for this interpretation has been mainly observational and circumstantial.</p><p>Here we show that removal of multiple growth suppressing transcriptional factors results in indeterminate growth of the margins of all lateral organs, coupled with sustained organogenesis and activity of gene modules shared amongst other plant meristems. Our finding supports the presence of a specific leaf meristem, and conforms to the view stemming from the fossil record that recruitment of suppressors of meristematic activity was critical in seed plant leaf evolution and development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, leaf morphogenesis is initiated at the flanks of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) where leaf primordia develop as flattened lamina with defined abaxial, adaxial and marginal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsukaya, 2013</xref>). Lamina development requires the juxtaposition of abaxial/adaxial polarity factors, including adaxial class III HD-Zip and abaxial KANADI transcription factors. These lie on either side of a narrow middle domain expressing the <italic>WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX</italic> (<italic>WOX</italic>) genes, <italic>PRESSED FLOWER (PRS</italic>) and <italic>WOX1</italic>, and together promote organ growth and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eshed et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf development, expression of growth genes rapidly diminishes distally but can persist proximally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donnelly et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nath et al., 2003</xref>). This proximo-distal differentiation gradient is regulated by CIN-TCP transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nath et al., 2003</xref>). A reduction of five CIN-TCPs targeted by the endogenous microRNA, miR319a (also known as miR-JAW) results in delayed basipetal progression of a mitotic arrest front and increased cell proliferation particularly at leaf margins, producing crinkly and serrated leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Efroni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ori et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palatnik et al., 2003</xref>). Increased distal leaf growth and serrations are also observed when the activities of the four NGA transcription factors are reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trigueros et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2009</xref>). The NGAs and CIN-TCPs are co-expressed at many stages of leaf development, exemplified by the distal expression of <italic>TCP3</italic>, <italic>TCP4</italic>, <italic>NGA1</italic> and <italic>NGA4</italic> in young leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and in contrast to the reported expression of <italic>miR319</italic> at the leaf base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Obayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nag et al., 2009</xref>). This, together with similarities in their loss-of-function phenotypes, suggests shared roles in leaf development. To investigate functional redundancy, we introduced a constitutive expression construct of miR319a (<italic>35S:miR319</italic>) targeting the five <italic>CIN-TCP</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palatnik et al., 2003</xref>) into a quadruple <italic>NGA</italic> mutant (<italic>nga1,2,3,4</italic>) that lacks NGA activities.</p><p>Strikingly, simultaneous reduction in expression of these nine genes resulted in continuous <italic>de novo</italic> formation of tissue at the margins of all lateral organs including cotyledons, leaves and floral organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Indistinguishable phenotypes were observed in plants constitutively expressing both <italic>miR319a</italic> and the previously characterized artificial miRNA <italic>amiR-NGA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2009</xref>), facilitating easier and more extensive characterization of the indeterminate growth phenotype. <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> plants grow more slowly, are later flowering, and their leaf margins harbor proliferative cell populations unlike those of <italic>35S:amiR-NGA</italic> and <italic>35S:miR319a</italic> singly transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>). Application of stain to <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> leaf margins indicates continued proliferation at the leaf margin, with the marker displaced sub-marginally over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D1–D2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The index of dissected, older <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> leaf margins clearly matches that of initiating primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). This result is further supported by the expression of markers that highlight continued cell division, distinguishing epidermal nuclei (<italic>ATML1:H2B-mYFP</italic>), epidermal plasma membrane (<italic>ATML1:mCitrine-RCI2A</italic>), general cell division (<italic>CYCB1;1:GFP</italic>), initiating trichomes (highlighted by <italic>GL2:GFP</italic>) and stomatal lineage proliferation (<italic>TMM:GUS-GFP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), which demonstrate ongoing leaf-primordium-like activity at the leaf margins. In initiating wild-type leaves, auxin flux, marked by PINFORMED1 (PIN1) expression, converges at the distal tip and at serrations, where it inwardly canalizes leaf vascular development, before becoming restricted to proximal margins of older leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilsborough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scarpella et al., 2006</xref>). Compared to wild-type leaves, in both <italic>35S:amiR-NGA</italic> and <italic>35S:miR319a</italic> individual knockdown leaves auxin flux persists longer at distal leaf margins. Strikingly, in the <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> combined knockdown leaves, auxin flux continues around the entire leaf margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). Auxin canalization and ongoing <italic>de novo</italic> vasculature morphogenesis at these margins is marked by expression of the provascular makers <italic>ATHB8</italic> and <italic>MONOPTEROS</italic> (<italic>MP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplements 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">10</xref>). Paralleling marginal auxin flux, the organ marginal markers <italic>PRS and WOX1</italic> are transiently expressed in initiating wild-type leaves before becoming proximally restricted. When NGA or CIN-TCP activities are reduced, <italic>PRS and WOX1</italic> distal expression persists in older leaves whereas in the combined loss in <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> leaves <italic>PRS</italic> and <italic>WOX1</italic> expression occurs in an uninterrupted marginal band, again suggesting that these margins retain meristematic properties equivalent to initiating leaf primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplements 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">12</xref>).</p><p>That expression of <italic>miR319a-amiR-NGA</italic> under control of the <italic>PRS</italic> regulatory sequences results in indeterminate margins confirms that marginal loss of NGA and CIN-TCP activity is sufficient to allow the maintenance of these meristematic characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s13">Figure 1—figure supplement 13)</xref>. Notably the lamina away from the margins of <italic>PRS</italic>&gt;&gt;<italic>miR319a-amiR-NGA</italic> is thinner and more wild-type in appearance than that of <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> leaves suggesting that the broader, non-marginal expression of the <italic>NGA</italic>s and <italic>CIN-TCP</italic>s may reflect an activity in regulating cell expansion that remains functional in <italic>PRS</italic>&gt;&gt;<italic>miR319a-amiR-NGA</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s13">Figure 1—figure supplement 13</xref>).</p><p>The extended maintenance of primordium identity was also observed in the cotyledons of <italic>35S:miR319a nga1,2,3,4</italic> or <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> plants, which continuously produce tissue with leaf characteristics including stellate trichome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s14">Figure 1—figure supplement 14</xref>).

Notably there was no evidence for impaired dormancy of <italic>35S:miR319a nga1,2,3,4</italic> or <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> seed suggesting that the seed-based program of imposed dormancy was as effective on this cotyledon marginal meristem as on the embryonic shoot and root meristems. After germination, cotyledons of <italic>35S:miR319a nga1,2,3,4</italic> or <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> seedlings continue growth and express growth markers unlike wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s14">Figure 1—figure supplements 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s15">15</xref>). The floral organs of NGA and CIN-TCP compromised plants also exhibit prolonged marginal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

This indicates that continued margin growth is independent of CUC-mediated marginal elaboration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Since lamina growth is an outcome of an interaction between adaxial and abaxial factors and involves the marginal leaf WOX genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eshed et al., 2004</xref>), the role of polarity factors and WOX genes in maintaining continued marginal growth was investigated. The respective adaxial, marginal and abaxial genes <italic>PHABULOSA</italic> (<italic>PHB</italic>), <italic>PRS</italic> and <italic>KANADI1</italic> (<italic>KAN1</italic>) are expressed in young, wild-type leaf primordia before diminishing in a basipetal fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C,E,G–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the margins of <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> leaves, <italic>PHB</italic>, <italic>PRS</italic> and <italic>KAN1</italic> gene expression continues indefinitely, with spatial relationships maintained, implying that in older leaves with reduced CIN-TCP and NGA activities, the collective interplay among these genes is sustained as established in initiating wild-type leaf primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test whether adaxial/abaxial tissue polarity and associated WOX activities are required for marginal leaf growth we examined the effects of mutations in these genes on indeterminate marginal growth. Semi-dominant <italic>PHB</italic> alleles produce two leaf types on the same plant: partially radialized leaves with distal lamina and completely radialized (adaxialized) leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). In <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA phb-1d/+</italic> plants, leaves with distal lamina exhibited ectopic marginal growth while radialized leaves did not, demonstrating that ongoing marginal growth first requires the juxtaposition of polarity factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). <italic>PRS</italic> and <italic>WOX1</italic> redundantly promote growth as an output of the abaxial/adaxial polarity program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakata et al., 2012</xref>). The combined loss of NGA and CIN-TCP activities in <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> plants results in both <italic>PRS</italic> and <italic>WOX1</italic> expression occurring as an uninterrupted marginal band in older leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplements 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">12</xref>).

The lack of marginal growth in radialized <italic>phb-1d/+</italic> organs and its ectopic placement at discrete positions of the lamina when the adaxial/abaxial patterning is compromised argues for a major role of the polarity factors in marginal positioning of a leaf meristem that requires the intervening activity of WOX genes. In turn, a negative feedback loop between the marginally restricted meristem and NGA/CIN-TCP activities may lead to the ephemeral nature of this meristem. In agreement, leaves of <italic>FIL:WOX1</italic> that are likely relieved from such feedback regulation, maintained a highly meristematic nature and failed to differentiate and expand when NGA and CIN-TCP activities were jointly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The observation that loss of NGAs and CIN-TCPs results in indeterminate leaf margins suggests that the early wild-type leaf primordium has a meristem that acts during a brief developmental window and that is gradually restricted spatially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with classical morphological and anatomical studies in which the definition of the marginal meristem was extended to include the entire meristematic leaf primordium at very early stages of leaf development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagemann, 1970</xref>). If a leaf primoridum is damaged or bifurcated at this stage, nearly complete regeneration of normal leaf morphology is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goebel, 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figdor, 1906</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Snow and Snow, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sachs, 1969</xref>). Subsequently, as the meristematic regions become restricted to the margins or portions of the margins, damage or bifurcation of the leaf primordium results in progressively more limited regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Snow and Snow, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sachs, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figdor, 1926</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves are argued to possess a basal meristem that remains transiently active after leaf initiation before transitioning to petiole development — a process regulated by the <italic>BLADE-ON-PETIOLE</italic> (<italic>BOP</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hepworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ichihashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuchen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laux et al., 1996</xref>). Our observations are consistent with early distal expression of CIN-TCP and NGA genes repressing the meristem distally, but the lack of early proximal expression allows marginal persistence of the leaf meristem at the leaf base, as reflected by <italic>PRS</italic> expression dynamics and leaf marginal cell differentiation along the proximo-distal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakata et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>).</p><p>Whereas <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves differentiate from tip to base, leaf differentiation in some other angiosperm species can proceed from base to tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trécul 1853</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ikeuchi et al., 2013</xref>). We thus speculate that variations in lateral organ growth within an individual and among species reflect differential maintenance of meristem activity along the marginal and proximo-distal axes. Remarkable diversity in leaf shape can arise from growth variation along the margin including leaf lobing. Lobe formation in many species relies on leaf-specific activity of class 1 KNOX (KNOX1) genes, which the simple leaves of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Piazza et al., 2010</xref>). However, lobes can be mimicked by ectopic KNOX1 expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves. The radialized leaves of <italic>phb-1d/+</italic> plants, a <italic>prs wox1</italic> background and <italic>NGA1</italic> over-expression, all suppresses the KNOX1-induced lobing phenotype, indicating that an active marginal meristem is a prerequisite to respond to KNOX1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus modulation in the marginal restriction of meristem activities can contribute to leaf shape diversity.</p><p>Cotyledons and floral organs are viewed as modified leaves. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, lack of a basally restricted meristem may distinguish them from leaves in their response to reduced CIN-TCPs and NGA activity. In these organs, additional growth is confined to the distal region whereas in leaves the entire margin is affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s14">14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s15">15</xref>). The observation that leaf tissue grows from cotyledon tips suggests a brief activity of a marginal meristem in cotyledons. Prolongation of the marginal meristem activity likely uncouples growth from the embryonic cotyledon program, and therefore, cotyledons continue to grow the same way as leaves.</p><p>How can our observations of a potential continuing meristematic activity at leaf margins be reconciled with classical concepts of marginal and plate meristems in leaves and with the denial of their existence based on mitotic indices and sector analyses? Seed plant leaves evolved from ancestral shoot systems; thus, the shoot apical meristem (SAM) may provide an analogy, or perhaps homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Floyd and Bowman, 2010</xref>). The seed plant SAM exhibits two distinct organizational features. Firstly, SAMs feature a tunica-corpus structure in which cell divisions in the tunica are almost exclusively anticlinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmidt, 1924</xref>). Secondly, the seed plant SAM exhibits cytohistological zonation that is correlated with functional zonation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster, 1938</xref>). The central zone (CZ) exhibits low rates of mitoses and acts to supply cells to the peripheral zone (PZ) and rib zone (RZ) where mitotic activity is high, and organogenesis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steeves and Sussex, 1989</xref>). Consistent with these patterns of cell division, cell lineage analyses of the SAM reveals that the majority of sectors observed do not extend to include the SAM, but rather are presumed to originate in derivatives of the peripheral/rib zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dulieu, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jegla and Sussex, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furner and Pumfrey, 1992</xref>).</p><p>As with SAMs, leaf meristems can also be interpreted to consist of distinct organizational zones. Regions of low and high mitotic activity correspond to the classically defined ‘marginal’ and ‘plate’ meristems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schüepp, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maksymowych and Wochok, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maksymowych and Erickson, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchs, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thomasson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubuc-Lebreux and Sattler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jéune, 1981</xref>). Consistent with these mitotic indices, cell lineage analyses reveal that the majority of sectors produced in developing leaves are derived from regions internal to the margins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulieu, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poethig and Sussex, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dolan and Poethig, 1998</xref>). While marginal activity of the leaf meristem in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> may be brief, we show here that when extended, cells generated at the margins are displaced towards the center of the leaf, displaying a maturation gradient, similar to the PZ and RZ cells displaced from the CZ of the SAM.</p><p>The CZ of the SAM is characterized by the expression of a WOX gene, <italic>WUSCHEL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mayer et al., 1998</xref>). Loss-of-function <italic>WUS</italic> alleles generate a functional SAM, but the CZ fails to be maintained, leading to the eventual depletion of cells in the active PZ and RZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laux et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, the leaf meristem exhibits WOX gene expression, whose function is required for continued leaf growth, but leaves can initiate and grow for a while without marginal WOX expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vandenbussche et al., 2009</xref>). The SAM features a tunica-corpus structure in which cell divisions in the tunica are almost exclusively anticlinal ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmidt, 1924</xref>] and others). As with the SAM, the leaf marginal domain is also organized into epidermal and sub-epidermal layers. Analysis of periclinal chimeras revealed that the epidermal layers of the leaf are clonally related, whereas the mesophyll and vascular bundles are derived from subepidermal layers ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baur, 1909</xref>] and references therein). The lack of differentiation of leaf marginal cells in <italic>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</italic> plants is consistent with these cells remaining meristematic.</p><p>Our results are largely consistent with classical views of leaf development — that the leaf primordium is broadly meristematic at its inception, and that meristematic potential is subsequently restricted to the marginal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hagemann and Gleissberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jéune, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sachs, 1969</xref>). In our view, the marginal and plate meristems represent two zones of a leaf meristem, analogous, or perhaps homologous, to the central and peripheral zones of the SAM.</p><p>We suggest that the marginal restriction of the leaf meristem is in part maintained and guided by the same adaxial and abaxial factors that function in shoot and cambial meristems, and all three meristems are maintained by the activity of different <italic>WOX</italic> paralogs, suggesting the repeated use of a molecular module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aichinger et al., 2012</xref>). Sharing of genetic modules implies either common descent or co-option of modules to pattern novel structures. Since seed plant leaves evolved from ancestral shoot systems, common descent is plausible. In this scenario, the leaf meristem module has been modified from an ancestral shoot meristem module to include the leaf-specific <italic>WOX1 and PRS</italic> paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nardmann and Werr, 2013</xref>) that arose in a common ancestor of seed plants. Additional regulators such as the <italic>YABBY</italic> genes, which are instrumental in lamina growth and restrict activity of SAM factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarojam et al., 2010</xref>), and later acting factors limiting leaf meristem activity (i.e., CIN-TCP and NGA) were integrated into the leaf program. Growth suppressors modulating leaf meristem activity were recruited from genes of both ancient and recent origins — <italic>CIN-TCP</italic> genes are present in all land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Navaud et al., 2007</xref>) whereas <italic>NGA</italic> genes evolved recently, perhaps within seed plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2009</xref>). Thus the leaf marginal meristem genetic program may have been derived via elaboration of an ancestral shoot program, reflecting the derivation of the leaf from a modified shoot. The identification of such genetic framework provides a unification of how the entire seed plant shoot system is built from apical, vascular, cambial, and leaf meristems that are mechanistically similar. The evolution of seed plant leaves from an ancestral shoot system can be interpreted as evolving via the recruitment of regulatory mechanisms to suppress the morphogenetic potential of the leaf meristem.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>For leaf analyses plants were grown under short-day conditions (10 hr light) at 20°C for 15 to 20 days.</p><p>A number of lines for genetic and image analyses were generously provided for use in this study.

For sections, specimens were then washed, dehydrated in an ethanol series, and infiltrated and embedded in LR White resin. 2 µm-thick sections were cut, dried onto slides, and stained with toluidine blue. For SEM, glutaraldehyde-fixed tissues were further fixed in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> before dehydration through a graded ethanol series and critical point dried using liquid CO<sub>2</sub>.

This was cloned downstream of the 35S promoter in pART7 or the array of the lac operator (OP) sequences in a BJ36-derivative plasmid for transactivation. The <italic>35S:amiR-NGA</italic> and OP<italic>:amiR-NGA</italic> constructs used to knockdown expression of all four NGA genes have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2006</xref>). To create expression constructs of the <italic>miR319a-amiR-NGA</italic> di-miR (two miRNAs concatemerized for co-transcription), the 323 bp, <italic>miR319a</italic> encoding fragment was cloned 5’ of the 235 bp <italic>amiR-NGA</italic> gene downstream of the 35S promoter in pART7 or the array of the lac operator (OP) sequences in a BJ36-derived plasmid.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers one of whom, Richard Amasino, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents very interesting data that is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. An understanding of how growth is limited in organs so that they achieve the proper final shape and size is important to both animal and plant developmental biologists and this work is an important advance in achieving that understanding.</p><p>The main issue to consider is whether or not this work does in fact demonstrate the existence of marginal meristems. The framing of the Introduction and other parts of the paper indicate that the data demonstrate the involvement of marginal meristems in leaf development, and that a longstanding issue is now resolved. Clearly there is proliferation at the leaf edges in the mutant-i.e., a marginal meristem-like proliferation can occur in the mutant background. But as noted below in the specific comments of reviewers, you could interpret the data as a broad failure of the mutant to exit an early leaf margin program of development and progress to the next stage of leaf blade development. Is this early leaf margin program of development really a marginal meristem? I.e., is it rigorously established that this early stage of development really has the attributes of a marginal meristem? For example, evidence that a bona fide meristem exists in the mutant situation could be that WOX genes are of central importance for the proliferation phenotype, which would be similar to what we know for root, shoot and cambium. Is the characterization of the prs wox1 double mutants sufficient to show this? There has been a Plant Cell paper on prs wox1 mutants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/content/24/2/519.long">http://www.plantcell.org/content/24/2/519.long</ext-link>); the markers used in this paper are mostly different from the ones in the current paper, and in our view, the authors of the current work do not sufficiently frame their results with respect to phenotypes and conclusions from the Plant Cell paper.</p><p>We think a more balanced discussion of the marginal meristem issue would better serve the readers. Thus, in a revision, the points below ought to be addressed &quot;head on&quot; for the readers even if you choose to disagree with them.</p><p>1) Would it be possible to define what a marginal meristem is, in terms of where the initial (stem) cells are located? The distinction between a &quot;marginal&quot; and &quot;plate&quot; meristems has never been clear to me. The paper implies that cells at apex of the margin are not involved, unlike a shoot tip, but we can't find the evidence suggesting that they are only sub-marginal. In fact, it could be argued that loss of elongated epidermal cells from the margin is consistent with gain of meristem characters here. Similarly, might the contribution of cell layers be affected (e.g., might L1 cells divide periclinally at the margin)?</p><p>2) The evidence against marginal meristems in later stages of leaf development is convincing (e.g., from Poethig &amp; Sussex's clonal analysis in the 1980s). However, some believe they have not been ruled out earlier in development – if you define a marginal meristem in terms of undifferentiated, dividing cells close the margin, then most of a small leaf primordium qualifies. The interpretation is therefore that reducing NGA and CIN-TCP activity reveals the existence of a marginal meristem that is normally transient, that this supports an origin of the leaf from a condensed shoot system and that gain of NGA and CIN-TCP activities might have been involved in the condensation.</p><p>Does reduction in NGA and CIN-TCP activity really reveal a marginal meristem that occurs early in development of a wild-type leaf? We agree that there are similarities in gene expression between a young wild-type primordium and the margins of an older NGA/CIN-TCP-reduced leaf, but does this also extend to cell division and cell morphology (e.g., absence of elongated marginal cells)? Do these morphologies persist towards the base of the wild-type primordium, which retains its meristem-like gene expression for longer than the tip?</p><p>3) Is there really a need to invoke an old concept (marginal meristem) that carries a lot of baggage? Especially since previous evidence indicates there is no persistent marginal meristem that establishes the leaf blade and since this paper doesn't address the existence of a marginal meristem in normal leaf growth. Indeed the continued proliferation of the leaf margins could be interpreted as an inability of the leaf margins to exit the early developmental phase that sets up the earliest outgrowth of the leaf margins and establishes the young leaf blades. Perhaps the Introduction and Conclusions could be presented in the context of either 1) addressing the problem of how organs find their correct final size or 2) what cellular components are required for leaves to progress from the pattern of growth typical of early primordium stage to the pattern of growth that defines the later stage leaf.</p><p>4) The authors find that some, but not all, of the genes involved in shoot apical meristem development also act at the proliferative leaf margins of the tcp nga mutant plants. The incomplete similarity is one of the important findings of this paper. For that reason, we suggest the following change to the Impact statement: &quot;We describe a meristem acting at the margins of leaves, the activity of which requires some of the same, or paralogous, genetic factors as other shoot meristems, but its suppression employs factors acting primarily in leaves and other determinate organs.&quot;</p><p>5) In the absence of a clonal analysis or tracking of cells over time, which would be a big ask, marking cells with nail polish seems to provide good evidence for a marginal meristem. Marked cells appear to displaced internally, implying that growth occurs between them and the margin. Could we have this in the main figures and in more detail (e.g., showing whether some marked cells remain at the margin, consistent with sub-marginal initials and whether the growth separating the marks from the margin involves cell division).</p><p>6) The authors concentrate on development occurring at the leaf margins and this is indeed dramatic. But several of the genes targeted are expressed in leaf domains beyond the margins (e.g. TCP3,4 and NGA1,4). Do non-marginal regions of the leaf display differences in growth or are abnormalities limited to the margins? From some of the images, it appears that the central regions have relatively sparse venation – do NGA and TCP factors promote higher order venation in the central part of the leaf?</p><p>7) It would be good to establish the extent to which genes are knocked down by the artificial microRNAs or natural microRNAs in this study. Are all members of the gene family knocked down to the same extent? It should be relatively easy to do qRT-PCR experiments to answer this. Controls for more distantly related gene family members should be included.</p><p>8) The authors concentrate on development occurring at the leaf margins and this is indeed dramatic.

From some of the images, it appears that the central regions have relatively sparse venation – do NGA and TCP factors promote higher order venation in the central part of the leaf.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15023.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Would it be possible to define what a marginal meristem is, in terms of where the initial (stem) cells are located? The distinction between a &quot;marginal&quot; and &quot;plate&quot; meristems has never been clear to me. The paper implies that cells at apex of the margin are not involved, unlike a shoot tip, but we can't find the evidence suggesting that they are only sub-marginal. In fact, it could be argued that loss of elongated epidermal cells from the margin is consistent with gain of meristem characters here. Similarly, might the contribution of cell layers be affected (e.g., might L1 cells divide periclinally at the margin)?</italic> </p><p>We have extended the Introduction and Discussion sections to include more detailed descriptions of the literature. Much of point 1 is discussed in the literature of the middle of last century, whereby a marginal meristem was defined as including both epidermal cells that divide only anticlinally (an thus producing only abaxial and adaxial epidermis), and sub- epidermal (sub-marginal) cells that divide both anticlinally and periclinally (producing all internal cell layers). The marginal meristem was thought to be restricted to only a few cells at the margin. The loss of differentiated marginal epidermal cells in the NGA/TCP loss-of- function lines is consistent with this view. The plate meristem was defined as being proximal to the margin, extending over a much larger spatial area than the marginal meristem.</p><p>In our revised version we argue that leaf primordia as a whole are made of a leaf meristem. This is clearly evident in anatomical sections as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We next argue that gradual differentiation imposed by leaf specific programs acts to spatially restrict this meristem to marginal and basal domain. Thus, the marginal leaf meristem does not represent a unique identity, but rather a specific stage during leaf development that can last for different periods in different plants as extensively described by Hagemann and Gleisberg in 1996.</p><p>We also argue that the leaf meristem is maintained and defined by WOX gene expression. In the NGA/TCP loss-of-function lines, this meristem continues unabated for the life of the plant, but in wild-type plants it is shut down early. Just as in the SAM or root, loss-of-function of the WOX genes results not in a complete loss of growth, but a failure to maintain a pluripotent stem cell population, e.g. wuschel mutants produce a few leaves but the failure to maintain a central zone results in an eventual loss of production of organs from the SAM. In the leaf, loss of wox1 and prs results in an analogous phenotype — production of a bit of leaf tissue but a failure to maintain continued marginal growth. Thus, prs wox1 mutations are epistatic to the NGA/TCP loss-of-function alleles. Further evidence of the role of these marginal cells comes from an experiment whereby the dimiR-NGA/TCP was driven with the PRS regulatory sequences, which also results in indeterminate meristematic growth at the leaf margin. While a major caveat may include inherent feedbacks, this experiment does suggest that the repression of WOX gene expression at the leaf margin is critical for whole leaf differentiation. Given our knowledge of hormone production in leaf margins, particularly auxin, this observation is not surprising.</p><p><italic>2) The evidence against marginal meristems in later stages of leaf development is convincing (e.g., from Poethig &amp; Sussex's clonal analysis in the 1980s). However, some believe they have not been ruled out earlier in development – if you define a marginal meristem in terms of undifferentiated, dividing cells close the margin, then most of a small leaf primordium qualifies. The interpretation is therefore that reducing NGA and CIN-TCP activity reveals the existence of a marginal meristem that is normally transient, that this supports an origin of the leaf from a condensed shoot system and that gain of NGA and CIN-TCP activities might have been involved in the condensation.</italic> </p><p>These statements are in accordance to the literature, e.g. that nearly the entire leaf primordium at an early stage is meristematic. This idea is further supported by classical experiments on the effects of surgical leaf primordia dissection at different stages, a discussion of which can be found in the modified Discussion. This is exactly the idea we were attempting to portray in our original paper, but it was perhaps too cryptic. We do hope that the new version makes our point clearer.</p><p><italic>Does reduction in NGA and CIN-TCP activity really reveal a marginal meristem that occurs early in development of a wild-type leaf? We agree that there are similarities in gene expression between a young wild-type primordium and the margins of an older NGA/CIN-TCP-reduced leaf, but does this also extend to cell division and cell morphology (e.g., absence of elongated marginal cells)? Do these morphologies persist towards the base of the wild-type primordium, which retains its meristem-like gene expression for longer than the tip?</italic> </p><p>We have included additional observations that support the idea that the leaf marginal cells in NGA/TCP loss-of-function alleles resemble at the morphological and anatomical levels that cells at the margins of wild-type leaf primordia. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) Is there really a need to invoke an old concept (marginal meristem) that carries a lot of baggage? Especially since previous evidence indicates there is no persistent marginal meristem that establishes the leaf blade and since this paper doesn't address the existence of a marginal meristem in normal leaf growth. Indeed the continued proliferation of the leaf margins could be interpreted as an inability of the leaf margins to exit the early developmental phase that sets up the earliest outgrowth of the leaf margins and establishes the young leaf blades. Perhaps the Introduction and Conclusions could be presented in the context of either 1) addressing the problem of how organs find their correct final size or 2) what cellular components are required for leaves to progress from the pattern of growth typical of early primordium stage to the pattern of growth that defines the later stage leaf.</italic> </p><p>This appears to be a matter of semantics, whether one calls the meristematic activity at the margins of early wild-type leaf primordia and which continues in NGA/TCP loss-of-function allele a marginal meristem or rather early leaf meristematic activity that continues at the margins in NGA/TCP loss-of-function alleles. We would argue this amount to the same thing, if one accepts that the early leaf primordium is meristematic, especially at its margin.</p><p>We are not sure how our work (1) addresses how organs contribute to the correct final size, as this is a combination of both meristematic activity and cell enlargement. We only wish to state that local continued proliferation can contribute to leaf form, and that the temporal and spatial shutting down on the meristematic margin could be one mechanism by which leaf shape is sculpted. We are also not sure how our work relates to the identification of (2) cellular components that are required for leaves to progress from the pattern of growth typical of early primordium stage to the pattern of growth that defines the later stage leaf.</p><p>Does this mean what causes cells to differentiate once displaced from the meristem? If so, neither NGA nor TCP are required for this as cells displaced from the meristematic margin in the NGA/TCP loss-of-function alleles gradually differentiate into regular leaf tissues.</p><p><italic>4) The authors find that some, but not all, of the genes involved in shoot apical meristem development also act at the proliferative leaf margins of the tcp nga mutant plants. The incomplete similarity is one of the important findings of this paper. For that reason, we suggest the following change to the Impact statement: &quot;We describe a meristem acting at the margins of leaves, the activity of which requires some of the same, or paralogous, genetic factors as other shoot meristems, but its suppression employs factors acting primarily in leaves and other determinate organs.&quot;</italic> </p><p>This has been altered to reflect the suggestion of the reviewers. Our idea is that, since leaves evolved from shoot systems, similar molecular mechanisms may be involved in their potentials</p><p>“they could either share genetic components, or use paralogous components, or in some cases dispense with certain factors.”</p><p><italic>5) In the absence of a clonal analysis or tracking of cells over time, which would be a big ask, marking cells with nail polish seems to provide good evidence for a marginal meristem. Marked cells appear to displaced internally, implying that growth occurs between them and the margin. Could we have this in the main figures and in more detail (e.g., showing whether some marked cells remain at the margin, consistent with sub-marginal initials and whether the growth separating the marks from the margin involves cell division).</italic> </p><p>We have moved these experimental results to the main text, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. One problem with the proposed experiments is the expectation suggested. The central zone of the shoot apical meristem has been described as a permanent office with no permanent workers (Newman 1965), and there is no reason to suspect that the meristematic region at the leaf margin is any different. Thus, even if the experiment was feasible, we might not expect any markers, e.g. carbon particles, to reside continually at the margin. A clonal analysis experiment in the NGA/TCP loss-of-function background could provide some insight, but we consider this to be beyond the scope of this work.</p><p><italic>6) The authors concentrate on development occurring at the leaf margins and this is indeed dramatic. But several of the genes targeted are expressed in leaf domains beyond the margins (e.g. TCP3,4 and NGA1,4). Do non-marginal regions of the leaf display differences in growth or are abnormalities limited to the margins? From some of the images, it appears that the central regions have relatively sparse venation – do NGA and TCP factors promote higher order venation in the central part of the leaf?</italic> </p><p>While we have concentrated on the marginal aspects of growth and differentiation, the observation that both NGA and TCP are broadly expressed in developing leaves suggests a function in regions of the leaf that are undergoing differentiation. In an attempt to separate the marginal function from other potential functions, the dimiR-NGA/TCP was driven with the PRS regulatory sequences. Comparisons of sections of these leaves with those from the more constitutively expressed dimiR reveal effects on cell expansion that appear independent from the phenotype of indeterminate growth — this data has been added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s13">Figure 1—figure supplement 13</xref>.</p><p>Concerning possible differences vasculature development and ATHB8 expression (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> 1 K, L; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M,N</xref>; old supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> sup 7 new supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> sup 10). We reevaluated vascular development using MP/ARF5:GFP as a provascular marker as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>. These data do not suggest a significant difference in older, more internal lamina tissues of 35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA versus wild-type leaves per se. However, it does appear that in 35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA leaves the midrib, which is not vascularised apart from the midvein, is considerably enlarged. This gives the impression of a larger internal region without vascular expression of either ATHB8: GUS or MP/ARF5:GFP. Also there is a tendency for the cleared, highly curled 35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA leaves to tear when being flattened for examination that can open the leaf up internally and further the impression of limited vascular marker expression.</p><p><italic>7) It would be good to establish the extent to which genes are knocked down by the artificial microRNAs or natural microRNAs in this study. Are all members of the gene family knocked down to the same extent? It should be relatively easy to do qRT-PCR experiments to answer this. Controls for more distantly related gene family members should be included.</italic> </p><p>Relevant data has been added as a data source file (file 4). It is also noted that the 35S:miR- NGA exhibits a phenotype indistinguishable from that of the nga1,2,3,4 quadruple mutant.</p><p><italic>8) The authors concentrate on development occurring at the leaf margins and this is indeed dramatic.
