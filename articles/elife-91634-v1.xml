crucial for optimal brain function. Our study focused on a neuroblast (NB) lineage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> known as Lin A/15, which generates motoneurons (MNs) and glia. Intriguingly, Lin A/15 NB dedicates 40% of its time to producing immature MNs (iMNs) that are subsequently eliminated through apoptosis. Two RNA-binding proteins, Imp and Syp, play crucial roles in this process. Imp+ MNs survive, while Imp−, Syp+ MNs undergo apoptosis. Genetic experiments show that Imp promotes survival, whereas Syp promotes cell death in iMNs. Late-born MNs, which fail to express a functional code of transcription factors (mTFs) that control their morphological fate, are subject to elimination. Manipulating the expression of Imp and Syp in Lin A/15 NB and progeny leads to a shift of TF code in late-born MNs toward that of early-born MNs, and their survival. Additionally, introducing the TF code of early-born MNs into late-born MNs also promoted their survival. These findings demonstrate that the differential expression of Imp and Syp in iMNs links precise neuronal generation and distinct identities through the regulation of mTFs. Both Imp and Syp are conserved in vertebrates, suggesting that they play a fundamental role in precise neurogenesis across species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motoneuron</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding proteins</kwd><kwd>programmed cell death</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE16-0007 DevandMaintain</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enriquez</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-21-ESRE-00016 Spatial-Cell-ID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enriquez</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nie</surname><given-names>Ziyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013465</institution-id><institution>AFM Téléthon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AFM (#21999)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enriquez</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic manipulations reveal how the spatiotemporal expression pattern of two RNA-binding proteins regulates the eventual number of motoneurons in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuronal lineage.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The central nervous system (CNS) receives information from the periphery, records and processes it to control different types of behavior such as communication or locomotion. This complex system relies on a network of neurons and glial cells, primarily generated during development by neuronal stem cells, to fulfill these functions. Each neuronal stem cell produces a specific number of neurons and glia with diverse identities at the appropriate time and location. The precise regulation of this process is essential, as any disruption in the molecular machinery controlling it can result in severe brain disorders or cancers. Notably, alterations in adult neurogenesis in humans can contribute to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahar et al., 2014</xref>) and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hazlett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wegiel et al., 2010</xref>) or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallardo, 2019</xref>). Disruptions in neurodevelopmental programs are often observed in brain tumors, and tumors that arise in early childhood may be attributed to a dysregulation in the molecular machinery governing the termination of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jessa et al., 2019</xref>). Elucidating the precise mechanisms that regulate the appropriate number of neuronal and glial cells is not only crucial for understanding biological system development and the origins of human diseases, but also for unraveling the evolution of the CNS’s architecture and function. Recent studies in insects have indicated that variations in the number of neurons contribute to changes in neuronal circuits and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pop et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prieto-Godino et al., 2020</xref>). In our research using <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have identified a novel mechanism involved in controlling the accurate production of neurons during development.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, adult neurons and glia are mostly produced during larval and pupal stages by stem cells called neuroblast (NB). Similar to vertebrates, NBs undergo asymmetric divisions to self-renew and generate neuronal and glial progenies either directly or indirectly. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, two major types of NBs are responsible for producing the majority of adult neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harding and White, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Homem et al., 2015</xref>). Type I NBs generate ganglion mother cells (GMCs) that divide once to produce neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doe et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karcavich and Doe, 2005</xref>) while type II NBs generate intermediate neuronal progenitors that undergo multiple divisions to generate glia and/or neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Homem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). Under normal conditions, each NB in <italic>Drosophila</italic> produces a consistent number of mature neurons, although this number can vary between different NBs. The precise generation of a stereotypical number of progenies depends on three key parameters: the speed of NB division, the timing of NB neurogenesis termination, and programmed cell death (PCD) during the asymmetric division of GMCs. Various molecular mechanisms have been identified to regulate these parameters.</p><p>Most type I and II NBs end neurogenesis during the early pupal stages either by accumulating the transcription factor (TF) Prospero, triggering symmetrical division and resulting in two postmitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>) or through a combination of autophagy and PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>). Prior to the termination of neurogenesis, all NBs experience a decrease in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). The reduction in size of NBs ending neurogenesis early in pupal stages is linked to a metabolic switch that enhances oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a terminal differentiation division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homem et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, the decrease in size observed in NBs terminating neurogenesis later, such as mushroom body NBs, correlates with a reduction in the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which acts as an autophagy inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>). The process of terminating NB neurogenesis through autophagic cell death or terminal differentiation is commonly referred to as decommissioning. The temporal control of decommissioning is influenced by extrinsic signals like the steroid hormone ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>) and as well as an intrinsic program characterized by the sequential expression of temporal RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) such as Imp (insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding proteins) and Syp (Syncrip) expressed in opposite temporal gradients within the NB, or through a temporal cascade of TFs. For instance, mushroom body NBs decommission during the late pupal stage due to a prolonged expression of Imp compared to other NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). In the ventral nerve cord (VNC, analogous to our spinal cord), the timing of NB decommissioning is determined by temporal TFs, leading to apoptosis in type II NBs or terminal division in type 1 NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). Lastly, the decommissioning of NBs is also spatially regulated by spatial selectors such as Hox genes. For example, NB5-6 in thoracic segments produces a greater number of neurons compared to NB5-6 in the abdomen, due to the absence of abdominal Hox genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karlsson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The rate of NB division is a molecularly controlled parameter that can influence the number of cells generated by a lineage. On average, NB divisions in larvae occur at a speed of approximately 80–90 min per division. However, this speed varies among different NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hailstone et al., 2020</xref>). The heterogeneity in NB division speed appears to be regulated by the opposing temporal gradients of Imp and Syp within the NB. Imp promotes high-speed division by stabilizing <italic>myc</italic> RNA and increasing Myc protein levels, while Syp has an inhibitory effect on NB division speed by directly inhibiting Imp as development progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Samuels et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, PCD after asymmetric division of the GMC acts as another influential factor in shaping the final clonal size of each lineage. Between 40% and 50% of hemi-lineages derived from type I NBs undergo PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Truman et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, when PCD is blocked in the midline NBs of the VNC, the ‘undead’ neurons differentiate and form complex and functional arborizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pop et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated how variation in PCD patterns between different insect species could change their behavior suggesting that probably all mechanisms controlling the number of neurons potentially play a role during the behavior evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pop et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prieto-Godino et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The diverse characteristics of neural stem cells (NBs), such as their proliferation termination, proliferation rate, and the generation of a GMC producing a dying cells by asymmetric division, may account for the varying number of neurons produced by individual NBs. Here, we have discovered that the fate of immature neurons also plays a crucial role in shaping the final number of neurons produced by a single stem cell.</p><p>In this study, we investigated a specific <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage known as Lin A (also called Lin 15), which gives rise to 29 adult motoneurons (MNs) per ganglion, responsible for innervating leg muscles during the adult stage. This lineage also produces most of the astrocytes and ensheathing glia of the thoracic ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baek and Mann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brierley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enriquez et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B4</xref>). The process of division in Lin A/15 NB during larval stages follows a particular pattern termed type Ib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–G</xref>). Initially, Lin A/15 NB generates intermediate mother cells (IMCs) that give rise to a postmitotic cell and a proliferative glioblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Subsequently, during a second phase, Lin A/15 switches to a classical type I division mode, producing only postmitotic MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enriquez et al., 2018</xref>). As development progresses, an adult Lin A/15 consists of a predetermined number of MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, during larval stages, Lin A/15 NB produces an excess of neurons, which are selectively eliminated before reaching the adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lin A/15 as model to study how a stereotyped number of neurons is produced by an NB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Drawing of an adult ﬂy showing the position of the central nervous system (CNS) (white (cortex), blue (neuropiles)) and Lin A/15 leg MNs (green cell bodies and dendrites in the VNC and axons in the legs).

This mode of division continues until the decommissioning of Lin A/15 NB by PCD, resulting in the production of supernumerary MNs. The excess MNs are then precisely and progressively eliminated by PCD from early pupal stages until the end of Lin A/15 neurogenesis, eventually reaching the final number of 29 MNs. Both the decommissioned Lin A/15 NB and the MNs eliminated by PCD are characterized by being Imp− and Syp+. Through genetic manipulations, we discovered that altering the temporal and spatial expression patterns of Imp and Syp can change the timing of NB decommissioning and the number of immature MNs (iMNs) that survive.</p><p>Further analysis of the expression patterns of various TFs published on our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guan et al., 2022c</xref>), using the computational tool PCCD 2.0, revealed that the last-born MNs exhibit a distinct set of TFs compared to the first-born MNs. Moreover, we found that changes in the expression levels of Imp and Syp directly affect the expression of at least three TFs: Nvy, Jim, and RunxA. Overexpression of Imp or knocking down Syp induces Jim expression and downregulates RunxA and Nvy in the last-born surviving MNs. This regulation of TF codes by Imp and Syp occurs at least in MNs 29–34. Notably, the new set of TFs induced in the last-born MNs closely resembles the TF code seen in earlier-born MNs (MNs 16–24). To further validate our findings, we genetically imposed a code found in young MNs (MNs 16–24) onto the surviving last-born MNs by overexpressing Jim and suppressing Nvy function.

Unlike in larval stages, we detected Elav+ cDcp1+ neurons close to the NB, indicating that the last-born Elav+ neurons are progressively eliminated by apoptosis from 0 to 24 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A1–C3</xref>). To further confirm that the last-born MNs are eliminated by PCD, we fed L3 larvae with 5-ethynyl-2′deoxyuridine (Edu) to label only the late-born MNs and dissected the CNS at early pupal stage (5 hr APF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D1–D7</xref>).

Further dissection of CNSs at late pupal stage (17 hr APF) showed a significant decrease in the number of Elav+ Edu+ MNs (<italic>N</italic> = 2, SD = 2, number of Edu+ MNs at 17 hr APF), confirming the progressive elimination of all these late-born MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D1–F</xref>). Both results indicate that the last-born MNs undergo PCD during pupal stages.</p><p>To confirm that the supernumerary MNs are eliminated by PCD, we conducted an experiment to inhibit apoptosis in MNs by ectopically expressing the antiapoptotic gene P35. For this purpose, we employed the MARCM technique with the <italic>VGlut-Gal4</italic> (also known as OK371-Gal4) enhancer trap driver to express P35 specifically in the supernumerary immature neurons. It is important to note that this driver is exclusively expressed in Lin A/15 Elav+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Consequently, the expression of VGlut&gt;P35 is expected to fail in inhibiting apoptosis in the Elav− cells eliminated by PCD after the GMC division (Lin A/15 hemi-lineage). However, it should effectively inhibit apoptosis in the last-born Elav+ MNs during the pupal stage. As anticipated with this genetic manipulation, we observed similar numbers of neurons produced in L3 larvae in the Lin A/15 MARCM clone expressing P35 compared to the WT Lin A/15, while more Lin A MNs survived into adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–J</xref>).

Knocking down Imp in Lin A/15 resulted in premature PCD of Elav+ MNs during larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C1–D3</xref>) and an increase in the number of Elav+ neurons eliminated by PCD during pupal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B1</xref>). Conversely, by prolonging the expression of Imp or knocking down Syp in Lin A/15 NB and its progeny, we were able to inhibit PCD of the supernumerary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B2, E1–J3</xref>). These genetic experiments, which manipulated the levels of Imp and Syp in the NB and its postmitotic progeny, led to changes in the final number of neurons produced by Lin A/15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>) by altering the timing of NB decommissioning and the pattern of PCD in postmitotic neurons. The modulation of PCD pattern in postmitotic neurons by Imp and Syp could result from an autonomous function in postmitotic MNs or a change in the temporal identity of Lin A/15 NB. To separate their functions in the NB and MNs, we ectopically expressed Imp in postmitotic neurons, including the supernumerary MNs, without affecting its expression in Lin A/15 NB, using the MARCM technique with the <italic>VGlut-Gal4</italic> enhancer trap driver. Under this experimental condition, more Lin A MNs were maintained in adult flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L1–N</xref>), implying a cell-autonomous function of Imp in promoting cell survival of MNs.

Using our genetic tool to trace a single lineage, we demonstrated that altering the timing of neural stem cell decommissioning changes the number of neurons generated from that stem cell. We found that two intrinsic temporal factors, Imp and Syp, actively participate in defining the final clonal size of a lineage by signaling the timely apoptosis of NBs. Previous research has indicated that both intrinsic mechanisms and external cues control the expression pattern of Imp and Syp in brain NBs. In some brain lineages, Imp and Syp cross-repress each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Syed et al., 2017</xref>), and this cross-repression is influenced by external cues such as the ecdysone hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homem et al., 2014</xref>) or activins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rossi and Desplan, 2020</xref>). However, in Lin A/15 NB, we observed that there is no mutual inhibition between Imp and Syp, suggesting that Imp/Syp-independent mechanisms regulate their sequential expression in Lin A/15 NB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, our investigation of a single neuronal lineage revealed that the opposite expression pattern of Imp and Syp in postmitotic neurons is also important in determining lineage size by regulating PCD. The opposite expression levels of Imp and Syp in iMNs correlate with their temporal expression in the NB: first-born neurons express high levels of Imp, while last-born neurons express high levels of Syp. Interestingly, both Imp and Syp are actively expressed in iMNs, indicating that their expression in these neurons is not simply a consequence of their expression in the NB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guan et al., 2022c</xref>).</p><p>We question whether iMNs maintain their Imp/Syp expression by inheriting determinants from the NB. If so, are these determinants directly influencing Imp/Syp expression, or do they give MNs the capacity to respond to external cues, such as the ecdysone hormone? Based on our hypothesis, we propose that postmitotic MNs, similar to their state in the NB, retain the ability to respond to external cues, which could explain why MNs are eliminated during early pupal stages when ecdysone is highly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Warren et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Imp and Syp, highly versatile RBPs in specifying neuronal identity and lineage sizes</title><p>Imp and Syp are versatile proteins that play roles in various aspects of NB development. Their opposite temporal expression in brain NBs controls the temporal identity of the NB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Syed et al., 2017</xref>), the timing of NB decommissioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), and the speed of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Samuels et al., 2020</xref>). In the brain, their opposing temporal expression in mushroom body NBs shapes the expression pattern of the Chinmo TF, which, in turn, determines the identity of the neuronal progeny based on its concentration.</p><p>Additionally, Imp and Syp appear to regulate the expression of terminal selector genes. Originally defined in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, terminal selectors are TFs that maintain the expression of proteins crucial for neuron function, such as neurotransmitters or neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eade et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hobert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hobert, 2016</xref>). In the mushroom body, Imp and Syp shape the terminal molecular features by regulating the terminal selector Mamo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We have recently revealed that Imp and Syp not only control the morphology of Lin A/15 MNs by determining the temporal identity of the NB but also by shaping a combination of mTFs in postmitotic MNs, which subsequently control their morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guan et al., 2022c</xref>). Here, we show that MNs eliminated by PCD during metamorphosis express a different combination of TFs compared to surviving MNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that changing the opposite expression of Imp and Syp in Lin A/15 alters the TF code not only in the surviving MNs but also in the MNs eliminated by apoptosis. These MNs adopt a TF code similar to that of MNs that survive, suggesting that the regulation of PCD in iMNs by Imp and Syp is dependent on TFs. To test this hypothesis, we changed the TF code without affecting Imp/Syp expression and were able to prevent the elimination of the last-born MNs. Taken together, all these data highlight that both RBPs control two parameters in postmitotic neurons: neuronal diversity and neuronal survival. These two parameters are directly coordinated through the regulation of TFs by Imp and Syp.</p><p>The question of why an excess of MNs is produced and why neurons undergo PCD during development is a fundamental one in neurodevelopment. PCD is observed in various animal models studied in laboratories, from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to vertebrates, and several explanations have been proposed to understand why such mechanisms have been selected during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oppenheim, 1991</xref>). The widespread occurrence of PCD during neurodevelopment leads to an intriguing hypothesis that neurons normally fated to die represent an important reservoir that can be used during evolution to explore different morphological possibilities. In this scenario, different mTF codes can be tested without affecting the axon–muscle connectome, allowing for the exploration of various combinations of mTFs until a functional combination is selected. This process may contribute to the diversification of neuronal morphologies and functions, ultimately shaping the complexity of the nervous system during evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Imp/Syp proteins in development and disease</title><p>Imp and Syp are evolutionarily conserved, both homologs are highly expressed in the developing mouse brain and play vital roles in neural development, suggesting a fundamental conservation of their function in the development of central nervous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mori et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams et al., 2016</xref>). For example, Imp1, one of the three mouse orthologs of Imp family, is highly expressed in young neuronal progenitors. Its temporal expression with other RBP partners changes the temporal identity of the neuronal stem cells. In particular Imp promotes the self-renewal state of neuronal stem cells while inhibiting differentiation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, any dysregulation of the machinery controlling neuronal stem cell physiology can have dramatic consequences.

The filtered stacks are then thresholded to disregard remaining background noise. In order to choose an optimal threshold, all possible thresholds are computed. The thresholds were always chosen manually and close to the plateau. A ‘check File stack’ for each cell was generated in order to visualize the accuracy of the spot detection for a given threshold. In most of our samples, common thresholds were chosen for all the samples of a time point. However, specific threshold were occasionally chosen to give the best visual detection of mRNA spots in our datasets check files.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>PCCD method</title><p>The PCCD method, as described in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guan et al., 2022c</xref>), aims to link the expression of a given TF to the birth order of an iMN by using the correlation between the birth order of iMNs and their spatial organization. In our Lin A/15 model, the EdU experiments reveal a good correlation between the birth order of iMNs and their spatial distance from the NB in third instar larvae: young born iMNs are farther away from the NB compared to older iMNs. The final goal of this method is to predict the TF code expression pattern in each iMN in a third instar larva.</p><p>The method followed a series of steps:</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Step 1</title><p>From the imaging, assign spatial <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic> coordinates and the expression (on/off) of a given TF to each Lin A/15 cell (<italic>N</italic> &gt; 15, number of Lin A/15 immunostained for a given TF).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Step 2</title><p>Calculate the Euclidean distance between the NB and the <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic> coordinates of each iMN (relative distance).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Step 3</title><p>Order iMNs in each Lin A/15 according to their distance to NB.

Global means that at each position <italic>i</italic>, the observed number of positive cells <italic>Pi</italic> will be normalized by the total number <italic>N</italic> of observed sequences for this TF. Thus, the frequency at rank <italic>i</italic> is defined as <italic>Pi</italic>/<italic>N</italic>. In contrast in the relative definition of frequencies, at each position <italic>i</italic>, the frequency is determined by the number of positive cells <italic>Pi</italic> divided by the number of sequences <italic>Ni</italic> for which this position has been measured, leading to a frequency at rank <italic>i</italic> defined as <italic>Pi</italic>/<italic>Ni</italic>. The relative measure avoids bias that possibly arises in the global method by considering as negative (by default) cells that are not observed in sequences that are too short to reach this index. In the sequel, we use this relative frequency histogram to limit such bias as much as possible.</p><p>Savitzky–Golay filter (Step 4): The Savitzky–Golay algorithm (polynomial filter) was set with a window of size 11 and a polynomial order of 3 (see scipy.signal.savgol_filter function from the scipy python library).</p><p>Peak detection method (Step 5): Peaks were detected as local maxima in the normalized TF distributions. Local maxima were determined according to local conditions. They had a minimal height (h_min = 0.2), a minimal distance from other peaks (d_min = 8), and a minimal prominence (p_min = 0.07). The prominence of a peak measures how much a peak is emerging clearly locally in the signal. It is defined as the vertical distance between the peak and the altitude of the largest region it dominates. These values were found to yield best peak interpretations over the whole set of TFs, in particular to detect multiple peaks in TF distributions such as RunxA. We used the function scipy.signal.find_peaks of the scipy library. In addition to the location of the different peaks <italic>p</italic> in the signal, the whole range of <italic>x</italic> values (i.e. the <italic>x</italic> axis) is split in intervals [<italic>ip</italic>,<italic>jp</italic>] where each peak is prevailing. Cells contributing to peak <italic>p</italic> can thus only be found in the interval [<italic>ip</italic>,<italic>jp</italic>] for each peak <italic>p</italic>.</p><p>Positive cell clusters (Step 5): For each TF, the average number ‘<italic>n</italic>’ of positive cells was computed in each Lin A/15 iMN observed Cluster corresponding to a detected peak <italic>p</italic> (using the span [<italic>ip</italic>,<italic>jp</italic>] as described above). The procedure varied according to whether only one peak was detected or more than one multiple peaks can be detected depending on the nature of the data and the parameters defining peaks (see above).</p><p>Case of a single detected peak (e.g. Jim): The span [<italic>ip</italic>′,<italic>jp</italic>′] of the active cells under the peak <italic>p</italic> was computed within the span [<italic>ip</italic>,<italic>jp</italic>] by finding the horizontal span under the peak that extends exactly over <italic>n</italic> cells (green lines on the figures). This cluster [<italic>ip</italic>′,<italic>jp′</italic>] of positive cells was assumed to correspond to all the cells expressing the TF.</p><p>Case of multiple detected peaks (e.g. Nvy (2 peaks) or RunxA (2 peaks)): The sequence was split into the regions [<italic>ip</italic>,<italic>jp</italic>] defined by each peak. Then the average number of positive cells ‘<italic>n</italic>1’, ‘<italic>n</italic>2’, …, are computed for each of the peak regions. Then the method proceeds within each region and its average number of positive cells as in the case of a single detected peak. This determines both the estimated length and the position of multiple positive cell clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Materials availability</title><p>All fly stocks used in this study are available from the corresponding author without restriction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>smFISH primary probe sequences for <italic>Imp</italic>, <italic>Syp</italic>, and <italic>Dpn.</italic></title><p>Sequences of the primary probes recognizing exonal sequences of <italic>Imp</italic>, <italic>Syp</italic>, and <italic>Dpn</italic>, designed using the Biosearch Technologies stellaris RNA FISH probe designer tool (free with registration, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biosearchtech.com">https://biosearchtech.com</ext-link>).</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-91634-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-91634-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data are available within the article and its supplementary information.

The focus of the experiments are two well-studied RNA-binding proteins: Imp and Syp. The Authors find that these factors play an important role in determining the number of neurons in their preferred model system of VNC motor neurons coming from a single lineage (LinA/15) by separate functions taking place at specific stages of development of this lineage: influencing the life-span of the LinA neuroblast to control its timely decommissioning and functioning in the Late-born post-mitotic neurons to influence cell death after the appropriate number of progeny is generated. The post-mitotic role of Imp/Syp in regulating programmed-cell death (PCD) is also correlated with a specific code of key transcription factors that are suspected to influence neuronal identity, linking the fate of neuronal survival with its specification. This paper addresses a wide scope of phenotypes related to the same factors, thus providing an intriguing demonstration of how the nervous system is constructed by context-specific changes in key developmental regulators. The bulk of conclusions drawn by the authors are supported by careful experimental evidence, and the findings are a useful addition to an important topic in developmental neuroscience.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91634.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study by Guan and co-workers focuses on a model neuronal lineage in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system, revealing interesting aspects about: (a) the generation of supernumerary cells, later destined for apoptosis; and, (b) new insights into the mechanisms that regulate this process. The two RNA-binding proteins, Imp and Syp, are shown to be expressed in temporally largely complementary patterns, their expression defining early vs later born neurons in this lineage, and thus also regulating the apoptotic elimination. Moreover, neuronal 'fate' transcription factors that are downstream of Imp and signatures of early-born neurons, can also be sufficient to convert later born cells to an earlier 'fate', including survival. The authors provide solid evidence for most of their statements, including the temporal windows during which the early and the later-born motoneurons are generated by this model lineage, how this relates to patterns of cell death by apoptosis and that mis-expression of early-born transcription factors in later-born cells can be sufficient to block apoptosis (part of, and perhaps indicative of the late-born identity). Other studies have previously outlined analogous, mutually antagonistic roles for Imp and Syp during nervous system development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in different parts and at different stages, with which the working model of this study aligns. Overall, this study adds to and extends current working models and evidence on the developmental mechanisms that underlie temporal cell fate decisions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91634.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Enriquez</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Génomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon, UMR5242, Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Université Claude Bernard-Lyon 1</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Wenyue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Génomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon, UMR5242, Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Université Claude Bernard-Lyon 1</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nie</surname><given-names>Ziyan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Génomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon, UMR5242, Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Université Claude Bernard-Lyon 1</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Laurençon</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Génomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon, UMR5242, Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Université Claude Bernard-Lyon 1</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bouchet</surname><given-names>Mathilde</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Génomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon, ENS de Lyon</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Godin</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Laboratoire Reproduction et Développement des Plantes, ENS de Lyon</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kabir</surname><given-names>Chérif</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Génomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon, UMR5242, Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Université Claude Bernard-Lyon 1</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Darnas</surname><given-names>Aurelien</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Génomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon, ENS de Lyon</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This study addresses the temporal patterning of a specific <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS neuroblast lineage, focusing on its larval development.

We address temporal patterning during larval and pupal stages until the adult stage. The Imp and Syp genes change the fate of one daughter cell/branch from survival to programmed cell death (PCD). The change from glioblast (GB) to PCD, which occurs at an early time point, is not addressed here. The main point of the paper is missing:</p><p>• Last-born MNs undergo apoptosis due to their failure to express a functional TF code, and this code is post-transcriptionally regulated by the opposite expression of Imp and Syp in immature MNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Guan and colleagues address the question of how a single neuroblast produces a defined number of progeny, and what influences its decommissioning. The focus of the experiments are two well-studied RNA-binding proteins: Imp and Syp. The Authors find that these factors play an important role in determining the number of neurons in their preferred model system of VNC motor neurons coming from a single lineage (LinA/15) by separate functions taking place at specific stages of development of this lineage: influencing the life-span of the LinA neuroblast to control its timely decommissioning and functioning in the Late-born post-mitotic neurons to influence cell death after the appropriate number of progeny is generated. The post-mitotic role of Imp/Syp in regulating programmed-cell death (PCD) is also correlated with a specific code of key transcription factors that are suspected to influence neuronal identity, linking the fate of neuronal survival with its specification. This paper addresses a wide scope of phenotypes related to the same factors, thus providing an intriguing demonstration of how the nervous system is constructed by context-specific changes in key developmental regulators.</p><p>The bulk of conclusions drawn by the authors are supported by careful experimental evidence, and the findings are a useful addition to an important topic in developmental neuroscience.</p></disp-quote><p>I cannot summarize better the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>A major strength is the use of a genetic labeling tool that allows the authors to specifically analyze and manipulate one neuronal lineage. This allows for simultaneous study of both the progenitors and post-mitotic progeny. As a result the paper conveys a lot of useful information for this particular neuronal lineage. Furthermore addressing the association of cell fate specification, taking advantage of this lab's extensive prior work in the system, with developmentally-regulated programmed celldeath is an important contribution to the field.</p><p>Beyond Imp/Syp, additional characterization of this model system is provided in characterizing a previously unrecognized death of a hemilineage in early-born neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main observations that distinguish this study from others that have investigated Imp/Syp in the fly nervous system is the role played in late-born post-mitotic neurons to regulate programmed cell death. This is an important and plausible (based on the presented findings) newly discovered role for these proteins. However the precision of experiments is not particularly strong, which limits the authors claims. The genetic strategy used to manipulate Imp/Syp or the TF code appears to be done throughout the entire lineage, or all neuronal progeny, and not restricted to only the late born cells. Can the authors rule out survival of the early born hemi-lineage normally fated to die? Therefore statements such as this:</p><p>To further investigate this possibility, we used the MARCM technique to change the TF code of lastborn MNs without affecting the expression of Imp and Syp should be qualified to specify that the result is obtained by misexpressing these factors throughout the entire lineage.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our genetic manipulations affect the entire lineage or all neuronal progeny. We do not have genetic tools to gain such precision. We have changed our descriptions to specify the entire lineage or all neuronal progeny. As the reviewer raised, we were also concerned about the possibility that the overexpression of Imp or knockdown of Syp could induce the survival of the early-born hemilineage. We have two experiments that rule out this possibility:</p><p>(1) In late LL3 larvae, Imp OE or syp MARCM clones do not change the number of cells in LL3 larvae (see Guan et al., 2022), indicating that the hemilineage that died by PCD is not affected. If Imp or Syp played a role in the survival of the hemilineage, we would see at least a 50% increase in the number of MNs at this stage.</p><p>(2) The MARCM experiment using the VGlut driver to overexpress P35 or Imp allows us to manipulate only elav+ VGlut+ neurons. The hemilineage removed by PCD is elav- VGlut- and is not affected by this experiment. Consequently, the increase in MNs in adults with genetic manipulation can only be the result of the survival of the other hemilineage (elav+, VGlut+). Moreover, this experiment shows an increase in the number of neurons in the adult but not in LL3, demonstrating that the hemilineage (elav- VGlut-) is still removed by PCD with this genetic manipulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors make an observation that differs from other systems in which Imp/Syp have been studied: that the expression of the two proteins appears to be independent and not influenced by cross-regulation. However there is a lack of investigation as to what effect this may have on how Imp/Syp regulate temporal identity. A key implication of the previously observed cross-regulation in the fly mushroom body is that the ratio of Imp/Syp could change over the life of the NB which would permit different neuronal identities. Without cross-regulation, do the authors still observe a gradient in the expression pattern of time? Because the data is presented with Imp and Syp stained in different brain samples, and without quantification across different stages, this is unclear. The authors use the term 'gradient' but changes in levels of these factors are not evident from the presented data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the transcriptional activity of Imp and Syp in the NB over time using smFISH. We have also quantified the relative expression of Imp and Syp protein in the NB over time by co-immunostaining. Additionally, we quantified the relative expression of Imp and Syp protein in postmitotic neurons as a function of their birth order in late LL3 larvae. All these data show an opposite temporal gradient of Imp and Syp in the NB and an opposite spatial gradient in immature neurons according to their birth order (Figure. 4). How these gradients are established in our system remains to be elucidated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This study by Guan and co-workers focuses on a model neuronal lineage in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system, revealing interesting aspects about: (a) the generation of supernumerary cells, later destined for apoptosis; and, (b) new insights into the mechanisms that regulate this process. The two RNA-binding proteins, Imp and Syp, are shown to be expressed in temporally largely complementary patterns, their expression defining early vs later born neurons in this lineage, and thus also regulating the apoptotic elimination. Moreover, neuronal 'fate' transcription factors that are downstream of Imp and signatures of early-born neurons, can also be sufficient to convert later born cells to an earlier 'fate', including survival.</p><p>The authors provide solid evidence for most of their statements, including the temporal windows during which the early and the later-born motoneurons are generated by this model lineage, how this relates to patterns of cell death by apoptosis and that mis-expression of early-born transcription factors in later-born cells can be sufficient to block apoptosis (part of, and perhaps indicative of the late-born identity).</p><p>Other studies have previously outlined analogous, mutually antagonistic roles for Imp and Syp during nervous system development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in different parts and at different stages, with which the working model of this study aligns.</p><p>Overall, this study adds to and extends current working models and evidence on the developmental mechanisms that underlie temporal cell fate decisions.</p></disp-quote><p>I cannot summarize better the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>While this is an interesting topic, I raised two issues in my original review.</p><p>(1) Against the backdrop of numerous previous studies linking many developmental regulators, including tTFs, to programmed cell death in the developing CNS, which in several cases have involved identifying key PCD genes and decoding the molecular regulatory interplay between regulators and PCD genes, this study does not provide any new insight into the regulation of developmental PCD in the CNS.</p><p>The authors have not added any new data to address this shortcoming.</p></disp-quote><p>I agree with the reviewer that we did not attempt to link Imp/Syp with the temporal transcription factor (tTF) cascade or spatial selectors such as Hox genes. However, this decision was intentional as our primary focus was on studying immature MNs. It is worth noting that the decommissioning of NBs by autophagic cell death or terminal differentiation, which is mediated by Imp/Syp in other lineages, has not been correlated with tTFs or spatial selectors. Although we have not directly examined the involvement of the hb + sv &gt; kr &gt; pdm &gt; cas &gt; cas-svp &gt; Grh cascade in the decommissioning of the Lin A neuroblast, our preliminary data indicate that Hb, Sv, Pdm, and Cas are not expressed in the Lin A NB, while Grh is consistently expressed in the NB (Wenyue et al., 2022). Thus, it is less likely that this particular tTF cascade is not implicated in Lin A neuroblast decommissioning. In contrast, spatial selectors, such as the Hox gene Antp, play an opposing role compared to HOX transcription factors in abdominal NBs. In the Lin A lineage, Antp promotes survival (Baek, Enriquez, &amp; Mann, 2013). Here, to avoid repeating what has already been described in the literature, we focused on the role of Imp/Syp in postmitotic neurons and revealed that the precise elimination of MNs is linked to the control of TFs expressed in the MNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I raised the issue that it is unclear if Imp/Syp acts in the NB, and/or in IMC/GMC, and/or in the daughter cells generated from these.</p></disp-quote><p>I agree with the reviewer's concern regarding the unclear function of Imp/Syp, i.e., whether it acts in the NB, IMC/GMC, or daughter cells. To address this, one possible approach would be to attempt rescuing Imp and Syp mutants by transgenic expression in specific cell types, such as NBs, IMC/GMC, or GB/daughter cells. However, we have not conducted such experiments as we were skeptical about the outcome. Previous published work has used drivers expressed in NBs, IMC/GMC, or postmitotic neurons to decipher the function of a gene in a specific cell type. But the results of these experiments must be taken with caution. Using NB/GMC drivers to study gene function can lead to effects not only in the NB but also in its progeny, including GMC or postmitotic neurons, due to the perdurance and stability of the Gal4 and UAS-gene expression system. For instance, dpn-Gal4 UASGFP not only labels the NB but also many of its progeny, even if Dpn is only expressed in NBs. And elav-Gal4 is expressed in the NB and GMCs.</p><p>However, our overexpression of Imp in immature neurons using Vglut demonstrates that Imp promotes cell survival through an autonomous function in these neurons. This driver is only expressed in postmitotic neurons (elav+) and not in the NB, IMC/GMC, or in the hemilineage eliminated by cell death (elav-vglut-).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Oddly knockdown of Imp in the neuroblast (Fig. 5D) only led to death at 8h APF, when Imp is no longer expressed. Do the authors have an explanation as to how the stem cell can survive until this point? A discussion would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The simple explanation is the efficiency of RNAi. The imp-/- MARCM clones (Guan et al., 2022) lead to a stronger reduction of MNs in LL3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A simple experiment I would recommend is to repeat the antibody stainings of staged larvae/pupae (Fig. 4) having the anti-Imp/Syp antibodies in the same brain sample, and perhaps a quantification of the ratio in the NB.

As it stands now, there is no indication of whether the ratio of Imp vs Syp change over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the transcriptional activity of Imp and Syp in the NB over time.
