We set out to investigate the physiological importance of autocatalytic cleavage upstream of the agonistic peptide sequence, an event necessary for NTF displacement and subsequent receptor activation. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized tethered agonist-mediated activation of GPR116 in vitro and in vivo. A knock-in mouse expressing a non-cleavable GPR116 mutant phenocopies the pulmonary phenotype of GPR116 knock-out mice, demonstrating that tethered agonist-mediated receptor activation is indispensable for function in vivo. Using site-directed mutagenesis and species-swapping approaches, we identified key conserved amino acids for GPR116 activation in the tethered agonist sequence and in extracellular loops 2/3 (ECL2/3). We further highlight residues in transmembrane 7 (TM7) that mediate stronger signaling in mouse versus human GPR116 and recapitulate these findings in a model supporting tethered agonist:ECL2 interactions for GPR116 activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adhesion GPCR ADGRF5</kwd><kwd>autocatalytic GPS cleavage</kwd><kwd>tethered agonist activation</kwd><kwd>pulmonary surfactant</kwd><kwd>modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL131634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bridges</surname><given-names>James P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutagenesis and activity assays in vitro and in vivo identify residues in the tethered agonist of GPR116, as well as those within the extracellular loops, that are critical for mediating the response to the tethered agonist.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are critical for a variety of biological and pathophysiological processes, including modulation of metabolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olaniru and Persaud, 2019</xref>) and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2017</xref>) to regulatory roles in the central and peripheral nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Folts et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, several lines of evidence suggest key functions for aGPCRs in cancer where they may, for example, relay cellular signaling in response to surrounding mechanical cues (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scholz, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Mechanosensory roles may prove to be a general feature of these receptors, in relation to the overall structure of aGPCRs and the mode of activation that was recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Langenhan, 2019</xref>). In aGPCRs, a large extracellular domain, termed the N-terminal fragment (NTF), is linked to the transmembrane 7 domain (7TM), which is referred to as the C-terminal fragment (CTF) of the protein. The NTF and CTF fragments are linked by GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain containing an autocatalytic cleavage site (GPS) motif that is activated during receptor processing. Following proteolytic cleavage, the NTF and CTF remain associated via non-covalent interactions during trafficking to the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araç et al., 2012</xref>). Groundbreaking work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liebscher et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoveken et al., 2015</xref> has shown that the CTF, in the absence of the NTF, possesses basal signaling activity and that the 15–27 most N-terminal amino acids of the CTF act as a tethered activating ligand, reminiscent of the activation mode of the thrombin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seeley et al., 2003</xref>). In light of these data, it is conceivable that interactions of the NTF with extracellular matrix (ECM) components, or with membrane components of neighboring cells, serve as an anchor for the receptor and that binding of an additional ligand, or generation of tension (e.g., shear stress, stiffness of the ECM), changes the structural conformation, thereby releasing or altering the conformation of the NTF, resulting in exposure of the tethered agonist and activation of the receptor.</p><p>Several studies have shown constitutive basal activity of CTF constructs and activation of full-length aGPCRs with exogenous synthetic peptides (which we refer to as GPCR-activating peptides [GAPs]) corresponding to their cognate tethered agonist sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liebscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoveken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilde et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassilana et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, release of the NTF concomitant to receptor activation has been shown for GPR56/ADGRG1 upon binding to the ECM laminin 111 and transglutaminase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2014</xref>) and for EMR2/ADGRE2 bound to the ECM dermatan sulfate and subjected to mechanical cues (vibration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Le et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Naranjo et al., 2020</xref>). However, it is important to note that some adhesion GPCRs such as CELSR1/ADGRC1, GPR115/ADGRF4, and GPR111/ADGRF2 lack a consensus GPS site and do not show evidence of cleavage. Further, the biological functions of GPR114/ADGRG5 and LAT1 (LPHN1/ADGRL1) are independent of cleavage at the GPS site, suggesting that these receptors may be activated by other structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Langenhan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scholz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beliu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In order to gain insight into the mechanisms of receptor activation at the level of the TM domains, several studies analyzed activation motifs and conserved functional elements within the TMs from various GPCR classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peeters et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arimont et al., 2019</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nazarko et al., 2018</xref> performed a comprehensive mutagenesis screen of LPHN1/ADGRL1. For the tethered agonist peptide, a beta strand conformation was suggested followed by a turn element that may be key in receptor activation (detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vizurraga et al., 2020</xref>). However, only recently a first study explored in greater detail the modalities of the tethered agonist-mediated activation for GPR64/ADGRG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). This study highlighted the importance of two residues within extracellular loop (ECL)2 and the tryptophan (W) toggle switch in TM6, showing reduced binding of an optimized peptide upon mutation. These functional data were recently complemented by cryo-EM structures of several aGPCRs in the presence of their activating tethered peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ping et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barros-Álvarez et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we set out to investigate the molecular mechanisms of tethered agonist-induced activation of the aGPCR GPR116/ADGRF5. GPR116 is expressed in several tissues and cell types, including alveolar type II epithelial (AT2) cells in the lung. One of the primary roles of GPR116 is in the regulation of pulmonary surfactant as revealed by global knock-out of the gene in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bridges et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuzawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niaudet et al., 2015</xref>). Cell-specific deletion of GPR116 in AT2 cells of adult mice, or deletion of the downstream signaling proteins GNAQ/GNA11, recapitulated the increased pulmonary surfactant phenotype observed in the global knock-out mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). With respect to putative ligands, GPR116 has been proposed to associate with surfactant protein D (SFTPD) via its NTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuzawa et al., 2013</xref>). However, evidence supporting a direct role for SFTPD in the activation of GPR116 is lacking. Additionally, FNDC4 has recently been shown to activate GPR116-mediated Gs signaling in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Georgiadi et al., 2021</xref>). Whether FNDC4 modulates Gq-mediated signaling via GPR116 in pulmonary AT2 cells remains to be determined.</p><p>In order to evaluate the role of the GPS cleavage and the tethered agonist for in vivo activation and functionality of GPR116, we generated knock-in mice in which autocatalytic cleavage at the GPS site is abolished. This approach has been employed for other aGPCRs in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and in vitro systems, using mutations immediately upstream or downstream of the GPS cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kishore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prömel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peeters et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, we generated synthetic peptides corresponding to the tethered ligand sequence and mutations within the extracellular loops (ECLs) of GPR116 to identify key amino acid residues involved in receptor activation. Finally, we developed a GPR116 homology model based on recently published cryo-EM structures of ADGRF1/GPR110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qu et al., 2022</xref>). Together, our findings provide additional insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of GPR116/ADGRF5.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Physiological relevance of GPS cleavage in GPR116</title><p>GPR116 contains a conserved GPS cleavage site, and receptor activation by its corresponding tethered agonist has been demonstrated in previous studies in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zaidman et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we set out to investigate the relevance of GPS cleavage on receptor activation and the physiological functions of GPR116 in vivo. Toward this goal, we first generated an H991A construct containing a histidine-to-alanine mutation at amino acid 991 within the GPS of GPR116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mutation of the histidine residue at this position, located two amino acids upstream of the cleavage site, was chosen as it is conserved in rodent and human GPR116 and has been shown to abolish autocatalytic cleavage of the GPS in other aGPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araç et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Next, we expressed wild-type and H991A GPR116 in HEK293 cells and demonstrated that the H991A protein is not cleaved relative to the wild-type protein. Specifically, while the CTF fragment and full-length protein were detectable in cells expressing the wild-type construct, only the full-length protein was observed in cells expressing the H991A construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the H991A mutant is not cleaved, this mutation did not impact cellular localization as H991A traffics to the plasma membrane similar to wild-type GPR116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). With respect to signaling, the response of GPR116 H991A to exogenously added agonistic peptide is indistinguishable from that of the wild-type receptor in both calcium transient assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and in IP conversion assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the H991 residue within the GAIN domain is critical for cleavage of GPR116 into NTF and CTF fragments but dispensable for trafficking of the receptor to the plasma membrane and responsiveness to exogenous peptide activation in vitro.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation and validation of a non-cleavable GPR116 mutant H991A.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the H991A mutation in GPR116, details of the sequence at the protein level and gene references.

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from three independent lines of 4-week-old H991A homozygous mice and compared to BALF obtained from wild-type mice. Interestingly, all three H991A lines demonstrated increased levels (~65–90 µmol/kg) of saturated phosphatidylcholine (SatPC) compared to BALF obtained from wild-type mice (~10 µmol/kg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

In our previous study, mutation of the tethered agonist amino acids to alanine using sequential steps of three amino acid substitutions for each mutant highlighted the role of this N-terminal sequence in receptor activation. The shortest exogenous peptide capable of activating GPR116 was defined as GAP9, corresponding to the nine most N-terminal amino acids of the tethered agonist. To identify the key amino acids critical for activation, we mutated the 12 most N-terminal amino acids individually to alanine using mouse GPR116 CTF (mCTF) as the parent construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). All mutants showed expression levels comparable to that of mCTF in whole cell lysates, and at the cell surface for key mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). To evaluate the basal activity of the CTF point mutant constructs, we performed IP1 conversion assays and found that three mutants showed complete inhibition of IP1 formation: F995A, L998A, and M999A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Significant effects were also observed for the I997A, D1002, S1003, and P1004 mutations, which showed diminished, but not completely abolished, activity. We then determined whether the inactive mutants would function in a dominant negative fashion or if they could still be activated by exogenous GAP peptides. To this end, we first demonstrated that the wild-type reference mCTF construct could be activated above basal levels (super-activated) with exogenous GAP peptide, and that inclusion of an N-terminal FLAG tag did not affect the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Next, we evaluated the different mCTF single alanine mutants for their ability to be activated by the exogenous ligand. In all cases, GAP14 strongly activated the mutant receptors, with IP1 levels accumulating to levels equivalent to or exceeding those observed with the reference wild-type construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, for alanine mutant constructs in which the basal activity was abolished, such as F995A, GAP14 could completely rescue the activity of the mutated tethered agonists. Constructs in which the basal activity was not affected by the mutations were also super-activated by GAP14, similar to the reference mCTF construct. These data are consistent with our previous results with sequential three amino acid substitution mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2017</xref>) and further show that the tethered agonist single-point mutants are expressed on the cell surface and capable of activation by GAP14, demonstrating that the ligand binding site remains available and accessible in these mutants. Furthermore, these data indicate that F995, L998, and M999 are the key amino acids within the tethered agonist sequence involved in receptor activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Identification of amino acids in the tethered agonist essential for GPR116 activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Design of the 12 mGPR116 CTF (mCTF) ECD mutants.

We used GAP10 as the template for these studies as it is more active on the murine receptor than GAP14. To rule out potential artifacts resulting from oxidation, the methionine corresponding to position 999 in the mCTF was replaced by norleucine (Nle). The activity of GAP10 Nle was indistinguishable from that of parental GAP10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Calcium flux assays were performed to measure the activity of GAP10 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). GAP10 peptides corresponding to the mutated CTF constructs F995A, L998A, and M999A failed to activate the full-length receptor, confirming the results shown above using the mCTF constructs with basal activity. Similarly, peptides corresponding to the other singly mutated mCTF constructs showed activities comparable or weaker to parental GAP10 in agreement with the results obtained with the mCTF constructs. Importantly, we confirmed that the mutant GAP10 peptides F995A (TSASILNleSPD), L998A (TSFSIANleSPD), and M999A (TSFSILASPD) also failed to activate the human full-length receptor, whereas parental GAP10 was active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Three native alanines located in these regions were mutated to valines. For this scan, we used a mouse GPR116 CTF construct that is deficient in basal activity yet responsive to GAP-mediated activation as the parent construct. This construct, initially described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2017</xref>, has the three N-terminal amino acids of the tethered agonist sequence (Thr993, Ser994, F995) mutated to alanines and is referred to hereafter as mCTF ‘basal activity deficient’ mutant, or mCTFbax. Data from this alanine scan identified five constructs that were unresponsive to GAP14-mediated activation: Y1158A, R1160A, W1165A, L1166A, and T1240A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Conservative exchanges for the three other critical amino acids still yielded inactive receptors (R1160K, W1165F, W1165V, W1165Y, and L1166I). While Y1158F, W1165V, L1166I, and T1240S showed protein expression levels comparable to the parental mCTFbax construct, R1160K, W1165F, and W1165Y showed a partial reduction in total protein expression levels and membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Despite receptor reserve effect, we cannot exclude the possibility that the absence of activity for these constructs is related to lower receptor expression.</p><p>Replacement of W1165 with a phenylalanine, valine, or tyrosine significantly reduced receptor activation. This suggests a role for the -NH group and that the size of the aromatic ring may be relevant. Surprisingly, replacing L1166 with an isoleucine, as is observed in some aGPCRs, was not tolerated in GPR116, suggesting a specific role of this amino acid. Finally, the decreased efficacy of the T1240S mutant suggests that the hydroxyl function is not sufficient to produce a full response to the GAP14-mediated activation. The additional bulk and/or conformational constraint of the methyl group on the T1240 side chain also plays an important role.</p><p>Taken together, our data confirms a predominant role for specific amino acids located in ECL2 and at the top of TM6/ECL3 in tethered peptide- and GAP-mediated activation of mouse and human GPR116.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Species-specific features involved in GPR116 responsiveness to the tethered agonist</title><p>The amino acids identified in the CTF that are critical for receptor activation are all conserved between murine and human GPR116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>); yet GAP peptides consistently elicit a more potent response on the mouse receptor compared to the human receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that additional residues are responsible for this difference in potency. We set out to identify the amino acids relevant for this differential responsiveness to gain additional important insight into the mechanisms underlying GPR116 activation.</p><p>We first generated a human GPR116 CTF construct in which the six N-terminal amino acids of the tethered agonist were deleted. This construct, referred to as hGPR116 CTFbax (hCTFbax), has no basal activity, analogous to the mCTFbax construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, inset). As expected, the hCTFbax construct responded to GAP14 activation in IP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and calcium flux assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similar to observations with the full-length receptors, the hCTFbax is less responsive to GAP14 than the mCTFbax receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These constructs were used in subsequent experiments to pinpoint key amino acid residues conferring this differential responsiveness. With this aim we exchanged specific non-conserved amino acids in the human receptor to the corresponding murine residues, focusing on amino acids at the surface of the receptor in the N-terminus and around ECLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We mutated small clusters of amino acids as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, and also introduced the single mutation G1011K, representing a non-conservative amino acid difference between human and mouse sequences in proximity to the extracellular surface. All mutants expressed well at the total protein level and showed localization comparable to that of the parent hCTFbax construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>); note that membrane expression could not be quantified due to cytoplasmic localization of the V5 tag.

The 1077QDN to HDG1079 mutant, with the lowest expression of this group of mutants, exhibited an activity close to that of the parent construct, suggesting that the expression levels of these receptor mutants were sufficient to generate the maximal signaling response. Surprisingly, only the G1011K mutation increased the signaling response of the resulting receptor so that it shifted sensitivity toward that of mCTFbax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

These studies identified a potential binding site containing non-conserved amino acids between mouse and human. We hypothesized that these amino acids might mediate the gain in efficacy for the murine receptor compared to human, as well as inhibition by the antagonist. We identified 10 mouse-specific residues that may be involved in this putative murine-specific binding site (mBS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and introduced all 10 residues into human GPR116, generating an hCTFbax mBS chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Thus GAP10-Pro1 acts as a highly potent, mouse-specific agonist peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left panels versus right panels). We also verified that the same pattern was observed with the mFL V5 tagged clone 1D8 (EC50: 107 µM with GAP14, 25 µM with GAP10, 17 µM with GAP10-Pro1). Next, we asked whether the same mouse amino acids that confer increased responsiveness to exogenous GAP14 activation in the human receptor would also enable response to GAP10-Pro1. Indeed, the A1254T and especially V1258A hCTFbax constructs showed a significant response to GAP10-Pro1, albeit not fully equivalent to hCTFbax mBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Its N-terminal half (T993-S1000) binds to a cavity within the helical bundle, while its C-terminal half caps the transmembrane domain. The tethered agonist peptide forms only van der Waals contacts with the transmembrane domain of GPR116. Four hydrophobic side chains of the peptide N-terminal half (F995, I997, L998, and M999, respectively, at positions 3, 5, 6, and 7) are involved in most of these van der Waals contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). These four hydrophobic side chains, which are well conserved across the ADGRF sub-family of adhesion GPCRs, interact with side chains of amino acids of TM1 (V1022), TM2 (F1070), TM3 (Y1099 and F1103), TM5 (F1177), TM6 (W1234 and T1239), TM7 (F1253, A1254, N1257, and V1259), and ECL2 (W1165).</p><p>The proposed interaction model between the tethered agonist peptide and GPR116 is consistent with the identification of GAP9 as the minimal exogenous peptide able of activating GPR116. In addition, the three mutants showing complete inhibition of IP1 formation (F995, L998, and M999; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) correspond to three of the four side chains that are involved in most of the van der Waals contacts with the TM bundle of GPR116 (F995, L998, and M999). Mutation of the fourth of these side chains (I997) also resulted in a significant inhibition of IP1 formation. Three additional mutations (D1002, S1003, and P1004) resulted in a significant decrease in IP1 formation. In the model, these three amino acids (D1002, S1003, and P1004) do not form extensive interactions with the GPR116 TM bundle. Instead, the side chain of D1002 is involved in electrostatic interaction with the hydroxyl of S1007 (C-terminal half of the tethered agonist peptide), while the hydroxyl of S1003 forms intramolecular H bonds with the side chains of S1000 and D1005. These intramolecular interactions contribute both to stabilize the bound conformation of the tethered agonist peptide and to shield its polar side chains in the hydrophobic environment of GPR116 TM bundle. Therefore, mutation of D1002, S1003, and P1004 is likely to disfavor productive binding of the tethered agonist peptide to GPR116.</p><p>Four of the five residues, which when mutated were unresponsive to GAP14 (Y1158, R1160, W1165, and L1166; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), are located on ECL2, while T1240 is located at the N-terminus of TM6. In the GPR116 homology model, only two of the five key amino acids (W1165 and T1240) interact directly with the tethered agonist peptide, more specifically with I997 and M999, respectively. On the other hand, the homology model does not provide insight into the role of the three other key amino acids on ECL2. However, our modeling protocol may have produced an irrelevant or inaccurate conformation of GPR116 ECL2 because of the challenge associated with modeling long loops. Analyzing the cryo-EM structures of the template may shed some light on the role of the three key ECL2 amino acids. Interestingly, Y1158, R1160, and L1166 are conserved in GPR110 (Y727, R729, and L735). In the three cryo-EM structures of GPR110 (PDB 7WU3, 7WU4, and 7WU5), Y727 and L735 do not form any interaction with the tethered agonist peptide either. However, both amino acids occupy the same region of space. More precisely, Y727 forms van der Waals contacts with TM3, TM4, and ECL2, while L735 is stacked between Y727 and W734 and forms van der Waals contacts with both TM3 and TM5. Therefore, these two amino acids may help to stabilize receptor conformation. On the other hand, the side chain of R729 is more flexible. In one of the three GPR110 structures, it donates an H bond to the backbone O of P575 (amino acid 9 of the GPR110 tethered agonist peptide). Interestingly, this proline is conserved in GPR116 and, as the most C-terminal amino acid of the minimally active peptide GAP9, it may be involved in receptor activation. Finally, the homology model also shows that A1254 and V1258 in TM7 do form contacts with F995 of the tethered agonist peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), supporting our functional studies in which modification of these residues modulated receptor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our functional studies combined with molecular modeling provide the first details on the mechanism of GPR116 activation by its tethered agonist peptide.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While great strides have been made in delineating the mechanisms of activation of aGPCRs in vitro, the mode of activation of adhesion GPCRs in vivo, including GPR116, is not well understood. Through generation and characterization of a cleavage-deficient mutant, H991A, we show that cleavage at the GPS site is required for GPR116 activity and modulation of pulmonary surfactant levels in vivo. These studies validate a tethered agonist-mediated activation mode for GPR116 in alveolar type 2 epithelial cells and alveolar homoeostasis. This is, to our knowledge, the first in vivo demonstration of the key role of the GPS cleavage and the unmasking of a tethered agonist in a mammalian system.</p><p>The tethered agonist sequence of each aGPCR family member is highly conserved between species, which explains cross-activation among orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liebscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we identified F995, L998, and M999 as key amino acids in the tethered agonist sequence required for GPR116 activation. These three amino acids are highly conserved in the ECDs of multiple aGPCR CTFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and have been highlighted for other receptors such as GPR126/ADGRG6, GPR133/ADGRD1, GPR110/ADGRF1, GPR56/ADGRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liebscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoveken et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that they play a critical structural role for activation in the aGPCR family. In this sense, these data may explain some of the promiscuous activities observed within and between aGPCR subfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demberg et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Other studies aimed at analyzing the critical residues comprising the tethered agonist are consistent with our identification of phenylalanine at position 3 (F995) as the most N-terminal residue playing a key role in aGPCR activation (GPR64/ADGRG2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azimzadeh et al., 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2021</xref>; GPR126/ADGRG6, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liebscher et al., 2014</xref>; Lphn3/ADGRL3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mathiasen et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, amino acids at positions 6 and 7 (L998 and M999), albeit not strictly conserved as leucine and methionine residues in all aGPCR tethered ligands, are key for GPR116 activation. It is noteworthy that additional residues within the tethered agonist that were dispensable for GPR116 activity are critical for other aGPCRs, possibly explaining the specificity for activation exhibited by some receptors. For example, alanine substitution of the first amino acid within the tethered agonist (usually a threonine) can lead to a loss of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liebscher et al., 2014</xref>) while substitution with a hydrophobic residue can increase the activity of the peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). This is consistent with our observations with the GAP10-Pro1 peptide, further supporting the concept that position 1 can modulate the strength of molecular interactions between ligand and its binding domain during aGPCR activation.</p><p>With respect to the 7TM, our mutational analysis of the extracellular surface of GPR116 identified ECL2 and top of TM6/ECL3 as the structural components most involved in receptor activation. Mutation of key residues may prevent GPR116 from transitioning to an active state or may prevent interaction with the tethered agonist peptide. We identified Y1158, R1160, W1165, and L1166 in ECL2 and T1240 at the TM6/ECL3 interface to be the key residues involved in GPR116 activation. Interestingly, we noted that W1165 and L1166, which immediately follow the cysteine involved in the disulfide bridge linking the top of TM3 and ECL2, comprise a CWL triad that is key for receptor activation. The tryptophan residue is globally conserved in aGPCRs, and the leucine (or sometimes isoleucine) is frequently present in this position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Residues within ECL2 have also been implicated in ligand binding and activation of classical GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wheatley et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, the CW motif in the ECL2 is conserved in family B, suggesting commonalities in the activation mechanism between aGPCRs and family B GPCRs. In particular, the (C)WF in ECL2 is involved in CRF1 binding to CRF1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gkountelias et al., 2009</xref>). In PAR1, a (C)HD sequence is important for receptor activation by the peptide, further highlighting the relevance of the ECL2 amino acids following the disulfide bridge, not only for activation per se but also ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">OBrien et al., 2001</xref>). Within the aGPCR family, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2021</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gad et al., 2021</xref> also identified the (C)WI triad in ECL2 and residues in TM6 as being involved in GPR64/ADGRG2 activation by the tethered agonistic peptide. The tyrosine at position 1158 is located six amino acids upstream of the CWL triad and it is conserved in most aGPCRs, except in the ADGRA and ADGRG subfamily members, and ADGRV1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It is noteworthy that the CWL cluster is also less strictly conserved in these ADGRs. It is possible that a tyrosine at a position further upstream in the ECL2 may functionally replace Y1158 in these receptors, depending on the flexibility of the ECL. With regard to position 1240, a role for ECL3 in aGPCR activation has already been suggested for disease-associated mutations of GPR56/ADGRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kishore and Hall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). The mutation L640R (corresponding to H1250 in GPR116) in ECL3 affects collagen 3-mediated activation of GPR56 signaling, likely by inducing a conformation that locks the receptor in an inactive state. While the mutational work presented here highlighted features in line with previously published studies on aGPCR activation, interpretation of the functional data is limited and addressing the role of the identified key amino acids in GPR116 activation was further investigated in a homology model.</p><p>Indeed, recently, nine cryo-EM structures of aGPCRs, not including GPR116, were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barros-Álvarez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ping et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>). These structures highlight, among other aspects, that the stachel is indeed buried into the 7TM domain, consistent with our data, with a key role of hydrophobic amino acids in positions 3, 4, 5, 7 of the tethered agonist and that the ECL2 can also bend into the barrel with variations depending on the receptor. The agonist peptide is surrounded by ECL2 and TMs on one side, and ECL3 and TMs on the other side. These structures confirm the key role ECL2, and it will be interesting to compare aGPCR activation with that of GPR52, recently shown to involve residues within ECL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). Although the tryptophan following the cysteine bridge is critical for receptor activation in all aGPCRs, additional essential residues appear distinct in the various studied receptors.</p><p>The homology model of human GPR116 confirms that amino acids in ECL2 are important for receptor activation, even if it is surprising that only three residues facing the extracellular side (two in ECL2, one in ECL3) are involved in interactions with the tethered peptide. Based on this model, we could address a role for amino acids identified as key for activation, with some residues being involved in interactions mediating the activation and others being involved in receptor or peptide conformation and stabilization. In particular, the C-terminal part of the peptide (S1000 to S1008) forms intramolecular interactions stabilizing the peptide and Y1158-L1166 in ECL2 may participate in receptor stabilization than activation.</p><p>Relative to receptor activation, we identified key residues conserved in the ADGR family such as the tryptophan following the ECL2 cysteine involved in the disulfide bridge or the methionine conserved in most family members at position 7 in the tethered peptide. The homology model also highlighted GPR116-specific residues and interactions, such as R1160 and P1001 conserved in ADGRFs. Further, the species comparison studies highlighted that the mouse sequence-specific amino acids T1254 and A1258 in TM7 strengthen receptor activation by the peptide. The GPR116 homology model shows that the corresponding amino acids in the human sequence, A1254 and V1258, do form contacts with F995 of the tethered agonist peptide. This supports the possibility that the mouse variants induce stronger activation by the peptide, for example, via H bonds by the threonine. Further, it supports our finding that exchanging F995 with proline generates a mouse-specific peptide that is active on a human GPR116 construct exhibiting the mouse sequence at these two positions. The details of such interactions, including the glycine to lysine exchange at position 1011, cannot be predicted using this human GPR116 model and will require further studies.</p><p>While the model of the GPR116 activation that we present here is in line with other studies of aGPCRs and highlights aspects of tethered agonist:ECL2 interactions, it does have some limitations. First, further studies using cross-linking and binding experiments will be required to define the contact points between the tethered peptide and ECL2. Second, the potential role of the NTF, how it is positioned relative to the CTF, and how it may affect tethered agonist structure is not known. Modeling the highly flexible loops remains challenging, although some studies focused on modeling of GPCR ECLs are underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liessmann et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, ECL2 is the largest ECL in GPR116, as in many other GPCRs, and the disulfide bridge within TM3 does not introduce sufficient constraints to provide a more defined model. Even with adequate representation of the amino acid stereochemistry, significant degrees of freedom remain for the ECL conformation. Third, our studies evaluate the interaction of the tethered agonist with ECL2 in a context devoid of the NTF. In a setting of peptide- or antibody-based activation without NTF removal, exemplified recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitgau et al., 2022</xref> for GPR126, these tethered agonist/ECL interactions may be different.</p><p>Finally, it will be interesting to investigate whether the proposed FNCD4-mediated activation of GPR116, via binding to the NTF and subsequent G protein-coupling, also involves the tethered peptide sequence or another mechanism to induce activating structural changes in the 7TM.</p><p>Based on this study, our working model postulates that following unveiling of the tethered agonist, residues within this sequence interact with amino acids located in ECL2, ECL3, and TM7 to induce conformational changes, resulting in productive Gq/G11 engagement and activation. While the endogenous ligand or the biological process(es) leading to displacement and/or conformational change of the non-covalently linked N-terminal domain and subsequent GPR116 activation in vivo remain unknown, our data advance the mechanistic understanding of GPR116 activation in the context of pulmonary surfactant homeostasis and may facilitate the development of novel receptor modulators that can be used to treat clinically relevant lung diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>H991A knock-in mice</title><p>The H991A mutation was introduced into the mouse <italic>Adgrf5</italic> locus via CRISPR/Cas9 editing.

One of the mechanisms they are activated by is a tethered agonist peptide that interacts with the transmembrane domain to activate the receptor. This work first shows that a knock-in mouse expressing a non-cleavable GPR116 mutant to prevent the release of the tethered agonist peptide phenocopies the pulmonary phenotype of GPR116 knock-out mice, demonstrating that tethered agonist-mediated receptor activation is indispensable for GPR116 function in vivo. The study then uses mutagenesis and activity assays to find residues in the tethered agonist that are most important for receptor activation, as well as mutating loops in the extracellular face of the receptor to find residues important in mediating the response to the tethered agonist.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69061.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Araç</surname><given-names>Demet</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/024mw5h28</institution-id><institution>University of Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Boucard</surname><given-names>Antony A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/009eqmr18</institution-id><institution>Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (Cinvestav-IPN)</institution></institution-wrap><country>Mexico</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.04.01.438115">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.01.438115v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

To address points 1, 3, 4, and 7 in my public review, the authors should either add further data that supports their claims (if they want to maintain the interpretation of their data as currently written) or alternatively they should alter the discussion of their findings if some of their interpretations cannot be more strongly supported by additional data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>1. Title is confusing when referring to &quot;… in extracellular loop 2 of the transmembrane region&quot; and should preferably indicate &quot;… in extracellular loop 2 and the transmembrane region&quot;.</p><p>2. The authors should analyze the role of the highly conserved Histidine residue in position 991 by generating at least one other substitution mutant with a conservative amino acid. A phenotypic rescue strategy could then be conducted by overexpressing the conservative mutant on the GPR116 knock-out background (previously generated by the research team). A parallel in vitro validation of the receptor mutant in HEK293 cells can be achieved to compare activation by GAP peptides, constitutive activity, expression and cleavage parameters all of which would help reinforce the authors' hypothesis on whether it is a lack of cleavage rather than the substitution of a highly conserved residue that is causing the described phenotypes.</p><p>3. Authors should provide a more detailed characterization of the GPR116 H991A/H991A mouse line. First, tissue expression of the mutated receptor should be assessed to discard the probability of a loss-of-function phenotype due to a lack of expression. Second, a direct comparison of AT2 cells secretion parameters should be included for the different genotypes (GPR116+/+, GPR116 -/-, GPR116 H991A/H991A), in order to gain direct mechanistic insights into genotype-linked phenotypes and evaluate the degree of loss-of-function phenotypes between GRP116-deficient mice and cleavage-deficient mice. Third, phospholipid homeostasis parameters should be tested further using AT2 cells from these mice in presence and absence of ATP stimuli (phospholipid secretion, phospholipid uptake).</p><p>4. Authors should determine expression levels for each receptor constructs in order to normalize their functional data accordingly. N-terminally Flag-tagged constructs provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate membrane exposure of mCTF receptors from the cell surface of HEK293 cells. This can be achieved by using flow cytometry (as performed in Supp Figure 7 for quantifying N-terminal mCherry signal) quantifying cell-surface fluorescence intensity of cell populations expressing respective receptor mutants which can be detected with anti-Flag antibody and fluorophore-coupled secondary antibody. Alternatively, a cell ELISA can be conducted using the same strategy but revealing with horseradish peroxidase substrates. As for C-terminally V5-tagged constructs, they can be analyzed also by flow cytometry coupled to immunofluorescence in order to obtain total protein expression levels as the positioning of the tag does not allow to make a distinction between subcellular compartments. For western blotting experiments, although band intensities can be visually approximated from western blot images, we highly recommend that authors make use of pixel intensity-based quantification software to monitor band intensities normalized using housekeeping proteins as loading controls.</p><p>5. P.11, the authors conducted activation assays rather than binding assays and thus should refrain from inferring that &quot; … set out to determine the region of the receptor to which the tethered agonist binds…&quot;. This sentence should be rephrased in order to better reflect the correlation that the authors try to establish using their structure-function assays strategy. Additionally, every mention of a binding site determination throughout the manuscript should be nuanced with this aspect in mind.</p><p>6. In their systematic characterization of critical residues by conservative substitutions the authors have dismissed the T1240 position which leaves this seemingly systematic approach incomplete. In order to show consistency, we recommend that they generate a Threonine to Serine replacement at this position and include the analysis in the manuscript.</p><p>7. In the generation of basal activity-null constructs (&quot;bax&quot; constructs), it is not clear why a different engineering strategy was adopted to generate the human versus mouse version. The authors should at least allude to it in the manuscript by shortly explaining or indicating if technical or circumstantial elements played a role in designing these different versions, or if other versions of hCTFbax where in fact designed but did not result in reduction in constitutive activity.</p><p>8. For consistency purposes, the authors should evaluate all mGPR116 full-length versions of receptor mutants modifying key ECL residues with a version of full-length mGPR116 also containing an intracellular V5 epitope tag to discard any collateral effects due to the insertion of a tag that could potentially disrupt intracellular coupling events. This is particularly important giving that the human versions containing an intracellular V5 epitope (hFL versions) display expression differences (Supp Figure 6B).</p><p>9. In order to allow for a more comprehensive reading, the authors should briefly explain in the text what their strategy was when using different GAP peptides interchangeably for the different assays.</p><p>10.

The textual changes and new data added by the authors have significantly strengthened the manuscript.</p><p>One additional comment I would like to make is that after the review of the original draft of this manuscript in Spring 2021, a paper was published reporting the secreted protein FNDC4 as a ligand for GPR116 (Georgiadi et al., Nat. Comm., 2021). This work is not mentioned in the present manuscript, and indeed the authors have a statement in the penultimate paragraph of their Introduction stating, &quot;Still considered an orphan aGPCR, GPR116 has been proposed…&quot;.</p><p>Is GPR116 still an orphan? It is understood that FNDC4 cannot be considered a definitive ligand for GPR116 until other groups have had a chance to confirm (or refute) the findings of Georgiadi and colleagues, but nonetheless, it seems that the work of Georgiadi et al. is highly relevant to the studies described in the present manuscript and therefore should at least be mentioned at some point.</p><p>Along these same lines, it is terrific that the authors of the present manuscript made the effort to cite the recent wave of cryo-EM studies on aGPCRs and place their findings in the context of those new structural studies. In a similar vein, it would also be appropriate for the authors to cite the recently-published work of Georgiadi et al. and discuss how these findings may be relevant to the authors' own findings of the activation mechanism of GPR116.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am satisfied with the authors' response to my original comments, but I have some suggestions that would need to be addressed for ease of reading, accuracy, and reproducibility purposes regarding the newly added data in this revised version:</p><p>1. To avoid confusion, I would suggest adding &quot;Cell surface expression (Mean fluorescence)&quot; as the title for the Y axis of all graphs reporting results from surface exposed epitope in flow cytometry (Flag): Figure 3C, Figure 4 D, Figure 4 Supp figure 4D-E.</p><p>2. Likewise, I would suggest indicating &quot;Total expression (mean fluorescence)&quot; as the Y-axis title of all graphs reporting flow cytometry results from intracellular epitopes (V5/mCherry). Figure 4E, Figure 4 Supp Figure 4B.</p><p>3. Refrain from using the terms “membrane expression” when the methodology that has been used does not allow this determination exclusively since the immunocytochemistry protocol, as currently described in the methods section, involves a permeabilization step. This is the case in Figure 4 Supp figure 3A and 3C.</p><p>4. Please complete the newly added data with the corresponding information on reproducibility parameters (# of independent experiments, define error bars). Error bar descriptions and/or # of independent experiments are missing for various figures involving functional assays or for expression quantifications by western blot or flow cytometry (western blot quantifications do not display errors? Was it done just once? Justify if this is the case as stable cell lines can show decaying expression with time). These include: Figure 3F; Figure 3 Supp Figure 1 and 2; Figure 4; Figure 4 Supp Figure 1B,3B,3D, 4B-E; Figure 5A,B,E; Figure 5 Supp Figure 1B; Figure 6B-C; Figure 6 Supp Figure 1C; Figure 7; Figure 10 (error is SD or SEM?).</p><p>5. It seems that flow cytometry experiments were performed only once, indicate if this is not the case.</p><p>6. For flow cytometry experiments, indicate the number of events analyzed in the methods section.</p><p>7. The use of the term “biological replicates” seems incorrect throughout figure legends as they seem to indicate technical replicates instead. One experiment done at the same time is a n=1 that might include various replicates of each different groups, considered technical replicates; when the same experiment is done more than once at different times experiments are considered biological replicates. For example, the legend for Figure 4F indicates 3 independent experiments with 4 biological replicates but instead should read as 3 independent experiments done in quadruplicates or 4 technical replicates. Please revise where relevant and correct if this is the case or add if it is missing (For example Fig3F, Figure 3 Sup Figure 1, and others are missing replicates data).</p><p>8. Indicate where relevant when experiments are technical replicates instead of biological replicates. Add information about statistical significance where data represent biological replicates.</p><p>9. Because the data seems more relevant to the reader in this case, please interchange current panel E in Figure 4 with surface expression graphs for remaining mutants displayed in this figure depicted in Figure 4 Supp Figure 4 D-E.</p><p>10. Line 660, please correct the antibody incubation time indicating 230 min.</p><p>11. Indicate “% IP1 conversion” as the Y-axis title for all corresponding graphs.</p><p>12. Note that no cell surface data expression is present for hFL-T1240A and is also missing for various hFL or hCTFbax or mCTF mutants. If data cannot be included at this stage, please include a brief comment in the manuscript to the effect of why this is the case in each section where the data is missing.</p><p>13.

However, desensitization experiments did not show decrease of activity of the mFL construct over a 2 hour time frame (not shown). Peptide-induced receptor internalization studies are challenging for this reason as well. That said, the degree of intracellular staining is similar for WT and the H991A mutant, so if signaling were affected by localization within the cell one would predict it would be affected similarly for both constructs. HEK293 cells are a strong expression system for CMV promoter-driven genes and indeed a strong receptor response is observed in functional assays, suggesting high levels of appropriate expression and localization. Further we do know that GPCRs exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells can rapidly reach receptor reserve (i.e. maximal response is reached without complete receptor occupancy – see e.g. the review from Buchwald 2019: Frontiers | A Receptor Model With Binding Affinity, Activation Efficacy, and Signal Amplification Parameters for Complex Fractional Response Versus Occupancy Data | Pharmacology (frontiersin.org)), implicating that lower membrane expression can be sufficient to reach maximal response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

We have edited the text as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>1. Title is confusing when referring to &quot;… in extracellular loop 2 of the transmembrane region&quot; and should preferably indicate &quot;… in extracellular loop 2 and the transmembrane region&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the title per the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should analyze the role of the highly conserved Histidine residue in position 991 by generating at least one other substitution mutant with a conservative amino acid. A phenotypic rescue strategy could then be conducted by overexpressing the conservative mutant on the GPR116 knock-out background (previously generated by the research team). A parallel in vitro validation of the receptor mutant in HEK293 cells can be achieved to compare activation by GAP peptides, constitutive activity, expression and cleavage parameters all of which would help reinforce the authors' hypothesis on whether it is a lack of cleavage rather than the substitution of a highly conserved residue that is causing the described phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully considered the reviewers suggestion and offer the following two arguments in response to their inquiry:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Authors should provide a more detailed characterization of the GPR116 H991A/H991A mouse line. First, tissue expression of the mutated receptor should be assessed to discard the probability of a loss-of-function phenotype due to a lack of expression. Second, a direct comparison of AT2 cells secretion parameters should be included for the different genotypes (GPR116+/+, GPR116 -/-, GPR116 H991A/H991A), in order to gain direct mechanistic insights into genotype-linked phenotypes and evaluate the degree of loss-of-function phenotypes between GRP116-deficient mice and cleavage-deficient mice. Third, phospholipid homeostasis parameters should be tested further using AT2 cells from these mice in presence and absence of ATP stimuli (phospholipid secretion, phospholipid uptake).</p></disp-quote><p>First, we have generated additional data demonstrating comparable expression levels of H991A mRNA in primary AT2 cells to that seen in WT AT2 cells (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1D). Since we chose not to epitope tag the H991A knock-in construct in the mouse and lack a reliable antibody against GPR116, we are unable to quantitate and localize H991A protein in the animal model. However, we observed similar calcium responses in response to peptide stimulation in primary AT2 cells isolated from H991A/H991A mice compared to those seen in WT AT2 (Figure 2C and D). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that expression levels and membrane localization of H991A in the knock-in are similar to the WT protein in littermate control animals.</p><p>Second, we have generated additional data demonstrating that levels of the primary surfactant phospholipid, saturated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (SatPC), are increased in the alveolar lavage fluid of H991A/H991A homozygous mice at levels comparable to those seen in aged matched GPR116-/- mice (Figure 2A). We believe that these data, together with: (1) similar histological findings in H991A/H991A and GPR116-/- mice; (2) similar mRNA levels in H991A and WT primary AT2 cells; and (3) similar peptide-induced calcium responses in H991A/H991A primary AT2 cells demonstrate that the H991A receptor is responsive in vitro but inactive in vivo.</p><p>Third, the primary goal of generating the cleavage-deficient mutant was to determine if receptor activation in vivo was dependent on cleavage at the GPS. Based on the data presented, we believe we have successfully demonstrated that the H991A mutant is expressed on the cell surface, is activated by exogenous peptide in a transiently transfected cell line and in primary AT2 cells, but is not functional in vivo based on the identical pulmonary phenotype of the H991A homozygous mouse line compared to the germline knock-out mouse line. We respectfully disagree that a complete characterization of the surfactant phospholipid secretion and uptake parameters in the H991A mouse line would add additional insight into the biology of the GPR116 beyond what is already presented in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Authors should determine expression levels for each receptor constructs in order to normalize their functional data accordingly. N-terminally Flag-tagged constructs provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate membrane exposure of mCTF receptors from the cell surface of HEK293 cells. This can be achieved by using flow cytometry (as performed in Supp Figure 7 for quantifying N-terminal mCherry signal) quantifying cell-surface fluorescence intensity of cell populations expressing respective receptor mutants which can be detected with anti-Flag antibody and fluorophore-coupled secondary antibody. Alternatively, a cell ELISA can be conducted using the same strategy but revealing with horseradish peroxidase substrates. As for C-terminally V5-tagged constructs, they can be analyzed also by flow cytometry coupled to immunofluorescence in order to obtain total protein expression levels as the positioning of the tag does not allow to make a distinction between subcellular compartments. For western blotting experiments, although band intensities can be visually approximated from western blot images, we highly recommend that authors make use of pixel intensity-based quantification software to monitor band intensities normalized using housekeeping proteins as loading controls.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now included appropriate quantification for each set of constructs as follows:</p><p>We also edited the text as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. P.11, the authors conducted activation assays rather than binding assays and thus should refrain from inferring that &quot; … set out to determine the region of the receptor to which the tethered agonist binds…&quot;. This sentence should be rephrased in order to better reflect the correlation that the authors try to establish using their structure-function assays strategy. Additionally, every mention of a binding site determination throughout the manuscript should be nuanced with this aspect in mind.</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased several parts of the Results and Discussion sections accordingly including taking into account data presented in Figure 8D that suggests the possibility of peptide binding into the putative binding site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In their systematic characterization of critical residues by conservative substitutions the authors have dismissed the T1240 position which leaves this seemingly systematic approach incomplete. In order to show consistency, we recommend that they generate a Threonine to Serine replacement at this position and include the analysis in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have generated this construct as requested and demonstrate that the T1240S mutant is less responsive to peptide stimulation as compared to the parent mCTFbax construct. These data represented in Figure 4G of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In the generation of basal activity-null constructs (&quot;bax&quot; constructs), it is not clear why a different engineering strategy was adopted to generate the human versus mouse version. The authors should at least allude to it in the manuscript by shortly explaining or indicating if technical or circumstantial elements played a role in designing these different versions, or if other versions of hCTFbax where in fact designed but did not result in reduction in constitutive activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a comment in the Methods section with regard to the two different strategies. The hCTFbax construct was based on published studies on other aGPCRs, hypothesizing that deleting 6 amino acids was an effective approach to abolish the basal activity of the hCTF construct. The mCTFbax construct was generated in our previously published work (Brown et al., 2017) and we thought it to be appropriate to test hypotheses in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. For consistency purposes, the authors should evaluate all mGPR116 full-length versions of receptor mutants modifying key ECL residues with a version of full-length mGPR116 also containing an intracellular V5 epitope tag to discard any collateral effects due to the insertion of a tag that could potentially disrupt intracellular coupling events. This is particularly important giving that the human versions containing an intracellular V5 epitope (hFL versions) display expression differences (Supp Figure 6B).</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments in Figure 4 E,F and Figure 4 supplement figure 3A have been replicated, using the V5-tagged version of the full length receptor as a control. This permitted more accurate comparison of the expression levels between the reference construct and the mutants thereof. Quantification of total expression levels by flow cytometry were also added to complement the immunocytochemistry data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In order to allow for a more comprehensive reading, the authors should briefly explain in the text what their strategy was when using different GAP peptides interchangeably for the different assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We commented in the Methods section the rationale for using GAP14 as reference peptide. GAP9 is the peptide with the minimum number of amino acids required for receptor activation comparable to that seen with GAP16 (previously published). GAP10 is more active than GAP9 and was used for specific studies looking at the importance of selective GAP amino acids.</p><p>Ex vivo and related experiments were performed originally with the GAP16 peptide. In additional experiments, GAP10 was used as a more active peptide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

The textual changes and new data added by the authors have significantly strengthened the manuscript.</p><p>One additional comment I would like to make is that after the review of the original draft of this manuscript in Spring 2021, a paper was published reporting the secreted protein FNDC4 as a ligand for GPR116 (Georgiadi et al., Nat. Comm., 2021). This work is not mentioned in the present manuscript, and indeed the authors have a statement in the penultimate paragraph of their Introduction stating, &quot;Still considered an orphan aGPCR, GPR116 has been proposed…&quot;</p><p>Is GPR116 still an orphan? It is understood that FNDC4 cannot be considered a definitive ligand for GPR116 until other groups have had a chance to confirm (or refute) the findings of Georgiadi and colleagues, but nonetheless, it seems that the work of Georgiadi et al. is highly relevant to the studies described in the present manuscript and therefore should at least be mentioned at some point.</p><p>Along these same lines, it is terrific that the authors of the present manuscript made the effort to cite the recent wave of cryo-EM studies on aGPCRs and place their findings in the context of those new structural studies. In a similar vein, it would also be appropriate for the authors to cite the recently-published work of Georgiadi et al. and discuss how these findings may be relevant to the authors' own findings of the activation mechanism of GPR116.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this point. We have included this FNDC4 reference in the introduction section of our manuscript. If GPR116 activation by FNCD4 is indeed confirmed by an independent group in the future, particularly in the context of pulmonary physiology, it could represent an interesting model to evaluate the dependence on the tethered peptide sequence for this agonist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I am satisfied with the authors' response to my original comments, but I have some suggestions that would need to be addressed for ease of reading, accuracy, and reproducibility purposes regarding the newly added data in this revised version:</p><p>1. To avoid confusion, I would suggest adding &quot;Cell surface expression (Mean fluorescence)&quot; as the title for the Y axis of all graphs reporting results from surface exposed epitope in flow cytometry (Flag): Figure 3C, Figure 4 D, Figure 4 Supp figure 4D-E.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion – we changed the titles accordingly as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Likewise, I would suggest indicating &quot;Total expression (mean fluorescence)&quot; as the Y-axis title of all graphs reporting flow cytometry results from intracellular epitopes (V5/mCherry). Figure 4E, Figure 4 Supp Figure 4B.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion – we changed the titles accordingly as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Refrain from using the terms “membrane expression” when the methodology that has been used does not allow this determination exclusively since the immunocytochemistry protocol, as currently described in the methods section, involves a permeabilization step. This is the case in Figure 4 Supp figure 3A and 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>We reformulated these sentences as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please complete the newly added data with the corresponding information on reproducibility parameters (# of independent experiments, define error bars). Error bar descriptions and/or # of independent experiments are missing for various figures involving functional assays or for expression quantifications by western blot or flow cytometry (western blot quantifications do not display errors? Was it done just once? Justify if this is the case as stable cell lines can show decaying expression with time). These include: Figure 3F; Figure 3 Supp Figure 1 and 2; Figure 4; Figure 4 Supp Figure 1B,3B,3D, 4B-E; Figure 5A,B,E; Figure 5 Supp Figure 1B; Figure 6B-C; Figure 6 Supp Figure 1C; Figure 7; Figure 10 (error is SD or SEM?).</p></disp-quote><p>We added in all required figure legends the details on the presented data (average +/- SD; number of independent experiments and technical replicates). With respect to quantification of receptor expression by Western blot or flow cytometry: we performed these experiments in parallel to one of the functional experiments, to relate the two readouts. Two notable exceptions are Figure 4 Suppl Fig4D and Fig6 Suppl1C, which were run independently of functional assays; this flow cytometry experiment and western blot were therefore performed with freshly thawed vials of early passages, exactly for the reason mentioned by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The use of the term “biological replicates” seems incorrect throughout figure legends as they seem to indicate technical replicates instead. One experiment done at the same time is a n=1 that might include various replicates of each different groups, considered technical replicates; when the same experiment is done more than once at different times experiments are considered biological replicates. For example, the legend for Figure 4F indicates 3 independent experiments with 4 biological replicates but instead should read as 3 independent experiments done in quadruplicates or 4 technical replicates. Please revise where relevant and correct if this is the case or add if it is missing (For example Fig3F, Figure 3 Sup Figure 1, and others are missing replicates data).</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the figure legends accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.
