Blood flow to the affected tissue must be restored quickly if viability and function are to be preserved. We report that disruption of the mixed-lineage protein kinase (MLK) - cJun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in endothelial cells causes severe blockade of blood flow and failure to recover in the murine femoral artery ligation model of hindlimb ischemia. We show that the MLK-JNK pathway is required for the formation of native collateral arteries that can restore circulation following arterial occlusion. Disruption of the MLK-JNK pathway causes decreased Dll4/Notch signaling, excessive sprouting angiogenesis, and defects in developmental vascular morphogenesis. Our analysis demonstrates that the MLK-JNK signaling pathway is a key regulatory mechanism that protects against ischemia in arterial occlusive disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18414.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18414.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18414.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A blocked artery can have serious health consequences. For example, heart attacks and strokes are caused by such blockages. Artery blockages are harmful because tissues and organs are supplied with oxygen carried in blood cells and without adequate oxygen they may suffer damage or even die. The body has back up arteries or collateral arteries that help to mitigate the damage caused by a blood flow blockage. These arteries normally do not deliver blood to tissues. However, if an artery becomes blocked, these arteries can provide new and efficient routes of blood flow that can bypass the blockage.</p><p>How well patients fair after an artery blockage depends on them having a working system of collateral arteries. These collateral vessels must quickly spring into action and even widen to accommodate adequate blood flow. However, little is known about how the collateral arteries are formed.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that an enzyme called cJun NH2-terminal kinase (or JNK for short) was essential for the formation of new blood vessels. Now, Ramo et al. show that while JNK is essential for the formation of collateral arteries during development, it is not required for the formation of blood vessels in adults. In the experiments, mice were genetically engineered to lack genes encoding two types of JNK in the cells that line the blood vessels. When these mice became adults they were still able to produce new blood vessels, just like normal mice. But the genetically engineered mice were missing the healthy collateral arteries that mice normally have in their muscles.</p><p>Next, Ramo et al. blocked arteries in the muscles of mice and found that mice without JNK suffered worse injuries than normal mice. Further experiments showed that JNK helps to regulate genes that control blood vessel formation during early development. Without JNK, developing blood vessels grow into poorly organized networks instead of forming normal collateral arteries. The experiments suggest that humans who have mutations in the genes for JNK or related genes may be more susceptible to the harmful effects of artery blockages in the muscles. More studies are now needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18414.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18414.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>JNK</kwd><kwd>MLK</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>collaterogenesis</kwd><kwd>collateral arteries</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK107220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Roger J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL09122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keaney</surname><given-names>John F</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigatorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Roger J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The kinase JNK is required in endothelial cells for the development of native collateral arteries.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease result from arterial occlusion that blocks blood flow leading to severe tissue ischemia and necrosis. To prevent loss of tissue viability and function, blood flow to the affected tissue must be restored quickly. Collaterals are artery-to-artery or arteriole-to-arteriole interconnections that can bypass an occlusion by providing an alternative route for blood flow to the affected tissue that restores tissue homeostasis and limits tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoniucci et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simons and Eichmann, 2015</xref>). Indeed, clinical outcome in patients with arterial occlusion depends on the presence of an adequate collateral circulation and animal models of arterial occlusion provide strong evidence for the critical importance of the extent of the native (pre-existing) collateral circulation in restoring blood perfusion and limiting ischemic sequelae following arterial occlusion.</p><p>Adequate restoration of blood flow depends on collateral artery size, number, and the pattern of connectivity, but also on functional adaptation to changes in blood flow. Following arterial occlusion, more blood flow is diverted to the collateral circulation and this increased flow and sheer stress in collateral arteries initiates a number of processes that result in the outward remodeling (arteriogenesis) of these vessels into efficient conductance arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Royen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simons and Eichmann, 2015</xref>). Collateral artery remodeling involves multiple cellular processes, including endothelial cell activation and proliferation, monocyte/macrophage recruitment and smooth muscle cell proliferation, all of which contribute to increased collateral artery diameter, including increased thickness of the tunica media. These structural and functional adaptations depend on the presence of the native collateral circulation.</p><p>Although the collateral circulation is crucially important for the protective response to arterial occlusive diseases, little is known about the cellular and morphogenetic processes, or the molecular factors and mechanisms, that contribute to native collateral artery formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoniucci et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simons and Eichmann, 2015</xref>). However, studies of leptomenengial (or pial) collateral arteries in the brain have provided significant insight. Murine pial collaterals are established during embryonic development with some remodeling and maturation continuing postnatally. The process of native collateral artery formation during embryogenesis has been termed collaterogenesis and involves a number of molecules including, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), gap junction protein, connexin37 (Cx37) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fang et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2012</xref>), prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takeda et al., 2011</xref>), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai and Faber, 2010</xref>), chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chalothorn et al., 2009</xref>), and Synectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moraes et al., 2013</xref>).

Our approach was to study the effect of compound gene disruption in endothelial cells to prevent JNK signaling in mice. We did not find that JNK signaling was required for angiogenesis in vitro or in adult mice, but JNK signaling is required for proper vascular morphogenesis and the normal formation of collateral arteries in muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We tested the role of the JNK signaling pathway in endothelial cells using a conditional gene ablation strategy.

This procedure causes hypoxia in the calf muscles that stimulates angiogenesis, but the proximal adductor muscles experience little or no hypoxia because of blood flow redistribution by the native collateral circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deindl et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We ligated the femoral artery (FA) between the proximal caudal femoral artery (PCFA) and the popliteal artery (PA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kochi et al., 2013</xref>); this is a mild version of the FAL procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Laser Doppler imaging revealed ~80% decreased blood perfusion to the ligated limbs of control mice; blood perfusion was restored to ~60% of the contralateral limbs by day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These mice did not exhibit major hallmarks of ischemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). In contrast, E<sup>3KO</sup> mice showed complete blockade of blood flow following occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) leading to severe necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Ligation of the FA more proximally at its origin (a more severe form of FAL) also demonstrated increased blood flow blockade and failure to recover in both E<sup>2KO</sup> and E<sup>3KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A–C</xref>). In contrast, no post-FAL phenotype was detected in mice with JNK1 or JNK2-deficiency alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6D</xref>) or in mice with JNK1 plus JNK2-deficiency in hematopoietic cells or muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6G–I</xref>). These data suggest that JNK1/2 in endothelial cells play a key role in the response to arterial occlusion.

Moreover, contraction and endothelium-dependent relaxation responses in aortic explants from E<sup>3KO</sup> and control mice were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7D</xref>).

Two highly stereotypic superficial arteries (gracilis collaterals) extend along the gracilis muscle in the medial aspect of the thigh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Gracilis collaterals were identified as two lumenized continuous arteries that connected the PCFA to the saphenous artery (SA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) and expanded radially during the post-FAL response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>).

Micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis confirmed reduced collateral artery size and continuity in the limbs of E<sup>3KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8A</xref>).

While large caliber vessels, including the FA/SA and PCFA, were established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>), distinct collaterals directly interconnecting the PCFA and SA were not formed at E16.5 and the gracilis muscle was covered by a capillary plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Prominent vessels do emerge from the PCFA and the SA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), but did not extend along the gracilis muscle as distinct collaterals; instead, these vessels branched and appeared to continue into the capillary plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Gracilis collaterals may therefore form through a plexus intermediate. Remodeling of vessels within this plexus likely leads to the formation of collateral arteries in close apposition to nerve fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This process of maturation appears to start at the two distal ends, where the future gracilis collaterals emerge from the PCFA and the SA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, arrowheads) and continue toward the middle of the muscle; a pattern of remodeling that likely reflects the blood flow characteristics of these vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meisner et al., 2013</xref>). Studies of E16.5 E<sup>3KO</sup> embryos demonstrated that the gracilis muscle capillary plexus was hyperbranched, denser, and disorganized with vessels of variable width that elaborated more filopodia than control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). This observation suggests that the failure of collateral artery formation in E<sup>3KO</sup> mice may be caused by defective sprouting angiogenesis that initially generates a hyperbranched, denser, and more chaotically organized plexus that fails to properly remodel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>JNK regulates vessel sprouting during developmental angiogenesis</title><p>To test whether JNK-deficiency caused endothelial cell hypersprouting, we examined retinal vascular development during the early postnatal period because this is a well-characterized system that enables analysis of sprouting angiogenesis in a vascular plexus that initially extends from the center towards the periphery of the retina in two dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>). Analysis of retinal flatmounts from P6 E<sup>3KO</sup> mice demonstrated significantly reduced radial extension of the vascular plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C,L</xref>). Closer examination demonstrated higher vascular density in the growing angiogenic front of the mutant retinas compared to littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–G,H,J,M</xref>). Vascular extension in the retina occurs through the coordinated interaction, migration, and proliferation of endothelial tip and stalk cells together with non-endothelial cells, including pericytes, that stabilize the vascular plexus. We found no differences in vessel pericyte coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>); however, the angiogenic front of the mutant retinas included larger numbers of tip cells and a larger number of filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–K,N,O</xref>).

However, these responses were suppressed in JNK-deficient endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Indeed, reduced Dll4 protein expression by E<sup>3KO</sup> endothelial cells was observed in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>).

We found that JNK is not required for angiogenesis or arteriogenesis in adult mice. However, JNK plays an essential role during developmental vascular morphogenesis, including the formation of native collateral arteries that provide an alternate route for blood flow and serve to protect against ischemic tissue damage. This action of JNK is mediated by the MLK signaling pathway. Defects in the MLK-JNK pathway result in the loss of muscle collateral circulation and profoundly suppress protective responses to arterial occlusion.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Collateral artery development</title><p>Studies of the development of leptomeningeal (or pial) collaterals that interconnect the medial, anterior and posterior cerebral artery trees in the brain have provided evidence that these collaterals form during embryonic development starting at ~E13.5 as sprout-like extensions of endothelial cells from arterioles of existing cerebral artery trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lucitti et al., 2012</xref>). These nascent vessels appear to course above the pial capillary plexus and fuse with an arteriole from an adjacent arterial tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lucitti et al., 2012</xref>). By E15.5, a portion of these collaterals have acquired expression of the arterial marker EphrinB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalothorn and Faber, 2010</xref>). Pial collateral density peaks ~E18.5 and is followed by extensive remodeling, maturation and pruning that continues postnatally, achieving adult form and density by P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalothorn and Faber, 2010</xref>). The process of collateral artery formation during embryonic development has been termed collaterogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chalothorn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faber et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about the development of the collateral arteries in muscle. Our studies focused on the development of the gracilis collateral arteries. We found that a vascular plexus is formed between the proximal caudal femoral artery (PCFA) and the saphenous artery (SA) at ≤ E16.5 before gracilis collaterals are detected at ≤ P0 and covered with smooth muscle at ≤ P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This observation suggests that gracilis collaterals may be formed through a plexus intermediate by selection and maturation within a pre-formed capillary network that separates adjacent arteries. The presence of nerve fibres may contribute to this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Developmental defects in gracilis collateral development were observed in mice with JNK deficiency in endothelial cells. The vascular plexus between adjacent arteries at E16.5 in JNK-deficient mice is denser and more chaotically organized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Highly variable vessel thickness and increased numbers of filopodia are also evident in the JNK-deficient vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similar defects were observed in the developing retinal vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). At P0, continuous and distinct gracillis collateral vessels interconnecting the PCFA to the SA were fully formed in control mice, but the analogous vessels in the gracillis muscle of JNK-deficient mice were defective with extensive branching into smaller vessels that appeared to enter the capillary circulation. These observations indicated that an endothelial cell patterning defect may account for the absence of gracillis collateral arteries in the JNK-deficient mice. Hypersprouting represents one aspect of this patterning defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and reduced Dll4 – Notch signaling may significantly contribute to this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>VEGF and Notch signaling in JNK-deficient vascular endothelium</title><p>The formation of properly organized vascular networks is essential for function and requires the coordinated interaction of numerous factors and signaling pathways that regulate diverse cellular processes. VEGF signaling promotes endothelial cell survival, proliferation and motility while Dll4–Notch signaling suppresses VEGF signaling, in part, by regulating VEGFR expression. These interactions between VEGF and Notch signaling underly the specification of endothelial cell phenotypes during angiogenesis, including highly motile tip cells that extend numerous filopodia and trailing stalk cells with low motility that form the lumen of nascent tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roca and Adams, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>).

Excessive sprouting angiogenesis may contribute to the critical requirement for MLK – JNK signaling during native collateral artery development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and this phenotype may result from promotion of Dll4 expression by MLK – JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Fiona Watt as the Reviewing and Senior Editor.

The authors perform a number of in vivo experiments focusing on the loss of <italic>JNK</italic> (1/2 &amp; 1/2/3) as well as upstream MAP kinases, MLK1 and 2, to determine the necessity of proper compensatory angiogenic responses. While it is initially shown that <italic>JNK</italic> and MLK loss results in improper collateral circulation in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1 &amp; 2</xref>), it is later demonstrated to be induced by developmental defects during vascular development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), causing the study to pivot to a focus on vessel sprouting in developmental angiogenesis. Using a model of retinal angiogenesis, the authors demonstrate that loss of <italic>JNK</italic> signaling leads to increases in filopodia and tip cells with no differences in pericyte coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and follow-up gene expression studies of primary endothelial <italic>JNK</italic> knockouts point to defects in Dll4/Notch signaling as the primary mechanism for alterations in sprouting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The investigation of <italic>JNK</italic> signaling in vascular development is thorough and provides various outstanding technical approaches.</p><p>Required revisions:</p><p>1) Given common origins of hematopoietic and vascular compartments, some work could be done to determine if vascular defects from lost <italic>JNK</italic> signaling are specific to endogenous mature endothelial cells or changes in endothelial progenitor cells.</p><p>2) Some investigation of monocyte/macrophage distribution (in hindlimb muscle and circulation) and phenotype at steady state and after induction of ischaemia in <italic>JNK</italic> deficient mice is required. These cells are key regulators of collateralization.</p><p>3) The authors should discuss the translational value of their work. Would they expect to find deficiencies in the MLK-<italic>JNK</italic> pathway in patients with critical limb ischaemia, for example? Could any of the findings of this study inform novel endeavors to promote collateralisation in these patients? Would it be possible to identify patients with peripheral arterial disease that do not benefit from extensive native collaterals and would therefore be at risk of developing critical limb ischaemia?</p><p>4) One mouse in the E<sup>3KO</sup> group had a normal limb after femoral artery ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). How can the authors explain this in view of the severe phenotype demonstrated in the other mice in that group? Was the ligation carried out correctly in this mouse?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18414.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Required revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Given common origins of hematopoietic and vascular compartments, some work could be done to determine if vascular defects from lost JNK signaling are specific to endogenous mature endothelial cells or changes in endothelial progenitor cells.</italic> </p><p>The common origins of the hematopoietic and endothelial compartments raise questions concerning the possible role for early hematopoietic progenitor cells in the hind limb ischemia response. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of <italic>Jnk</italic> gene ablation in hematopoietic stem cells using Vav1-cre; this analysis demonstrated that <italic>JNK</italic>-deficiency in hematopoietic stem cells caused no change in recovery from hind limb ischemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>The Cdh5-cre driver we used may cause gene ablation in both endothelial progenitor cells and mature endothelial cells. Consequently, the phenotype we describe could result from <italic>JNK</italic>-deficiency in either of these cell types. To test whether <italic>JNK</italic>-deficiency in endothelial cells is required for the failure to recover from hind limb ischemia, we used an inducible Cdh5ERT2-cre driver to ablate <italic>Jnk</italic> genes in adult mice; this analysis demonstrated that <italic>JNK</italic>-deficiency in endothelial cells caused no change in recovery from hind limb ischemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This experiment demonstrates that there is no role for <italic>JNK</italic> in endothelial progenitor cells or mature endothelial cells in the response of adult mice to hind limb ischemia. <italic>JNK</italic> in adult mice therefore does not regulate revascularization mediated by either endothelial progenitor cells or mature endothelial cells.</p><p>Our analysis demonstrates that the failure to recover from hind limb ischemia caused by <italic>JNK</italic>-deficiency in endothelial cells reflects an embryonic developmental defect in collateral vessel formation. Whether this is caused by a primary defect in embryonic endothelial progenitor cells or a primary defect in embryonic mature endothelial cells is unclear. We note that most studies of endothelial progenitor cells (relevant to revascularization) have been done in adult animals rather than embryos. Moreover, the identity of Cdh5+ Flt4+ VEGFR2+ cells as endothelial progenitors or monocytoid cells that can adopt an endothelial-like phenotype is controversial. Given this background, we believe that it is beyond the scope of the present study to define roles for endothelial progenitor cells and mature endothelial cells during embryonic development of collateral vessels in muscle. However, we have obtained direct evidence for relevant defects caused by <italic>JNK</italic>-deficiency in mature endothelial cells, including reduced Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and increased hypersprouting during developmental angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>).</p><p>These data support the conclusion that <italic>JNK</italic>-deficiency in mature endothelial cells contributes to the embryonic developmental defect.</p><p> <italic>2) Some investigation of monocyte/macrophage distribution (in hindlimb muscle and circulation) and phenotype at steady state and after induction of ischaemia in JNK deficient mice is required. These cells are key regulators of collateralization.</italic> </p><p>We agree – monocyte/macrophages are implicated in post-occlusion collateral artery remodeling in adult mice. It is for this reason that we examined the effect of <italic>JNK</italic>-deficiency in hematopoietic cells (using Vav1-cre) and myeloid cells (using LysM-cre) in hindlimb ischemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6G &amp; 6H</xref>); this analysis demonstrated no role for <italic>JNK</italic> in macrophages during hind limb ischemia. We also examined macrophages in endothelial cell specific <italic>JNK</italic> knockout mice that fail to recover after hind limb ischemia. Flow cytometry demonstrated no significant differences in the number of circulating macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Moreover, no defect in macrophage recruitment to the calf muscle before and following hind limb ischemia in mice with endothelial cell-specific <italic>JNK</italic>-deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8E</xref>). It is most likely that the absence of a macrophage phenotype in our studies reflects the embryonic developmental origin of the defect in muscle collateral vessels that we describe (rather than collateral artery remodeling in adult mice).</p><p> <italic>3) The authors should discuss the translational value of their work. Would they expect to find deficiencies in the MLK-JNK pathway in patients with critical limb ischaemia, for example? Could any of the findings of this study inform novel endeavors to promote collateralisation in these patients? Would it be possible to identify patients with peripheral arterial disease that do not benefit from extensive native collaterals and would therefore be at risk of developing critical limb ischaemia?</italic></p><p>Thank you – this is an excellent point. Since the mechanism we describe reflects an embryonic developmental defect, it is not clear that our conclusions concerning the role of endothelial cell <italic>JNK</italic> during recovery from ischemia can be directly translated to adults with critical limb ischemia. However, germ-line mutations in <italic>JNK</italic> pathway genes in humans may contribute to increased risk for poor outcomes following exposure to an ischemic insult. The increased use of genomic sequencing in patient care may allow the identification of people with increased risk for ischemic injury. We have revised the manuscript in the Conclusion to note this point.</p><p> <italic>4) One mouse in the E<sup>3KO</sup> group had a normal limb after femoral artery ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). How can the authors explain this in view of the severe phenotype demonstrated in the other mice in that group? Was the ligation carried out correctly in this mouse?</italic></p><p>Our data policy is to report all observations. No data have been censored from the analysis presented in this manuscript. We do not know why one E<sup>3KO</sup> mouse exhibited a mild phenotype (no planatar flexion and necrosis of one toe) in this experiment. However, we believe that full disclosure and transparency of data presentation is a critical aspect of the scientific method.</p></body></sub-article></article>
