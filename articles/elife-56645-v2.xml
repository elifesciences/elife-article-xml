transmission are poorly understood. Recent data have shown that sensory stimuli elicit activity in ensembles of cortical neurons that recapitulate stereotyped spontaneous activity patterns. Here, we elucidate a possible mechanism by which gating of patterned population cortical activity occurs. In this study, sensory-evoked all-or-none cortical population responses were observed in the mouse auditory cortex in vivo and similar stochastic cortical responses were observed in a colliculo-thalamocortical brain slice preparation. Cortical responses were associated with decreases in auditory thalamic synaptic inhibition and increases in thalamic synchrony. Silencing of corticothalamic neurons in layer 6 (but not layer 5) or the thalamic reticular nucleus linearized the cortical responses, suggesting that layer 6 corticothalamic feedback via the thalamic reticular nucleus was responsible for gating stochastic cortical population responses. These data implicate a corticothalamic-thalamic reticular nucleus circuit that modifies thalamic neuronal synchronization to recruit populations of cortical neurons for sensory representations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory system</kwd><kwd>corticothalamic</kwd><kwd>medial geniculate body</kwd><kwd>thalamic reticular nucleus</kwd><kwd>NTSR1</kwd><kwd>thalamocortical</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>NIDCD</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llano</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>NIDCD</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DC014765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llano</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1515587</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llano</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sensory stimulation produces stochastic population responses in the cortex that are governed by layer 6 cortico-reticular projections that modulate thalamic synchrony.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our experience of the world relies on how sensory information is processed. Thalamocortical projections are critical for activation of the cerebral cortex, which is thought to contain the neural circuits that drive our conscious awareness of sensory stimuli. A classical view of thalamocortical function is that cortical activity during sensory perception is predictable based on activity in the thalamus and patterns of synaptic convergence of thalamocortical axons onto cortical neurons. Thus, sensory processing in this classical scheme behaves as a series of hierarchical linear filters, whose tuning is modified by feedback, creating more complex response properties that reach the level of conscious perception by activating the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vidyasagar and Eysel, 2015</xref>). However, this view does not comport with findings that population activity in sensory cortices is often stereotyped and recapitulates patterns of cortical spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MacLean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kenet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sakata and Harris, 2009</xref>). As such, a hypothesis has emerged that sensory representations are developed by early exposure to sensory stimuli and stored in the cortex within intracortical networks, and that the thalamus activates these pre-wired sensory representations upon sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MacLean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Petersen, 2005</xref>). Some observations that support this hypothesis are that spontaneous cortical activity is highly determined by the internal cortical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kenet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</xref>), and is not easily predictable from activity in thalamocortical afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MacLean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cossart et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, spontaneous cortical activity is the main substrate for the generation of the internal percepts during states without external sensory input, such as memory recall and dreaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takeuchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nir and Tononi, 2010</xref>). Further, despite substantial differences in the form and organization in the initial processing stages of different modalities of sensation, at the level of the thalamus and cortex, neural circuits across modalities are relatively homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shepherd, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Douglas et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that there is a common function of thalamocortical circuits that is not tied to specific modalities of perception.</p><p>Given that connected neuronal ensembles are likely the main functional unit for behavior and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uhlhaas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2010</xref>), a major control point for the activation of cortical ensembles, and therefore cognition more generally, may lie in the thalamus. Here, we examine the mechanisms by which all-or-none population responses (hereafter called âPopulation ONâ or âPopulation OFFâ responses) in the auditory cortex (AC) are gated. We find that gating of cortical activity occurs via corticothalamic projection to the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which is a long-enigmatic structure that partially surrounds and sends GABAergic projections to thalamocortical neurons. Further, we observed that population OFF responses in the AC are associated with increases in synaptic inhibition and neuronal desynchronization in the auditory thalamus. These findings suggest that one mode of thalamocortical function is to select groups of cortical neurons for activation based on feedback from cortical layer 6.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stochastic AC responses to sound presentations in vivo</title><p>Transcranial calcium imaging of the AC of an anesthetized GCaMP6s mouse following repeated presentations of a 5 kHz-37 dB SPL pure tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) revealed cortical activity in three distinct areas, the primary AC (A1), secondary AC (A2), and anterior auditory field (AAF), consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Issa et al., 2014</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, MATLAB code in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1scode1">Figure 1âsource code 1</xref>).

The auditory colliculo-thalamocortical (aCTC) mouse brain slice retains the synaptic connections between these structures: hence, electrical stimulation of the IC evoked neuronal activity in all of these brain structures as indicated by stimulus-evoked flavoprotein autofluorescence (FA) and calcium-dependent fluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâE</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>, (MATLAB codes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2scode1">Figure 2âsource code 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2scode2">2</xref>), show the average of the stimulus-evoked activity of the connected brain structures in the aCTC slice after 10 trials of IC stimulation. However, review of the individual time series of Îf/f of the stimulus-evoked FA and calcium signals across trials of IC stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">2</xref>) reveals stochastic responses in the AC; a pattern that was similar to the in vivo data, despite the fact that MGB, TRN, and IC were always responsive to IC stimulation.

This finding was consistent with whole-cell recording from MGB and TRN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), where spikes were seen in response to each stimulus irrespective of the presence of a population AC response.

Therefore, we investigated the source of these potential inhibitory inputs.

To test the specificity of corticothalamic layer 6-TRN pathway to modulate MGB activity, we performed a control experiment by inhibiting layer 5 corticothalamic cells, which do not have significant projections to the TRNÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crabtree, 2018</xref>). The injection of the AC of <italic>RBP4</italic>-Cre neonatal mice with halorhodopsin virus resulted in a successful Cre-dependent expression of eNpHR3.0 receptors in layer 5 cells as indicated by YFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). In contrast to layer 6 cells, the projections from layer five to MGB in the aCTC slice are sparse, as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llano and Sherman, 2008</xref>), so they are not well seen in the low-magnification image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). However, with high magnification, the layer 5 projections to MGB wereÂ observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with the previous data, the photoinhibition of layer 5 cells expressing eNpHR3.0 receptors by illumination with 565 nm light could not retrieve the missing cortical responses, indicated by no recovery of the post-stimulus LFP signals from L3/4 compared to control (no light) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata3">Figure 6âsource data 3</xref>, paired t-test: t(36) = 0.46, p=0.18, nÂ =Â 37 trials from four animals), which suggests that the population OFF cortical responses were specifically driven by MGB inhibition through corticothalamic layer 6-TRN pathway. To suppress feedforward inhibition, the IC of neonatal <italic>GAD2</italic>-Cre mice was injected with halorhodopsin-AAV virus (see Materials and methods) to induce the expression of halorhodopsin specifically in the GABAergic cells of the IC in a Cre-dependent manner. As expected, GABAergic cells of the IC as well as their projections to MGB expressed halorhodopsin indicated by the presence of YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). Photoinhibition of GABAergic cells of the IC by illumination with 565 nm light was not able to retrieve the missing cortical responses as indicated by no recovery of the post-stimulus LFP signals recorded from L3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O and P</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata4">Figure 6âsource data 4</xref>, Paired t-test: t(6)Â = â1.03, p=0.34, nÂ =Â 7 trials from five animals). Accordingly, based on the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>, we conclude that the population OFF cortical responses were most likely driven by the feedback inhibition of MGB by corticothalamic layer 6 cells via TRN.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We observed stochastic population cortical responses in the mouse AC following the presentations of pure tones in vivo or electrical stimulation of the IC in vitro. Population ON responses were associated with synchronized responses among MGB cells, whereas population OFF responses were associated with TRN-mediated inhibition at the level of the MGB, under the control of layer 6 corticothalamic projections. Other inhibitory projections to the MGB from the IC had no impact on the probability of eliciting a population ON response. It is unlikely that population OFF cortical responses were a sign of cortical adaptation, because adaptation responses are generally characterized by gradual decrease of the response amplitude, rather than the all-or-none responses observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abolafia et al., 2011</xref>). We conclude from these findings that layer 6 corticothalamic neurons gate population activity in the AC via their projections to TRN, which desynchronize MGB neurons. Previous work has suggested that corticothalamic axons, via the strong inhibition to thalamocortical cells by way of the TRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crandall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paz and Huguenard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Steriade et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guillery and Harting, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McAlonan et al., 2008</xref>), control thalamocortical information flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Destexhe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). In the current study, the gating mechanism appears to involve TRN-based desynchronization of thalamocortical neurons rather than diminishing the overall thalamic response, which is consistent with previous findings showing that the TRN can desynchronize thalamocortical cells via multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pita-Almenar et al., 2014</xref>). This explanation is also consistent with our finding that direct electrical stimulation of the thalamus did not lead to stochastic AC response because direct electrical stimulation is likely to elicit highly synchronous responses among MGB neurons. It is also possible that silencing layer six corticothalamic neurons led to changes in likelihood of activating the AC via intracortical connections of <italic>NTSR1</italic>-positive neurons. Future work involving selective silencing of corticoreticular terminals vs. corticocortical terminals will be needed to distinguish between these possibilities. It will also be important to determine if the mechanisms observed in the current slice data are also seen in adult animals. Juveniles were used to maximize slice connectivity, but now that specific hypotheses may be proposed, elements of the proposed thalamocortical gating mechanisms can be examined in adult preparations. We also note that population OFF cortical responses in the current study were never initiated by the first stimulation of the IC. Rather they were always elicited by the subsequent IC stimulation, which suggests that population OFF cortical responses occurred only after evoked cortical activity that could change the internal dynamics of the cortical cells. Moreover, the strong association between the high probability of the OFF cortical responses and the low level of stimulation suggests that cortico-reticulothalamic control of thalamocortical transmission is most likely to be effective when signal-to-noise ratio is low. This finding is consistent with the notion that top-down modulation is mostly required for the attentional modulation of weak signals and that highly salient signals rely on bottom-up mechanisms to activate perceptual representations (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asilador and Llano, 2020</xref>).Â Classical models have viewed sensory processing stations, including the thalamus and cortex, as a series of feedforward, hierarchically organized filters whereby combinations of receptive fields produce increasingly selective feature detectors, culminating in uniquely selective neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vidyasagar and Eysel, 2015</xref>). This type of organization implies that moment-to-moment perception is a reflection of detailed streams of information coursing through ascending sensory systems, to be consciously perceived when those streams engage highly selective cells in the cortex. An alternative view is that ascending information is used to create and modify a bank of sensory representations that are recruited depending on behavioral needs, and that conscious perception reflects activation of these pre-wired circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ringach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">LlinÃ¡s, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mishkin, 1982</xref>). Thus, conscious perception may involve the release of stereotyped patterns of cortical activity. One potential role of thalamocortical transmission in this model is to select cortical ensembles rather than impress sensory information upon them. Our data suggest that at the thalamocortical level, sensory inputs activate stereotyped patterns of population cortical activity. Future work in awake preparations will help to establish whether population ON responses correspond to perception of sensory stimuli.</p><p>Critical for any such mechanism of control of cortical ensembles is a means by which those ensembles are selected. The current data suggest that the TRN, under the control of layer 6 projections, gates populations of thalamic neurons by desynchronizing their responses, decreasing the likelihood of engendering a population cortical response. A mechanism of TRN-based modification of thalamic synchrony to activate the cortex has been proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saalmann and Kastner, 2011</xref>) and is consistent with the finding that synchronized populations of thalamic neurons are required to optimally activate the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruno and Sakmann, 2006</xref>) and that the TRN is at the heart of a prefrontal cortex-based mechanism to shape cortical activation under changing cognitive demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zikopoulos and Barbas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wimmer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yingling and Skinner, 1975</xref>). Further, the TRN receives inputs from basal forebrain, amygdala and non-reciprocally linked regions of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lam and Sherman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lam and Sherman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crabtree et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crabtree and Isaac, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DesÃ®lets-Roy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zikopoulos and Barbas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizenberg et al., 2019</xref>), forming an assortment of inputs to potentially modulate TRN, and ultimately select cortical circuits for activation. Given the putative role of the TRN in the selection of thalamic, and therefore cortical circuits during sensory perception, one would predict that disruption of TRN activity could lead to uncontrolled release of patterns of cortical activity. Consistent with this idea, ample evidence has accumulated to suggest that schizophrenia, a disease characterized by the presence of auditory hallucinations, involves disruption of the TRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pratt and Morris, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Young and Wimmer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bencherif et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Light and Braff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferrarelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrarelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wamsley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here, we describe a unique stimulus-evoked population cortical all-or-none response, which suggests that thalamus recruits cortical ensembles of pre-wired sensory representations upon external stimulation in conjunction with internal cortical dynamics of corticothalamic neurons.

All surgical procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animals were housed in animal care facilities approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>In vivo imaging</title><p>The detailed procedures have been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yudintsev et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, adult GCaMP6s mice were used for transcranial in vivo imaging of evoked calcium signals from the left AC. For each experiment, the mouse was anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, respectively) delivered intraperitoneally. The animalâs body temperature was maintained within the range of 35.5Â°C and 37Â°C using a DC temperature controller (FHC, ME, USA). Mid-sagittal and mid-lateral incisions were made to expose the dorsal and lateral aspects of the skull along with the temporalis muscle. The temporalis muscle was separated from the skull to expose the ventral parts of the underlying AC. The site was cleaned with sterile saline, and the surface of the skull was thinned by a surgical drill. A small amount of dental cement (3M ESPE KETAC) was mixed to a medium level of viscosity and added to the head of the bolt just enough to cover it. A head-bolt was bonded to the top of the skull, and the dental cement was allowed to set. An Imager 3001 integrated data acquisition and analysis system (Optical Imaging Ltd., Israel) was used to image the cortical responses to sound in mice. A macroscope consisting of 85 mm f/1.4 and 50 mm f/1.2 Nikon lenses was mounted to an Adimec 1000 m high-end CCD camera (7.4 Ã 7.4 Âµm pixel size, 1004 Ã 1004 resolution), and centered above the left AC, focused approximately 0.5 mm below the surface of the exposed skull. Acoustic stimuli were generated using a TDT system three with an RP 2.1 enhanced real-time processor and delivered via an ES1 free field electrostatic speaker (Tucker-Davis Technologies, FL, USA), located approximately 8 cm away from the contralateral ear. All imaging experiments were conducted in a sound-proof chamber and images were obtained at 10 frames per second. Each trial of sound presentation was composed of two conditions (10 s each); Condition 0 (C0), where there is no sound and condition 1 (C1), where there is a 500 ms sound presentation that comes after 5 s from the onset of the C1. For imaging, the blue light exposure was only on during the 10 s of each trial, and there was a 5 s interval between the two conditions during which the blue light was off. This intermittent schedule of the blue light exposure was done to lower the likelihood of photobleaching. 500 ms pure tones of 5 kHz, at 37, 44, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, orÂ 80 dB SPL were used for acoustic stimulation. The response window was set as one second starting from the 5<sup>th</sup> second for C0 or from the onset of sound for C1. The Îf/f of the response window was computed as the difference between Îf/f<sub>0</sub> (C0) and Îf/f<sub>1</sub> (C1) using a custom MATLAB code (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1scode1">Figure 1âsource code 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Virus injection</title><p>To modulate specific cell types, Cre recombinase-expressing mice were used to provide an expression of opto- or chemo-genetic probes in those specific cells 11 days after viral injection at P4. The detailed procedures have been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huynh et al., 2020</xref>). For all neonates, cryoanesthesia was induced after five to ten minutes. A toe pinch was done to confirm that the mice were fully anesthetized. A small animal stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) was used with a universal syringe holder (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) and standard ear bars with rubber tips (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) were used to stabilize the head. The adaptor stage was cooled by adding ethanol and dry ice to an attached well. A temperature label (RLC-60-26/56, Omega, Norwalk, CT) was attached to the stage to provide the temperature of the stage during cooling. The temperature was kept above 2Â°C to prevent hypothermia or cold-induced skin damage of the neonatal mice and below 8Â°C to sustain cryoanesthesia. Glass micropipettes (3.5-inches, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) were pulled using a micropipette puller (P-97, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and broken back to a tip diameter between 35Â andÂ 50 Î¼m.</p><p>The micropipette was filled with mineral oil (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA) and attached to a pressure injector (Nanoliter 2010, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) connected to a pump controller (Micro4 Controller, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL).

The tip was lowered to 1.2 mm from the brain surface and was then pulled back to 1.0 mm for the first injection where 200 nL of halorhodopsin-AAV or DREADDs-AAV was injected at 200 nL/min. After the injection was finished, the micropipette was left in the brain for 1 min before removing to allow the injectate to settle into the brain. Following the first injection, the tip was pulled back stepwise in 0.1 mm increments, and 200 nL of the injectate was injected at every step until the tip reached 0.3 mm from the surface. In total, 1600 nL of AAV was injected into the AC. The incision was sutured using 5/0 thread size, nylon sutures (CP Medical, Norcross, GA). To target the GABAergic cells of the inferior colliculus (IC), the IC of <italic>GAD2</italic>-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lammel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Villalobos et al., 2018</xref>) neonatal mice was injected with halorhodopsin-AAV following the same procedures shown above, but the micropipette loaded by halorhodopsin-AAV was located over the IC at the left hemisphere at 2.0 mm posterior to lambda and 1.0 mm laterally from the midline. The neonates were transferred back onto a warming pad to recover. After 5â7 min, their skin color was returned to normal, and they started moving. After recovery, all neonates were returned to their nest with the parents.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Brain slicing</title><p>For all in vitro experiments, 15-Â toÂ 18-day-old mice were initially anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/ kg) and xylazine (3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and transcardially perfused with chilled (4Â°C) sucrose-based slicing solution containing the following (in mM): 234 sucrose, 11 glucose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. After the brain was removed from the skull, it was cut to obtain auditory colliculo-thalamocortical brain slice (aCTC) as shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Slater et al., 2015</xref>). 600 Î¼m thick horizontal brain slices were obtained to retain the connectivity between IC, MGB, TRN and AC. All slices were incubated for 30 min at 33Â°C in a solution composed of (in mM: 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 10 glucose, 126 NaCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>). After incubation, all slices were transferred to a perfusion chamber coupled to an upright Olympus BX51 microscope, perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 10 glucose, 126 NaCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Another set of experiments was done in a different laboratory to exclude any experimental factors related to our laboratory environment, chemicals, or anesthesia. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krause et al., 2014</xref>), following full anesthesia by isoflurane, a C57BL/6J mouse was immediately decapitated without cardiac perfusion, the animalâs brain was extracted and immersed in cutting artificial CSF [cACSF; composed of (in mM) 111 NaCl, 35 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, 1.8 KCl, 1.05 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.8 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 glucose] at 0â4Â°C. Slices were maintained in cACSF at 24Â°C forÂ &gt;1 hr before transfer to the recording chamber, which was perfused at 3â6 ml/min with ACSF [composed of (in mM) 111 NaCl, 35 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, 1.8 KCl, 2.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.4 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 KH2PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 glucose]. All of the solutions were bubbled with 95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide and all experiments were done at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrical stimulation</title><p>All the electrical stimulation protocols in the IC evoked similar cortical response patterns. One second electrical train pulses of (250 ÂµA, 40 Hz, 1 ms pulse width) to IC was the main stimulating protocol as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ibrahim et al., 2017</xref>). However, one second durations of electrical stimulation were not suitable for electrophysiology experiments because responses were intermingled with the stimulus artifact. Therefore, for whole-cell and LFP recording, the stimulation of IC was done with a single 3 ms pulse (300â500 Î¼Î) or 100 ms long trains of pulses (250 ÂµA, 40 Hz, 1 ms pulse width) were used. The electrical stimulation was done using a concentric bipolar electrode (Cat#30201, FHC) every 10â20 s. The parameters of the electrical pulses were adjusted by a B and K precision wave generator (model # 4063) and World Precision Instruments stimulation isolator (A-360). In another stimulation set up (Our collaboratorâs laboratory), a biphasic current pulse (200 ÂµA, 5 ms; STG4002 stimulator, Multichannel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) was delivered to IC at 0.05 Hz using bipolar tungsten electrodes (100 Kâ¦, FHC Inc, Bowdoin, ME).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Imaging</title><p>For calcium imaging in vitro, slices from GCaMP6s mice or wild-type mice loaded with CAL-520, AM (Abcam, ab171868) calcium dye were used. For CAL-520, AM calcium dye loading, the aCTC slices were incubated in 48 Âµl of DMSO dye solutionÂ +2 Âµl of Pluronic F-127 (Cat# P6866, Invitrogen) in 2.5 ml of the incubating solution at 35â36Â°C for 25â28 min according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacLean and Yuste, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yuste et al., 2011</xref>. The slices then were incubated in normal incubating solution (shown above) for 30 min to wash the extra dye. Imaging was done under ACSF perfusion as described before. Depending on the experiment, the evoked calcium or flavoprotein autofluorescence (FA) signals following IC stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ibrahim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shibuki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shibuki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Husson et al., 2007</xref>) were measured using a stable DC fluorescence illuminator (Prior Lumen 200) and a U-M49002Xl E-GFP Olympus filter cube set (excitation: 470â490 nm, dichroic 505 nm, emission 515 nm long pass, 100 ms exposure time for FA and 5 ms for calcium signals). All data were collected using Retiga EXi camera at a frame rate of 4 Hz for FA and 10 Hz. The time trace of the FA or calcium population signals were obtained by placing regions of interest (ROI) over brain regions (IC, MGB, TRN or AC). The collected time traces were used to compute the Îf/f. For the calcium signals obtained from cortical or thalamic cells, the ROIs were manually made around the cell body. A strong correlation between voltage and calcium signals validated the calcium signals obtained from thalamic cells containing CAL-520 dye after simultaneous whole-cell recording and calcium imaging following the injection of a positive current to the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The average background value was calculated by drawing an ellipse with radii 2.25 times that of the original ROI and subtracting all cell ROI from that ellipse to eliminate overlap. Finally, the Îf/f was computed after 40% of the background value was subtracted from the cell's average value for neuropil correction. Îf/f was computed using the average signal of a 2 s period before the stimulus onset. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>, the ON-cortical responses were determined following two criteria. Each signal required a rising and falling phase as well as a z-score greater than 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Pharmacological intervention</title><p>To inhibit GÎÎÎÎ receptors globally, GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yaron-Jakoubovitch et al., 2013</xref>), gabazine (Cat# 1262, Tocris) was added to the bath ACSF solution 200 nM, which is near the synaptic IC50 for this compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindquist et al., 2005</xref>). To specifically inhibit the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in either MGB or AC, a continuous flow of gabazine (400 nM) was injected into MGB or AC in a counterbalanced manner through a glass pipette (broken tip, 35 Âµm) which was connected to a picospritzer (Toohey Company, New Jersey, USA). The pipette was filled by a solution composed of 1 ml ACSFÂ +10 ÂµL Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide, sodium salt dye (Cat#A10438, Invitrogen) to visualize the flow of the solution and to ensure that it was restricted to the site of injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The injection was done under 10 psi pressure for 5 min and continuously during imaging.

Voltage was clamped at â60 mV orÂ +10 mV to measure either the excitatory or inhibitory currents, respectively, using cesium-based intracellular solution (in mM: 117.0 CsOH, 117.0 gluconic acid, 11.0 CsCl, 1.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>*6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.07 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 11.0 EGTA, 10.0 HEPES, pH 7.3, 290 mOsm).Â Local field potential (LFP) recordings were performed using glass pipette with a broken tip 5â10 Âµm. LFP signals were filtered offline using Clampfit 10.7 software under Gaussian low pass frequency at 300 Hz as well as a notch filter at 60 Hz. A Multiclamp 700B amplifier and pClamp software (Molecular Devices) were used for data acquisition (20 kHz sampling). To analyze the distribution of the membrane potential of layer 4 cells during the UP state, a time period starting from the stimulation offset and including a similar time of both the cortical upstate event and the basal membrane potential was used. The sampling rate was reduced from 20 kHz to 2 kHz, and spikes and stimulus artifacts were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>For photoinhibition, the halorhodopsin eNpHR3.0 probe expressed selectively in either corticothalamic layer 6, layer 5, or IC-GABAergic cells, was activated by illuminating a yellow light (565 nm) obtained from DC fluorescence illuminator (Prior Lumen 200) and Olympus filter cube (U-MF2, Olympus, Japan). The same light was used to illuminate the brain slice with a layer six expressing eYFP only as a control for halorhodopsin. The light was set to illuminate the whole field of the LFP recording chamber using a 4X objective for three seconds extending from one second pre-stimulus and two seconds after the onset of IC stimulation. Based on the initial results related to the peri-stimulus dynamics of corticothalamic layer 6 cells and the post-stimulus cortical activity, 3 s of illumination was chosen to cover the time period one second before the onset of the stimulus as well as the post-stimulus period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Histology and confocal imaging</title><p>After collecting the aCTC slice from <italic>RBP4</italic>-Cre mouse injected with AAV9-FLEX-EGFP into the AC, the aCTC slice was placed in a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for fixation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel B Polley (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.

This is an important and surprising finding, which provides new insight into the role of corticothalamic circuits. These findings are based on a combination of in vivo and in vitro population recordings and make excellent use of a powerful slice preparation that allows the connectivity of the midbrain, thalamus and cortex to be explored. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about much of the study, they thought that the findings were not well presented and disagreed with some of your interpretations of the data. In particular, they were unanimous in their view that the sections dealing with gamma oscillations, thalamic synchrony and deep learning are weak and incomplete, and should be removed from the paper. They were also concerned that critical control groups (the use of a control fluorophore in the case of the halorhodopsin experiments and a CNO only group for the DREADDS study) are not reported. This is particularly important where such large injection volumes were used in very young mice. Consequently, it was felt that additional data as well as re-analysis and re-writing would be needed before this paper could be considered acceptable for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a nice paper that proposes a mechanism that allows for gating of population cortical activity.

Why must these hierarchical filters be linear?</p><p>Line 73. This formed complex hallucinations argument isn't really clear. Are you just arguing that a hierarchical linear filter model cannot explain anything that causes elevated activity in primary sensory cortices, that isn't present in subcortical stations?</p><p>Line 85. I'm not sure I agree with the statement that the thalamus is strikingly similar across modalities. The two references that are cited only discuss canonical cortical circuits.</p><p>Line 91. The statement &quot;all-or-none&quot; to describe the population response seems inadequate, given the variability in &quot;ON&quot; responses in Figure 1D.</p><p>Figure 1. Where do these ON/OFF responses fall within the trial presentations â are there any time dependence that could reflect photobleaching? There is also a large fraction of OFF responses that seem to be driven below baseline (in Figure 1D) â is this an artifact of the dF/F computation? On that note, the methods do not explain how you computed dF/F (there are different ways that one can do this).</p><p>Line 105. 37dB is quite a specific intensity â why did you choose this?</p><p>Line 108 and Line 110. You say &quot;to 10 presentations of the same tone&quot;, and &quot;across the 40 trials of the same sound presentation&quot;. It's not quite clear what is meant.</p><p>Line 123. Activating the IC and observing AC response is due to di-synaptic circuitry. Therefore, does the AC &quot;failure rate&quot; change with the intensity of the stimulation? Can you stimulate hard enough to overcome the thalamic inhibition that you claim mediates the OFF responses?</p><p>Figure 2E. Why is the dF/F in the MGB orders of magnitude lower than IC or ACtx?</p><p>Line 139. It's not immediately clear to me how are you getting single-cell resolution using this one-photon preparation? The images shown throughout are &quot;wide field&quot; population images. Are you able to show any cellular examples? Are you using some kind of NMF algorithm to achieve cellular resolution? How are you controlling for issues like neuropil contamination (that are ubiquitous in 2P data).</p><p>Line 146. On the issue of up states vs down states. If you histogram the membrane potential, is it bimodal to reflect the different states?</p><p>Line 155-160. This isn't particularly well described. What exactly is it being modeled here? It seems like you are performing a binary classification, e.g. using either MGB activity or striatum activity to predict whether the corresponding cortical response was ON or OFF? Why does this imply that network-level activity may determine whether an on or off response occurred? Why is the striatum region irrelevant (i.e. it is still (indirectly) connected the cortex via the thalamus, no?). Why the need to use such an advanced machine learning method? Did simpler binary classification tools fail? Does this method also give the same result when used on the GCaMP or whole cell recordings?</p><p>Figure 3B. Why are there are more OFF responses that appear in the wash condition? Can you add a third variable to Figure 3C to show this â shouldn't the wash be statistically indistinguishable from control?</p><p>Line 195. This is actually a question regarding choices throughout the paper â what dictated the choice of either flavoprotein or calcium? The deep learning results referenced here were established with flavoprotein, but these follow-up experiments use calcium.</p><p>Figure 4B. It's not quite clear what is going in this figure. Would some kind of population signal help? Or an alternative way to plot the data? Do these individual traces all have well-defined peak latencies (it's hard to tell from the figure). You're showing the variance of the peak latencies â but couldn't you just compare the peak latencies directly? Does it give the same result? Also, you talk about three categories in the text, but are only showing two categories in the figure. A latency analysis is also a little bit difficult to interpret with calcium data (both from the calcium timescale and the acquisition frame rate) â it might be a good idea to either discuss these limitations, since you are arguing for synchronicity based on a small reduction in variance within this data.</p><p>Line 195. &quot;Calcium signals of MGB cells were imaged following the stimulation of the IC during ON vs OFF cortical responses&quot; â is it not the IC stimulation that is causing the ON or OFF cortical responses?</p><p>Line 373 â &quot;The detailed procedures have been described before (77)&quot;. This seems like it may be the wrong citation? (77) is a theoretical conference paper with no in vivo imaging details.</p><p>Line 220 â Is there a particular reason to use neonates for the experiments in this section?</p><p>Figure S7. I'm slightly confused by the MGB of the RBP4-Cre mouse â it looks like there is no TRN labelling but also no MGB labelling?</p><p>Line 270. It's not possible to understand what you did here without jumping to the methods.</p><p>Line 274. Is there an intuitive reason why a shorter pre-stimulus period (which should contain more oscillatory information) be less predictive?</p><p>Line 276. &quot;A classifier?&quot; Can you justify your classifier choice here, compared to the more complicated deep learning approach used for classification earlier in the paper?</p><p>Figure S8. Based on the text, the gamma prediction is important to the circuit story. It may be a better idea to include it as a main figure?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>There is much to admire in the paper by Ibrahim and colleagues. They are the only lab in the world (to the best of my knowledge) that has worked out the geometry of a brain slab that leaves the synaptic connections intact from the midbrain-thalamus-MGB-TRN-cortex-back to TRN/MGB. Here, they use this slab to great effect by revitalizing the old cortical up/down state phenomenon in the context of all-or-nothing responses in A1 to stimulation of midbrain afferents. They have convinced me that the basic phenomenon is real and that it is interesting. Further, I am convinced that they can reduce the probability of OFF response trials by: (1) blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, (2) blocking AMPA receptors in TRN, (3) inactivating Ntsr1-Cre L6 CT neurons. They also have data to show that (4) inactivating feedforward inhibition from the IC or glutamatergic L5 projection neurons does not affect OFF response probability.</p><p>While there is a lot of good in this manuscript, there is plenty of bad and ugly as well. In their efforts to weave a complete theory of the phenomenon, they are forced to rely on a few very weak/poorly developed pieces of data. Emphasizing these more tenuous findings (Figure 4, Figure S4, Figure S8), ends up doing them a disservice because it takes away from their more solid observations. Apart from eliminating the dubious findings, the figures and the analysis are poorly organized, confusing and do not convey the process of processing the data from example cases to summary plots that relate to their statistics. They look more like lab meeting figures than manuscript figures.</p><p>In the final analysis, I think the work offers a significant conceptual advance based on an innovative technical approach. The manuscript can be substantially improved through eliminating the under-developed analyses, reorganizing the remaining figures and adding some additional analysis. The authors needn't feel compelled to oversell the reader on a complete comprehensive story when some of holes are not yet filled in. It's fine that some of the mechanisms are unknown so long as the shortcomings and caveats are clearly identified.</p><p>1. Figure 1 is potentially important but is not too convincing in its current form. One reason that it's important is that the rest of the manuscript is a developmental neuroscience study that is never acknowledges this fact. The intro and discussion with the talk of schizophrenia and hallucinations are too far-ranging for my taste, but particularly in the context that their study was performed in mice that had only been connected to the auditory world for less than 1 week. It would be very easy to write off the phenomenon they describe here as an oddity o development that would not apply to the mature cortex.</p><p>For me, this underscores the potential importance of Figure 1, where they demonstrate the phenomenon in vivo using older animals. The biggest impediments in its current form are (i) the age of the animals used for transcranial imaging is never mentioned. I presume they are adult? (ii) The entire analysis is based on a single tone frequency presented a single sound intensity that is very near threshold (5k at 37 dB SPL). This makes me question the generality of the principle described here. Having done this trial-by-trial analysis myself on this type of data, I don't think it really works for strong, suprathreshold stimulus intensities. Is this entire phenomenon restricted to a very narrow range of near-threshold intensities? In that caseâ¦is it really a phenomenon or just what happens near minimally effective stimulation levels (which is already very well known). Obviously, the same critique applies to the current levels they use for the rest of the study. It would have been nice to see a more systematic and quantitative examination of the stimulus parameters where this phenomenon is strong versus weak.</p><p>2. Imaging from &quot;single cells&quot;. Single cell imaging is not possible with epifluorescence illumination in a slice this thick, especially without neuropil removal. At best they are ROIs but even then, what is the value when there is no basis for the argument that their ROIs are independent response units? I suggest eliminating 2G, Figure 4 and Figure S4. The issues with Figure 4 (and S4) go way beyond the cellular resolution issues, they are uninterpretable for a number of reasons.</p><p>3. In Figure 2D, I'm not convinced that they are looking at signals from TRN cell bodies as opposed to thalamocortical/corticothalamic axons. The thalamic radiation forms a dense fascicle right at the point of the TRN in this plane so it could be very hard to distinguish between TRN cell bodies and axon signals with the optics they are using. Too bad they didn't express GCaMP in the GAD-Cre mice they use for inhibiting the feedforward inhibitory IC projection neurons.</p><p>4. Calcium imaging in the MGB and IC. Looking at other publications of the Thy1-GCaMP6 mouse, I see lots of labeling in pyramidal neurons in neocortex and hippocampus, but no labeling in the MGB or IC. I'm confused about what is being measured in Figure 2E. Maybe there is expression in younger mice or is just very faint?</p><p>5. Figure 3E-H (graphics could be greatly improved here) show that EPSCs in MGB are unchanged in cortical ON vs OFF trials but IPSCs are elevated in OFF trials. This is one of the mysteries of their study that they try to address with a bunch of uninterpretable analysis methods (Figure 4 and Figure S4). The conundrum they face is how does enhanced thalamic inhibition create a cortical OFF response without making the MGB excitatory response weaker? Figure 4 and S4 attempt to explain this but are contrived and unconvincing. I don't disagree but I would suggest that they are thinking about it too simplistically. It doesn't matter what the MGB cell bodies are doing, what matters is what they are transmitting to the cortex during OFF trials. It would be helpful if they quantified these data more carefully by looking at the relative timing of the IPSC and EPSC responses. Looking at the study by Reinhold, Lien and Scanziani 2015, the TRN can regulate sustained spiking and thalamocortical synaptic depression in ways that cannot be dismissed just by measuring the excitatory response. They don't have to fully answer this here. They can do the best with whatever straightforward analysis they can manage and then devote some space in the discussion to actually discussing alternative explanations for their experiments instead of rhapsodizing about how these data solve the greatest mysteries of the brain.</p><p>6. Figure 3K â It would be important to see the individual data points. The legend says the data are an n=5, reflecting 5 slices from 4 animals. How do you get two of these slices from one animal? Regardless, this is a very small sample to make such a strong conclusion as blocking cortical GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors does not affect the OFF response probability. Was the AC Gabazine always performed after the MGB wash? The order should be counterbalanced and really I'm not even sure what the justification is for using a t-test on a sample this small. Unclear how the assumptions of the test can really be determined.</p><p>7. I suggest putting all three of their halorhodopsin experiments into one figure (IC inhibitory feedforward neurons, L6 CT and L5 projection neurons). I'm also bothered that there isn't a control condition where mice have undergone a perinatal injection to express a control fluorophore. This seems particularly warranted because they injected an enormous volume of virus solution (1600 nL) into very small area. Apart from this control, while I think the L6 inactivation result is very interesting, I strongly disagree with their often repeated interpretation of the data, that &quot;Population OFF responses were associated with TRN-mediated inhibition at the level of the MGB, under the control of layer 6 corticothalamic projections&quot;.</p><p>Their data do not support this conclusion. Yes, blocking AMPA receptors in TRN reduced the probability and Yes, silencing L6 CT also reduced the probability but it is a logical fallacy to assume those are causally related. Ntsr1 neurons make synaptic contacts on TRN neurons, MGB neurons, local AC inhibitory neurons and local AC excitatory neurons. It is entirely possible that the Ntsr1 neurons are mediating this effect through local connections in the cortex and not through the descending projection. In that regard, it is a bit frustrating that the main point of the Guo 2017 study was the Ntsr1 neurons can strongly bias AC neurons to become less responsive to afferent activity via intracortical connections, yet these findings are not mentioned in this context.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, they might be right. But providing that the L6 CTs modify MGB via TRN would require a different type of experiment to isolate the influence of L6 CT axons onto TRN neurons and not the other three types of neurons that it communicates with. Again, good topic for a revamped Discussion section.</p><p>8. Figure S3 should be upgraded to a main figure and quantified.</p><p>9. Figure S6 is interesting but preliminary. There are only four data points and DREADD experiments are usually considered uninterpretable without a control condition in which CNO is applied with the expression of a control fluorophore (i.e., without the designer receptor) to account for known off-target effects of CNO.</p><p>10. The issues with Figure S7 are that Rbp4-Cre does not selectively label &quot;PT-like&quot; L5 cells that project sub-cerebrally. In fact, most of their axons remain within the cortex. To this point, the expression they show in no way resembles the cartoon in Panel A but more problematically does not compare to the expression in the Ntsr1 neurons. As such, it is hard to interpret much from the negative result because it may be that they are hyperpolarizing many fewer neurons overall and very often not the L5 neurons that project to the MGB.</p><p>11. Figure S8 is another example of them trying to squeeze too much out of their data. First of all, I was unclear about how they were confident that they patched Ntsr1 neurons and not other L6 cell types. But mainly the analysis methods were a little strange to me. Why not just filter in the Gamma band (or other bands)? Also there is a huge literature showing the phase of ongoing 2-6Hz oscillations gate the response probability of AC neurons (e.g., in Guo 2017). It would have been reasonable calculate the phase and amplitude of the pre-stimulus membrane currents from its analytical signal using the Hilbert transform. In its current form, the quantification in this figure is not convincing at all.</p><p>Apart from that, the Pre-stimulus L6 neuronal activity could only accurately predict 58.1 {plus minus} 3.5 SD% ON and OFF cortical responses, which is subtle compared to the theoretical random accuracy 55.1%. Moreover, should the random accuracy be calculated by training and testing the model with shuffled ON and OFF responses?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper that finds that the cortical feedback to the thalamic reticular contributes to the omission of responses in the cortex. This is an important and surprising finding, and the authors bring a whole arsenal of state-of-the-art tools to dissect the contribution of this pathway. The variety of the methods, that include calcium imaging, flavoprotein imaging, electrical stimulation, whole cell recording, pharmacologic/optogenetic/chemogenetic manipulations, all point towards the same conclusions. The data that are presented support most of the claims of the paper. Most of my concerns reflect the interpretation of the data, the focus of the introduction and discussion, some missing controls and the lack of report of statistics in the main body. I believe that the authors should be able to address these concerns with the data in hand, through additional analysis and re-interpretation.</p><p>1. The emphasis in the introduction and discussion on the &quot;classical models&quot; of purely feedforward hierarchical processing seems somewhat forced. Numerous studies, especially in the auditory system, have addressed the importance of feedback in anatomy, auditory processing, learning and behavior. Rather than skipping over this important work, the paper would benefit from the discussion of previous work on the function of feedback in sensory processing. This would furthermore allow the authors to better define what role their work plays in this context.</p><p>2. Similarly, the emphasis on the role of this feedback in neuronal oscillations seems to be overstated. In the introduction, the discussion of hallucinations seems to come out of nowhere. In the paper, only one supplementary figure is devoted to analysis of oscillations, whereas in the abstract, introduction and discussion, these is an extensive focus on the gamma oscillations. The gamma activity -based prediction of ON vs OFF responses seems to be weak. The classifier only had an accuracy of 58%, which is not very high, and is only barely above random accuracy of 55. This focus and confusing result detracts from the main message of the paper.</p><p>3. The terminology of ON and OFF responses seems to be at odds with the accepted terminology in the auditory field. Typically, in the auditory field, ON responses refer to the activity at the onset of a stimulus, and OFF responses refer to the activity after stimulus offset. OFF responses, where there is no response at all, is confusing. The authors allude to the use of UP and DOWN states in the literature, but there is only indirect evidence that this activity indeed corresponds to those states. Perhaps using &quot;Response&quot; and &quot;Omission&quot;; yes/no; 1/0 or +/- could work.</p><p>4. The claim that the thalamus selects co-activated cortical ensembles, referred to in the abstract, last sentence of the introduction as well as the discussion, is not supported by data. Perhaps it is known that the auditory cortex uses partially overlapping ensembles of coactivated neurons to represent auditory stimuli, but that data is not represented in this paper. In fact, the data in this paper hinges on an &quot;all or nothing response,&quot; which undermines this idea of coactivated ensembles in the AC. These contrasting ideas deserve reconciliation.</p><p>5. Statistics for all claims should be reported in the main text. Some statistics are missing, for example, in Figure 5D, the distribution of the histograms.</p><p>6. It is great that the paper starts with results in vivo. However, those are under anesthesia. Are OFF responses also present in awake animals, perhaps influenced by attention or arousal levels? Perhaps worth speculating in the discussion on the functional importance of this corticothalamic gating in awake behaving animals.</p><p>7. The authors use a deep learning algorithm to establish the predictive power of the response, training on MGB data vs irrelevant striatum. How would the algorithm work for IC data? Furthermore, it is unclear whether deep learning is required for this analysis. Would more simple statistical measures, such as correlation or Granger causality measures work here as well? Can the predictive ability of layer 6 activity be improved with just using pre-stimulus layer 6 firing rate, as opposed to LFP power spectra?</p><p>8. The authors observed cortical IPSCs during ON responses but not OFF responses. The importance of this finding would be better demonstrated by comparing it with cortical EPSCs. Presumably, ON responses are characterized by large EPSPs and medium IPSCs, whereas OFF responses are characterized by no EPSCs or IPSCs. That way, it's clearer that OFF responses are not simply caused by increase in IPSC magnitude. It could then be contrasted that with the increase in IPSC magnitude observed in MGB, as they show in figure 3G. The importance of figure 3E/3F is unclear. It would be great to explain why IPSCs are observed in cortical ON responses and not OFF responses.</p><p>9. How well do gabazine and NBQX stay localized to the area of injection? Is there any chance of diffusion of the agent confounding results? How was localization confirmed?</p><p>10. What are the controls for chemogenetics?</p><p>11. In Figure 4, when performing calcium imaging in MGB, which trials had cortical ON vs OFF responses? Was that determined through simultaneous LFP recording in AC (diagram in figure 4A)?</p><p>12. How well can latency of response and response timing variability (Figure 4) be assessed using GCaMP6s, which has a response time scale on the order of seconds? Is the variability in response timing really on the order of hundreds of milliseconds (Figure 4D)? Perhaps this would be better evaluated using whole cell recording or electrophysiology.</p><p>13. Is it MGB synchrony, or MGB inhibition, that leads to cortical ON vs OFF responses? The importance of MGB synchrony, or at least its interaction with TRN-MGB inhibition, is unclear. Furthermore, the synchrony analysis should be conducted with more appropriate statistical tools, including correlation measures. It remains unclear how a desynchronized MGB leads to an OFF response (aka no firing) in the cortex. Do layer 4 cortical cells not reach firing threshold when the inputs are asynchronous? Or do cortical neurons not receive inputs from MGB when the neurons fire asynchronously (due to further gating by third party cells)?</p><p>14. Is the difference in power at ~36Hz significant when controlling for multiple comparisons across 11 different LFP power spectra frequencies? Perhaps the authors could try running a 2-way ANOVA with frequency and ON/OFF status as factors.</p><p>15. I recommend tightening the writing style throughout: e.g. in abstract: &quot;Here, we elucidate the mechanism for gating of population activity.&quot; Some paragraphs are multiple pages long. There are run-on sentences, and the authors use passive tense extensively. I would recommend splitting up the paragraphs, so that each paragraph contains one result/analysis, as well as two sentences for motivation and conclusion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Corticothalamic gating of population auditory thalamocortical transmission in mouse&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have now added a figure to show that there are no apparent order effects in our data and added text to clarify the method for computing âF/F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 105. 37dB is quite a specific intensity â why did you choose this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have found that the population ON/OFF phenomenon is seen near response threshold. Below threshold, no responses are found and above threshold, consistent full responses are found in the AC. In the case of 37 dB SPL, we did use higher intensities and found consistent ON responses.

Activating the IC and observing AC response is due to di-synaptic circuitry. Therefore, does the AC &quot;failure rate&quot; change with the intensity of the stimulation? Can you stimulate hard enough to overcome the thalamic inhibition that you claim mediates the OFF responses?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue. As stated above, the presence of ON/OFF responses does indeed depend on stimulus amplitude. The ON/OFF phenomenon is seen just above threshold and at high stimulus amplitudes, only ON responses are seen. We have added Figure 3 and corresponding text to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2E. Why is the dF/F in the MGB orders of magnitude lower than IC or ACtx?</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent observation. We have previously shown that flavoprotein autofluorescence responses in the thalamus are significantly smaller than corresponding responses in the cortex (Llano et al. 2009, PMID: 19321634). We do not know the reason for the smaller responses, but speculate that because the flavoprotein signal is derived primarily from neuropil (where the majority of signal-generating mitochondria are), that brain regions with strongly aligned neuropil processes (like apical dendrites in pyramidal cells) produce stronger signals. We do note that the flavoprotein responses in the MGB, though small, are consistent and align well with the electrophysiological results presented in Figure 4. We have added clarifying text to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 139. It's not immediately clear to me how are you getting single-cell resolution using this one-photon preparation? The images shown throughout are &quot;wide field&quot; population images.

What exactly is it being modeled here? It seems like you are performing a binary classification, e.g. using either MGB activity or striatum activity to predict whether the corresponding cortical response was ON or OFF? Why does this imply that network-level activity may determine whether an on or off response occurred? Why is the striatum region irrelevant (i.e. it is still (indirectly) connected the cortex via the thalamus, no?). Why the need to use such an advanced machine learning method? Did simpler binary classification tools fail? Does this method also give the same result when used on the GCaMP or whole cell recordings?</p></disp-quote><p>Complying with the other reviewersâ and editorâs suggestions, we have removed this section from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3B. Why are there are more OFF responses that appear in the wash condition? Can you add a third variable to Figure 3C to show this â shouldn't the wash be statistically indistinguishable from control?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We have now compared the wash vs. baseline responses, and the differences are not significant. In revised figure 3C (now Figure 4C), we now use one-way ANOVA instead of paired t-test, and the test showed a nonsignificant difference between the control and wash groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 195. This is actually a question regarding choices throughout the paper â what dictated the choice of either flavoprotein or calcium? The deep learning results referenced here were established with flavoprotein, but these follow-up experiments use calcium.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. The main imaging technique used in the paper is flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging because it does not require any modifications to the slice or to the animal. Calcium imaging was used to demonstrate that the ON/OFF phenomenon was not an artifact of the use of a metabolic signal, as well as to examine the cellular activity in layer 4 cells and MGB cells. The deep learning component of the manuscript has been removed, as suggested by the other reviewers and editor. We have revised the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4B. It's not quite clear what is going in this figure. Would some kind of population signal help? Or an alternative way to plot the data? Do these individual traces all have well-defined peak latencies (it's hard to tell from the figure). You're showing the variance of the peak latencies â but couldn't you just compare the peak latencies directly? Does it give the same result? Also, you talk about three categories in the text, but are only showing two categories in the figure. A latency analysis is also a little bit difficult to interpret with calcium data (both from the calcium timescale and the acquisition frame rate) â it might be a good idea to either discuss these limitations, since you are arguing for synchronicity based on a small reduction in variance within this data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. Figure 4B was meant to show an overlay of all of the calcium traces during ON vs. OFF response. Figures 4B-4D are alternative ways of showing the same data. We respectfully would like to keep Figure 4B (now Figure 5E) because it shows the reader the raw traces and illustrates the increased synchrony during ON responses.

They are the only lab in the world (to the best of my knowledge) that has worked out the geometry of a brain slab that leaves the synaptic connections intact from the midbrain-thalamus-MGB-TRN-cortex-back to TRN/MGB. Here, they use this slab to great effect by revitalizing the old cortical up/down state phenomenon in the context of all-or-nothing responses in A1 to stimulation of midbrain afferents. They have convinced me that the basic phenomenon is real and that it is interesting. Further, I am convinced that they can reduce the probability of OFF response trials by: (1) blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, (2) blocking AMPA receptors in TRN, (3) inactivating Ntsr1-Cre L6 CT neurons. They also have data to show that (4) inactivating feedforward inhibition from the IC or glutamatergic L5 projection neurons does not affect OFF response probability.</p><p>While there is a lot of good in this manuscript, there is plenty of bad and ugly as well. In their efforts to weave a complete theory of the phenomenon, they are forced to rely on a few very weak/poorly developed pieces of data. Emphasizing these more tenuous findings (Figure 4, Figure S4, Figure S8), ends up doing them a disservice because it takes away from their more solid observations. Apart from eliminating the dubious findings, the figures and the analysis are poorly organized, confusing and do not convey the process of processing the data from example cases to summary plots that relate to their statistics. They look more like lab meeting figures than manuscript figures.</p><p>In the final analysis, I think the work offers a significant conceptual advance based on an innovative technical approach. The manuscript can be substantially improved through eliminating the under-developed analyses, reorganizing the remaining figures and adding some additional analysis. The authors needn't feel compelled to oversell the reader on a complete comprehensive story when some of holes are not yet filled in. It's fine that some of the mechanisms are unknown so long as the shortcomings and caveats are clearly identified.</p><p>1. Figure 1 is potentially important but is not too convincing in its current form. One reason that it's important is that the rest of the manuscript is a developmental neuroscience study that is never acknowledges this fact. The intro and discussion with the talk of schizophrenia and hallucinations are too far-ranging for my taste, but particularly in the context that their study was performed in mice that had only been connected to the auditory world for less than 1 week. It would be very easy to write off the phenomenon they describe here as an oddity o development that would not apply to the mature cortex.</p><p>For me, this underscores the potential importance of Figure 1, where they demonstrate the phenomenon in vivo using older animals. The biggest impediments in its current form are (i) the age of the animals used for transcranial imaging is never mentioned. I presume they are adult?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for making these points. Yes, the animal shown in Figure 1 is an adult animal, which has now been described in the revised text. We have also added text to describe the limitations on the interpretation of the study, given the finding that the animals in the slice part of the study were young.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) The entire analysis is based on a single tone frequency presented a single sound intensity that is very near threshold (5k at 37 dB SPL). This makes me question the generality of the principle described here. Having done this trial-by-trial analysis myself on this type of data, I don't think it really works for strong, suprathreshold stimulus intensities. Is this entire phenomenon restricted to a very narrow range of near-threshold intensities? In that caseâ¦is it really a phenomenon or just what happens near minimally effective stimulation levels (which is already very well known). Obviously, the same critique applies to the current levels they use for the rest of the study. It would have been nice to see a more systematic and quantitative examination of the stimulus parameters where this phenomenon is strong versus weak.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show that the likelihood of observing an OFF response decreases with increasing stimulus amplitude in modified Figure 1. This dependence on stimulus amplitude is also seen in the slice data and is now shown in revised Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Imaging from &quot;single cells&quot;. Single cell imaging is not possible with epifluorescence illumination in a slice this thick, especially without neuropil removal. At best they are ROIs but even then, what is the value when there is no basis for the argument that their ROIs are independent response units? I suggest eliminating 2G, Figure 4 and Figure S4. The issues with Figure 4 (and S4) go way beyond the cellular resolution issues, they are uninterpretable for a number of reasons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the section on deep learning, and therefore removed previous Figure S4. We respectfully suggest that single-photon imaging of calcium activity in slices has been done for some time (Maclean et al. 2005 PMID: 16337918, Berger et al. 2007 PMID: 17360827, Cameron et al. 2016 PMID: 27183102). We have now re-analyzed the data using neuropil correction as suggested by the reviewer and have found similar results and present them in modified Figures 2 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 2D, I'm not convinced that they are looking at signals from TRN cell bodies as opposed to thalamocortical/corticothalamic axons. The thalamic radiation forms a dense fascicle right at the point of the TRN in this plane so it could be very hard to distinguish between TRN cell bodies and axon signals with the optics they are using. Too bad they didn't express GCaMP in the GAD-Cre mice they use for inhibiting the feedforward inhibitory IC projection neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is correct that corticothalamic axons pass through this area, we think that these are likely signals from the TRN for four reasons. First, flavoprotein imaging produces very weak signals in axons. Second, this region is the precise location of the auditory region of the TRN. Third, in the current studies, we show that application of a glutamate blocker to this region strongly facilitates thalamocortical transmission â a finding that is inconsistent with this region being reflective of axons of passage. Fourth, to definitively establish that there are TRN cell bodies in this region, we were able to record from several TRN cells, and found that their firing was synchronized with IC stimulation and that these neurons had current/voltage profiles consistent with TRN neurons. We added this result as Figure 2âfigure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Calcium imaging in the MGB and IC. Looking at other publications of the Thy1-GCaMP6 mouse, I see lots of labeling in pyramidal neurons in neocortex and hippocampus, but no labeling in the MGB or IC. I'm confused about what is being measured in Figure 2E. Maybe there is expression in younger mice or is just very faint?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. GCaMP signal is smaller (but present) in the IC and fairly weak in the MGB in the original description of these mice by Dana et al. (PMID: 25250714). Our data are consistent with their findings, with the smallest signals deriving from the MGB. It is also certainly possible that part of the signal that is observed in IC and MGB is contaminated by flavoprotein signals, which are obtained with the same filter set, but are generally about an order of magnitude smaller than GCaMP signals. Either way, it does not impact the main conclusion from the use of GCaMP mice which is that the cortical ON/OFF responses are not an artifact of metabolic imaging. We have modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 3E-H (graphics could be greatly improved here) show that EPSCs in MGB are unchanged in cortical ON vs OFF trials but IPSCs are elevated in OFF trials. This is one of the mysteries of their study that they try to address with a bunch of uninterpretable analysis methods (Figure 4 and Figure S4). The conundrum they face is how does enhanced thalamic inhibition create a cortical OFF response without making the MGB excitatory response weaker? Figure 4 and S4 attempt to explain this but are contrived and unconvincing. I don't disagree but I would suggest that they are thinking about it too simplistically. It doesn't matter what the MGB cell bodies are doing, what matters is what they are transmitting to the cortex during OFF trials. It would be helpful if they quantified these data more carefully by looking at the relative timing of the IPSC and EPSC responses. Looking at the study by Reinhold, Lien and Scanziani 2015, the TRN can regulate sustained spiking and thalamocortical synaptic depression in ways that cannot be dismissed just by measuring the excitatory response. They don't have to fully answer this here. They can do the best with whatever straightforward analysis they can manage and then devote some space in the discussion to actually discussing alternative explanations for their experiments instead of rhapsodizing about how these data solve the greatest mysteries of the brain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We have modified the graphics on this figure. We have quantified the timing of the IPSCs and EPSCs in the modified version of figure 3 (now Figure 5). Also, we have discussed these issues in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 3K â It would be important to see the individual data points. The legend says the data are an n=5, reflecting 5 slices from 4 animals. How do you get two of these slices from one animal? Regardless, this is a very small sample to make such a strong conclusion as blocking cortical GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors does not affect the OFF response probability. Was the AC Gabazine always performed after the MGB wash? The order should be counterbalanced and really I'm not even sure what the justification is for using a t-test on a sample this small. Unclear how the assumptions of the test can really be determined.</p></disp-quote><p>We are occasionally able to obtain two viable brain slices from a single animal retaining IC-MGB-AC connectivity. We have tested whether the data were normally distributed, and based on this result, ran a suitable non-parametric test. We have also re-run the pharmacology experiments in a counterbalanced fashion as suggested and obtained similar results (see modified Figure 4I-K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I suggest putting all three of their halorhodopsin experiments into one figure (IC inhibitory feedforward neurons, L6 CT and L5 projection neurons). I'm also bothered that there isn't a control condition where mice have undergone a perinatal injection to express a control fluorophore. This seems particularly warranted because they injected an enormous volume of virus solution (1600 nL) into very small area. Apart from this control, while I think the L6 inactivation result is very interesting, I strongly disagree with their often repeated interpretation of the data, that &quot;Population OFF responses were associated with TRN-mediated inhibition at the level of the MGB, under the control of layer 6 corticothalamic projections&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion and we have now placed all of the halorhodopsin experiments into one figure. Also, we conducted a control experiment in which we injected 4 day old mice with the same serotype viral particles that do not express halorhodopsin receptor. We put the results of this experiment in revised Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Their data do not support this conclusion. Yes, blocking AMPA receptors in TRN reduced the probability and Yes, silencing L6 CT also reduced the probability but it is a logical fallacy to assume those are causally related. Ntsr1 neurons make synaptic contacts on TRN neurons, MGB neurons, local AC inhibitory neurons and local AC excitatory neurons. It is entirely possible that the Ntsr1 neurons are mediating this effect through local connections in the cortex and not through the descending projection. In that regard, it is a bit frustrating that the main point of the Guo 2017 study was the Ntsr1 neurons can strongly bias AC neurons to become less responsive to afferent activity via intracortical connections, yet these findings are not mentioned in this context.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, they might be right. But providing that the L6 CTs modify MGB via TRN would require a different type of experiment to isolate the influence of L6 CT axons onto TRN neurons and not the other three types of neurons that it communicates with. Again, good topic for a revamped Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point that we had not considered previously. The reviewer is absolutely correct that silencing NTSR1+ neurons may have multiple effects outside of their projections to the TRN, particularly based on their intracortical projections. We have modified the Discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure S3 should be upgraded to a main figure and quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion, and we upgraded the figure to a main figure 3 and quantified the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure S6 is interesting but preliminary. There are only four data points and DREADD experiments are usually considered uninterpretable without a control condition in which CNO is applied with the expression of a control fluorophore (i.e., without the designer receptor) to account for known off-target effects of CNO.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion, and we have done the control experiment by injecting 4 days old mice with the same stereotype viral particles that do not express the DREADD receptor. We put the results of this experiment in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The issues with Figure S7 are that Rbp4-Cre does not selectively label &quot;PT-like&quot; L5 cells that project sub-cerebrally. In fact, most of their axons remain within the cortex. To this point, the expression they show in no way resembles the cartoon in Panel A but more problematically does not compare to the expression in the Ntsr1 neurons. As such, it is hard to interpret much from the negative result because it may be that they are hyperpolarizing many fewer neurons overall and very often not the L5 neurons that project to the MGB.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewerâs comment. Initially, we conducted this experiment as a negative control thinking that inhibiting another cell type in the cortex, not layer 6 cells, will not be able to retrieve the OFF cortical response. We respectfully suggest keeping the RBP4 data in the paper to help differentiate layer 5 vs. layer 6 effects. Clearly if an effect was seen after RBP4 silencing, one could not know if the effect was due to subcortical vs. cortical effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Figure S8 is another example of them trying to squeeze too much out of their data. First of all, I was unclear about how they were confident that they patched Ntsr1 neurons and not other L6 cell types. But mainly the analysis methods were a little strange to me. Why not just filter in the Gamma band (or other bands)? Also there is a huge literature showing the phase of ongoing 2-6Hz oscillations gate the response probability of AC neurons (e.g., in Guo 2017). It would have been reasonable calculate the phase and amplitude of the pre-stimulus membrane currents from its analytical signal using the Hilbert transform. In it's current form, the quantification in this figure is not convincing at all.</p><p>Apart from that, the Pre-stimulus L6 neuronal activity could only accurately predict 58.1 {plus minus} 3.5 SD% ON and OFF cortical responses, which is subtle compared to the theoretical random accuracy 55.1%. Moreover, should the random accuracy be calculated by training and testing the model with shuffled ON and OFF responses?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the suggestion made by the reviewers and the editor, this part was removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is an interesting paper that finds that the cortical feedback to the thalamic reticular contributes to the omission of responses in the cortex. This is an important and surprising finding, and the authors bring a whole arsenal of state-of-the-art tools to dissect the contribution of this pathway. The variety of the methods, that include calcium imaging, flavoprotein imaging, electrical stimulation, whole cell recording, pharmacologic/optogenetic/chemogenetic manipulations, all point towards the same conclusions. The data that are presented support most of the claims of the paper. Most of my concerns reflect the interpretation of the data, the focus of the introduction and discussion, some missing controls and the lack of report of statistics in the main body. I believe that the authors should be able to address these concerns with the data in hand, through additional analysis and re-interpretation.</p><p>1. The emphasis in the introduction and discussion on the &quot;classical models&quot; of purely feedforward hierarchical processing seems somewhat forced. Numerous studies, especially in the auditory system, have addressed the importance of feedback in anatomy, auditory processing, learning and behavior. Rather than skipping over this important work, the paper would benefit from the discussion of previous work on the function of feedback in sensory processing. This would furthermore allow the authors to better define what role their work plays in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have made substantial modifications to the Introduction in accordance with this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Similarly, the emphasis on the role of this feedback in neuronal oscillations seems to be overstated. In the introduction, the discussion of hallucinations seems to come out of nowhere. In the paper, only one supplementary figure is devoted to analysis of oscillations, whereas in the abstract, introduction and discussion, these is an extensive focus on the gamma oscillations. The gamma activity-based prediction of ON vs OFF responses seems to be weak. The classifier only had an accuracy of 58%, which is not very high, and is only barely above random accuracy of 55. This focus and confusing result detracts from the main message of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We have modified the Discussion with respect to the potential connection to hallucinations. Based on the suggestion made by the reviewers and the editor, the gamma oscillations has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The terminology of ON and OFF responses seems to be at odds with the accepted terminology in the auditory field. Typically, in the auditory field, ON responses refer to the activity at the onset of a stimulus, and OFF responses refer to the activity after stimulus offset. OFF responses, where there is no response at all, is confusing. The authors allude to the use of UP and DOWN states in the literature, but there is only indirect evidence that this activity indeed corresponds to those states. Perhaps using &quot;Response&quot; and &quot;Omission&quot;; yes/no; 1/0 or +/- could work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you and we have struggled with this terminology ourselves. Reviewing the classical auditory literature, most authors use âonsetâ and âoffsetâ to refer to response at the beginning vs. the end of a tone rather than ON/OFF (Qin et al. 2007, PMID: 17360820, Anderson and Linden 2016, PMID: 26865621, Kopp-Scheinpflug et al. 2018, PMID: 30274606). We have been reluctant to call these UP/DOWN responses because we do not yet know how completely UP/DOWN aligns with ON/OFF. We thank the reviewer for the other suggestions, but also find them to be less descriptive. We respectfully suggest using the terms âpopulation ONâ and âpopulation OFFâ responses and have made the corresponding changes in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The claim that the thalamus selects co-activated cortical ensembles, referred to in the abstract, last sentence of the introduction as well as the discussion, is not supported by data. Perhaps it is known that the auditory cortex uses partially overlapping ensembles of coactivated neurons to represent auditory stimuli, but that data is not represented in this paper. In fact, the data in this paper hinges on an &quot;all or nothing response,&quot; which undermines this idea of coactivated ensembles in the AC. These contrasting ideas deserve reconciliation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data do not establish that specific ensembles of neurons are activated by particular stimuli. We have replaced the word âensembleâ with âpopulationâ or âgroupâ of neurons in the Abstract and Introduction, respectively, which we believe has less specific implications than âensemble.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Statistics for all claims should be reported in the main text. Some statistics are missing, for example, in Figure 5D, the distribution of the histograms.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have moved the statistics from the figure legend to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It is great that the paper starts with results in vivo. However, those are under anesthesia. Are OFF responses also present in awake animals, perhaps influenced by attention or arousal levels? Perhaps worth speculating in the discussion on the functional importance of this corticothalamic gating in awake behaving animals.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have added text to highlight this point in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors use a deep learning algorithm to establish the predictive power of the response, training on MGB data vs irrelevant striatum. How would the algorithm work for IC data? Furthermore, it is unclear whether deep learning is required for this analysis. Would more simple statistical measures, such as correlation or Granger causality measures work here as well? Can the predictive ability of layer 6 activity be improved with just using pre-stimulus layer 6 firing rate, as opposed to LFP power spectra?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion but based on the suggestion made by the reviewers and the editor, this part was removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors observed cortical IPSCs during ON responses but not OFF responses. The importance of this finding would be better demonstrated by comparing it with cortical EPSCs. Presumably, ON responses are characterized by large EPSPs and medium IPSCs, whereas OFF responses are characterized by no EPSCs or IPSCs. That way, it's clearer that OFF responses are not simply caused by increase in IPSC magnitude. It could then be contrasted that with the increase in IPSC magnitude observed in MGB, as they show in figure 3G. The importance of figure 3E/3F is unclear. It would be great to explain why IPSCs are observed in cortical ON responses and not OFF responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. The important outcome of these experiments is the absence of cortical IPSCs during OFF responses. The presence of barrages of IPSCs during ON responses was initially surprising to us, but is consistent with ON responses being found during UP states. UP states are associated with barrages of both EPSCs and IPSCs (Hasenstaub et al. 2005, PMID: 16055065, Tahvildari et al. 2012, PMID: 22933799, Salkoff et al. 2015, PMID: 26180200). We have now quantified the magnitude of the IPSCs during ON vs. OFF responses (revised Figure 4F) to make this point more clear, and to provide more contrast with the MGB IPSC magnitudes, which were larger during the OFF responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. How well do gabazine and NBQX stay localized to the area of injection? Is there any chance of diffusion of the agent confounding results? How was localization confirmed?</p></disp-quote><p>We mixed the drug and the ACSF as control with Alexa Fluor-594 dye, so we could visualize the injection of the solution injected. We provided the images or the videos of these injections. Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 shows the localized injection of the drugs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. What are the controls for chemogenetics?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

In Figure 4, when performing calcium imaging in MGB, which trials had cortical ON vs OFF responses? Was that determined through simultaneous LFP recording in AC (diagram in figure 4A)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there was a simultaneous LFP recoding and MGB calcium imaging. We have modified the text to make this point more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. How well can latency of response and response timing variability (Figure 4) be assessed using GCaMP6s, which has a response time scale on the order of seconds? Is the variability in response timing really on the order of hundreds of milliseconds (Figure 4D)? Perhaps this would be better evaluated using whole cell recording or electrophysiology.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are significant limitations in the interpretability of response timing using calcium signals. However, gold-standard approaches to measuring timing, such as electrophysiology in the slice, limit the number of neurons simultaneously sampled. We have now added text describing the limitations to this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Is it MGB synchrony, or MGB inhibition, that leads to cortical ON vs OFF responses? The importance of MGB synchrony, or at least its interaction with TRN-MGB inhibition, is unclear. Furthermore, the synchrony analysis should be conducted with more appropriate statistical tools, including correlation measures. It remains unclear how a desynchronized MGB leads to an OFF response (aka no firing) in the cortex. Do layer 4 cortical cells not reach firing threshold when the inputs are asynchronous? Or do cortical neurons not receive inputs from MGB when the neurons fire asynchronously (due to further gating by third party cells)?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the data suggest that inhibition of the MGB leads to desynchronized MGB output, leading to OFF responses. Synchrony in this case was measured as variance in latency across the population which is a direct measurement of whether MGB neurons are responding at the same time. The idea that thalamic synchrony is needed to elicit a cortical response and that TRN may disrupt thalamic synchrony is established in the literature (Bruno and Sakmann et al. 2006, Pita-Almenar et al. 2014 PMID: 25339757). We have made this point more clearly in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Is the difference in power at ~36Hz significant when controlling for multiple comparisons across 11 different LFP power spectra frequencies? Perhaps the authors could try running a 2-way ANOVA with frequency and ON/OFF status as factors.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the suggestion made by the reviewers and the editor, the gamma oscillations part was removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. I recommend tightening the writing style throughout: e.g. in abstract: &quot;Here, we elucidate the mechanism for gating of population activity.&quot; Some paragraphs are multiple pages long. There are run-on sentences, and the authors use passive tense extensively. I would recommend splitting up the paragraphs, so that each paragraph contains one result/analysis, as well as two sentences for motivation and conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion and have revised the manuscript extensively.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors are to be commended for carrying out a number of new experiments to provide essential control data and to provide additional information that has strengthened the study. The majority of the other concerns raised by the reviewers have been dealt with adequately, but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Both the in vivo and slice data now clearly illustrate the dependence of the cortical responses on the stimulus magnitude, with the probability of an OFF response occurring declining with increasing stimulus strength. This reinforces one of the points made by reviewer 2, namely that these effects appear be present only for near minimally effective stimulation levels. That raises the question of what function they serve and how these responses contribute to our understanding of cortical processing under more natural conditions (including in awake animals at higher sound levels). These are important issues that need to be addressed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added the following text to the Discussion:</p><p>âMoreover, the strong association between the high probability of the OFF cortical responses and the low level of stimulation suggests that cortico-reticulothalamic control of thalamocortical transmission is most likely to be effective when signal-to-noise ratio is low. This finding is consistent with the notion that top-down modulation is mostly required for the attentional modulation of weak signals and that highly salient signals rely on bottom-up mechanisms to activate perceptual representations (reviewed in [45]).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The readability of the text would benefit further from greater use of paragraphs (as pointed out by reviewer 3).
