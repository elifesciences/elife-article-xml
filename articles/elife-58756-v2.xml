Newly formed neurons integrate into functional neural circuits, enabling the recovery of function and behaviour, which is how CNS regeneration is measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009</xref>). The human CNS does not regenerate after injury. However, in principle it could, as we continue to produce new neurons throughout life that integrate into functional circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gage, 2019</xref>). Through understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying natural regenerative neurogenesis in animals, we might be able to provoke de novo neurogenesis in the human CNS to promote regeneration after damage or neurodegenerative diseases. Regenerative neurogenesis across animals may reflect an ancestral, evolutionarily conserved genetic mechanism, which manifests itself to various degrees in regenerating and non-regenerating animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, it may be possible to discover molecular mechanisms of injury-induced neurogenesis in the fruit-fly <italic>Drosophila,</italic> which is a powerful genetic model organism.</p><p>Regenerative neurogenesis could occur through activation of quiescent neural stem cells, de-differentiation of neurons or glia, or direct conversion of glia to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk and Götz, 2017</xref>). Across many regenerating animals, new neurons originate mostly from glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk and Götz, 2017</xref>). In the mammalian CNS, radial glial cells behave like neural stem cells to produce neurons during development. Remarkably, whereas NG2-glia (also known as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, OPCs) produce only glia (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) in development, they can also produce neurons in the adult and upon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dimou and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk and Götz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Valny et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2021</xref>) – although this remains controversial. Discovering the molecular mechanisms of a neurogenic response of glia is of paramount urgency.</p><p>NG2-glia are progenitor cells in the adult human brain, constituting 5–10% of total CNS cells, and remain proliferative throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dimou and Götz, 2014</xref>). In development, NG2-glia are progenitors of astrocytes, OPCs, and oligodendrocytes, but postnatally and upon injury they can also produce neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dimou and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk and Götz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Valny et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2021</xref>). They can also be directly reprogrammed into neurons that integrate into functional circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pereira et al., 2017</xref>). The diversity and functions of NG2-glia are not yet fully understood, but they are particularly close to neurons. They receive and respond to action potentials generating calcium signals, they monitor and modulate the state of neural circuits by regulating channels and secreting chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan perineural nets, and they also induce their own proliferation to generate more NG2-glia, astrocytes that sustain neuronal physiology, and oligodendrocytes that enwrap axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dimou and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakry and Trotter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2021</xref>). NG2-glia have key roles in brain plasticity, homeostasis, and repair in close interaction with neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dimou and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakry and Trotter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2021</xref>), but to what extent this depends on the <italic>NG2</italic> gene and protein, is not known.</p><p><italic>NG2</italic> (also known as <italic>chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 4, CSPG4)</italic> is expressed by NG2-glia and pericytes, but not by oligodendrocytes, neurons, or astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>). NG2 is a transmembrane protein that can be cleaved upon neuronal stimulation to release a large secreted extracellular domain and an intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sakry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakry and Trotter, 2016</xref>). The intracellular domain (ICD, NG2<sup>ICD</sup>) is mostly cytoplasmic, and it induces protein translation and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nayak et al., 2018</xref>). NG2<sup>ICD</sup> lacks a DNA binding domain and therefore does not function as a transcription factor, but it has a nuclear WW4 domain and nuclear localisation signals and can regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakry and Trotter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nayak et al., 2018</xref>). It is thought that NG2 functions as a receptor, triggering nuclear signalling in response to ligands or partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sakry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakry and Trotter, 2016</xref>). NG2 protein is abundant in proliferating NG2-glia and glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakry and Trotter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nayak et al., 2018</xref>). It is also required for OPC proliferation and migration in development and in response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kucharova and Stallcup, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kucharova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binamé et al., 2013</xref>). Given the close relationship of NG2-glia with neurons, it is anticipated that key partners of NG2 are produced from neurons, but these remain largely unknown.</p><p>The fruit-fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> is particularly powerful for discovering novel molecular mechanisms. The <italic>Drosophila NG2</italic> homologue is called <italic>kon-tiki (kon)</italic> or <italic>perdido</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Estrada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schnorrer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pérez-Moreno et al., 2017</xref>). Kon functions in glia, promotes glial proliferation and glial cell fate determination in development and upon injury, and promotes glial regeneration and CNS injury repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). Kon works in concert with the receptor Notch and the transcription factor Prospero (Pros) to drive the glial regenerative response to CNS injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). It is normally found in low levels in the larval CNS, but injury induces a Notch-dependent increase in <italic>kon</italic> expression in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). Together, Notch signalling and Kon induce glial proliferation. Kon also initiates neuropile glial differentiation and <italic>pros</italic> expression, and Pros maintains glial cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffiths and Hidalgo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). This glial regenerative response to injury is homeostatic and time-limited, as two negative feedback loops halt it: Kon represses Notch, and Pros represses <italic>kon</italic> expression, preventing further cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). The relationship between these genes is also conserved in the mouse, where the homologue of <italic>pros, Prox1,</italic> is expressed together with <italic>Notch1</italic> in NG2-glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kato et al., 2015</xref>). Following cell division, Prox1 represses NG2-glia proliferation and promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kato et al., 2015</xref>). Together, Notch, Kon, and Pros form a homeostatic gene network that sustains neuropile glial integrity throughout life and drives glial regeneration upon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hidalgo and Logan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kato et al., 2018</xref>). As Kon is upregulated upon injury and provokes glial proliferation and differentiation, it is the key driver of the glial regenerative response to CNS injury.</p><p>A critical missing link to understand CNS regeneration was the identification of neuronal partners of glial NG2/Kon that could induce regenerative neurogenesis. We had observed that injury to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval CNS also resulted in spontaneous, yet incomplete, repair of the axonal neuropile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2011</xref>). This strongly suggested that injury might also induce neuronal events, such as axonal regrowth or generation of new neurons. Thus, we asked whether Kon may interact with neuronal factors that could contribute to regenerative neurogenesis after injury. Here, we report that relay of insulin signalling involving neuronal Ia-2 and glial Kon drives in vivo reprogramming of neuropile glia into neural stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic analysis reveals Ia-2 is a key neuronal factor interacting with Kon</title><p>To search for neuronal factors that might interact with glial <italic>kon</italic>, we carried out genetic screens aimed at identifying genes expressed in neurons that had non-autonomous effects on glia. We exploited the fact that overexpression of <italic>kon</italic> elongates the larval ventral nerve cord (VNC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>), and tested whether RNAi knock-down of candidate genes in neurons or glia could rescue this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). To validate the approach, we first tested genes predicted or known to interact with <italic>kon</italic> and/or <italic>NG2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schnorrer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pérez-Moreno et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, knock-down of known interactors, such as <italic>integrins</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pérez-Moreno et al., 2017</xref>), factors involved in Notch signalling (e.g. <italic>Mtm, Akap200</italic>), secretases (i.e. <italic>kuz, kul</italic>) that cleave both Notch and NG2/Kon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakry and Trotter, 2016</xref>), and phosphatases <italic>Prl1</italic> and <italic>Ptp99A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Song et al., 2012</xref>), all rescued the phenotype, validating the approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). We tested knock-down of other genes encoding phosphatases and transmembrane proteins expressed in neurons. Knocking-down phosphatases <italic>ptp99A, ptp69D,</italic> and <italic>ptp4E</italic> from neurons rescued the phenotype, but most prominent was knock-down of phosphatase <italic>lar,</italic> a negative regulator of insulin signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Notably, knock-down of other insulin related factors including <italic>Akt</italic> and <italic>ia-2</italic> also caused some rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). However, multiple genes can affect VNC length, and these rescue phenotypes may not necessarily reflect specific gene interactions. Thus, we next asked whether altering <italic>kon</italic> function affected the expression of a group of genes selected from the above screens. Kon can influence gene expression, as <italic>kon</italic> mutations cause loss of glial gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). Using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) on dissected larval CNSs, we found that <italic>kon</italic> knock-down in neurons (with <italic>kon<sup>c452</sup>, elavGAL4&gt;UAS-konRNAi</italic>) or glia (with <italic>kon<sup>c452</sup>, repoGAL4&gt;UAS-konRNAi</italic>) had no effect on the expression of most phosphatases, including <italic>lar</italic>, or other tested genes. By contrast, it resulted in an approximately three fold increase in <italic>ia-2</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of full-length <italic>kon</italic> in either neurons or glia downregulated <italic>ia-2</italic> mRNA levels by 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We validated these results by increasing the repeats of the most promising subset of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>), and this confirmed the strongest effect of <italic>kon</italic> loss of function (LOF) and gain of function (GOF) on <italic>ia-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Accordingly, Kon function in glia prevents <italic>ia-2</italic> expression.

The loss of function phenotype could be indirect: in glial cells Pros and Notch depend on each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffiths and Hidalgo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2011</xref>), thus loss of <italic>pros</italic> causes the downregulation of <italic>Notch</italic>, which would increase <italic>ia-2</italic> expression.

Indeed, <italic>kon</italic> loss of function in glia increased the number of Ia-2YFP+ cells along the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The ectopic ia-2YFP cells had the pan-neuronal marker Elav and did not have the glial marker Repo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), meaning they were neurons.

We focused on the abdominal VNC only, which has three neuroblasts per hemi-segment in ventro-lateral positions, in early third instar larvae. Crush injury in the abdominal VNC at 74–76 hr AEL resulted in ectopic abdominal Dpn+ cells by 5–7 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>). These were more numerous than the normal developmental abdominal larval neuroblasts, and included cells located in dorsal positions, which are not normally occupied by them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Froldi et al., 2015</xref>). The numerous Dpn+ cells could correspond to injury-induced divisions of neuroblasts normally found during larval development. To test whether injury might induce ectopic neural stem cells distinct from developmental neuroblasts, we next carried out crush injury at three later time points: (1) at 96 hr AEL and analysed the VNCs 6 hr post-injury (PI, 102 hr AEL), when in control VNCs, abdominal hemi-segments have 0 or 1 Dpn+ cells remaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–I</xref>); (2) at 105 hr and analysed 24 hr PI (129 hr AEL), when in controls there are no ventro-lateral neuroblasts, only Dpn+ cells along the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>); and (3) at 117 hr AEL and analysed the VNCs 12 hr PI (129 hr AEL), taking advantage of the delayed pupariation of injured larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–O</xref>). At 129 hr AEL there were no remaining abdominal ventro-lateral neural stem cells in intact controls, only some Dpn+ cells along the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M,N</xref>). Normal thoracic Dpn+ neuroblasts were present in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,L</xref>). Injury induced at the three later time points caused ectopic abdominal Dpn+ cells at the lesion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H,M,N,P</xref>). Most, ectopic Dpn+ cells lacked Ia-2YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H,M,N</xref>). Importantly, most ectopic abdominal Dpn+ cells surrounded the neuropile, and some were dorsal, in positions never occupied by developmental neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,N</xref>). Ectopic abdominal Dpn+ cells were located surrounding the lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,M,P</xref>). To take into account that Dpn might also be induced in cells at a distance from the lesion site, we also counted the total number of abdominal Dpn+ cells in all injured samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–O</xref>). The number of abdominal Dpn+ cells increased significantly in injured samples compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,J,O</xref>). The incidence of ectopic Dpn+ cells at the injury site decreased as larval age at the time of injury increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>). This most likely means that in older injured larvae there was not enough time between injury and pupariation for cells to divide further. Altogether, these data showed that injury induced ectopic neural stem cells that were distinct from developmental neuroblasts.

These data meant that Kon<sup>ICD</sup> does not directly function as a transcription factor. Instead, it may function as a co-factor of an unknown transcription factor. Kon<sup>ICD</sup> could also participate in the nuclear import–export shuttle, as loss of <italic>kon</italic> function prevented nuclear translocation of Repo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, most likely Kon regulates <italic>dilp-6</italic> indirectly by influencing glial cell fate and it does not induce ectopic Dpn+ cells.</p><p>By contrast, overexpression of <italic>ia-2</italic> induced ectopic abdominal Dpn+ cells prominently along the midline but also in lateral locations surrounding the neuropile, ordinarily occupied by glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> had a stronger effect, and there were many ectopic Dpn+ cells surrounding the neuropile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Dpn levels in ectopic cells were generally lower than in normal thoracic neural stem cells. These data showed that both Ia-2 and Dilp-6 can induce <italic>dpn</italic> expression, potentially in glia. However, Kon alone cannot, meaning that insulin signalling is required to induce neural stem cells. Since Ia-2 drives Dilp-6 production and secretion, this suggested that ultimately Dilp-6 induced ectopic neural stem cells.</p><p>To further test whether Ia-2 upregulated <italic>dpn</italic> ectopically via Dilp-6, we carried out epistasis analysis. Overexpression of <italic>ia-2</italic> together with <italic>dilp-6</italic> knock-down in glia (<italic>ia-2YFP, repoGAL4&gt;UAS-ia-2, UAS-dilp-6RNAi)</italic>, rescued the number of abdominal Dpn+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that Ia-2 induces ectopic neural stem cells via Dilp-6. Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>ia-2</italic> together with <italic>kon</italic> RNAi in glia (<italic>ia2-YFP, repoGAL4&gt;UAS-ia-2, UAS-konRNAi</italic>) also rescued the Dpn+ phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that <italic>dilp-6</italic> expression depends on Kon in glia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and that Kon and Dilp-6 engage in a positive feedback loop (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, the ectopic Dpn+ phenotype was also rescued by overexpression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> together with <italic>InR<sup>DN</sup></italic> in glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>ia-2YFP repoGAL4&gt;UAS-dilp6, UAS-InR<sup>DN</sup></italic>), meaning that ectopic neural stem cells depend on InR signalling in glia. Together, these data showed that Ia-2 induces ectopic abdominal neural stem cells via Dilp-6 and InR signalling in glia, and that ectopic Dpn cells originated from glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>The observation that Ia-2 and Dilp-6 could induce neural stem cell marker expression from glia was important. Thus, we sought to further verify it in two ways. Firstly, we used a second anti-Dpn antibody aliquot, from the Wang Lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang and Wang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), as well as their protocol. This revealed thoracic Dpn signal in normal neuroblasts, in late third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–F</xref>). In the abdomen, Dpn could be detected in some cells at low levels in ectopic positions corresponding to neuropile glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,G</xref>). Ectopic abdominal Dpn levels increased significantly when <italic>dilp-6</italic> was overexpressed in glia (with <italic>repoGAL4</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,G,J</xref>). <italic>dilp-6</italic> overexpression also increased abdominal Dpn+ cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,M</xref>), reflecting either higher levels and/or that Dpn+ cell proliferated. Secondly, we asked whether directly manipulating downstream effectors of insulin signalling – Ras and PI3Kinase – in glia might also influence <italic>dpn</italic> expression. Since InR signalling can trigger multiple signalling pathways downstream, we overexpressed <italic>dilp-6</italic> together with the activated forms of Ras (Ras<sup>V12</sup>) and PI3Kinase (Dp110CAAX, hereby called activated PI3K). In order to prevent potential embryonic lethality, to separate Dilp-6 function from its developmental function activating quiescent neuroblasts, and to separate further developmental neuroblasts from ectopic Dpn in glia, we used <italic>tubGAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic> to conditionally overexpress these factors in glia after larval L1 hatching. Samples were analysed in late third instar larvae, just before pupariation, when no normal neuroblasts remain in the abdomen. Dpn was normal in thoracic neuroblasts, with genotype-specific modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–F</xref>). In the abdominal VNC, overexpression of activated <italic>ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> in glia <italic>(tubGAL80<sup>ts</sup>, repo&gt;act-ras<sup>V12</sup>)</italic> increased the levels of ectopic Dpn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,H,K</xref>), and joint overexpression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> and <italic>activated-ras<sup>V12</sup> (tubGAL80<sup>ts</sup>, repo&gt;dilp6, act-ras<sup>V12</sup>)</italic> increased Dpn levels further (over twofold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,H,K</xref>). Remarkably, whereas activated Ras<sup>V1<italic>2</italic></sup> did not alter abdominal Dpn+ cell number, together Dilp-6 Ras<sup>V12</sup> resulted in a dramatic threefold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,H,N</xref>). It appeared that more than all glial cells now expressed <italic>dpn</italic>. These ectopic Dpn+ cells were located throughout the VNC, also invading and disrupting the neuropile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Thus, activated Ras with Dilp-6 induced Dpn+ cell proliferation. Overexpression of activated PI3K in glia <italic>(tubGAL80<sup>ts</sup>, repo&gt;act-PI3K)</italic> had no effect on abdominal Dpn+ levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I,L</xref>), but levels increased nearly fourfold when <italic>dilp-6</italic> was also overexpressed <italic>(tubGAL80<sup>ts</sup>, repo&gt;dilp-6, act-PI3K)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I,L</xref>). Interestingly, and contrary to Ras<sup>V12</sup>, activated PI3K induced Dpn only surrounding the neuropile, in positions normally occupied by neuropile glia (astrocytes, ensheathing glia, and midline glia). Co-overexpression of <italic>dilp-6 act-PI3K</italic> increased the number of Dpn+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I,O</xref>), but not as dramatically as Dilp-6 Ras<sup>V12</sup>. These data demonstrated that insulin signalling induces <italic>dpn</italic> expression ectopically in late larval glial cells and promotes their proliferation.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Activation of Ras or PI3K downstream of insulin signalling in glia induces ectopic Dpn+ cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Full ventral nerve cord (VNC) projections of VNCs showing normal thoracic levels of Dpn, and genotype-specific modulations, using anti-Dpn from Wang Lab.

This could mean that either some ectopic Dpn+ did not originate from glia, or that as glial cells reprogrammed into neural stem cells, they switched off glial gene expression. To test whether ectopic neural stem cells originated from glia, we used the cell-lineage marker G-TRACE. This GAL4-dependent tool results in the permanent labelling of GAL4/UAS-expressing cells and their lineage. Thus, as glial cells become neural stem cells, the glial <italic>repo</italic> promoter would be switched off, but G-TRACE would enable their visualisation as well as that of all their progeny cells. Cells that were originally glia but may no longer be so would be labelled in green (GFP+), and recently specified glial cells would be labelled in red (RFP+). G-TRACE expression in glia with <italic>repoGAL4</italic> together with <italic>dilp-6</italic> caused larval lethality and thus could not be analysed.

Pros controls the switch from neural stem cell to progenitor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>). In this way, cell–cell interactions involving Ia-2 can influence neural progenitor cell fate. <italic>ia-2</italic> loss of function would also cause a decrease in Dilp-6 secretion from neurons, but not from glia, as <italic>kon</italic> mRNA levels were unaffected, and <italic>dilp-6</italic> expression depends mostly on glial <italic>ko</italic>n. As neuronal Ia-2 and glial Kon mutually exclude each other, perhaps loss of <italic>ia-2</italic> function might increase <italic>kon-</italic>dependent Dilp-6 production. As Ia-2 is required for Dilp-6 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harashima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>ia-2</italic> GOF would increase Dilp-6 release triggering the Dilp-6 amplification loop. Conceivably, either way Dilp-6 increased and this induced Dpn. Upon injury, levels of <italic>kon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>ia-2</italic> expression increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Ia-2 drives secretion of Dilp-6 from neurons, Dilp-6 is received by glia, and a positive feedback amplification loop drives the further Kon and InR dependent production of Dilp-6 from cortex glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B, C</xref>). Dilp-6 can then both promote glial proliferation to generate more glia and induce the neural stem cell marker Dpn in neuropile glia – the subset known as <italic>‘Drosophila</italic> astrocytes’ and midline glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B,C</xref>). Ectopic Dpn+ cells were induced from glia both upon injury and genetic manipulation of Ia-2, Dilp-6, Ras, and PI3Kinase. Importantly, these glial-derived neural stem cells could divide, as revealed by the S-phase marker PCNA-GFP and the mitotic marker pH3, and could generate neurons, albeit to a rather limited extent. Altogether, Dilp-6 is relayed from neurons to cortex and then to neuropile glia. This neuron-glia communication relay could enable concerted glio- and neuro-genesis, matching interacting cell populations for regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C,D</xref>). Interestingly, Dilp-6 is also involved in non-autonomous relays between distinct CNS cell populations to activate neural stem cells and induce neuronal differentiation in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Ia-2 and Dilp-6 drive a regenerative neurogenic response to central nervous system (CNS) injury.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the abdominal larval ventral nerve cord (VNC), neurons have Ia-2, glia have Kon, and Ia-2 and Kon are mutually exclusive; non-midline glia have the transcription factor Repo and midline glia the membrane protein Wrapper. In the normal, uninjured abdominal VNC, InR is in glial cells and some neurons; Ia-2 expression is constantly present in neurons; <italic>kon</italic> is switched off, and there are no neural stem cells (neuroblasts). (<bold>B</bold>) Diagram showing that Dilp-6 can be secreted from neurons, amplified and secreted by cortex glia, and received by all glial types. Dilp-6 production and secretion depend on Kon and Ia-2, which increase in injury. (<bold>C</bold>) Injury to the abdominal VNC provokes a dramatic surge in Ia-2 and Kon. This drives the initial secretion of Dilp-6 from neurons (1). Secreted Dilp-6 binds InR in glia, and InR signalling may facilitate cleavage and activation of Kon. Kon<sup>ICD</sup> activates glial proliferation (2). In an autocrine Kon and InR dependent manner, Dilp-6 sets off a positive feedback loop that amplifies Dilp-6 production from cortex glia (2). Once secreted, Dilp-6 and InR signalling cause the upregulation of Dpn+ in neuropile glia – including Notch+ Pros+ lateral (astrocytes) and Wrp+ midline glia (3). Neuropile glia can stochastically switch on Dpn. Glial-derived Dpn+ neural stem cells can divide and generate new neurons – although to a rather limited extent (4). After cell division, Kon may determine whether daughter cells become glia, to the exclusion of Ia-2. (<bold>D</bold>) Insulin signalling involving Ia-2, Dilp-6, and InR can increase cell number of various glial cell types – including cortex glia, neuropile astrocytes and midline glia – induce neural stem cells, and potentially generate new neurons. The neurogenic potential of glia may depend on the availability of Notch and Pros and the downregulation of Kon. Together, these genes can potentially induce neurogenesis and gliogenesis, matching cell populations for regeneration.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58756-fig11-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We have demonstrated that ectopic neural stem cells originate from glia. Regenerative neurogenesis could occur via direct conversion of glia into neurons, glial de-differentiation, or neuronal de-differentiation. Neuronal de-differentiation occurs both in mammals and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Froldi et al., 2015</xref>). However, in most animals, neural stem cells in the adult CNS and upon injury are generally distinct from developmental ones, and can originate from hemocytes, but most often, glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dimou and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk and Götz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simões and Rhiner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2021</xref>). In the mammalian brain, radial glia in the hippocampus respond to environmental challenge by dividing asymmetrically to produce neural progenitors that produce neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shtaya et al., 2018</xref>); and astrocytes and NG2-glia can generate neurons, particularly in response to stroke, excitoxic injury, and genetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heinrich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dimou and Gallo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Péron and Berninger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, genetic manipulation can lead to the direct conversion of NG2-glia into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pereira et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings that Dilp-6 and InR signalling can induce <italic>dpn</italic> expression are reminiscent of their functions in the induction of neural stem cells from quiescent progenitors in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gil-Ranedo et al., 2019</xref>). However, the Dpn+ cells induced upon injury and after development are distinct from the developmental neural stem cells normally induced by Dilp-6 in multiple ways. Firstly, in injuries carried out in third instar larvae, the induced neural stem cells were more numerous than normal neural stem cells. Secondly, in injuries carried out late in wandering larvae, Dpn+ cells were found after normal developmental neural stem cells have been eliminated through apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bello et al., 2003</xref>). Thirdly, Dpn+ cells were found in dorsal ectopic locations not normally occupied by developmental neural stem cells. In all injury and genetic manipulation experiments involving overexpression of either <italic>ia-2</italic>, <italic>dilp-6</italic>, or <italic>PI3K</italic>, ectopic Dpn+ cells were located along the midline and surrounding the neuropile, in positions normally occupied by glia. Remarkably, concerted overexpression of <italic>ras</italic> and <italic>dilp-6</italic> induced Dpn in potentially all glial cells and more, consistently with further Dpn+ cell proliferation. Consistent with our findings, ectopic neuroblasts were also observed upon co-expression of activated <italic>ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> and knock-down of <italic>PTEN</italic> in glia, within glioma models in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gangwani et al., 2020</xref>). We demonstrated that ectopic Dpn+ originated from glia, most particularly neuropile glia (midline glia and <italic>‘Drosophila</italic> astrocytes’). Firstly, ectopic Dpn+ cells did not have Ia-2YFP, which is expressed in all neurons. Secondly, overexpression of <italic>ia-2</italic> or <italic>dilp-6</italic>, alone or in combination with <italic>ras</italic> and <italic>PI3K,</italic> in glia dramatically increased Dpn levels, meaning that insulin signalling induces <italic>dpn</italic> expression in glia. Thirdly, ectopic Dpn+ cells surrounding the neuropile occupied positions of astrocytes and had the pan-glial marker Repo, and Repo<sup>−</sup> Dpn+ along the midline had the midline glia marker Wrp. Fourthly, the glial origin of the ectopic Dpn+ cells was demonstrated using two cell-lineage tracing methods (G-TRACE and glial activation of the <italic>actin</italic> promoter) whereby the expression initiated from the glia <italic>repo</italic> promoter was turned permanent despite cell state transitions. Consistently with our findings, TRAP-RNA analysis of the normal third instar larva revealed expression of <italic>dpn</italic> and multiple genes involved in neuroblast polarity, asymmetric cell division, neuroblast proliferation, and neurogenesis in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). And single cell RNAseq analysis of the larval CNS revealed that in normal larvae some Repo+ glial cells can express <italic>dpn</italic>, or other neuroblast markers like <italic>wor</italic> and <italic>ase</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunet Avalos et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings show that basal or potential expression of neuroblast genes in glia is switched on and amplified by insulin signalling. We conclude that Ia-2 and Dilp-6 could reprogramme glial cells in vivo into neural stem cells.</p><p>Our data showed that the ectopic <italic>ia-2</italic> and <italic>dilp-6</italic> induced neural stem cells could divide and generate neurons. In fact, concomitant overexpression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> and <italic>PI3K</italic>, and most prominently <italic>dilp-6</italic> and <italic>ras</italic>, dramatically increased Dpn+ cell number. Dilp-6 induced glial-derived Dpn+ cells could express the S-phase marker PCNA-GFP, and Ia-2 induced Wrp+ Dpn+ cells that were pH3+ in mitosis. We could not detect mitotic cells surrounding the neuropile, but mitosis is brief, and could have easily been missed. The Dilp-6 induced ectopic Dpn+ cells could generate neurons that could be traced with GFP expression from their glial origin. Thus, ectopic neural stem cells induced by Dilp-6 can divide and produce neuronal progeny cells. However, the clusters of GFP+ cells originating from the in vivo reprogrammed glial cells were rather small, indicating that although neurogenesis was possible in late larvae, it was extremely constrained. This could be due to the fact that in the third instar larva, time is rather limited by pupariation. Injury and genetic manipulation in late larvae may not allow sufficient time for cell lineages to progress, before pupariation starts. Pupariation and metamorphosis bring in a different cellular context, which could interfere with regenerative neuronal differentiation. Alternatively, Ia-2 and Dpn may not be sufficient to carry neurogenesis through either. For instance, gain of <italic>ia-2</italic> function resulted only in Dpn+ but not Pros+ or Eve+ cells, suggesting that Ia-2 and Dpn are not sufficient for neuroblasts to progress to GMCs and neurons. In fact, ectopic Dpn+ cells still had Repo. Furthermore, we did not detect other ectopic neuroblast markers, such as Wor or Ase in glia. Nevertheless, RNA seq data revealed expression of neuroblast markers, including <italic>dpn, wor,</italic> and <italic>ase</italic> in some glia in normal larval CNS, meaning they could potentially be further regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunet Avalos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Still, to generate neurons, glia may not only require the expression of neural stem cell markers like <italic>dpn</italic>, but also perhaps receive other yet unknown signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). In mammals, injury creates a distinct cellular environment that prompts glial cells to generate different cell types than in the un-injured CNS. For instance, elevated Sox-2 is sufficient to directly reprogramme NG2-glia into neurons, but only upon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heinrich et al., 2014</xref>). Whereas during normal development NG2-glial cells may only produce oligodendrocyte lineage cells, upon injury they can also produce astrocytes and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dimou and Gallo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that there are injury-induced cues for neuronal differentiation. In the future, it will be compelling to find out what signals could enhance neurogenesis from glial cells reprogrammed in vivo by insulin signalling.</p><p>Our work has revealed a novel molecular mechanism driving a regenerative neurogenic response from glia, involving Kon/NG2 and insulin signalling. Ia-2 induces an initial secretion of Dilp-6 from neurons, Dilp-6 is received by glia, and a positive feedback loop amplifies the Kon-dependent production of Dilp-6 by cortex glia, Dilp-6 is then relayed to neuropile glia, resulting in the in vivo reprogramming of glial cells into neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). This mechanism can induce both glial regeneration and neural stem cells from glia, potentially also neurons, matching interacting neuronal and glial cell populations. The incidence of neuropile glia conversion to Dpn+ cells was variable, meaning the process is stochastic. However, all glia converted when activated Ras or PI3K were combined with Dilp-6, meaning levels of insulin signalling matter. Such a mechanism may also operate in mammals. In fact, Ia-2 has universal functions in dense core vesicles to release insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harashima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2011</xref>). Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) induces the production of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons from progenitor cells in the adult brain, in response to exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nieto-Estévez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mir et al., 2017</xref>). The transcription factor Sox-2 that can switch astrocytes to neural stem cells and produce neurons is a downstream effector of InR/AKT signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mir et al., 2017</xref>). NG2 also interacts with downstream components of the InR signalling pathway (e.g. PI3K-Akt-mTOR) to promote cell cycle progression and regulate the expression of its downstream effectors in a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nayak et al., 2018</xref>). Together, all of these findings indicate that Ia-2, NG2/Kon, and insulin signalling have a common function across animals in reprogramming glial cells into becoming neural stem cells.</p><p>Intriguingly, <italic>dpn</italic> was mostly induced in neuropile associated glial cells and was only induced in other glial types with overexpression of active Ras<sup>V12</sup> together with Dilp-6. Thus, perhaps prominently neuropile glia have neurogenic potential. Of the neuropile glia, <italic>Drosophila</italic> ‘astrocytes’ and midline glia express <italic>Notch, pros,</italic> and <italic>kon</italic>, as well as <italic>InR</italic>. The cells frequently called ‘astrocytes’ share features with mammalian NG2-glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hidalgo and Logan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kato et al., 2018</xref>). In mammals, the combination of Notch1, Prox1, and NG2 is unique to NG2-glia and is absent from astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>). Perhaps Ia-2 and Dilp-6 can only induce neural stem cells from NG2-like glia bearing this combination of factors. Notch activates glial proliferation and <italic>kon</italic> expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>), and in the mammalian CNS, Notch promotes NG2-glia proliferation and maintains the progenitor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamamoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ables et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piccin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk and Götz, 2017</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Notch and Pros also regulate <italic>dpn</italic> expression: Notch activates <italic>dpn</italic> expression promoting stemness, and Pros inhibits it, promoting transition to GMC and neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaessin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">San-Juán and Baonza, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babaoğlan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi and Kuang, 2015</xref>). Thus, only glial cells with Notch and Pros may be poised to modulate stemness and neuronal differentiation. We showed that <italic>InR</italic> is expressed in neuropile glia, which was confirmed by publically available single cell RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunet Avalos et al., 2019</xref>). Insulin signalling represses FoxO, which represses <italic>dpn,</italic> and thus ultimately activates <italic>dpn</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>). As Notch and insulin signalling positively regulate <italic>dpn</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaessin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">San-Juán and Baonza, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babaoğlan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi and Kuang, 2015</xref>), and injury induces a Notch-dependent upregulation of Kon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>), which enables <italic>dilp-6</italic> expression, and of Ia-2, which secretes Dilp-6, our data indicate that Notch-Kon/NG2-insulin synergy triggers the activation of <italic>dpn</italic> expression. Importantly, we found no evidence that Kon functions in neural stem cells. Thus, perhaps induced neural stem cells can generate only glia from daughter cells that inherit Kon, on which Repo and glial cell fate depend, or generate neurons, from daughter cells that lack Kon, but have Pros, on which Ia-2 depends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Thus, upon injury, Notch, Pros, Kon/NG2, Ia-2, and insulin signalling function together to enable the regenerative production of both glial cells and neural stem cells from glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C,D</xref>). Intriguingly, developmental neural stem cells are thought to be eliminated through upregulation of Pros, induction of cell cycle exit, and terminal differentiation into glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings imply that such termination may not be final.</p><p>To conclude, a neuron-glia communication relay involving Ia-2, Dilp-6, Kon, and InR is responsible for the induction of neural stem cells from glia, their proliferation, and limited neurogenesis. Neuronal Ia-2 and Dilp-6 trigger two distinct responses in glia: (1) in cortex glial cells, insulin signalling boosts Kon-dependent amplification of Dilp-6, glial proliferation, and glial regeneration. (2) In neuropile-associated NG2-like glial cells, insulin signalling unlocks a neurogenic response, inducing neural stem cell fate. As a result, these genes can drive the production of both glial cells and neurons after injury, enabling the matching of interacting cell populations, which is essential for regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p>Fly stocks used are listed in Key Resources Table.

All images were taken with resolution 512 × 512 or 1024 × 1024, step 0.96 μm and 1–3× averaging for all samples except for cell counting with DeadEasy that have no averaging.</p><p>Images were analysed using ImageJ. Images of horizontal sections are projections from the stacks of confocal images that span the thickness of the entire VNC, using ImageJ. Transverse views were generated using the Reslice option. Images were processed using Adobe Creative Suite 6 Photoshop and compiled with Adobe Illustrator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Automatic cell counting</title><p>Glial cells labelled either with anti-Repo or with repoGAL4&gt;UAShistone-YFP were counted automatically in 3D across the thickness of the VNC using DeadEasy Larval Glia software, as previously described. Prospero+ and Dpn+ cells were counted manually in 3D (i.e. not in projections), as the signal was noisy for DeadEasy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using Graphpad Prism. All data in this work are continuous, except for the PCNAGFP data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref> which are categorical. The latter were analysed with a non-parametric Fisher’s exact test. For all other data, tests to determine whether data were distributed normally and variances were equal were initially carried out, and thereafter if so, parametric one-way ANOVA tests were carried out when comparing more than two sample types group. Multiple comparison corrections were carried out with post hoc Dunnett tests comparisons to set controls, or Bonferroni comparisons of all samples against all. Box plots were used to represent the distribution of continuous data, where the line within the box represents the median of the data distribution, the box comprises the 25 percentiles above and below the median, and the whiskers the lowest and highest 25 percentiles.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank our labs and C Rezaval for discussions and

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hugo Bellen as the Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers feel that several conclusions made throughout the manuscript are not fully supported by data presented, and some conflicting results need to be addressed or resolved. Several reviewers also recommended that there is the backbone of interesting story but the number of experiments requested cannot be performed in a few months. Finally, we also found the manuscript difficult to read and it really needs editing. The reviewers also mention this. We did not feel 2 months is adequate time to address all of the reviewers' concerns. If you are willing to address most of the reviewers comments and resubmit the manuscript along with a detailed rebuttal letter, we will send this work back to the current reviewers. Please note that the reviewers would like all their comments addressed and the resubmission option is the same as a new submission except that we will try our best to find the same reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Harrison et al. identify a novel molecular mechanism involving islet antigen (Ia-2), Kon/NG2 and Dilp-6 to induce regenerative neurogenesis from glia. Through a genetic screen and qRT-PCR analysis the authors clearly demonstrate Ia-2 as a functional neuronal partner of Kon and that Ia-2 can participate in the Kon, Notch and Pros gene network that drives a regenerative response to CNS injury. Using crush injury experiments, they further show that Ia-2 levels are significantly upregulated during injury and changes in Ia-2 levels induced the formation of ectopic neural stem cells. Interestingly, these ectopic neural stem cells originated from glia. Finally, they demonstrate a neuron-glia communication loop involving Ia-2, Dilp-6,Kon and InR. Ia-2 was capable of inducing the secretion of Dilp-6 from neurons, which is taken up by glia and amplified through a kon-dependent positive feedback loop to induce both glial regeneration and neural stem cell proliferation.</p><p>Overall, this is an very interesting study with novel findings on regenerative neurogenesis. The experiments are well performed and supported by proper quantification. However, the following points may strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>1) The authors show that both ia-2 gain of function and loss of function in neurons increased the number of abdominal VNC Dpn+ cells and ia-2 was up-regulated during injury. The fact that both the ia-2 lof and gof resulted in a similar phenotype seems counter-intuitive. It would be helpful if the authors can provide an explanation for this.</p><p>2) Over-expression of full length kon in neurons and glia resulted in the down-regulation of ia-2 mRNA levels but had no effect on dpn or dilp-6 expression. It would be interesting to know whether over-expression of konICD could cause a change in dpn or dilp-6 expression.</p><p>3) Similarly, since InR signaling can activate kon cleavage downstream in glia, could over-expression of konICD induce ectopic Dpn+ cells?</p><p>4) In general, the writing needs to be improved. Certain sentences were long and hard to follow which made the reading difficult.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses an important problem – how to achieve neuronal regeneration in humans – using an excellent model system, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where there are superb tools for identifying and characterizing signaling pathways.</p><p>The manuscript jumps off from the observation that the evolutionarily conserved transmembrane/nuclear glial protein Kon-tiki (fly)/NG2 (mouse) may promote &quot;regenerative neurogenesis&quot; via an unknown ligand.</p><p>Overall the paper is clearly written and the figures are appropriate.</p><p>I have a single major comment that affects the whole paper, and multiple minor comments. Overall, the paper needs additional experiments before resubmission.</p><p>1) Throughout the paper conclusions are not fully supported by the data shown. Most results paragraphs end with a conditional conclusion, but then in the headers and subsequent sections it is assumed to be proven. The manuscript would be strengthened by either dampening down conclusions to match the data, or by adding additional data to justify the conclusions. A major example is the claim of “regenerative neurogenesis” in the title, Abstract, and Results… yet there are no data presented showing the production of newly-induced neurons – only increased Dpn+ cells (without showing these cells express other stem cell markers, proliferation markers, or produce neuronal progeny).</p><p>2) Calling kon and ia-2 &quot;partners&quot; suggests a direct physical interaction. This has not been shown. There could be a dozen genes acting between these two. Please add direct interaction experiments or use wording that accurately reflects the unknown relationship between the two proteins. Multiple examples in the text; where it is stated &quot;ia-2 is a functional partner of Kon.&quot;</p><p>3) Figure 2F,G says &quot;ectopic Pros+ cells might be GMCs or neurons&quot; but this result should be resolved by staining for Elav protein (neurons) and Asense (neuroblasts and GMCs) and Worniu (neuroblasts).</p><p>4) The text says loss of Ia-2 &quot;destabilizes cell fate&quot; but this statement is extremely vague; it seems to hide the fact that the actual phenotype is not known.</p><p>5) The use of ectopic Dpn+ cells to indicate “induced neurogenesis” is premature. The authors at a minimum need to assay the ectopic Dpn+ cells for other neuroblast (stem cell) markers (e.g. Wor, Ase) to validate stem cell identity, and PH3 or PCNA to validate their proliferative state. To make their conclusion solid it would be ideal to induce clones containing these ectopic Dpn+ cells and show the clone includes neurons.</p><p>6) Figure 3D is unconvincing. The images show large speckles in the Dpn channel that are similar to the “ectopic Dpn+ cells” plus the number of ectopic Dpn+ cells per brain is not quantified (that I could find).</p><p>7) Either show data or cite prior work showing that InR-gal4 mimics the InR endogenous expression pattern.</p><p>8) Figure 5B. The increased number of glia is not convincing. All panels look the same to me. The statistics show much greater significance between panels than I trust. It would be good to give the raw numbers in a supplement so that the statistics could be validated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Harrison et al. describes a neuronal-glial communication loop that requires Ia-2, Dilp-6, InR and kon and in some circumstances, can induce the formation of Dpn+ cells from glia. Overall, the manuscript presents an interesting signaling relationship between neurons and glia that could influence neurogenesis. However, the manuscript was not easy to read or interpret and covers many details not essential for the final conclusions. Significant revisions are required to clarify and simplify the manuscript before publication. In addition, ensure that conclusions are appropriate for the data shown and do not overreach. Finally, specific suggestions are below.</p><p>1) The authors state that kon overexpression (which has a striking VNC overgrowth phenotype) decreases the transcript of ia-2 (not significantly?) but RNAi of ia-2 suppresses kon<sub>on</sub> overexpression phenotypes, which is suspicious. Do multiple RNAi lines for ia-2 give the same suppression of kon overexpression? How about the other ia-2 phenotypes presented throughout the manuscript? It is possible that off target affects could account for these phenotypes and a second RNAi line should be used to verify ia-2 phenotypes. Since the authors start with kon overexpression phenotypes in the VNC and suppression, the reader is left with a conflict that is not resolved. How does ia-2 knockdown suppress kon overexpression phenotypes, which reduces the levels of ia-2 in the first place? If the authors choose the keep this data in the manuscript, they must address this discrepancy.</p><p>2) For Figure 1A and supplemental, with what genotype were the samples normalized/compared? The authors show the control in B but not A. Conclusions are made that are not necessarily supported. Since the authors state that kon overexpression only marginally decreased ia-2 mRNA levels, too much emphasis is placed on this result, which leaves the reader with concerns mentioned in 4, above. Knockdown of kon may not specifically regulate Ia-2 mRNA levels but may be the result of extra Ia-2 positive cells shown in Figure 2.</p><p>3) Pros does not simply activate ia-2 as removal of pros or Pros expression causes ia-2 mRNA increase. This is difficult to interpret and is not a simple ARROW (below 1D). Perhaps analysis of Notch and Pros is unnecessary here as it complicates the message of the manuscript.</p><p>4) When analyzing loss of ia-2, sometimes Df plus RNAi is used, sometimes only RNAi is used. Please be consistent with the strategy to remove ia-2 if you wish to compare phenotypes.</p><p>5) What is the difference between Figure 3B and D? You provide numbers for controls in the text, so it is unclear why numbers are not provided for the injury model. Also, what is the percentage that lack Ia-2YFP?</p><p>6) The authors make strong statements about RNA changes in ia-1 LOF and GOF models (Figure 4E-F), but no changes are statistically significant. Perhaps this data belongs in supplemental or not include at all.</p><p>7) Is Figure 5E the same stage as 2J? If so, the controls have very different number of Dpn + cells. If this is due to the genetic background or the GAL4, it is not the correct driver to use.</p><p>8) In the section &quot;Ia-2 and Dilp6 can induce neural stem cells from glia&quot;, it does not seem that everything is included or referenced correctly. I don't see images of &quot;repoGAL4&gt;UAS-ia-2, UAS-dilp-6-RNAi&quot;, &quot;repoGAL4&gt;UAS-ia-2, UAS-konRNAi&quot;, or &quot;repoGAL4&gt;UAS-dilp-6, UAS-InRDN&quot; even though 6A-D is referenced for each genotype. Ideally, the authors should control for GAL4 dilution effects and use the same ia-2-YFP in all comparisons (epoGAL4&gt;UAS-dilp-6, UAS-InRDN does not have this transgene).</p><p>9) Dpn staining in Figure 7 is not clear. All arrows do not convincingly point to a Dpn + cell because of the high background. Use a different color for Dpn in C/D as blue cannot be seen. Better Dpn staining is presented in other figures. As this experiment is important, perhaps an image with less background or better Dpn staining can be shown.</p><p>10. What is the direct evidence that there is Ia-2 regulated Dilp-6 signaling from neurons to glia?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regenerative neurogenic response from glia requires insulin driven neuron-glia communication&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hongyan Wang (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The reviewers feel that while many comments were adequately addressed, several essential points remain problematic and do not support the conclusions of the manuscript. These include experiments with technical difficulties or uninterpretable results. If you are willing and able to address the reviewers' concerns you may resubmit a revised manuscript with a detailed rebuttal letter.</p><p>It is required that you address the following to be reconsidered for publication:</p><p>1) Additional NSC markers must be optimized. Dpn staining in some figures is unconvincing and must be verified using additional markers.</p><p>2) Cell markers routinely used by many labs must work (Wor, Ase, Elav)</p><p>3) Dpn is a reagent that works well and should be clear.</p><p>Please note that this decision letter does not guarantee that this manuscript will be accepted. At least one reviewer feels that their concerns were not addressed in the revised manuscript and that it is in everyone's best interest that the authors can prove that the inability to provide the appropriate expression patterns is not indicative of a deeper problem with the underlying hypothesis.</p><p>1) The main conclusion of the paper (glia transform into NSCs which produce neurons) but is not supported by data: only one NSC marker used out of many available.</p><p>The authors tried two additional NSC markers but did not observe staining, despite these reagents working for many labs in many publications. &quot;We did not consider these results satisfactory enough to present.&quot;</p><p>This is a major flaw, especially how unusual the Dpn staining looks like in the ectopic Dpn+ cells (very speckly). Failure to show additional NSC markers very concerning is a real issue; also no evidence for asymmetric cell division at mitosis (a hallmark of these NSCs).</p><p>2) There is no evidence for proliferation of the ectopic Dpn+ cells. The authors state that ectopic Dpn+ cells expressed the S phase marker PCNA:GFP and can be labeled with the mitotic marker pH3.</p><p>However, only panes 8A-C show PCNA<sup>+</sup> Dpn+ cells, which are increased following dilp-6 overexpression. No data in the figure shows ectopic Dpn+ cells that are pH3. The rest of the figure shows glial markers and PCNA or pH3, which is irrelevant to the question of whether ectopic Dpn+ cells can divide.</p><p>3) To show evidence that ectopic Dpn+ cells produce neuronal progeny, the authors used the pros-Gal4 line to drive flybow expression, and observed a small cluster of cells that included one Dpn+ and one Elav+ cell. As the authors say &quot;this does not prove these cells are related by lineage, but is consistent with it.&quot;</p><p>This does not show Dpn+ cells are producing neurons.</p><p>4) The authors also used &quot;flip out&quot; genetics to permanently mark glial cells.</p><p>The genetics shown in the figure, legend, and reviewer response will not specifically label glia. The genotype is: actGAL4&gt;y+&gt;UASGFP/UAS-FLP; repoGAL4/Dilp-6. This would induce Flp widely, in all cells due to ubiquitous expression of actin-gal4. Most likely, the authors wrote down the wrong genotype in the figure, legend, Materials and methods, and reviewer response – it is probably actin promotor-FRT-stop-FRT-GFP. They cite Table 1 for more information on genotypes but there is no Table 1 provided.</p><p>5) In order to call kon and ia-2 partners, a direct physical interaction should be shown. The authors could not get the biochemical experiments to work for various reasons. Changed text from &quot;partners&quot; to &quot;functional neuronal partner.&quot;</p><p>The continued use of “partner” is inappropriate. The most accurate description of their relationship is that they show “genetic interactions” – so the first results header should be changed from &quot;Ia-2 is a functional partner of Kon&quot; to &quot;Ia-2 and kon show genetic interactions.&quot;</p><p>6) Saying ectopic Pros+ cells are GMCs or neurons is premature and can be definitively resolved by staining for Wor or Dpn (neuroblast-specific), Ase (neuroblast and GMC), and Elav (neurons). All have been extensively used by many labs. The authors could not get the stains to work.</p><p>This is unsatisfactory.</p><p>7) The text says loss of ia-2 &quot;destabilizes cell fate&quot; – which is a vague term that obscures the phenotype. The authors changed text to &quot;… upregulated GMC and NSC markers.&quot;</p><p>They looked at Dpn but no other NSC marker, and Pros is not a specific GMC marker, also being expressed in neuropile glia near the midline (which is worrying).</p><p>8) Dpn staining in Figure 3D is unconvincing; everything looks speckly. The authors state that Dpn staining is speckly in their hands.</p><p>Many labs have used Dpn to mark neuroblasts, it is a very reliable reagent. The authors have good Dpn staining in other figures; this suggest to me that the ectopic Dpn+ cells are different from the normal Dpn+ NPCs, leading to different protein localization/levels. This concern is reinforced by the failure of the authors to show the ectopic Dpn+ cells express any other NSC marker.</p><p>9) Ectopic Dpn+ cells were not quantified due to due to the disruption and variability of the abdominal crush procedure. The authors only counted the VNCs in which they could see ectopic Dpn+ (cells).</p><p>Cherry-picking only VNCs that show ectopic Dpn+ cells is inappropriate.</p><p>10) In response to InR-Gal4 expression concerns, the authors state &quot;we do not know whether (InR-gal4) represents the endogenous expression pattern&quot;. It labels sparse patterns of neurons and sporadic glial cells.</p><p>The authors directly state in the revised manuscript &quot;we visualized InR expression using available GAL4 lines to drive his-YFP&quot; but in the reviewer response they acknowledge this is not accurate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58756.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

It would be helpful if the authors can provide an explanation for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not fully understand why <italic>ia-2</italic> loss of function induced ectopic Dpn+, but data were unambiguous. Reasoning through it, <italic>ia-2</italic> loss of function would cause a decrease in Dilp-6 from neurons (Cai et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2008), but not from glia, as k<sub>on</sub> mRNA levels were unaffected (Figure 1B) and <italic>dilp-6</italic> expression depends mostly on glial k<sub>on</sub> (Figure 4C). <italic>ia-2</italic> loss of function caused an increase in Pros+ small cells that were not glia (Figure 2F-H), and this effect was non-autonomous, since neuronal number was unaffected (Figure 2D). This suggested that perhaps cell-cell interactions involving Ia-2, between neurons and other cell types, is required to prevent a reversion to progenitor or neural stem cell fate. Alternatively, as the genetic data suggest that neuronal <italic>ia-2</italic> and glial k<sub>on</sub> mutually exclude each other, perhaps loss of <italic>ia-2</italic> function resulted in an increase in k<sub>on</sub> function that we could not detect, and with it an increase in Dilp-6. The gain of function effect was clearer. Ia-2 is required for Dilp-6 secretion (Harashima et al., 2005; Cai et al., 2001), thus <italic>ia-2</italic> gain of function, as well as the increase in Ia-2 levels with injury, presumably resulted in increased release of Dilp-6. Conceivably, perhaps either way Dilp-6 increased and this induced Dpn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Over-expression of full length k<sub>on</sub> in neurons and glia resulted in the down-regulation of ia-2 mRNA levels but had no effect on dpn or dilp-6 expression. It would be interesting to know whether over-expression of konICD could cause a change in dpn or dilp-6 expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that this was an interesting question. Thus, we carried out qRT-PCRs to measure levels of <italic>dilp-6</italic> and <italic>dpn</italic> mRNA in wandering 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae of genotypes: control <italic>UAS-kon<sup>ICD</sup>/+</italic> and test <italic>repoGAL4&gt;UAS-kon<sup>ICD</sup></italic> and <italic>elavGAL4&gt;UAS-kon<sup>ICD</sup></italic> using n=10 VNC and 3 biological replicates each.

With <italic>kon<sup>ICD</sup></italic>, <italic>dpn</italic> mRNA was upregulated, but this result was still very variable. Unfortunately, as the results were variable and we could not resolve the discrepancy between the full-length and the cleaved forms, we decided to leave them out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Similarly, since InR signaling can activate k<sub>on</sub> cleavage downstream in glia, could over-expression of konICD induce ectopic Dpn+ cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We also thought this was interesting. We attempted this, and carried out anti-Dpn stainings in wandering 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae at 120h AEL, of genotypes: control <italic>UAS-kon<sup>ICD</sup>/+</italic> and test <italic>repoGAL4&gt;UAS-kon<sup>ICD</sup></italic>. Over-expression of <italic>kon<sup>ICD</sup></italic> did not induce ectopic Dpn+ cells. However, as this effect was normally stochastic, anti-Dpn doesn’t reliably result in unambiguous signal and ectopic NBs generally have lower levels than normal NBs, we couldn’t resolve whether this was absence of evidence or evidence of absence. The qRT-PCR results above were variable, but resulted in increased dpn mRNA, which contradicted the lack of ectpic Dpn+ in the stainings. So together, these two data sets did not help resolve whether <italic>UAS-kon<sup>ICD</sup></italic> could induce Dpn or not or how efficiently. Either way, we could not conclude and had to leave out.</p><p>We tried to address a similar question with a different approach: does lack of k<sub>on</sub> in null mutant clones in glia result in the conversion of glial cells into neuroblasts or neurons? For this, we carried out Twin-spot MARCM mutant clones in glia with <italic>repoGAL4</italic>, whereby the twin clones resulting from mitotic recombination would be either <italic>kon<sup>c452</sup> </italic>mutant (RFP) or wild-type (GFP), and the control clones would be wild-type both for RFP and GFP.

This meant that the Twin-spot MARCM lines provided by Janelia were rather strange.

In the previous version, we had ended each section by first drawing a conclusion based on the data, followed by introducing a new question – as it is most common in science that solving a question raises a further question. This new question was then solved in the following section. This style was meant to create a suspense, anticipation and ease the reading. We have done it for other manuscripts, where it worked, but we do understand that it doesn’t work for all readers. Thus, to satisfy this reviewer, for the revised version we have finished all sections with a straightforward conclusion, and we have moved the questions to the beginning of new sections.</p><p>Second point: claim of “regenerative neurogenesis” in the title, Abstract, and Results… yet there are no data presented showing the production of newly-induced neurons – only increased Dpn+ cells (without showing these cells express other stem cell markers, proliferation markers, or produce neuronal progeny). Other examples below.</p><p>This reviewer is correct that we had previously not provided any evidence for de novo neurogenesis. Thus, we have removed the word “neurogenesis” from the title – changing it to “neurogenic response from glia” – have considerably restricted the use of this word and taken care to use it more accurately.</p><p>An important point had been raised, i.e. whether the ectopic neural stem cells could complete de novo neurogenesis. For the revision, we have carried out more experiments – as suggested by this reviewer – and provide novel data to address this point:</p><p>1) Neural stem cell markers: We attempted to visualise the ectopic neural stem cells using other neural stem cell markers, anti-Worniu and anti-Asense. We did this in wandering third instar larvae at 120h AEL, of genotypes: control <italic>repoGAL4/+,</italic> and over-expression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> in glia: repoGAL4/UAS-dilp-6. Unfortunately, in our hands, these antibodies resulted in very high background, and we did not consider these results satisfactory enough to present.</p><p>However, we provide new data that show that not only lateral neuropile glia, but also midline can convert into Dpn+ neuroblasts. We demonstrate that all ectopic Dpn+ cells originate from glia. These new data are now reported in Figure 7C-F showing Wrp+ Dpn+ cells at the midline, and revised version text.</p><p>2) Proliferation: we tested whether over-expression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> or <italic>ia-2</italic> could cause the ectopic neural stem cells to divide, testing this using the G1-phase marker PCNA-GFP and the mitosis marker anti-phospho-histone-H3 (pH3). We found that:</p><p>a) New Figure 8A-D, PCNA-GFP: Over-expression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> at 110.5h AEL with <italic>heat-shock GAL4</italic> in late third instar larvae induced PCNAGFP in ectopic Dpn+ cells located around the neuropile. Genotype: <italic>PCNAGFP, hsGAL4/+;; UAS-dilp-6/+.</italic></p><p>b) New Fig8ure A-H, PCNA-GFP: Over-expression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> with at 110.5h AEL <italic>heat-shock GAL4</italic> in late third instar larvae induced PCNAGFP in Wrp+ midline glia.</p><p>Genotype: <italic>PCNAGFP, hsGAL4/+;; UAS-dilp-6/+</italic></p><p>c) New Figure 8I-L, pH3: Over-expression of <italic>ia-2</italic> with <italic>repo-GAL4</italic> induced mitosis, visualised in Wrp+ pH3+midline cells. Genotype: <italic>repoGAL4&gt;UAShisYFP, UAS-ia-2.</italic> The increase was not statistically significant, but visualising mitosis is challenging as it is very brief.</p><p>Thus, we demonstrate that ectopic Dpn+ cells can be induced from two types of glial cells, Repo+ neuropile glia and Wrp+ midline glia, and these can divide. These findings are now reported in revised version text.</p><p>3) Neurogenesis: we carried out two new experiments to test whether the ectopic Dpn+ cells can generate neurons:</p><p>a) Use <italic>pros</italic> promoter to visualise progeny neurons, data provided in new Figure 9A,B: we had shown that ectopic Dpn+ cells originated from glial cells (Figure 6,7). Thus, we would not be able to use a glial promoter to visualise their progeny cells, since as glia reprogrammed into neural stem cells, they would stop responding to glial gene expression (e.g. driven by Repo, controlled by the <italic>repo</italic> promoter). Thus, to visualise the progeny cells of re-programmed glia, now Dpn+, we used the <italic>pros</italic> promoter instead. As the <italic>pros</italic> gene can be expressed in any nervous system cell type, we reasoned that it could remain switched on as cells went through a cell-state transition. With <italic>prosGAL4&gt; UASFlyBow</italic> we small clusters of cells, like shown in Figure 9A,B: one cell was Dpn+ and one was Elav+. Although this does not demonstrate that these cells are related by lineage, it would be compatible with it.</p><p>b) Lineage tracing, new Figure 9C,D: To test whether Dpn+ cells could result in Elav+ cells through lineage, we used flies bearing <italic>actinGAL4&gt;y+ stop&gt;UASGFP, repoGAL4</italic> crossed to <italic>UASFLP, UAS dilp-6</italic>. Here, Flippase is over-expressed only in glia, where it removes the stop codon downstream of the actin promoter, thus switching reporter gene expression from being under the control of a glial promoter to a house-keeping general promoter, of <italic>actin</italic>. This labels all progeny cells of glia and reprogrammed glia. We found that over-expressing <italic>dilp-6</italic> resulted in progeny cells that were GFP+ as well as Elav+, and therefore were neurons.</p><p>Thus, these data demonstrate that glia reprogrammed into ectopic Dpn+ neural stem cells by Dilp-6 can produce neurons. Production of neurons was rather limited as we never found clusters larger than 3 cells. As these larvae were 120h old or as old as possible and about to pupate, pupariation likely restricts the regenerative neurogenic response of glia.</p><p>These new data are provided in new Figure 9A-D and text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Calling k<sub>on</sub> and ia-2 &quot;partners&quot; suggests a direct physical interaction. This has not been shown. There could be a dozen genes acting between these two. Please add direct interaction experiments or use wording that accurately reflects the unknown relationship between the two proteins. Multiple examples in the text; where it is stated &quot;ia-2 is a functional partner of Kon.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We were also interested in finding out whether the interaction was direct, as both are transmembrane proteins, and could function in cell-to-cell communication. We attempted to carry out co-immunoprecipitations, by tagging Ia-2 with HA and Kon-full-length with FLAG and co-transfecting S2 cells. This involved cloning <italic>ia-2</italic> and k<sub>on</sub> cDNAs into <italic>pAct5</italic> expression vectors, for which we had to generate a k<sub>on</sub> cDNA by RT-PCR, as full-length cDNAs were unavailable. However, we could not get <italic>pAct5-kon-FL-FLAG</italic> to express. We found out there was a point mutation in the construct that introduced a stop codon. Using site directed mutagenesis, we corrected this mutation, but still <italic>kon-FL-FLAG</italic> would not get expressed in S2 cells. We did not understand why this was the case, but solving this would have meant starting again from scratch. This would have required far longer time than appropriate for a revision. Thus, we put considerable effort to attempt this experiment, but could not get it to work.</p><p>We modified the text instead, and used the term “functional neuronal partner”, meaning a functional link without necessarily a physical interaction. The the text has been modified accordingly in the Abstract, Introduction and Results sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2F,G says &quot;ectopic Pros+ cells might be GMCs or neurons&quot; but this result should be resolved by staining for Elav protein (neurons) and Asense (neuroblasts and GMCs) and Worniu (neuroblasts).</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to resolve this using Anti-Elav (rat) + anti-Pros (mouse) to stain larvae of genotypes: Control: <italic>yw,</italic> and test: <italic>elavGAL4&gt;UAS-ia-2RNAi.</italic> However, unfortunately, we obtained cross-hybridisation, and the two markers could not be resolved.</p><p>We also tried with the recommended neuroblast markers, Anti-Asense and anti-Worniu together with anti-Pros, in larvae of the same genotype as above. However, unfortunately, in our hands these antibodies gave very high background, and the data were not satisfactory. Thus, these experiments did not work either.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The text says loss of Ia-2 &quot;destabilizes cell fate&quot; but this statement is extremely vague; it seems to hide the fact that the actual phenotype is not known.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a point for debate. The fact that a cell previously known as glial can become a neural stem cell would imply that cell fate is not as fixed and stable as it was previously thought. The phenotype was being explored in Figure 2, at the beginning of the paper, so perhaps at that point the phenotype was not yet known. But 8 Figures later for an article of 10 main Figures and a proposed functional model, it would appear that the statement above is a misinterpretation. Still, to address this reviewer’s point, we have now changed this statement for “interference with normal neuronal Ia-2 levels up-regulated ganglion mother cell and neural stem cell markers”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The use of ectopic Dpn+ cells to indicate “induced neurogenesis” is premature. The authors at a minimum need to assay the ectopic Dpn+ cells for other neuroblast (stem cell) markers (e.g. Wor, Ase) to validate stem cell identity, and PH3 or PCNA to validate their proliferative state. To make their conclusion solid it would be ideal to induce clones containing these ectopic Dpn+ cells and show the clone includes neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer is correct that we had previously not provided any evidence for de novo neurogenesis. Thus, we have removed the word “neurogenesis” from the title – changing it to “neurogenic response from glia” -, have considerably restricted the use of this word and taken care to use it more accurately.</p><p>Still, an important point had been raised, i.e. whether the ectopic neural stem cells could complete de novo neurogenesis. For the revision, we have carried out more experiments – as suggested by this reviewer – and provide novel data to address this point:</p><p>1) Neural stem cell markers: We attempted to visualise the ectopic neural stem cells using other neural stem cell markers, anti-Worniu and anti-Asense. We did this in wandering third instar larvae at 120h AEL, of genotypes: control <italic>repoGAL4/+,</italic> and over-expression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> in glia: repoGAL4/UAS-dilp-6. Unfortunately, in our hands, these antibodies resulted in very high background, and we did not consider these results satisfactory enough to present.</p><p>However, we provide new data that show that not only lateral neuropile glia, but also midline can convert into Dpn+ neuroblasts. We demonstrate that all ectopic Dpn+ cells originate from glia. These new data are now reported in Figure 7C-F showing Wrp+ Dpn+ cells at the midline, and revised text.</p><p>2) Proliferation: we tested whether over-expression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> or <italic>ia-2</italic> could cause the ectopic neural stem cells to divide, testing this using the G1-phase marker PCNA-GFP and the mitosis marker anti-phospho-histone-H3 (pH3). We found that:</p><p>a) New Figure 8A-D, PCNA-GFP: Over-expression of <italic>dilp-6</italic> with <italic>heat-shock GAL4</italic> in late third instar larvae induced PCNAGFP in ectopic Dpn+ cells located around the neuropile.

The images show large speckles in the Dpn channel that are similar to the “ectopic Dpn+ cells” plus the number of ectopic Dpn+ cells per brain is not quantified (that I could find).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our Dpn stainings were rather speckly at this stage, later ones were cleaner. Injured larval VNCs, most particularly these younger and slender ones, were extremely fragile, and stainings were rather challenging. If washed vigorously the whole injured VNC could fall apart. We tried some more samples, but unfortunately the quality of anti-Dpn at this early stage was still similar to that provided.</p><p>To address the criticism of lack of quantification, we counted all ectopic Dpn+, not just for this time point, but for all time-points. For the younger larvae (Figure 3H, 74-80h AEL), when there were still developmental neuroblasts, the crush injury caused massive lesions that removed also normal Dpn+ neuroblasts, complicating the analysis. So, we counted the VNCs in which we could see ectopic Dpn+. For the rest (Figure 3K-O) all injured samples were counted, and all Dpn+ in the abdominal VNC were counted at 120-129h AEL, when there are no remaining developmental neuroblasts except in the midline. In (Figure 3P) we show the average number of Dpn+ surrounding the lesion, for each time point.</p><p>Counts of Dpn+ cells are now provided in new graphs in Figure 3H,K,L,O,P</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Either show data or cite prior work showing that InR-gal4 mimics the InR endogenous expression pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>We had visualised the expression of the <italic>insulin receptor (InR)</italic> using an available GAL4 line, <italic>InR[NP2552].</italic> We do not know whether this represents the endogenous expression pattern, as <italic>GAL4</italic> is inserted in an intron. To test whether other <italic>InR-GAL4</italic> drivers might have the same or different expression patterns, we purchased and tested all three available lines. We visualised their expression with nuclear histone-YFP and stained the larvae with the pan-glial marker anti-Repo and the pan-neuronal marker anti-Elav:</p><p>Anti-Repo and anti-Elav in InRGal4[NP2552], InRGal4[0488-G4], InRGal4[0726-G4] x UAS-HisYFP.

The increased number of glia is not convincing. All panels look the same to me. The statistics show much greater significance between panels than I trust. It would be good to give the raw numbers in a supplement so that the statistics could be validated.</p></disp-quote><p>We wonder if perhaps there might have been a misunderstanding here. To clarify, glia were labelled with <italic>repo&gt;his-YFP</italic> and his-YFP+ cells were counted automatically in 3D volumes throughout the stacks using accurate and validated DeadEasy software (Forero et al., 2012). DeadEasy counts cells using a combination of signal intensity and cell volume within validated margins. Graphs do not show mean nor error bars, but box-plots, with the box representing the distribution of 50% of samples and the line across is the median, and the whiskers the distribution of the upper and lower 25% of samples. The significance provided is factual, and all statistical details had been provided in the Supplement file 1. Thus, the reviewers “lack of trust” is not grounded on the evidence provided. Although in principle we would of course be happy to provide the raw data for these counts, we find this unnecessary. This kind of experiment is not novel, nor the software, which has been used to automatically count larval his-YFP+ cells in previous successful publications (Kato et al., 2011; Losada-Perez et al., 2016; Foldi et al., 2917). To avoid misunderstandings and make the difference more apparent, the graph has been enlarged and a dashed line has been added across the control median, to facilitate comparisons.</p><p>Please see Revised Figure 5C, and statistical details provided in Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Harrison et al. describes a neuronal-glial communication loop that requires Ia-2, Dilp-6, InR and k<sub>on</sub> and in some circumstances, can induce the formation of Dpn+ cells from glia. Overall, the manuscript presents an interesting signaling relationship between neurons and glia that could influence neurogenesis. However, the manuscript was not easy to read or interpret and covers many details not essential for the final conclusions. Significant revisions are required to clarify and simplify the manuscript before publication. In addition, ensure that conclusions are appropriate for the data shown and do not overreach. Finally, specific suggestions are below.</p><p>1) The authors state that k<sub>on</sub> overexpression (which has a striking VNC overgrowth phenotype) decreases the transcript of ia-2 (not significantly?) but RNAi of ia-2 suppresses k<sub>on</sub> overexpression phenotypes, which is suspicious. Do multiple RNAi lines for ia-2 give the same suppression of k<sub>on</sub> overexpression? How about the other ia-2 phenotypes presented throughout the manuscript? It is possible that off target affects could account for these phenotypes and a second RNAi line should be used to verify ia-2 phenotypes. Since the authors start with k<sub>on</sub> overexpression phenotypes in the VNC and suppression, the reader is left with a conflict that is not resolved. How does ia-2 knockdown suppress k<sub>on</sub> overexpression phenotypes, which reduces the levels of ia-2 in the first place? If the authors choose the keep this data in the manuscript, they must address this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Please allow us to break this paragraph into its distinct points:</p><p>1) The reduction in <italic>ia-2</italic> mRNA levels caused by k<sub>on</sub> over-expression in neurons is statistically significant. We had forgotten to add the star before to the graph, and this has now been corrected. Shown in revised Figure 1A. See also Supplementary file 1 for all statistical details.</p><p>2) “… k<sub>on</sub> over-expression… ia-2 RNAi suppresses…” Counter-intuitively, these conditions are not incompatible. Conceivably, if <italic>ia-2</italic> and k<sub>on</sub> were over-expressed together, the VNC could become even longer than with k<sub>on</sub> gain of function alone, which would mean that a relative decrease in <italic>ia-2</italic> levels would weaken or partially rescue the phenotype. Accordingly, a further reduction with RNAi would rescue even further. We did not carry out this test. Nevertheless, the long VNC phenotype is not specific enough, as it has been reported by others to result from a variety of genotypes – hence the reason for having these as supplementary data. Still, it was a useful approach, as the known candidates did validate it, and for the unknown, it led to an unexpected link to the insulin pathway. We have now extensively modified this section to clarify the limitations of this screen, and resolve the conflict.</p><p>3) Do multiple RNAi lines for ia-2 give the same suppression of k<sub>on</sub> overexpression?</p><p>We attempted to repeat the screen with another RNAi line from VDRC: UAS-ia-2RNAi[<italic>KK108555-VIE-260B]</italic> and crossing it to <italic>elavGAL4 UASkon, UAS Flybow</italic>, but this line caused a weaker knock-down, so the effect was lost.</p><p>Using qRT-PCR, qRT-PCR ia-2mRNA in larvae in which <italic>ia-2</italic> was knocked-down in neurons with this new RNAi line <italic>elavGAL4&gt;UAS-ia-2RNAi[KK108555-VIE-260B]</italic> and control: elavGAL4/+ (n=10 VNC with 3 x biological replicates), we found that this new line caused a much weaker knock-down than the previous <italic>UAS-ia-2</italic>[<italic>TRIPHMS00536]</italic> line previously used. Whereas <italic>UAS-ia-2</italic>[<italic>TRIPHMS00536]</italic> caused an 80% reduction in <italic>ia-2</italic> mRNA levels, the new VDRC line <italic>UAS-ia-2RNAi[KK108555-VIE-260B]</italic> only caused a 25% reduction. This demonstrates that the original TRIP line was more effective.</p><p>Importantly, this demonstrated that both <italic>ia-2</italic> RNAi lines knock-down <italic>ia-2</italic> expression.</p><p>We now provide these new data in Figure 1E and revised text.</p><p>4) How about the other ia-2 phenotypes presented throughout the manuscript?</p><p>We only analysed <italic>ia-2</italic> loss of function RNAi knock-down phenotypes in Figure 1B and Figure 2D-J. That is, qRT-PCRs for k<sub>on</sub> mRNA and stainings with Eve, Pros and Dpn. (Stainings with FasII and BP102 shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 had revealed no phenotypic differences from controls). There are no other <italic>ia-2</italic> RNAi data in the paper that contains 9 main figures of experiments and 5 supplementary figures. Our qRT-PCR analysis (described above) showed that the new RNAi line <italic>UAS-ia-2RNAi</italic>[<italic>KK108555-VIE-260B]</italic> was considerably weaker than the line we had originally used, as it only knocked them down by 25%. Thus, we did not anticipate remarkable phenotypes from this weak knock-down. Still, to address the reviewer’s request we repeated the most meaningful staining, which was anti-Dpn in larvae of genotype <italic>elavGAL4&gt; UAS-ia-2RNAi[KK108555-VIE-260B]</italic> and control: <italic>elavGAL4/+.</italic> As expected, we obtained a mild increase in ectopic Dpn+ cells with this line.</p><p>These new data are provided in the revised graph Figure 2J and changes the text.</p><p>Finally, to rule out off-target effects of <italic>ia-2</italic> RNAi, we had previously combined it with heterozygosity for a deficiency for the locus. We now expand on this genotype and provide data for <italic>Df ia-2 elavGAL4&gt;UASia-2RNAi[TRIPHMS00536]</italic> phenotypes in Figure 2D,E, I,J showing that the deficiency enhances the strength but does not alter the quality of the phenotypes.</p><p>To conclude, data show that the <italic>ia-2</italic> loss of function phenotypes most likely are not due to off-targets of <italic>ia-2 RNAi.</italic> This supported by qRT-PCR data, RNAi knock-down in a heterozygous background with a deficiency for the <italic>ia-2</italic> locus and using two distinct RNAi lines that partially reproduce the Dpn+ phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For Figure 1A and supplemental, with what genotype were the samples normalized/compared? The authors show the control in B but not A. Conclusions are made that are not necessarily supported. Since the authors state that k<sub>on</sub> overexpression only marginally decreased ia-2 mRNA levels, too much emphasis is placed on this result, which leaves the reader with concerns mentioned in 4, above. Knockdown of k<sub>on</sub> may not specifically regulate Ia-2 mRNA levels but may be the result of extra Ia-2 positive cells shown in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that these data could have been presented better. Figure 1A is a subset of the data also presented within Figure 1—figure supplement 3. Normalisations were to house-keeping Rp132. Comparisons were to k<sub>on</sub> genotypes on k<sub>on</sub> mRNA levels, ie the controls for Figure 1A and supplementary are the levels of k<sub>on</sub> mRNA itself. That is, how far were k<sub>on</sub> mRNA levels increased with the gain of function, and reduced upon RNAi knock-down.</p><p>We have now revised these graphs, split the data into two separate groups and added the controls. On the left graph, controls show that over-expression of k<sub>on</sub> resulted in a very high increase in k<sub>on</sub> levels beyond the scale of the remaining data (hence their original exclusion and from Figure 1—figure supplement 3B). On the right graph, k<sub>on</sub> RNAi knock-down resulted in a 50% reduction in k<sub>on</sub> mRNA levels. These new graphs are shown in revised Figure 1A</p><p>The effect of k<sub>on</sub> over-expression on <italic>ia-2</italic> mRNA is not marginal, but instead statistically significant. These data had been provided before in the Supplementary file 1 with the statistical analysis, but unfortunately we forgot to add the star p&lt;0.05 on the figure. This has now been added to Figure 1A.</p><p>We agree with this reviewer that at least in part, the increase in <italic>ia-2</italic> mRNA caused by k<sub>on</sub> loss of function could be due to the increase in Ia-2YFP+ cells observed along the midline in these larvae. Still, it was interesting that other genes known to be expressed in neurons (like the phosphatases) were not up-regulated with k<sub>on</sub> loss of function, only <italic>ia-2</italic> was, suggesting a more direct functional interaction. This has now been clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Pros does not simply activate ia-2 as removal of pros or Pros expression causes ia-2 mRNA increase. This is difficult to interpret and is not a simple ARROW (below 1D). Perhaps analysis of Notch and Pros is unnecessary here as it complicates the message of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that we did not make this point clear enough before, please allow us to explain. We had previously published that Notch and Pros depend on each other in glia, and that loss of <italic>pros</italic> function down-regulates Notch (Griffiths and Hidalgo, 2004; Kato et al., 2011; Losada-Perez et al., 2016). In fact, in <italic>Notch</italic> mutants, <italic>pros</italic> expression goes down, and in <italic>pros</italic> mutants, Notch signalling is down-regulated; conversely, over-expression of <italic>pros</italic> up-regulates Notch signalling, and over-expression of <italic>Notch<sup>ICD</sup></italic> activates <italic>pros</italic> expression (Griffiths and Hidalgo, 2004; Kato et al., 2011; Losada-Perez et al., 2016). Thus, we considered it un-necessary to dwell on this again. It also makes sense that <italic>Notch</italic> loss of function caused an upregulation of <italic>ia-2</italic> mRNA, because k<sub>on</sub> depends on <italic>Notch</italic> (Losada-Perez et al., 2016) and loss of k<sub>on</sub> function also upregulates <italic>ia-2</italic> mRNA (Figure 1A). Therefore, if <italic>pros</italic> loss of function also up-regulates <italic>ia-2</italic> mRNA (Figure 1D, left), this could be an indirect effect, because loss of <italic>pros</italic> function will result in a decrease in <italic>Notch</italic> and therefore <italic>kon</italic>. Pros is a transcription factor, so it is more probable that the effect of the over-expression, rather than the loss of function, is a direct phenotype in this case (Figure 1D, right). Furthermore, the <italic>pros</italic> gain of function phenotype is statistically significant, whereas the loss of function is not. This means that the gain of function is most meaningful. In genetics language, this is expressed as <italic>pros</italic> positively regulates <italic>ia-2</italic>. The arrow does not mean that this explains everything, it’s standard genetic inference and symbolism. In our context, it provided a step to move forward.</p><p>A comparable effect was observed in the relationship between k<sub>on</sub> and <italic>pros:</italic> both loss and gain of <italic>pros</italic> function down-regulated k<sub>on</sub> expression, and similarly, the effect of <italic>pros</italic> gain of function was more pronounced (Losada-Perez et al., 2016). This meant that <italic>pros</italic> negatively regulates <italic>kon</italic>. Since now we show that <italic>ia-2</italic> and k<sub>on</sub> antagonise each other, the fact that <italic>pros</italic> relates to k<sub>on</sub> and <italic>ia-2</italic> in opposite ways, further strengthens the genetic inferences drawn, and the conclusion that <italic>ia-2</italic> and <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> are mutually exclusive in neurons and glia, respectively.</p><p>Placing <italic>ia-2</italic> within the context of the <italic>pros-Notch-kon</italic> regenerative gene network was a very important initial step in the analysis of <italic>ia-2</italic> function, and therefore cannot be removed. We had previously published that Notch and Pros, together with Kon/NG2, drive a glial regenerative response to CNS injury, and we demonstrated that this response is evolutionarily conserved from flies to mammals, (Griffiths and Hidalgo, 2004; Kato et al., 2011; Kato et al., 2015; Losada-Perez et al., 2016). If Ia-2 were to be involved in regenerative responses to CNS injury, it would make sense for it to be genetically and functionally related to this gene network. Indeed, this is what the data in Figure 1C,D showed. Linking <italic>ia-2</italic> to <italic>kon, pros</italic> and <italic>Notch</italic> was an initial exploratory phase that enabled us to pursue the investigation of Ia-2 function in a regenerative response to injury.</p><p>We very much hope that this is clearer now, and that the reviewer is satisfied with this explanation. Accordingly, we have now revised the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) When analyzing loss of ia-2, sometimes Df plus RNAi is used, sometimes only RNAi is used. Please be consistent with the strategy to remove ia-2 if you wish to compare phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that it would be neater to have all consistent throughout, and we have made an effort to tidy this up as much as possible, within a reasonbale time frame for a revision. Thus, we have now added new genotypes to Figure 2E, J: n=10-15 Anti-Dpn in <italic>elavGAL4&gt;UAS-ia-2RNAi</italic> and Anti-Eve in <italic>elavGAL4 x Df, UAS-ia-2RNAi</italic></p><p>We provide a revised Figure 2D,E,I,J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What is the difference between Figure 3B and D?

We have now revised all our figure legends and this information has been provided. We have now quantified abdominal Dpn+ cells upon injury at each of the time-points, and all counts are provided in new graphs in Figure 3H,K,L,O. In samples with ectopic Dpn+ cells, we have also counted the number of ectopic Dpn+ specifically around the lesion, at each time point, and we provide these data in new graph Figure 3P.</p><p>We have also revised the statement to “and most, if not all, ectopic Dpn+ cells lacked Ia-2YFP”. We think it would be inaccurate to try to put a number on this. It appears that they all lack ia-2YFP, but injury samples look rather different from un-injured samples, cell morphology is different, the CNS is damaged and stainings can be messier. Thus, providing a number to this could be a misrepresentation.</p><p>In response to point 5, new graphs are provided in Figure 3H,K,L,O,P.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors make strong statements about RNA changes in ia-1 LOF and GOF models (Figure 4E-F), but no changes are statistically significant.

If this is due to the genetic background or the GAL4, it is not the correct driver to use.</p></disp-quote><p>No, they are not, and we thank the reviewer for noticing this important detail that we had not explained. These experiments differed. Figure 5E was of L3 larvae at 72h AEL to see developmental neuroblasts, whereas Figure 2J was at 120h AEL to exclude developmental neuroblasts, hence the reduction in Dpn+ cells.</p><p>The controls were inscutable-GAL4/+ for Figure 5E and elavGAL4/+ for Figure 2J. As explained above, the fact that the number of abdominal Dpn+ cells differed between the two is not due to genetic background nor the GAL4, but instead it is due to the stage, i.e. age of the larvae.</p><p>Clarifying this point is very important as these figures address two different questions:</p><p>1) Figure 2I,J addressed the question of whether altering <italic>ia-2</italic> levels affected cell fate, whether this could be detected with anti-Dpn, whilst distinguishing any effect from Dpn+ normal developmental neuroblasts. To this aim, images were from larvae fixed at 120h After Egg Laying, when no developmental neuroblasts remain in the larval VNC, except for a few at the midline, as they have all been eliminated through apoptosis. This figure shows that altering <italic>ia-2</italic> levels induced ectopic Dpn+ cells surrounding the neuropile or along the midline, in the abdominal VNC, at 120h AEL.</p><p>2) Figure 5D,E addressed the question of whether k<sub>on</sub> was required for normal developmental neuroblast cell fate. Images were from larvae fixed at 72h AEL, as here we wanted to see the normal, developmental Dpn+ neuroblasts of the larval VNC. All Dpn+ cells here are normal developmental neuroblasts, in the abdominal VNC, at 72h AEL.</p><p>We have now added this clarification in the main text, figure legends, Materials and methods section, and we have also indicated it on a revised Figure 5D,E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the section &quot;Ia-2 and Dilp6 can induce neural stem cells from glia&quot;, it does not seem that everything is included or referenced correctly.

Ideally, the authors should control for GAL4 dilution effects and use the same ia-2-YFP in all comparisons (epoGAL4&gt;UAS-dilp-6, UAS-InRDN does not have this transgene).</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for this, we thought perhaps it was not necessary to show every single image, which would make the figure massive. We now provide the images for every genotype represented in the graph, in a revised Figure 6A,B.</p><p>We have also added new anti-Dpn in <italic>ia2YFP, repoGAL4&gt;UAS-dilp-6, UASInR<sup>DN</sup>,</italic> so that all samples now have <italic>ia-2YFP</italic>. These new data have been added to revised Figure 6A,B,D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Dpn staining in Figure 7 is not clear. All arrows do not convincingly point to a Dpn + cell because of the high background. Use a different color for Dpn in C/D as blue cannot be seen. Better Dpn staining is presented in other figures. As this experiment is important, perhaps an image with less background or better Dpn staining can be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to improve these images, but these experiments were rather difficult as over-expression of GTRACE in all glia severely reduced viability. Thus, fewer progeny of the required genotype resulted from the crosses, and we could only use the oldest larvae at 120h AEL. Furthermore, anti-Dpn is not a great antibody, and stainings not always produced high signal, so although we put a considerable effort in repeating this experiment, it did not always work well enough. Thus, unfortunately, we could not provide new images for Figure 7A,B or G,H.</p><p>We realise blue is not easy to see over black, but that is why we presented the single channels in black and white instead. Still, to satisfy this reviewer, colours have been changed for GTRACE data: red to magenta, and blue to cyan. Please see revised Figure 7G, H.</p><p>We provide new additional data for Figure 7. We had previously noticed that over-expression of ia-2 and dilp-6 induced two types of ectopic Dpn+, one type around the neuropile and a second class along the midline. We had identified the lateral cells as Repo+ glia. However, we had not identified the midline cells. For the revision, we carried out new experiments to identify the midline cells, staining:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>anti-Dpn and anti-Wrp in the <italic>repoGAL4&gt;UASdilp-6</italic> and <italic>repoGAL4&gt;UAShis-YFP UASdilp-6</italic>: new Figure 7 C-F</p></list-item><list-item><p>anti-Wrp in <italic>PCNA-GFP, hsGAL4&gt;UASdilp-6</italic> in new Figure 8F-H</p></list-item><list-item><p>anti-pH3 in <italic>repoGAL4&gt;UAShis-YFP, UASia-2</italic> and <italic>repoGAL4&gt;UAShis-YFP, UASia-2.</italic></p></list-item></list><p>These new data identified the ectopic Dpn+ Wrp+, originally midline glia. This is important, as we now demonstrate that ALL ectopic Dpn+ induced by Dilp-6 and Ia-2 – both around the neuropile and along the midline – originate from glia.</p><p>We provide these additional new data in Figure 7C-F and Figure 8E-L and revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) What is the direct evidence that there is Ia-2 regulated Dilp-6 signaling from neurons to glia?</p></disp-quote><p>This had been provided in the original submitted version.

May I point out that, however, these previous high profile publications did not report the expression pattern of <italic>InR.</italic> The expression of <italic>InR</italic> in the CNS was published using low resolution in situ hybridisations and antibody stainings in embryos by Fernandez et al. 1995 EMBO J.

Therefore, necessarily signalling can be relayed from neurons to glia.</p><p>To ensure that these important connections between data are not missed by future readers, we have expanded on the explanation in the text in multiple points. We hope we have made it clerer now.</p><p>We have also revised the concluding Figure 10.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is required that you address the following to be reconsidered for publication:</p><p>1) Additional NSC markers must be optimized. Dpn staining in some figures is unconvincing and must be verified using additional markers.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, there seems to have been a misunderstanding. Our samples from the first submission were appropriately stained with anti-Dpn. In the letter to reviewers, we had mentioned experiments we carried out that did not work, but this did not apply to the submitted evidence. Dpn is normally abundant in the thorax, where we detected it well, but we had not shown the thoracic signal because our work does not focus on the thorax. Our manuscript focused on the abdominal segments of the late third instar larval VNC, where there are normally no Dpn+ cells there except for the midline.</p><p>We now provide the Dpn thoracic signal for our original samples, in revised Figure 2I, Figure 3F,L, Figure 6A, Figure 6—figure supplement 1, as well as a new Figure 7A-F. Anti-Dpn in the thorax and optic lobes worked well, and differences can be attributed to genotypes (e.g. over-expression of a dominant negative form of the insulin receptor). Thus, we did not have technical problems with anti-Dpn. Relatively to the thoracic signal, the ectopic abdominal Dpn signal in glia is lower.</p><p>Similarly, anti-Worniu worked well in the thorax, but did not reveal ectopic signal in glia. We have now tested a new aliquot of anti-Ase, a kind gift of Dr Wang. Whereas it worked very well in the thorax and optic lobes, it did not reveal ectopic signal in abdominal glia.</p><p>For this revision, we obtained a new aliquot of anti-Dpn from Prof. Wang (Reviewer 1) and followed their protocol. This revealed excellent signal in the thorax, and confirmed ectopic Dpn signal in abdominal glia, which we could increase even further upon new genetic manipulations of insulin signalling. These data are provided in a new Figure 7.</p><p>Our findings are also supported by published data that we now cite:</p><p>1) TRAP-RNAseq data (Huang et al., 2015) showing that larval astrocyte glia express <italic>dpn,</italic> as well as many factors involved in neuroblast polarity, asymmetric cell division, asymmetric protein localisation and cell fate determination, neuroblast proliferation and neurogenesis.</p><p>2) Published after our original submission, single cell RNAseq data confirmed that LI glial cells can express <italic>dpn, wor</italic> and <italic>ase</italic> (Brunet Avalos et al., 2019).</p><p>3) Whilst revising our manuscript, Gangwani et al., 2020 reported that ectopic neuroblasts were induced in glioma models in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>These references have now been cited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Cell markers routinely used by many labs must work (Wor, Ase, Elav)</p></disp-quote><p>Antibodies to Wor, Ase and Elav worked well in our experiments, revealing standard neuroblasts in thorax and optic lobes (Wor and Ase) and neurons (Elav). However, they did not reveal ectopic expression in abdominal glia. To meet the requirements of the Editors, we repeated these experiments with a new aliquot of anti-Ase (gift from H. Wang), which again worked beautifully in thorax and optic lobes, but did not reveal ectopic expression in glia. This indicates that conversion of glia into neural stem cells does not follow the same processes as developmental neuroblasts.</p><p>We had previously shown excellent anti-Elav stainings (e.g. Figure 2C). However, when combining anti-Elav (raised in rat) with anti-Pros (raised in mouse), we originally did not realise they would cross-hybridise. For this revised version, we have used highly-cross adsorbed secondary antibodies, and provide new data in Figure 2H demonstrating that super-numerary Pros+ cells can have the neuronal marker Elav.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Dpn is a reagent that works well and should be clear.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, it seems it was not clear to reviewers that Dpn worked well in our experiments in developmental NBs in thorax and optic lobes. Our manuscript revealed ectopic abdominal Dpn expression in glia upon manipulating <italic>ia-2</italic>, insulin signalling and upon injury. This ectopic signal was lower than Dpn in thoracic NBs. To clarify this point, we now provide evidence of reliable Dpn signal in normal, developmental NBs in thorax in our original samples in new Figure 2I, Figure 3F,L, Figure 6A and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and 2.</p><p>We have now further confirmed our data:</p><p>1) We have used a new anti-Dpn aliquot provided by reviewer 1, Prof. Wang, and used their protocol. This showed Dpn staining in developmental neuroblasts in thorax and optic lobes, in abdominal midline cells and low signal in some abdominal glia in controls.

That is, activation of insulin signalling in glia induces <italic>dpn</italic> expression and Dpn+ cell proliferation. These are provided as new data in new Figure 7A-O.</p><p>3) We have analysed publicly available RNAseq data, which demonstrate that glial cells can express neuroblast markers:</p><p>a) TRAP-RNAseq data of the LIII larval astrocyte glia showed they can express <italic>dpn</italic>, as wel as other neuroblast markers (Huang et al., 2015).</p><p>b) Single-cell RNAseq data of the LI larval CNS (published after our initial submission) showing that Repo+ glia can express Dpn, Wor and/or Ase (Brunet Avalos et al., 2019 ).</p><p>We conclude that the switch from a canonical glial cell state to that of expressing the neural stem cell marker <italic>dpn</italic> when insulin signalling is activated is an important discovery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please note that this decision letter does not guarantee that this manuscript will be accepted.

We had originally tried those experiments, and the antibody stainings did not reveal ectopic Dpn+ cells, but the qRT-PCR data were variable.

Thus, now qRT-PCR data are consistent with stainings. We now provide these new data :</p><p>1) Over-expression of kon<sup>ICD</sup> in glia does not induce ectopic Dpn+ cells</p><p>2) Over-expression of kon<sup>ICD</sup> in glia does not alter dilp-6 nor dpn mRNA levels.</p><p>These data are provided in new Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><p>These data mean that when Kon<sup>ICD</sup> translocates to the nucleus, it does not function directly as a transcription factor.

We could visualise excellent, normal, canonical staining with anti-Dpn, anti-Wor and anti-Ase in thoracic and optic lobe neuroblasts. Instead, this work focuses in the abdominal ventral nerve cord of the late third instar lava, when there are normally no neuroblasts. i.e. no Dpn+, Wor+ nor Ase+ cells. No other labs had focused on nor reported ectopic Dpn signal in adbomen in the late larva before. Furthermore, in subsequent point 8 (see below) reviewers point out that all our Dpn data are good, except for (old) Figure 3D, contradicting the above statement that Dpn is <italic>“very speckly”.</italic> In any case, to clarify this point, we now provide the original data showing Dpn staining in thoracic NBs for comparison, including projections from either the entire VNC in new Figure 2I, Figure 6—figure supplements 1,2 and Figure 7A-C or projections from thorax (as with the thickness of the VNC a full projection loses resolution obscuring the signal) in new Figure 3F,L, new Figure 6A and new Figure 7D,E,F.</p><p>Upon genetic manipulation of insulin signalling, we could detect Dpn ectopic signal in abdominal glial cells, and this ectopic Dpn signal was not as strong as in normal neuroblasts.

All have been extensively used by many labs. The authors could not get the stains to work.</p><p>This is unsatisfactory.</p></disp-quote><p>Please allow us to correct that we could get anti-Dpn, anti-Wor and anti-Ase to work as well as other labs have shown, in canonical, developmental NBs in thorax and abdomen. No other labs reported ectopic signal in abdomen in late larvae before, therefore it is not possible to compare our data with those of other labs for this context. In response to this criticism, we now provide evidence of thoracic Dpn signal from our original samples, shown in new Figure 2I, Figure 3F,L, Figure 6A, Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2, and new Figure 7A-F.</p><p>Unfortunately, we had not realised that anti-Elav (raised in rat) and anti-Pros (raised in mouse) would result in non-specific cross-hybridisation using standard anti-mouse and anti-rat secondary antibodies. For this revised version, we used highly-cross adsorbed secondary antibodies, which revealed clear, specific co-localisation of Elav and Pros in some small cells in <italic>ia-2</italic> loss of function specimens, which are therefore neurons. We provide these new data in new Figure 2H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The text says loss of ia-2 &quot;destabilizes cell fate&quot; – which is a vague term that obscures the phenotype.

This is mentioned in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Dpn staining in Figure 3D is unconvincing; everything looks speckly. The authors state that Dpn staining is speckly in their hands.</p><p>Many labs have used Dpn to mark neuroblasts, it is a very reliable reagent. The authors have good Dpn staining in other figures; this suggest to me that the ectopic Dpn+ cells are different from the normal Dpn+ NPCs, leading to different protein localization/levels. This concern is reinforced by the failure of the authors to show the ectopic Dpn+ cells express any other NSC marker.</p></disp-quote><p>The point that the reviewer considered our Dpn stainings speckly and the reference to “many labs” was already raised in point 1, please see our response above.</p><p>On the point “Dpn staining in Figure 3D is unconvincing; everything looks speckly… The authors have good Dpn staining in other figures”: Figure 3D was from an injured VNC at 74h AEL. No other stainings showed speckly Dpn staining, as stated by this reviewer. So that was one image, out of 25 experiments using anti-Dpn that had good Dpn staining, according to this reviewer. Thus, the reviewer makes an unfair generalisation on the quality of our work. May I point out that injured samples have to be handled with extreme care during stainings, so that they don’t fall apart, thus stainings are more challenging than normally, and younger injured larval VNCs are even more difficult to handle. Still, to satisfy the reviewer’s comment, we have now removed Figure 3D.</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s point “this suggest to me that the ectopic Dpn+ cells are different from the normal Dpn+ NPCs, leading to different protein localization/levels”.</p><p>We did not claim that glial cells that express Dpn ectopically are identical to developmental <italic>“normal Dpn+ NSC”</italic>: that was a reviewer’s assumption. In fact, we claim the opposite: that regenerative neurogenesis does not involve developmental, canonical neural stem cells, but instead requires a neurogenic response from glial cells.</p><p>Dpn is the general NSC marker in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We showed, and with the new data now confirm and reinforce, that genetic manipulation of Ia-2 and insulin signalling in glia increases <italic>dpn</italic> expression levels in glia, induces Dpn+ cell proliferation, increases Dpn+ cell number, and at least to a limited extent – constrained by the onset of pupariation – results in new neurons. We also showed that injury induces the expression of <italic>ia-2</italic> and ectopic Dpn+ cells. Animals that can regenerate their CNS upon injury do so by inducing neurogenesis not from “normal” NSCs, but from glia (Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009; Falk and Gotz, 2017). Our data show an important discovery that insulin signalling is involved in the injury-induced regenerative neurogenic response from glia. This important finding was discussed in the text in previous versions, and it seems the reviewer missed this important point.</p><p>To address the criticisms in point 8, we now show:</p><p>1) Dpn staining in thorax, for comparison, providing projections from either the entire VNC (including thoracic and abdominal) or for projections from thorax (as with VNC thickness resolution is lost with full projections obscuring the signal) in: new Figure 2I, Figure 3F,L, Figure 6A, Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and 2 and new Figure 7A-F.</p><p>2) Repeated Wor, Ase and Dpn stainings, using new aliquots kindly donated by reviewer 1 (H. Wang), and using their protocol. We again obtained excellent stanings in thorax and optic lobes for all, no ectopic abdominal signal for Wor nor Ase in glia, but good ectopic abdominal Dpn signal. The new stainings using the Wang anti-Dpn aliquot are shown in new Figure 7.</p><p>3) We have carried out further new tests that demonstrate that insulin signalling induces further ectopic abdominal <italic>dpn</italic> expression and increased Dpn+ cell number, implying proliferation. We over-expressed in glia <italic>dilp-6</italic> alone and together with the activate forms of the downstream targets of insulin signalling – <italic>activated ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> and <italic>PI3K</italic> – and showed that they increased Dpn signal intensity and number of Dpn+ cells. That is, activation of insulin signalling in glia induces ectopic <italic>dpn</italic> expression and Dpn+ cell proliferation. These new data are shown in a new figure, new Figure 7.</p><p>4) We analysed publicly available RNAseq data for the larval CNS which confirmed our findings:</p><p>a) TRAP-RNAseq data showed that larval astrocyte glia express <italic>dpn,</italic> as well as many factors involved in neuroblast polarity, asymmetric cell division, asymmetric protein localisation and cell fate determination, neuroblast proliferation and neurogenesis (Huang et al., 2015), now cited in the text.</p><p>b) Single cell RNAseq data show that some Repo+ glia express <italic>dpn, wor</italic> and <italic>ase (</italic>Brunet Avalos et al., 2019)(published after our first submission), now cited in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Ectopic Dpn+ cells were not quantified due to due to the disruption and variability of the abdominal crush procedure. The authors only counted the VNCs in which they could see ectopic Dpn+ (cells).</p><p>Cherry-picking only VNCs that show ectopic Dpn+ cells is inappropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is incorrect. The ectopic Dpn+ cells were quantified in all our experiments, including all injury experiments (see graphs in current Figure 3D,I,J,O,P). It would appear that the Reviewer’s comment refers to the original submitted version (October 2019), in which we had not provided the quantifications upon injury. For the first revised version (May 2020), more experiments were carried out, and all the ectopic Dpn+ cells were counted and the data were provided in graphs.</p><p>Data were not cherry-picked. Instead, perhaps the reviewer is not familiar with genetic analysis or perhaps our data were not explicit enough for non-specialists. The question addressed was whether injury could induce ectopic abdominal Dpn+ cells, and if so, how many abdominal ectopic Dpn+ cells were produced. Standard genetic practice is to analyse phenotypes according to their penetrance and expressivity. The penetrance is the frequency with which a phenotype is manifested within a population. In our case, phenotypic penetrance was the percentage of injured VNCs that had ectopic abdominal Dpn+ cells. Not all injured samples had ectopic abdominal Dpn+ cells and some injured VNCs were severely damaged causing widespread cell loss. We had previously provided all penetrance data in the figure legend. The expressivity is the severity of the phenotype in individuals that manifest a given phenotype. In our case, expressivity was the incidence of ectopic Dpn+, and whether these cells were at the lesion site or also at a distance. Expressivity was provided in the graphs as the number of Dpn+ cells surrounding the lesion site, and the total number of abdominal Dpn+ cells, which we included to account for potential long-range effects away from lesion site. In order to make this point clearer to non-geneticists, we have now included the phenotypic penetrance as a percentage below the images in revised Figure 3G,H,J,M,N, and the expressivity above the graphs, in revised Figure 3D,I,J,O,P.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In response to InR-Gal4 expression concerns, the authors state &quot;we do not know whether (InR-gal4) represents the endogenous expression pattern&quot;.
