(m<sup>6</sup>A) modifications on messenger RNA (mRNA) in humans. METTL3-14 plays key roles in various biological processes through its methyltransferase (MTase) activity. However, little is known about its substrate recognition and methyl transfer mechanism from its cofactor and methyl donor <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Here, we study the MTase mechanism of METTL3-14 by a combined experimental and multiscale simulation approach using bisubstrate analogues (BAs), conjugates of a SAM-like moiety connected to the N<sup>6</sup>-atom of adenosine. Molecular dynamics simulations based on crystal structures of METTL3-14 with BAs suggest that the Y406 side chain of METTL3 is involved in the recruitment of adenosine and release of m<sup>6</sup>A. A crystal structure with a BA representing the transition state of methyl transfer shows a direct involvement of the METTL3 side chains E481 and K513 in adenosine binding which is supported by mutational analysis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free energy calculations indicate that methyl transfer occurs without prior deprotonation of adenosine-N<sup>6</sup>. Furthermore, the QM/MM calculations provide further support for the role of electrostatic contributions of E481 and K513 to catalysis. The multidisciplinary approach used here sheds light on the (co)substrate binding mechanism, catalytic step, and (co)product release, and suggests that the latter step is rate-limiting for METTL3. The atomistic information on the substrate binding and methyl transfer reaction of METTL3 can be useful for understanding the mechanisms of other RNA MTases and for the design of transition state analogues as their inhibitors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>m<sup>6</sup>A</kwd><kwd>methyl transfer</kwd><kwd>METTL3</kwd><kwd>transition state</kwd><kwd>bisubstrate analogue</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030−212195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caflisch</surname><given-names>Amedeo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ARNtools-19-CE07-0028-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ethève-Quelquejeu</surname><given-names>Mélanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM141930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A multidisciplinary study reveals the reaction mechanism and transition state of adenosine-N<sup>6</sup> methyl transfer catalyzed by human METTL3-14, deepening our insight into RNA methyltransferases and paving the way for similar studies on related enzymes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>METTL3-14 is the main human mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A MTase</title><p>There are more than 170 RNA modifications forming the epitranscriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boccaletto et al., 2022</xref>).

The complex of methyltransferase-like protein 3 (METTL3) and METTL14 (abbreviated as METTL3-14 in the following) is the main m<sup>6</sup>A-RNA methyltransferase (MTase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The METTL3-14 heterodimer is involved in a wide variety of diseases including type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Jesus et al., 2019</xref>), viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dang et al., 2019</xref>), and several types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2019b</xref>). METTL3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A deposition is directly involved in the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) by promoting the translation of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vu et al., 2017</xref>). It has been demonstrated that inhibition of the METTL3 catalytic function is sufficient to induce apoptosis and differentiation in AML cells and in a mouse model of the disease but not in normal non-leukaemic haematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moroz-Omori et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yankova et al., 2021</xref>). While it has been well established that METTL3-14 dysregulation is related to cancer development, the role of METTL3-14 varies in different cancer types, i.e., it can act as oncogene or tumour suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zeng et al., 2020</xref>). Despite growing knowledge of the diverse pathways involving METTL3-14, the mechanism of how m<sup>6</sup>A regulates gene expression remains poorly understood. Little is known about the recognition of specific RNA transcripts, the binding/release of the adenosine/m<sup>6</sup>A substrate/product, and the methyl transfer mechanism catalysed by METTL3. Furthermore, inhibiting the MTase function of METTL3-14 is a promising therapeutic strategy for several diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yankova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dolbois et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, understanding the mechanism of this complex would be helpful to develop new therapies.</p><p>METTL3-14 is the catalytic complex that transfers the methyl group from <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the substrate adenosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). METTL3 comprises a low-complexity region at the N-terminus, a zinc finger responsible for substrate binding, and the catalytic MTase domain at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). The METTL3 MTase domain has the catalytically active SAM binding site and adopts a Rossmann fold that is characteristic of Class I SAM-dependent MTases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). METTL14 has an MTase domain, too, however, with a redundant active site of hitherto unknown function, and so-called RGG repeats at its C-terminus essential for RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). METTL14 plays a structural role for complex stabilisation and RNA binding. It forms a positively charged groove at the interface with METTL3 which is predicted to be the RNA binding site.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Methyltransferase-like proteins 3 and 14 (METTL3-14) domain architecture and structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain architecture of METTL3 and METTL14.

In the latter, dynamic cross-correlation analysis, a technique usually applied for the study of allosteric processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ichiye and Karplus, 1991</xref>), showed that MTase conformational changes can influence the orientation of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). In the former, Chen et al. explored the conformational landscape of SETD8, a histone MTase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2019a</xref>). The study showed how slow conformational motions and conformational states of the MTase are relevant to catalysis.</p><p>Among RNA MTases, research has focused on viral enzymes.

This enabled a detailed analysis of their interaction and understanding of the effects of MTase inhibitors as antiviral drugs. Another study focused on the mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 MTase nsp16 and its heterodimeric partner nsp10 which acts as a stimulator of SAM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sk et al., 2020</xref>). The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic, thermodynamic, and allosteric processes of MTase complex formation and function.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Bisubstrate analogues as structural tools to investigate the mechanisms of MTases</title><p>Only a few structures of RNA-bound MTases are currently available due to the intrinsic instability of RNA and RNA-enzyme complexes and resulting difficulties in obtaining their structures.

The lack of more such structures results in poorly understood RNA recognition and methyl transfer mechanisms. In contrast, structures are available for many MTases in complex with either the cosubstrate SAM or the coproduct SAH, allowing for a well-understood cofactor binding within this protein family.

The only structural information on these molecules is their binding mode in the bacterial m<sup>6</sup>A RNA MTase RlmJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Oerum et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meynier et al., 2022</xref>). There, in the mononucleoside-containing compounds BA2 and BA4, the substrate adenosine is positioned in the presumed substrate binding pocket of RlmJ, and for the cofactor moiety, the methionine chain is bound like SAM. However, the structural studies resulted in a (co)substrate conformation that is not always biologically relevant, as the adenosine of the SAM analogue was rotated out of the canonical SAM binding pocket caused by π-stacking with the substrate adenine ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Oerum et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the binding modes revealed therein are diverse and not always suitable for mechanistic studies. In a subsequent study, using a dinucleotide containing BA (GA* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the SAM moiety had the correct orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meynier et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, the N<sup>6</sup>-atom of adenosine was positioned, through the alkyl chain of the linker, at 3 Å distance from the carbon corresponding to the Cε-atom of the methionine moiety in the cosubstrate SAM. Such a distance, in two non-linked moieties, would allow for an SN2 methyl transfer from SAM to the N<sup>6</sup>-atom of adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">O’Hagan and Schmidberger, 2010</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that targeting human RNA MTases, in particular METTL3, with BAs might lead to structures that provide a suitable basis for understanding their MTase mechanism.</p><p>In the present study, we use a multidisciplinary approach to study the substrate binding, m<sup>6</sup>A methylation reaction, and release of m<sup>6</sup>A product in the human RNA MTase METTL3-14. To shed light on its catalytic mechanism, we combine crystal structures of METTL3-14-BA complexes with in vitro experiments, multiscale atomistic simulations, namely classical MD and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free energy calculations. Crystal structures show the binding mode of the substrate adenosine in two different conformations, representing an encounter complex of RNA binding and the transition state of catalysis, respectively. These structures are validated through mutational analysis. Classical MD simulations are used to investigate the binding of the substrates SAM and adenosine and dissociation of the products SAH and m<sup>6</sup>A. QM/MM free energy calculations reveal the details of the methylation reaction. Taken together, we elucidate the reaction catalysed by METTL3-14 at atomic level of detail. This knowledge will help in the further investigation of other MTases and the optimisation of chemical probes that target their function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bisubstrate analogues bind in the METTL3 active site</title><p>We evaluated a series of bisubstrate analogues (BAs) as catalytic inhibitors and investigated the structural similarity between their binding mode in METTL3-14 and the putative RNA substrate and SAM cosubstrate during methyl transfer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). First, we measured the inhibitory activity of the BAs on METTL3-14 enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For this, we used our in-house developed reader-based enzymatic assay that quantifies the adenosine-N<sup>6</sup> methyl transfer based on homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wiedmer et al., 2019</xref>). The assay detects m<sup>6</sup>A using the natural m<sup>6</sup>A-reader YTHDC1. The m<sup>6</sup>A-RNA and -reader are fluorescently labelled such that their proximity during binding causes Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The BAs that inhibit METTL3 reduce the m<sup>6</sup>A level, and thus decrease the FRET signal, in a dose-dependent manner. The low micromolar inhibitory activity of the most potent BAs motivated us to conduct a structural investigation on their binding mode to METTL3-14. We conducted crystallisation trials and obtained crystal structures of four of the BAs (BA1, BA2, BA4, and BA6) by soaking them into METTL3-14 crystals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Bisubstrate analogues (BAs) for methyltransferase-like proteins 3 and 14 (METTL3-14) characterised in this study.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Bisubstrate analogue name<sup>a</sup></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">IC<sub>50</sub> (µM)<sup>b</sup> ± SE</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">PDB ID<sup>c</sup></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Resolution<sup>c</sup> (Å)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BA1</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">346±66</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">8PW9</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BA2</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">9±1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">8PW8</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BA3</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">21±2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BA4</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">18±3</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">8PWA</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BA6</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">⪆500</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">8PWB</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Compound 12</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">⪆500</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GA*</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">32±3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>NA = not available.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>a</sup> Compound names as previously published: BA1/2/3/4/6, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Oerum et al., 2019</xref>; Compound 12, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atdjian et al., 2020</xref>; GA*, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meynier et al., 2022</xref>.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>b</sup> IC<sub>50</sub>=Half maximal inhibitory concentration from the enzymatic assay, SE=standard error from the fit; for comparison, IC<sub>50</sub> of <italic>S</italic>-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is 0.51µM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wiedmer et al., 2019</xref>.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>c</sup> Data for the METTL3-14-BA complex structures deposited to the Protein Data Bank (PDB).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>All the crystallised BAs bind in the METTL3 active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

D395 forms a salt bridge to SAM and its mutation to alanine was previously shown to abolish METTL3 activity and SAM binding, confirming its involvement in cosubstrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>). The METTL3-BA2 structure reveals that there can also be a hydrogen bond formed between D395 and the N<sup>6</sup>-atom of adenosine in the case of the non-alkylated RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). P396 in the <sup>395</sup>DPPW<sup>398</sup> motif, through its carbonyl group, forms a hydrogen bond to the N<sup>6</sup>-atom of adenosine. In addition, P397 from the <sup>395</sup>DPPW<sup>398</sup> motif makes hydrophobic contacts with SAM. The BA2 structure further shows that adenosine is stabilised by additional hydrogen bonds from its N<sup>7</sup>- and O2’-atoms to the METTL3 side chains of E481 and K513, respectively. While W398 from the <sup>395</sup>DPPW<sup>398</sup> motif is not directly involved in adenosine binding, its backbone carbonyl group forms a water-bridged hydrogen bond with the Y406 side chain in the BA4 structure. The latter is involved in hydrophobic interactions with adenosine in the BA4 structure whereas it remains flexible in the BA2-bound METTL3 structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, adenosine swaps conformation from solvent exposed in the METTL3-BA4 structure to buried in the METTL3-BA2 structure where it forms hydrogen bonds with residues in the active site loop 2 (ASL2, METTL3 residues 507–515). Each moiety of the BAs is involved in hydrophobic interactions with METTL3 residues, and both adenines (of SAM and adenosine) form hydrogen bonds to conserved residues in METTL3. Alanine mutation of D395, Y406, E481, and K513, which are involved in adenosine binding as seen in the BA2 and BA4 structures, almost completely abolishes the METTL3 catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Importantly, these residues are highly conserved in METTL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The loss of activity of the Y406, E481, and K513 mutants originates mainly from abolished binding capability to adenosine and not SAM, because they can still bind SAH, as seen from a thermal shift assay (TSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Upon binding SAH, the thermal shift for the Y406, E481, and K513 mutants is similar as for the wild-type (WT) which suggests that their side chains are not involved in binding SAM/SAH but rather the RNA substrate. In contrast, mutation of D395 impairs SAH binding, which is consistent with the involvement of the D395 side chain in SAM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MD simulations reveal BA2 as the stable adenosine binding pose</title><p>Because of the different conformations of METTL3 and adenosine in the BA2 and BA4 structures, we went on to characterise the enzyme dynamics in the presence of adenosine.

The MD simulations were started from the crystal structures of the complex with bisubstrate analogues BA2 and BA4 described above. Based on the position of each BA, the (co)substrates SAM and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or the (co)products SAH and m<sup>6</sup>AMP were positioned in the protein, aligning them to their respective moiety of the BA. The intermolecular and intra-protein salt bridges and hydrogen bonds were monitored throughout the trajectories. The dissociation time for each of the substrates and products was analysed and modelled by fitting a single exponential to the fraction of bound ligands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> using block averaging, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> considering all trajectories). The SAM and SAH cofactors remained bound in all but one of the sampled trajectories and thus fitting was not possible. The experimentally determined k<sub>off</sub> rates of SAM and SAH are 8×10<sup>–4</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> and 2×10<sup>–4</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>, respectively, which corresponds to mean lifetimes of more than 20 min and 83 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Selberg et al., 2019</xref>).

This could mean that this conformation represents a short-lived intermediate during substrate binding or product release. Possibly, it represents an encounter complex between the METTL3-SAM holo complex and RNA substrate. This could be promoted through electrostatic steering of the negatively charged RNA backbone by the positively charged sulphonium ion of SAM.</p><p>The simulations started from the BA2 conformation show that the AMP and m<sup>6</sup>AMP ligands dissociated in several of the analysed MD simulation runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>). Binding of AMP is more stable, while the methylated product dissociates more quickly (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This difference originates, at least in part, from the long-range monopole-monopole electrostatic interaction between the positively charged SAM and the negatively charged AMP. After the methyl transfer reaction, SAH is neutral which does not favour interaction with m<sup>6</sup>AMP resulting in rapid dissociation of the latter.</p><p>One caveat is that we simulate only a mononucleotide, resulting in much faster dissociation of both the substrate AMP and product m<sup>6</sup>AMP than would be expected for the longer, canonical RNA substrate/product. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published affinities of AMP and m<sup>6</sup>AMP for METTL3-14 binding. Based on the mean lifetimes determined from the MD simulations, and assuming diffusion-limited association rates of 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>s<sup>–1</sup>, the dissociation constants of AMP and m<sup>6</sup>AMP are ~2 and ~78 mM, respectively. In contrast to these low affinities, the long GGACU motif containing mRNA can interact with the binding groove at the METTL3-14 interface with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range, resulting in a more stable complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Qi et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, our model is useful as it emphasises the differences in binding affinity due to the different electrostatic interactions between the SAM-AMP and SAH-m<sup>6</sup>AMP pairs. Besides the structural stability of the BA2-like pose of AMP, the MD simulations also suggest that AMP can transiently populate a binding mode similar to BA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). This further supports that BA4 could represent an intermediate binding conformation of adenosine.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A polar interaction network stabilises the BA2 conformation of adenosine in METTL3</title><p>The crystal structure of the complex with BA2 reveals a string of ionic interactions which involves charged side chains of METTL3 and the amino and carboxyl groups of the SAM analogue. The string consists of seven charged groups (four of which are positive): R536<sup>+</sup> – SAM COO<sup>-</sup> – SAM NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> – D395<sup>-</sup> – K513<sup>+</sup> – E481<sup>-</sup> – K459<sup>+</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). We decided to monitor these salt bridges and the following monopole-dipole interactions in the MD simulations: D395<sup>-</sup> – AMP-N<sup>6</sup>, K513<sup>+</sup> – AMP-N<sup>7</sup>, and E481<sup>-</sup> – AMP-2’OH (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>). In the BA2 conformation, the polar interactions between AMP and the charged side chains D395 and K513 are stronger than the interaction between E481 and the 2’ hydroxyl group of the ribose (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>, black traces). For SAM, the interaction between its positively charged amine and D395 is more stable than the one between its negatively charged carboxy with R536 which can adopt different conformations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>, blue traces). The intramolecular salt bridges are also stable throughout the sampling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>, grey traces). The salt bridge D395<sup>-</sup> – K513<sup>+</sup> seems to be the most stable, while E481<sup>-</sup> – K459<sup>+</sup> seems to change frequently between direct and water-separated contacts. In METTL3 apo trajectories, the D395<sup>-</sup> – K513<sup>+</sup> salt bridge is not present in the initial structure but is formed during the course of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>). The bond between E481 and K513 is stable but separated by water when SAM and AMP are bound. This contrasts with the METTL3 apo simulations, where this bond forms transiently. The simulations with the products reveal similar interactions except for the faster dissociation of m<sup>6</sup>AMP (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Another difference is the weaker interaction between SAH and D395 which fluctuates more than with SAM. The intramolecular interactions are also observed for the simulations initiated from the BA4 conformation of adenosine (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>). These MD results validate the mechanistic interpretation of the BA-bound METTL3-14 crystal structures, and give a dynamic view of the behaviour of the complex before (substrate bound) and after (product bound) the methyl transfer reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The flexibility of METTL3 Y406 supports the recruitment of adenosine</title><p>In structures of METTL3-14 in the apo state or bound to SAH or SAM, METTL3 residue Y406 is found in different conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>). One study suggested that Y406 makes a hydrogen bond with S511 in ASL2 and thereby caps the SAH coproduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>). However, another study suggested that Y406 might be important for the interaction with nucleotide bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>). The different conformations of Y406 seen in our crystal structures with BA2 and BA4 support the latter and suggest an involvement of the Y406 side chain in RNA nucleotide binding, probably as a first step of RNA recognition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, mutation of Y406 to alanine (in this and a previous study) or cysteine (in a previous study) abolishes MTase activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The flexibility of Y406 in the MD simulations was analysed by monitoring the distance between its hydroxyl oxygen atom and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of METTL3 residue W398. There is a water-bridged polar interaction between these two oxygen atoms in the BA4 crystal structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In the MD simulations, Y406 transitions multiple times (on the µs time scale) from orientations far away from the W398 carbonyl oxygen (distance of ~15 Å) to shorter distances of ~6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This corresponds to a transition from the extended ASL1, with Y406 pointing outside the pocket, to a conformation compatible with the water-bridged hydrogen bond observed in the crystal structure with BA4. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows a superposition of frames of a BA2 substrate MD trajectory illustrating this behaviour. We observe that the adenine ring system of AMP can be involved in a π-π interaction with Y406 for several ns before exiting the pocket, and is then captured again later by the Y406 side chain, but is not brought back into the pocket (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). The full binding mechanism thus probably requires the rest of the substrate RNA, though the role of Y406 emerges already from the present simulations with the mononucleotide. The different conformations of Y406 reflect different steps in the binding and catalysis reaction. In the METTL3 SAM-bound state, the Y406 side chain is flexible. To bind RNA effectively, Y406 needs to stabilise through the water-bridged polar interaction with the backbone of W398. The substrate adenosine can then bind through selection of this conformation. Additionally, Y406 plays a role in positioning the adenosine substrate at the catalytic site.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Flexibility of Y406 is evidenced by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distance time series of five 500 ns MD trajectories started from the BA2 conformation with substrates (top), products (middle), or apo methyltransferase-like proteins 3 and 14 (METTL3-14) (bottom).

METTL3 residues D395, W398, Y406, K459, E481, S511, K513, and R536 are shown as sticks and coloured by atom with carbon in teal. The movie begins with the SAM and AMP in the position of BA2. The flexibility of the Y406 side chain and the ASL1 loop in which it is located is observed already at the beginning of the movie. At around time point 00:15, the Y406 interacts with the adenosine ring of AMP, and at 00:20, there is a dissociation of AMP from the binding pocket. AMP remains bound to Y406 via π-π interactions for the next 10 s and finally dissociates completely. In the natural system, the adenosine would remain bound by the rest of the RNA chain, but in this case, when AMP is alone, it dissociates away. Y406 occupies the binding pocket close to SAM. At around 00:39, the AMP re-enters in the vicinity of the pocket, and the Y406 again coordinates via π-π interactions with the adenosine ring at 00:45. After around 10 s, the AMP dissociates again. The binding mechanism of the natural substrate probably requires the binding of the RNA chain in the groove, followed by the interaction of Y406 with the substrate adenosine. The rest of the movie continues with a partial dissociation of the methionine moiety of SAM at around 01:05 and the non-specific interactions of AMP with METTL3-14.</p></caption></media></fig-group></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SAM binding primes the METTL3 active site for adenosine recognition</title><p>Given the high concentration of SAM in the cell (60–160 μM in the rat liver), the cosubstrate SAM is expected to bind before the RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Finkelstein and Martin, 1984</xref>). SAM binding results in large conformational changes of several side chains in the METTL3 active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the apo state, the K513 side chain points away from the putative RNA binding site and is involved in intramolecular polar contacts with the side chains of Y518, E532, and, via a water molecule, D395, that probably help to stabilise the apo protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). SAM binding disrupts the water-mediated hydrogen bond between K513 and D395. This leads to a conformational change in the K513 side chain which then points in the direction of the RNA binding site where it can form a direct salt bridge with D395. In that conformation, the K513 side chain can also readily form a hydrogen bond to the adenosine-N<sup>7</sup> of an RNA substrate as seen in the BA2 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, the side chain of H512, which is part of the SAM binding pocket environment, also undergoes a conformational change upon SAM binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the apo state, the H512 side chain points inwards and thus blocks the adenosine binding site. However, once SAM is bound, the H512 side chain is attracted to form a π-π interaction with H538 whose side chain rotates from an outward pointing conformation in the apo state to an inward pointing conformation in which it interacts with SAM in the holo state. This conformational change of the H512 side chain makes space for adenosine to bind as seen in the BA2 structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). MD simulations show that the side chains of both H512 and K513 are flexible in the apo state, but undergo stabilisation upon SAM and adenosine binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

When the SAM moiety of BA2 is superimposed with SAM bound to METTL4 and METTL16, the adenosine moiety of BA2 is situated in a very similar position as the substrates of the other MTases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In METTL4 and METTL16, the N<sup>6</sup>-atom of their substrate adenosine (analogue) is positioned at a distance of 2.8 and 2.1 Å from the methyl group of SAM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>).

The 1.9 Å distance in the crystal structure with BA2 is similar to the corresponding distance in METTL4 and METTL16, which, in two non-linked moieties, would allow for an SN2 transfer of the methyl group of a METTL3-bound SAM to the N<sup>6</sup>-atom of an adenosine substrate. Strikingly, the angle formed by the SAM-5’S – Cε – adenosine-N<sup>6</sup> in METTL3 is 160.9° which is similar to the other MTases, and very close to the optimal 180° for an SN2 reaction in which the adenosine-N<sup>6</sup> attacks the SAM-Cε and SAH becomes the leaving group.

In the absence of any catalytic base, it was proposed that the methyl transfer occurs first, leading to an adenine-m<sup>6</sup>NH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> group well stabilised by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the Asn side chain and Pro backbone carbonyl. The mechanism was supported by QM/MM free energy simulations with a barrier height of ~20 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aranda et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, the same QM/MM study suggested that when the active site Asn was replaced by an Asp, a mechanism in which deprotonation of the adenine-N<sup>6</sup> group by the Asp preceded the methyl transfer from SAM also had a comparable free energy barrier. Due to the involvement of the proton transfer, the corresponding transition state exhibited rather different charge distributions from that in the WT M·TaqI. DNA N<sup>6</sup>-methyltransferases in the α/β groups feature an Asp in the active site, while those in the γ group have an Asn at the equivalent position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malone et al., 1995</xref>). Hence, the QM/MM computational results suggest that transition states with distinct charge distributions are involved in different groups of enzymes (i.e. α/β vs. γ), giving rise to the opportunity of designing transition state analogues as inhibitors unique to specific classes of methyl transferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aranda et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This raises the question whether methyl transfer in METTL3-14 may also occur following deprotonation of the adenosine-N<sup>6</sup>H<sub>2</sub>. The structural features of the METTL3-14 active site do not support this mechanism. The adenosine-N<sup>6</sup> position has a very high p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of ~17, and thus its deprotonation requires a particularly strong base, which is absent in the active site of METTL3-14. For example, while there is a carboxylate nearby (D395), it forms a salt bridge with K513, and therefore is expected to feature a too low p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> value to deprotonate the adenosine-N<sup>6</sup>H<sub>2</sub>. These considerations are congruent with the observation that the computed DFTB3/MM free energy profile without adenosine-N<sup>6</sup> deprotonation is possible within the reported experimental kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woodcock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The difference in the methylation energetics of adenosine in different protonation states shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> is consistent with the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> difference of adenosine before and after methylation.

This model shows that in the apo state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, State 0), the side chain of K513 is involved in intramolecular interactions that stabilise the protein. SAM binding displaces the K513 side chain and brings it in the right conformation where it can form a hydrogen bond to the N<sup>7</sup> of the adenosine substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, State 1). Space for adenosine to bind is further conditioned by the conformational change of the H512 side chain which blocks the catalytic site in the apo state, but is drawn out of the adenosine binding site to interact with H538 in the SAM-bound state. The proper recognition of adenosine is conditioned by the interaction with the aromatic side chain of Y406 to which the adenosine substrate can bind and stabilise the ASL1 through interaction in the BA4 conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, State 2). The Y406 side chain acts as gatekeeper and swaps out to allow the adenosine ring to flip and slip into the catalytic site where it is stabilised through hydrogen bonds to E481 and K513 in the BA2 conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, State 3). The bond between K513 and adenosine is especially stable in the MD simulations started from the binding mode of BA2. Hydrogen bonds with the D395 side chain and P396 backbone enhance the nucleophilicity of the adenosine-N<sup>6</sup> and trigger the SN2 reaction with the electrophilic methyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, State 4).

Crystal structures of METTL3-14 complexed with bisubstrate analogues (BAs) were solved and allowed us to carry out classical MD simulations and QM/MM free energy calculations. The encounter complex between the METTL3-SAM holo complex and RNA is promoted by electrostatic steering of the negatively charged RNA backbone by a surface groove of positively charged electrostatic potential centred around the sulphonium ion of SAM. The crystal structures together with mutational analysis and MD simulations have revealed a key role of METTL3 residue Y406 in recruiting the adenosine of the RNA substrate into a catalytically competent position and orientation. The proper recognition of adenosine is conditioned by interaction with the aromatic side chain of Y406 positioned in the flexible active site loop of METTL3. The side chain of Y406 recruits the RNA-adenosine, accommodates it into the catalytic site, and facilitates product release after methyl transfer. The adenosine ring forms hydrogen bonds to the side chains of E481 and K513 in the catalytic site of METTL3. Alanine mutants of these newly identified adenosine binding residues show abolished MTase activity compared to the WT METTL3-14. Importantly, these mutants are still folded and able to bind the SAH cofactor. This confirms the contribution of these newly identified adenosine binding residues to RNA-substrate binding, as shown also by the stability of their hydrogen bonds to adenosine in the MD simulations. Hydrogen bonds with the METTL3 D395 side chain and P396 backbone enhance the nucleophilicity of the adenosine-N<sup>6</sup> and trigger the SN2 reaction with the electrophilic methyl group of SAM. The QM/MM calculations provide evidence that the transfer of the methyl group from SAM to adenosine proceeds without prior deprotonation of the adenosine-N<sup>6</sup>. Furthermore, the height of the QM/MM free energy barrier indicates that the methyl transfer step is not rate-determining. MD simulations suggest that the release of the coproduct SAH is the rate-limiting step.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that BAs and multiscale atomistic simulations can be used to decipher RNA recognition by human RNA MTases. The multidisciplinary strategy described here can be used for other RNA/DNA MTases to probe their active site by adapting the RNA/DNA sequence of the BA to the RNA/DNA substrate of the MTase of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Chemical synthesis of bisubstrate analogues (BAs)</title><p>The synthesis of the BAs was as previously described: BA1/2/3/4/6, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atdjian et al., 2018</xref>; Compound 12, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atdjian et al., 2020</xref>; GA*, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meynier et al., 2022</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>METTL3-14 expression, purification, and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>For determining the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) with the full-length complex and for crystallisation studies with the truncated complex METTL3<sup>MTD</sup>:METTL14<sup>MTD</sup> containing just the methyltransferase domains (MTD) of METTL3 (residues 354–580) and METTL14 (residues 107–395), the recombinant complex constructs were expressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell expression system and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>).</p><p>For mutational analysis, alanine mutants were generated in the baculovirus vector pFastBacDual-StrepII-GFP-TEV-METTL3-His-TEV-METTL14 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol and confirmed by sequencing.

A single exponential with a multiplicative factor was used to check the quality of the fitting, with a preexponential factor close to 1 indicative of a good fit. No fitting was done for SAM/SAH as they remained bound in almost every single trajectory. The rates were calculated by fitting the dissociation time of two blocks of the trajectories at a time. The 16 choose 8 (12,870) possible combinations were considered, and the mean of all the values was reported as the dissociation rate in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. The standard deviation was used as error. The unbinding rates using all the trajectories without block averaging are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>QM model calculations</title><p>To understand the intrinsic energetics of the methyl transfer reaction, we conducted QM calculations of an infinitely separated model substrate (adenosine) and a truncated model for the cofactor SAM in which the adenosine and amino moieties were replaced by ethyl groups. The N<sup>6</sup> position of the model substrate was taken to be either protonated (-NH<sub>2</sub>) or deprotonated. Calculations were performed in the gas phase using two different density functional theory (DFT) methods (B3LYP with the D3 dispersion correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Becke, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becke, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lee et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Grimme et al., 2010</xref>] and ωB97XD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chai and Head-Gordon, 2008</xref>]) and two different basis sets (aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dunning, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kendall et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Woon and Dunning, 1993</xref>). Calculations were also conducted at the DFTB3/3OB level for calibration as the same QM method is used in subsequent QM/MM free energy simulations. To probe the effect of solvation on the methyl transfer energetics, single point calculations were carried out with the conductor-like polarisable continuum model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barone and Cossi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cossi et al., 2003</xref>) using the gas-phase optimised structures at both B3LYP-D3 and ωB97XD levels.

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the crystal structure (at 2.3 Å resolution) of the complex with a transition state analogue (the bisubstrate analogue BA2) suggests a rather straightforward mechanism through which the methyl group is transferred from SAM to the adenosine-N<sup>6</sup> position. The deprotonation of N<sup>6</sup> by a nearby base in principle may occur either before or after the methyl transfer, but QM/MM calculations strongly suggest that deprotonation occurs after the methyl transfer.</p><p>In the QM/MM simulations, the BA was first converted to a SAM non-covalently bonded to the adenosine: the nitrogen N<sub>BS</sub> atom in the crystal structure was replaced by a sulphur atom and the extra carbon atom was deleted. The O5*-PA bond was cut off and a hydrogen atom was patched to the location. The QM region included the cofactor SAM, the model substrate adenosine, the carbonyl groups of A394, D395, P396, and P397 without the backbone carbonyl group, and the side chain of K513. Link atoms were added between C and C<sub>α</sub> of A394 and P397, and between C<sub>β</sub> and C<sub>α</sub> of K513 to saturate the valence of the QM boundary atoms using the divided frontier charge (DIV) scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">König et al., 2005</xref>). The QM atoms were treated with the DFTB3 method with the 3OB parameter set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gaus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gaus et al., 2014</xref>); benchmark calculations using model compounds (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) indicate that the DFTB3/3OB method describes the energetics of the methyl transfer reaction rather well in comparison to DFT calculations with a large basis set. The MM region was described with the CHARMM36 force field for proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huang and MacKerell, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the generalised solvent boundary potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Im et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schaefer et al., 2005</xref>) framework, the inner region contained atoms within a 27 Å radius sphere centred at the N<sup>6</sup> in adenosine. Newtonian equations of motion were solved for atoms within 25 Å. Protein atoms in the buffer region (25–27 Å) were harmonically restrained with force constants determined from the crystallographic B factors and Langevin equations of motion were solved with a bath temperature of 300 K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brooks and Karplus, 1983</xref>). The remaining portion of the system in the outer region was frozen. All water molecules were subject to a weak geometrical (GEO) type of restraining potential to keep them inside the inner sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>). Weak GEO restraints were added on adenosine to make sure it was well bounded during the simulations. Electrostatic interactions among inner region atoms were treated with extended electrostatics and a group-based cut-off scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stote et al., 1991</xref>). The static field due to the outer region atoms was evaluated with the linearised Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equations using a focusing scheme, which employed a coarse grid of 1.2 Å and a fine grid of 0.4 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Im et al., 1998</xref>). The reaction field matrix was evaluated using spherical harmonics up to the 20<sup>th</sup> order. In the PB calculations, dielectric constants of the protein and water were set to 1 and 80, respectively, and the salt concentration was set to zero.</p><p>To probe the energetics of the methyl transfer reaction catalysed by the METTL3-14 complex, well-tempered multiple-walker metadynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Valsson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barducci et al., 2008</xref>) were carried out using the PLUMED-CHARMM interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonomi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">PLUMED consortium, 2019</xref>). The antisymmetric stretch that describes the methyl transfer process between the N<sup>6</sup> in adenosine and the SAM sulphur-methyl group was chosen as the collective variable (CV), i.e., ξ=r(CE−SD) − r(CE−N6). The corresponding C-S distance and C-N distance are also monitored but no bias potential was added. SHAKE was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen and used to avoid undesired proton transfer reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ryckaert et al., 1977</xref>).</p><p>The first two metadynamic runs were not well tempered for the efficiency of sampling. In the subsequent well-tempered runs, the bias factor was set to be 35. A new Gaussian biasing potential was added every 0.2 ps with an initial height of 0.3 kJ/mol and a width of 0.05. Twenty-four walkers with different initial velocities were used per simulation in parallel while sharing hill history among all walkers every 1 ps. Each walker was run for 250 ps for a total of 6 ns of sampling, and convergence was evaluated by comparing the PMF (potential of mean force) as a function of the number of Gaussians added.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Senior editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Crystallography data collection and refinement statistics.</title><p>Statistics for the highest-resolution shell are shown in parentheses.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-92537-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-92537-transrepform1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the supplementary materials.

Since there is no involvement of the Y406-OH group with adenosine, mutating to F did not seem sufficient. Furthermore, by mutating Y406 to alanine, we also eliminate the possibility for a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the W398 backbone.

It was shown that SAH is bound with higher affinity than SAM by METTL3 (DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.02.100). Since the magnitude of the thermal shift depends also on the affinity, we chose the higher-affinity binder SAH.There is no RNA per se shown in this figure. “Ligands” in the figure caption (A) refers to the three bound molecules that are shown and mentioned in the previous sentence: SAM, BA2, and BA4. “Ligand” in the figure caption (D) refers to “SAH” that was used in the experiment described and mentioned just after, but is now removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Figure 5D is very difficult to interpret.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays would be sufficient if Tm studies are time-consuming.

Such RNA binding experiments can turn out to be very time consuming, both in TSA and EMSA. The reason is mainly this: The RNA substrate must be chosen such that it binds sufficiently strong to the WT to cause an effect (thermal shift or electrophoretic mobility shift), but also to observe a clear difference in binding between WT and mutant proteins. Since many more residues of METTL3 and METTL14 contribite to RNA binding, the effects of individual mutants on affinity might be too small to be confidently detected in TSA or EMSA. In particular, we only identified the substrate adenosine binding residues, and mutating them and hence preventing adenosine binding alone, might not have a big effect on overall RNA binding affinity. The enzymatic assay that we used, on the other hand, is more sensitive since the detection is fluorescence based and quantifies the conversion of A to m6A in an RNA substrate, and more factors than just affinity play a role for enzymatic activity, such as correct orientation and stability of the adenosine in the active site and stabilization of the transision state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A written narrative to accompany Supplementary Movie 1 would make it much more accessible to those unfamiliar with modeling and simulations.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment.

We also added another line in the table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In the conclusion, the authors state &quot;the height of the QM/MM free-energy barrier indicates that the methyl transfer step is not rate-determining.&quot; How does this compare to experimental data? Additional kinetic assays to demonstrate this experimentally would go a long way in convincing the reader of this conclusion.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the question. Kinetic assays have been performed for METTL3-14 and we mention and reference them in the text. We believe that further kinetic experiments would be outside of the scope of this study. Furthermore, the METTL3 mutants that we made show no activity in our enzymatic assay and hence kinetic studies would be probably impossible to do with them.</p><p>As we show from QM/MM and describe in the text, the methyl cation in the SAM cofactor is transferred directly to the N6 position of the adenosine substrate. DFTB3/MM free energy simulations show that this mechanism has an energetic barrier of 15-16 kcal/mol. The turnover as published based on an enzymatic assay is 0.2-0.6 min-1 at ambient temperature which implies a barrier of ~20 kcal/mol. This value is higher than that determined for the methyl transfer alone as determined by QM/MM. Hence, in the overall mechanism, there must be a step that is slower than the methy transfer and hence we conclude that the methyl transfer is not the rate-limiting step.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I only have a few comments about the work.</p><p>(1) It would be good if the authors could show more of the data that is used as the basis for their conclusions. For example, IC50 values are presented (Table 1) without error estimates or an indication of the quality of the data that is used to estimate the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We included errors of the IC50 values and show the dose response curved from the enzymatic assay with the BAs as inhibitors in a new Supplementary Figure S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) More substantially, it would be good to have a more detailed analysis of the crystal structures in terms of the properties that are mentioned/analysed. While the structures are relatively good (2.1 Å2.5Å), it is not clear to the reader how this data supports the interactions that are proposed. For example, the authors pinpoint a number of hydrogen bonding interactions and water molecules in the complexes. They might consider showing support for some of these in the electron density maps. Similarly, it would be good to show the densities that support the substantial differences of the Ade in the BA2 and BA4 complexes. These might be supplementary files. I note also that the structures are not yet released or available for analysis [which of course is a valid choice but also means that I cannot inspect the maps myself].</p></disp-quote><p>We have added supplementary figures supporting the conformations of the BAs and their interactions with METTL3 with electron density, for BA1 and BA6 in Supplementary Figure S2, and for BA2 and BA4 in a new Supplementary Figure S3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It would be useful with an error analysis of the off-rates estimated from the MD simulations and a discussion of the accuracy of these estimates. Even the slower dissociation events seem quite fast. What are the rough affinities of these molecules and how fast would the binding need to be to be compatible with the affinity and estimated off-rates?</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded upon this in the results paragraph concerning the MD simulations. The affinities of METTL3-14 binding to AMP or m6AMP can be expected to be very low, with Kd values in the millimolar range. We have not measured these Kd values, nor have we found any published data, but we have conducted thermal shift assays with A and m6A and did not observe any significant thermal shifts in the melting temperature of METTL3-14 at high micromolar concentrations of these compounds, indicative of a very low binding affinity. This is to be expected because METTL3-14 should not methylate adenosines unspecifically but rather in the GGACU motif of substrate mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors use QM/MM simulations with metadynamics to estimate the energy profile of the methyl transfer reaction. They find a barrier of ca. 15 kcal/mol and suggest this to be compatible with the enzymatic turnover rate of ca. 0.3/min. Here it would be good with a clearer description of the possible sources of error and assumptions in making these statements. First, what is the error on the estimated energy profile from the metadynamics? The authors mention the analysis of progression of the PMF as a function of time, but that is in itself not a strong test for convergence (the PMF may stay constant if there is little sampling). What does the time series of the CV look like? Second, it seems as if the authors are assuming a large pre-exponential factor (10^9/s ?). Is that correct, and how sure are they of this value? Finally, when linking the barrier of the methyl-transfer reaction to the overall turnover rate it sounds like they assume that other parts of the reaction do not affect the turnover rate. Is that correctly understood, and what is the evidence for that? It sounds like the authors are saying that step 5 in the cycle (Figure 10) is limiting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the questions. Accordingly, we have carried out additional simulations and statistical error analyses.</p><p>(i) We have carried out two additional sets of multi-walker metadynamics simulations with the same setup as the original calculation, except for using different initial random seeds. Using the three independent sets of metadynamics simulations, we can better estimate the statistical uncertainty for the computed potential of mean force (PMF). We have updated the PMF in Fig. 8b, in which the solid curve represents the result averaged over three independent runs, and the shaded area represents the standard error of the mean of the three replicas. The figure caption of Fig. 8b is revised accordingly.</p><p>(ii) To further illustrate the convergence behavior of the metadynamics simulations, we have included the following supplementary files: (1). Potentials of mean force computed with different numbers of deposited Gaussians are compared. (2). As suggested by the reviewer, we show the time series of the collective variable (CV) sampled by the 24 independent walkers during one set of metadynamics simulations. These results clearly indicate that the CV exhibits diffusive behaviors between the reactant and product regions, further supporting the adequate sampling and convergence of our metadynamics simulations.</p><p>(iii) Regarding the issue of pre-factor used in the rate estimate, we have indeed used the common approximation of kT/h as in the regular transition state theory. Many studies in the literature support the use of this expression for very localized chemical reactions in enzymes. We have included several representative references along this line: (1) M. Garcia-Viloca, J. Gao, M. Karplus, D. G. Truhlar, How enzymes work: Analysis by modern rate theory and computer simulations, Science, 303, 186-195 (2004) (2) D. R. Glowacki, J. N. Harvey, A. J. Mulholland, Taking Ockham’s razor to enzyme dynamics and catalysis, Nat.
