Using the developing <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> intestine as an in vivo model, we investigated how epithelia maintain their integrity through cell division and elongation to build a functional tube. Live imaging revealed that apical PAR complex proteins PAR-6/Par6 and PKC-3/aPkc remained apical during mitosis while apical microtubules and microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) proteins were transiently removed. Intestine-specific depletion of PAR-6, PKC-3, and the aPkc regulator CDC-42/Cdc42 caused persistent gaps in the apical MTOC as well as in other apical and junctional proteins after cell division and in non-dividing cells that elongated. Upon hatching, gaps coincided with luminal constrictions that blocked food, and larvae arrested and died. Thus, the apical PAR complex maintains apical and junctional continuity to construct a functional intestinal tube.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epithelia</kwd><kwd>apicobasal polarity</kwd><kwd>cell-cell junctions</kwd><kwd>MTOC</kwd><kwd>PAR-6/Par6, PKC-3/aPkc</kwd><kwd>CDC-42/Cdc42</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2 GM119136-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>Jessica L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM133950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>Jessica L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM129900-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pickett</surname><given-names>Melissa A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 GM13548901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sallee</surname><given-names>Maria Danielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM120913-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sallee</surname><given-names>Maria Danielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P40 OD010440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>Jessica L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During intestinal development, apical PAR complex proteins keep apical domains and junctions continuous between cells as they divide and elongate, and ultimately build a continuous functional tube.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelia are dynamic tissues composed of polarized and adherent epithelial cells that line organs, provide mechanical resiliency, act as selective barriers, and separate animal bodies from the outside world. The integrity of a functional epithelium requires cell polarity and adhesion to be consistent and continuous throughout the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pickett et al., 2019</xref>). Epithelial cells polarize along an apicobasal axis, collectively positioning their apical surfaces facing outward with important specializations such as microvilli and cilia, while their basolateral domains contact neighboring cells and basement membranes. Junctional complexes (‘junctions’) form belt-like bands at the cell periphery that adhere neighboring cells together and separate the apical and basolateral domains. During development and homeostasis, epithelia must maintain their integrity despite being challenged by various programmed cellular ‘assaults’ such as mitosis, cell shape change, intercalation, extrusion, and cell death, any of which could potentially compromise tissue architecture and function. How epithelial primordia maintain their integrity in vivo in the face of these challenges to build a functional organ is not well understood.</p><p>Different assaults on epithelial integrity require individual epithelial cells to remodel existing polarized structures or build new ones. In most epithelial cells, cell division physically cleaves their polarized domains and daughters must build junctions at the new cell-cell contact while maintaining correct apicobasal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Bras and Le Borgne, 2014</xref>). Division also requires rearrangement of the microtubule cytoskeleton. In many interphase epithelial cells, such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and mammalian intestinal cells, <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal and follicle cells, and many mammalian epithelial cell lines, microtubules are arranged in parallel arrays emanating from an apically localized microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), allowing for intracellular vesicle transport and apicobasal polarity maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sanchez and Feldman, 2017</xref>). During mitosis, microtubules are temporarily rearranged into radial arrays around the centrosomal MTOC and then returned to the apical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pease and Tirnauer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Feldman, 2015</xref>), yet how microtubules are released from and returned to the apical surface is unknown. Epithelial cells frequently must also change their shape and size. For example, the epithelial folds that drive <italic>Drosophila</italic> gastrulation and vertebrate neurulation require cells to undergo apical construction, shrinking their apical surfaces in concert with their junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>); conversely, new cells are added to the <italic>Xenopus</italic> epidermis via apical emergence, expanding their apical surfaces and junctions as they extend to join the apical side of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sedzinski et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The highly conserved apical PAR polarity complex can play important roles in epithelial cell remodeling by, for example, orienting the mitotic spindle during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuchinke et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mack and Georgiou, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siegrist and Doe, 2005</xref>) and regulating actin dynamics during apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">David et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishiuchi and Takeichi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Walck-Shannon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zilberman et al., 2017</xref>). This ‘PAR complex,’ consisting of PAR-3/Par3, PAR-6/Par6, PKC-3/aPkc, and CDC-42/Cdc42, is best characterized for its role in the formation and maintenance of apicobasal domains and junctions in many tissues and organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pickett et al., 2019</xref>). The scaffold Par6 binds the kinase aPkc; another scaffold Par3 recruits them to the apical surface, and the Rho-family GTPase Cdc42 replaces Par3 and activates aPkc kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achilleos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris and Peifer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hutterer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joberty et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Totong et al., 2007</xref>). aPkc phosphorylates and removes basolateral proteins from the apical domain, and mutual inhibition between apical and basolateral proteins maintains and refines the apical and basolateral domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pickett et al., 2019</xref>). The PAR complex also promotes adherens junction plasticity, tight junction formation, and junction maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Georgiou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montoyo-Rosario et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rusu and Georgiou, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Totong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wallace et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zilberman et al., 2017</xref>). These roles are well known, though specific contributions can vary by tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pickett et al., 2019</xref>). One example is in the early steps of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryonic intestinal development. PAR-3 is required to establish the apical domain of intestinal cells along a shared central midline, which later forms the lumen, and to recruit other PAR complex proteins and microtubules to the apical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achilleos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feldman and Priess, 2012</xref>); PAR-6 and PKC-3 localize interdependently to the apical surface, and PAR-6 is required for junction formation but not polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montoyo-Rosario et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Totong et al., 2007</xref>); and CDC-42 is not required for polarity or junction formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zilberman et al., 2017</xref>). However, epithelial remodeling occurs after polarity establishment as intestinal cells divide and elongate, and the role of PAR complex proteins in these later stages is less well understood due to their earlier requirements for embryo viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achilleos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gotta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kay and Hunter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montoyo-Rosario et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Plusa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tabuse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Totong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watts et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zilberman et al., 2017</xref>). Recent advances in tissue-specific protein depletion allow robust spatial and temporal control of protein removal, enabling the study of the later roles of polarity proteins in specific tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armenti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sallee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We used the developing <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine as a genetically accessible in vivo context to study how a polarized epithelial primordium maintains tissue integrity through the developmental assaults of cell division and elongation to build a functional tube. We found that PAR complex proteins are required during embryonic intestinal development to build a functional larval intestine with a continuous, open lumen. Intestine-specific depletion of PAR-6, PKC-3, and CDC-42 in embryos resulted in gaps along the intestinal midline in apical MTOC proteins, both where cells had divided and where cells were elongating. Preventing polarized cells from dividing in PAR-6-depleted intestines also reduced their tendency to form gaps, suggesting a causal link between division and gap formation. In PAR-6-depleted intestines, gaps in MTOC proteins correlated with gaps in apical and junctional proteins, and basolateral proteins failed to be excluded from the midline. The discontinuities in apical and junctional proteins became more numerous as elongation progressed, with PAR-6 continuing to be required in later stages of embryonic intestinal elongation, and larvae arrested upon hatching with functionally obstructed intestines showing gaps in the lumen, apical surfaces, and junctions. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of these highly conserved PAR complex proteins during development in remodeling the apical domain and junctions to maintain continuity as intestinal cells divide and expand their apical surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cells within the polarized <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine elongate and divide</title><p>Following polarization, cells in the developing <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine divide, intercalate, and elongate during morphogenesis, and thus serve as a good in vivo model to understand the mechanisms epithelial cells use to buffer against these assaults. The 16-cell primordial intestine (E16) is arranged into two tiers of 10 dorsal and 6 ventral cells. These cells begin to polarize soon after they are born, building a continuous apical domain along a central midline, the future lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leung et al., 1999</xref>). Adherens and septate-like junctions form a single ‘apical junction’ that localizes around the apical domain between left/right, dorsal/ventral, and anterior/posterior pairs of cells in a ladder-like arrangement along the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Labouesse, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Two pairs of anterior and posterior cells, referred to here as ‘star cells,’ undergo an additional round of mitosis after polarity is established while the other 12 ‘non-star cells’ remain in interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The embryonic intestine more than doubles its midline length from a polarized primordium at bean stage to the 1.5- to 1.8-fold stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Elongation continues and the lumen is formed at the midline. Embryos hatch as L1 (first larval stage) larvae with a functional intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), built from a series of nine stacked ‘int’ rings with a continuous central hollow lumen through which food passes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The apical surfaces of all the cells face the lumen where they secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients through microvilli, and junctional complexes maintain cell adhesion and barrier function while allowing the open lumen to run unobstructed between the intestinal rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dimov and Maduro, 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell division and elongation challenge the epithelial integrity of the developing <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) A cartoon schematic (<bold>A</bold>) and corresponding live time course (<bold>B</bold>) of an embryo expressing an apical microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) marker TBG-1::mCherry (green, orange arrowhead) and a membrane marker intestinal GFP::CAAX (magenta); the anterior and posterior ‘star cells’ divide (blue) and the apical surface elongates (white arrow) as the polarized intestinal primordium develops into an intestine.

Apical microtubules and the microtubule nucleator γ-Tubulin Ring Complex (γ-TuRC) transiently leave the apical surface when star cells divide and centrosomes are reactivated as MTOCs to build the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pease and Tirnauer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Feldman, 2015</xref>). The loss of apical microtubules is easiest to see when star cells divide at the same time. Both apical surfaces lose apical microtubules during mitosis, creating a visible ‘midline gap’ in MTOC proteins as both the left and right cells reactivate centrosomal MTOCs; the midline gap is then refilled upon mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Feldman, 2015</xref>). In addition to microtubules and the γ-TuRC components TBG-1/γ-tubulin and GIP-1/GCP3, all other MTOC and microtubule-associated proteins we examined also left the apical surface during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Some MTOC proteins localized to the active centrosomes (γ-TuRC, ZYG-9/chTOG, AIR-1/Aurora A), while other proteins did not and likely became cytoplasmic (NOCA-1/Ninein, PTRN-1/CAMSAP, VAB-10B/Spectraplakin). The observed removal of apical MTOC proteins during mitosis, including the MTOC anchoring proteins VAB-10B and WDR-62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sanchez et al., 2020</xref>), suggests the complete inactivation of the apical surface as an MTOC. Junctional proteins retained some localization during mitosis, albeit reduced as compared with interphase neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Localization of the septate-like junction-associated protein DLG-1/Discs large was most strongly reduced during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, D</xref>), and the adherens junction protein HMR-1/E-cadherin was also reduced compared to the non-dividing ‘non-star’ intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, E</xref>), appearing as thin fluorescent threads as new cell boundaries formed. The other apical proteins examined, ACT-5/actin and three members of the PAR complex PAR-3/Par3, PAR-6/Par6, and PKC-3/aPkc, all remained apically localized during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, G</xref>).

We used intestine-specific promoters to express ZIF-1 prior to polarity establishment (<italic>elt-2</italic>p in the four-intestinal cell ‘E4’ stage and <italic>ifb-2</italic>p in the eight-intestinal cell ‘E8’ stage), ensuring robust depletion only in the gut well before star cell divisions and intestinal elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In contrast, we observed gaps in the apical MTOC in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> and PKC-3<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we examined the localization of two apical junction complex proteins, HMR-1/E-cadherin and DLG-1/Dlg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bossinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costa et al., 1998</xref>), relative to gaps in TBG-1::mCherry in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos. Normally, HMR-1 and DLG-1 localize as a continuous band at the cell periphery between the apical and basolateral domains and form ladder-like belt junctions at the interfaces between intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McMahon et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

For small TBG-1 gaps, a gap in HMR-1 was sometimes not observed. We also examined DLG-1::mNG localization, which was severely perturbed along the entire midline in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos as has previously been reported following PAR-6 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Totong et al., 2007</xref>). We occasionally found large patches of DLG-1 that colocalized with TBG-1; however, DLG-1 was clearly absent from most TBG-1 gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>). Together, these results indicate that junctional complexes do not spread into and fill midline gaps in apical proteins following PAR-6 depletion.</p><p>Lastly, we asked whether the basolateral domain inappropriately localized at midline gaps in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos. We examined two basolateral markers: LGL-1, which localizes specifically to basolateral domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beatty et al., 2010</xref>), and LET-413/Scribble, which localizes to basolateral and junctional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Legouis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McMahon et al., 2001</xref>). Because of a natural twist in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leung et al., 1999</xref>), the apical domain in anterior cells presented itself as a side view under normal imaging conditions, making it easier to detect the localization of membrane-enriched proteins at the midline of these cells (compare midline GFP::CAAX in anterior and posterior cells of middle image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, we restricted our analysis of LGL-1 and LET-413 localization to the anterior half of the intestine (int1-4). In control intestines, LGL-1::GFP and LET-413::GFP were observed at lateral surfaces and strongly reduced at the midline where apical markers TBG-1::mCherry and PAR-3::tagRFP localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–J</xref>). In PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos, LGL-1 and LET-413 signal intensities were significantly elevated in most gaps, and similar to intensities at lateral surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–J</xref>). LGL-1 and LET-413 were also observed at midline ‘non-gap’ regions, where apical markers localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, I</xref> insets, orange arrowheads), suggesting a more general failure of LGL-1 and LET-413 exclusion from the apical surface rather than specific invasion of the basolateral domain into the midline gaps. Intriguingly, both PAR-3 and LET-413 signal intensities were highest at non-gap midline regions in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos, which could reflect a failure to remove PAR-3 and both junctional and basolateral LET-413 from the midline when PAR-6 is depleted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>PAR complex-depleted intestinal lumens are functionally obstructed and cannot pass food</title><p>The importance of PAR-6 for building a functional intestine is unknown because global loss of <italic>par-6</italic> causes lethality in embryos, well before intestinal function can be assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Totong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watts et al., 1996</xref>).

However, in 83% of PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> larvae and 93% of PKC-3<sup>gut(-)</sup> larvae, blue food passed through the pharynx and pharyngeal valve but was trapped at the anterior end of the intestine, suggesting a luminal obstruction in the first intestinal ring (int1), which comprises the four anterior star cell daughters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, E, F</xref>). Blue food leaked into the body of a small percentage of larvae (10% of PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup>, 2% of PKC-3<sup>gut(-)</sup>), suggesting that most of the PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> and PKC-3<sup>gut(-)</sup> larvae that ingested food retained their intestinal barrier function, at least between the pharyngeal valve and int1. Consistent with their milder larval arrest phenotype, CDC-42<sup>gut(-)</sup> larvae also showed a lower penetrance of obstructed intestines; 42% had a normal intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), 23% had an early int1 obstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G’</xref>), and 20% had a more posterior obstruction.</p><p>Using this assay, we also tested whether cell division and elongation contributed to obstructing PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> intestinal lumens.

It is often difficult to tease apart their requirement for these different roles, especially in vivo, and to determine how morphological defects caused by their removal during development affect the mature organ. Using tissue-specific protein degradation to deplete proteins from developing intestines, we found that the PAR complex proteins PAR-6, PKC-3, and CDC-42 are required to preserve apical and junctional continuity as cells in the developing intestine divide and elongate during morphogenesis. This continuity is critical for transforming the polarized intestinal primordium into a functional tube at hatching as depletion of any of these proteins resulted in a failure to build a continuous lumen that could pass food. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which PAR-6, PKC-3, and CDC-42 promote apical, junctional, and basolateral domain remodeling to maintain tissue-level continuity during intestinal cell division and elongation, thereby ensuring the formation of an open and functional intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model.</title><p>A cartoon model of the role of PAR-6, PKC-3, and CDC-42 in apical and junctional remodeling as <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryonic intestinal cells divide and elongate to form a functional intestinal tube.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64437-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>The contribution of tissue-specific depletion studies</title><p>A critical feature of this study was our tissue-specific protein degradation approach. Ubiquitous somatic depletion of PAR-6, PKC-3, or CDC-42 causes embryonic lethality and failed embryonic elongation due to skin defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montoyo-Rosario et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Totong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zilberman et al., 2017</xref>), thereby masking potential roles of these proteins in other tissues during or after elongation. Using tissue-specific degradation, we bypassed the requirement for these proteins in earlier embryonic development and in other tissues and revealed the requirement for PAR-6, PKC-3, and CDC-42 for apical and junctional continuity during intestinal morphogenesis. Similar techniques have identified different roles and regulation of the PAR complex in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> excretory cell and larval intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams and Nance, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castiglioni et al., 2020</xref>), underscoring the value of this approach in understanding the range of ways that these conserved regulators function. While we found that PAR-6 and PKC-3 are required embryonically to build a functional intestine, they seem to be dispensable once the functional intestine has been built, even though intestinal elongation continues through larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castiglioni et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that the embryonic and larval intestines elongate via different mechanisms. These findings thus highlight another advantage of tissue-specific protein depletion: controlling the timing of depletion can uncouple early and late roles in the development and maintenance of the same organ.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PAR complex protein requirement during epithelial cell mitosis</title><p>Our study found that dividing cells were sensitive to depletion of PAR-6, PKC-3, and CDC-42 during intestinal morphogenesis. Star cells contribute only three of the nine int rings that build the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), yet over half of the midline gaps in 1.5-fold embryos affected star cell daughters. Cell division appears to cause this high frequency of gap formation as inhibition of the star cell divisions ameliorated the gaps caused by PAR-6 depletion. Dividing epithelial cells extensively remodel many polarized features, any of which could depend on PAR complex proteins. The apical MTOC and microtubules are removed and centrosomes are reactivated to organize microtubules into a bipolar spindle. Apical microtubules contribute to the establishment and maintenance of apical and junctional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feldman and Priess, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris and Peifer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vasileva and Citi, 2018</xref>), so losing apical microtubules during mitosis could weaken the integrity of an epithelial cell and make it more dependent on the PAR complex to maintain polarity. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, parallel inputs from PAR complex proteins and microtubules assemble a polarized Pins/Gαi crescent to orient the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siegrist and Doe, 2005</xref>). Similarly, apical microtubules and PAR-6 could redundantly maintain the apical domain in star cells; loss of the apical domain would thus only occur when both apical microtubules and PAR-6 are absent, as in dividing PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> star cells.</p><p>Division also requires the formation of new junctions between daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baum and Georgiou, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roignot et al., 2013</xref>), a process that could specifically rely on the known ability of PAR complex proteins to regulate junction formation and maturation during polarity establishment. The adherens junctions of interphase cells can promote tissue integrity in dividing neighbor cells by orienting the mitotic spindle, maintaining adhesion, and regulating the length of the new cell-cell interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gloerich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herszterg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Higashi et al., 2016</xref>). Synchronous division of neighboring cells therefore creates a new challenge as both cells remodel their junctions at the same time, which could temporarily remove important positional information and adhesion. Indeed, we observed that when wild-type star cells divided synchronously, HMR-1 and DLG-1 levels were drastically reduced. In addition, when PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> star cells divided synchronously, persistent midline gaps in the apical MTOC formed, but we did not observe such gaps during asynchronous divisions. These results suggest that either apical PAR-6 or a non-dividing neighboring cell is sufficient for new daughter cells to correctly remodel and build junctions, but that loss of both can impair this remodeling. Thus, adherens junctions may function as an external orientation cue to ensure correct polarity and junction position in daughter cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Gap formation during epithelial cell elongation: cause versus consequence</title><p>Elongating epithelial tubes often must increase the area of the apical domains and junctions of their underlying cells, and consistently, the midline gap phenotype in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> and PKC-3<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos became more severe during the greater than threefold increase in intestine length that occurred by the L1 larval stage. In addition, later PAR-6 depletion in elongating intestines also resulted in discontinuous lumens, albeit less frequently, suggesting a continued requirement for PAR-6 during embryonic intestine development. Most gaps occurred at interfaces between anterior and posterior cells without visible physical cell separation, raising the question of what causes cell-cell interfaces to be vulnerable to loss of PAR-6 or PKC-3. One possibility is that weakened junctions allow basolateral domains to invade and compress the apical domain. While we observed some basolateral protein localization in the gaps in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos, the signal was not specific to the gaps, indicating that basolateral protein localization to the midline does not create apical and junctional gaps. Alternatively, compromised apical and junctional expansion could allow basolateral proteins to diffuse into the new midline space created by elongation. Apical expansion could fail if, for example, the mobility of important apical determinants like PAR-3 decreased and failed to spread to newly added midline membrane. Membrane lacking PAR-3 would likely have less PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and no apical microtubules, both of which normally promote apical protein localization and recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campanale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>). Failure in junctional remodeling could also impede apical expansion by creating junctions that corral and trap the apical domain as cells elongate. Positioning junctions, apical, and basolateral domains is by necessity a highly intertwined process as each domain helps reinforce the position of the other, so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the causes of the gaps versus the consequences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Embryonic PAR complex proteins and intestinal tissue integrity</title><p>The primary defect in PAR-6-, PKC-3-, and CDC-42-depleted intestines is a failure to maintain the coordination of apicobasal polarity between cells; apical and junctional gaps correlated with luminal gaps in larval intestines, the luminal gaps blocked the passage of food, and young larvae arrested and died. Despite the lethality, many aspects of epithelial tissue integrity appeared intact in these larval intestines and thus did not require PAR-6, PKC-3, or CDC-42.</p><sec id="s3-4-1"><title>Selective barrier function</title><p>Disrupting tight/septate junction proteins can compromise epithelial barrier function and tissue integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behr et al., 2003</xref>). Intestines depleted of PAR-6, PKC-3, or CDC-42 rarely leaked, so barrier function appeared largely intact. This result was unexpected due to the known requirement for PAR-6 in junction maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Totong et al., 2007</xref>). While junctional DLG-1 localization was dim and fragmented in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Totong et al., 2007</xref>, this study), DLG-1 appeared to recover a junction-like localization in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> larvae. In addition, DLG-1 was usually visibly continuous between the anterior valve and int1, which may explain why their barrier function remained intact. This result suggests that a secondary mechanism may drive later septate-like junction formation independent of PAR-6 and PKC-3. A candidate parallel pathway is the transmembrane Crumbs polarity complex, a critical polarity regulator in many epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charrier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tepass et al., 1990</xref>). Simultaneous removal of all three <italic>C. elegans</italic> Crumbs homologs does not cause obvious polarity defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Waaijers et al., 2015</xref>), but their role could normally be masked by the activity of the PAR complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-2"><title>Lumen formation</title><p>Lumenogenesis requires correct apicobasal polarity as apically directed vesicles add membrane, apical proteins, and channel and pump proteins to expand the apical surface and build the luminal space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shafaq-Zadah et al., 2020</xref>). Yet without PAR-6, larval intestines developed luminal regions surrounded by apical proteins, suggesting that the ability of the apical domain to direct apical trafficking and lumenogenesis was intact. The edematous nature of much of the PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> and PKC-3<sup>gut(-)</sup> lumens may indicate an inability to regulate luminal expansion. However, luminal expansion is usually associated with increased apical polarity proteins, such as overexpressed Crumbs, or decreased basolateral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2011</xref>), the opposite of our depletion cases. Therefore, we favor a model in which the edematous swellings are the by-product of normal lumenogenesis at the apical surface but with no exit route for the luminal fluid, leading to swelling due to trapped fluid accumulation.</p><p>An important caveat to our interpretations is that tissue-specific degradation is not equivalent to a null allele. While we see robust degradation of all three PAR complex proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), we cannot exclude the possibility that low levels of undegraded protein are sufficient to rescue lumenogenesis and barrier function. However, the level of PAR-6 and PKC-3 degradation we achieve is clearly sufficient to cause fully penetrant luminal gaps and larval arrest. Thus, we consider the likeliest explanation to be that PAR-6, PKC-3, and CDC-42 are not required in the developing intestine to build a lumen per se or to maintain barrier function. Rather, these proteins maintain apical and junctional domain continuity and thus continuous lumenogenesis, resulting in a functional intestinal tube.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>PAR-6 and PKC-3 play a more substantial role than CDC-42 in maintaining apical continuity</title><p>In many tissues, CDC-42 is required for PAR complex localization and to activate PKC-3 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams and Nance, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campanale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pichaud et al., 2019</xref>), but CDC-42 is not required to establish apical polarity or to recruit apical PAR-6 in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zilberman et al., 2017</xref>). Our results revealed two surprising findings about CDC-42. First, by depleting CDC-42 specifically in the intestine, we bypassed the embryonic lethality caused by skin-based enclosure defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zilberman et al., 2017</xref>), and we were able to discover a later role for CDC-42 in promoting intestinal apical continuity after apical polarity is established. Second, while CDC-42<sup>gut(-)</sup>, PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup>, and PKC-3<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos all had similar embryonic gap defects, we found that the number of intestinal gaps defects increased only in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> and PKC-3<sup>gut(-)</sup> larvae, and not in CDC-42<sup>gut(-)</sup> larvae. This result indicates that PAR-6 and PKC-3 continue to be required to maintain apical continuity as the embryonic intestine further elongates, whereas CDC-42 may only be required early in intestinal morphogenesis. One possible explanation for the difference in larval phenotypic severity could be that CDC-42 is important for activating all PKC-3 kinase activity, but that PAR-6 and PKC-3 also provide kinase-independent activity, as has been observed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, the PKC-3 kinase mutant G336N partially rescued PKC-3<sup>gut(-)</sup>, resulting in a phenotype similar to CDC-42<sup>gut(-)</sup> larvae. Alternatively, G336N could be acting as a hypomorphic mutation as a second kinase mutant K282A completely abolished PKC-3 rescuing activity.</p><p>Apicobasal polarity regulators are highly conserved, yet differentially required across organisms and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pickett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wen and Zhang, 2018</xref>).

Detailed studies of diverse epithelia will continue to be important for parsing apart the roles of critical polarity proteins during different stages of organ development and homeostasis, to deepen our understanding about the many ways in which these highly conserved regulators function in development and in disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>JLF631</td><td>This paper;

Two independently derived transgenic lines were scored to assess the rescuing capacity of PKC-3(+), PKC-3[G336N], and PKC-3[ΔPB], and one line for PKC-3[K282A].</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Smurf feeding assay</title><p>One-day-old gravid hermaphrodites were allowed to lay eggs overnight, and hatched larvae were picked into a 30 μL drop of standard overnight OP50 bacterial culture. 10 μL of a 20% solution of blue food coloring (FD and C Blue #1 Powder, Brand: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flavorsandcolor.com/">FLAVORSandCOLOR.com</ext-link>, Amazon) in water was added at a final concentration of 5%, and worms were incubated in a humid box for 3 hr before imaging. To collect the larvae, the dye-OP50 solution was transferred to and spread on an NGM plate to allow the larvae to crawl out of the dark blue solution. Larvae were mounted in 2 mM levamisole on a 3% agarose pad and imaged as described above. Occasionally, larvae were damaged in the transfer process, so larvae that appeared desiccated or damaged were omitted from the analysis. For the PKC-3 rescue assay strains, mosaicism of the array could be detected because transgenically supplied PKC-3 was BFP-tagged and thus visible when it was present or absent. We could not interpret PKC-3 localization as even wild-type PKC-3 appeared cytoplasmic, likely due to its overexpression. However, the presence of BFP allowed us to exclude from our analysis any larvae in which mosaicism appeared to correlate with intestinal defects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in Excel and RStudio.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper provides insight into how apicobasal polarity is necessary for the developing intestinal epithelium to form during morphogenesis. While the importance of polarity in gut development has been known, this study uses a new tissue-specific degradation strategy to probe the effects of polarity loss during cell division and tissue elongation during gut development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Live imaging experiments show that dividing cells maintain apical PAR complex proteins, but lose apical MTOC proteins, during mitosis. The apical domain, which is retained through mitosis, is used to rebuild the lost apical MTOC after division. Degradation of Par6, aPKC and Cdc42 cause similar morphogenetic defects in the intestine, leading to apical gaps in the intestinal lumen, gut obstruction during feeding, and larval lethality. These phenotypes occur most prominently in cells that undergo mitosis and during gut elongation, highlighting the continued need for PAR function in cells as they undergo morphogenetic changes. Rescue experiments with mutant forms of PKC-3/aPKC suggest a novel, kinase-independent role for PKC-3 in intestinal development.</p><p>The most significant advance of the study is the suggestion that PAR-6 and PKC-3 function to mark the apical surface in dividing cells, allowing apical MTs to reform once division is complete. In addition, the authors propose that PAR-6 and PKC-3 function to maintain apical junctions as cells change shape during the process of embryo elongation. Overall, the study is rigorous and convincing, although as detailed below, additional experiments and data quantitation are needed to test the main advances of the paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Revisions requiring new experiments</p><p>1. The hypothesis that PAR-6 and PKC-3 mark the apical domain so that it can be recognized after mitosis is complete, allowing for reassembly of apical MTs, is intriguing, but additional experiments are needed to more thoroughly test this idea. Using heat-shock expression of ZIF-1, it should be possible to degrade these proteins at specific points of intestinal tube formation to test key hypotheses. PAR-6 or PKC-3 should be depleted just after star cell division is complete to ensure that the MT gaps that form at apical surfaces of star cells when PAR-6 is depleted early do not appear. Conversely, if PAR-6 is depleted early then re-expressed by heat-shock or a late-acting promoter after star cell division is complete, do the star cell gaps disappear and fill once again with apical MTs or do gaps remain? I don't think these experiments need to be done with tissue-specific degradation since the autonomy of phenotypes has already been established. Although it's possible that the timing is too tight to get this to work, the authors are encouraged to try this experiment as they would know quickly whether it would be feasible, and it would strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>2. A second and related question is whether PAR-6 and PKC-3 actually have a role during elongation itself. Two alternative hypotheses are that gaps take time to develop and would form eventually even in embryos that do not elongate; or that small gaps present initially are not revealed until apical domain area expands as cells change shape during elongation. The experiment above to remove PAR-6 or PKC-3 after star cell division but before or during elongation can be used to separate out an early function in junction formation from a later function during elongation. Alternatively (or additionally), elongation could be blocked in embryos lacking PAR-6 or PKC-3 in gut cells to determine if defects still arise.</p><p>Revisions requiring new data analysis</p><p>Figure 1: The data showing protein localization during star cell division would benefit from a temporal element: images of protein localization prior the onset of mitosis (or alternatively, images of a neighboring non-mitotic cell), should be shown to illustrate that proteins of interest localize apically during interphase and are then lost during division.

We used three approaches to further bolster the model that PAR-6 is required to maintain apical continuity through epithelial divisions:</p><p>1) Alleviate the requirement for PAR-6 in the star cells by blocking star cell divisions: We observed frequent gaps in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos at the anterior and posterior ends of the intestine, positions where star cells divided. To determine if cell division drives gap formation, we genetically blocked star cell divisions (<italic>cdc-25.2(0)</italic>) in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> embryos and found a significant reduction in gap formation at the intestine ends (new in Figure 4), indicating that divisions do indeed contribute to gap formation. In addition, when we compared the position of intestinal obstructions in larvae, we found that 25% of PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup><italic>; cdc-25.2(0)</italic> intestines had a continuous int1/int2 connection and a more posterior obstruction (new in Figure 6), compared to only 5% in PAR-6<sup>gut(-)</sup> larvae, suggesting that cell division contributes to the high frequency of intestinal obstructions at int1.</p><p>2) Remove PAR-6 from the intestine after the star cell divisions: The <italic>asp-1</italic> promoter drives intestinal expression (Tcherepanova et al. 2000) after the star cell divisions, beginning around the 2-fold stage. We made and expressed an <italic>asp-1p::zif-1</italic> transgene and observed its ability to robustly degraded PAR-6 after the star cell divisions at the two-fold embryonic stage (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1). 16% of these “PAR-6<sup>late gut(-)</sup>” larvae arrest in the L1 stage and have obstructed intestines, but none had an int1 obstruction, suggesting that removing PAR-6 after the star cell divisions allows a normal int1/int2 connection to form.</p><p>3) Modulate expression timing using heat shock: As suggested, we attempted to express ZIF-1 immediately after the star cell divisions using a heat-shock driven promoter (<italic>hsp-1</italic>p). We generated <italic>hsp-1</italic>p<italic>::zif-1</italic> transgenes, but unfortunately, these transgenes were too variable and leaky to interpret the results of these experiments with confidence.</p><p>Together, we believe that these new experiments strengthen our conclusion that PAR-6 is required to maintain MTOC continuity through cell divisions, and that cell divisions are an obstacle to apical continuity.</p><p><italic>2. A second and related question is whether PAR-6 and PKC-3 actually have a role during elongation itself. Two alternative hypotheses are that gaps take time to develop and would form eventually even in embryos that do not elongate; or that small gaps present initially are not revealed until apical domain area expands as cells change shape during elongation.

Using the <italic>asp-1</italic>p::<italic>zif-1</italic> transgene, we depleted PAR-6 in the 2-fold embryonic stage after the star cell divisions were completed (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1). As mentioned in the previous section, we observed L1 arrest and intestinal obstructions in elongating non-dividing cells in 16% of L1 larvae. This result suggests that PAR-6 continues to be required during embryonic intestinal elongation, and not only in the early stages of intestinal development. The observed defects were much milder than those caused by early depletion of PAR-6, however, which suggests that PAR-6 is required both during early and later stages of embryonic intestinal development.</p><p>We tried to block intestinal elongation to distinguish the time vs. elongation hypotheses.</p><p>We avoided the classic approach of inhibiting actin to block elongation (Priess and Hirsch 1986), because of the newly identified role for actin in anchoring microtubules in the embryonic intestine (Sanchez et al., 2021). Instead, we simultaneously degraded PAR-6 in both the intestine and in the skin. PAR-6 degradation in the skin was achieved using an “<italic>epiDeg”</italic> transgene (Wang et al., 2017) that would target the endogenous ZF-tagged PAR-6 in the skin and thereby block embryonic elongation (Totong, Achilleos and Nance, 2007). Unfortunately, the degree to which embryos arrested was highly variable, and embryo movement (an important criterion to ensure we were analyzing live embryos) introduced uncertainty in intestinal length measurements, particularly as embryos often stretched and contracted along their AP axis, causing the apparent length of the intestine to change along with it. We observed some arrested embryos with gaps becoming worse over the course of 1 hour and others with gaps remaining constant, but the variability and uncertainty in the degree of intestinal elongation arrest made us unable to confidently interpret the phenotypes, so we did not include this analysis in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Revisions requiring new data analysis</italic></p><p><italic>Figure 1: The data showing protein localization during star cell division would benefit from a temporal element: images of protein localization prior the onset of mitosis (or alternatively, images of a neighboring non-mitotic cell), should be shown to illustrate that proteins of interest localize apically during interphase and are then lost during division.
