at distance and fertilize pre-metastatic niches facilitating subsequent seeding by tumor cells. However, the link between EV secretion mechanisms and their capacity to form pre-metastatic niches remains obscure. Using mouse models, we show that GTPases of the Ral family control, through the phospholipase D1, multi-vesicular bodies homeostasis and tune the biogenesis and secretion of pro-metastatic EVs. Importantly, EVs from RalA or RalB depleted cells have limited organotropic capacities <italic>in vivo</italic>and are less efficient in promoting metastasis. RalA and RalB reduce the EV levels of the adhesion molecule MCAM/CD146, which favors EV-mediated metastasis by allowing EVs targeting to the lungs. Finally, RalA, RalB, and MCAM/CD146, are factors of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Altogether, our study identifies RalGTPases as central molecules linking the mechanisms of EVs secretion and cargo loading to their capacity to disseminate and induce pre-metastatic niches in a CD146-dependent manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>Ral GTPase</kwd><kwd>pre-metastatic niche</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

neighboring stromal cells is essential to sustain tumor growth and promote invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Follain et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, this communication allows tumors to indoctrinate their microenvironment and switch the phenotypes of various cell types, such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or immune cells to the benefit of tumor growth, invasion, immune escape and metastasis. Such communication occurs with organs distant of the primary tumors and favors the formation of pre-metastatic niches where the modified microenvironment can help settling metastatic tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peinado et al., 2017</xref>). Seeding of this favorable metastatic environment can be mediated by soluble molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaplan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) or by extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costa-Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoshino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>). EVs are lipid bilayered vesicles of nanometric diameters containing a complex mixture of RNA and protein cargoes, including a repertoire of surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mathieu et al., 2019</xref>). They can be directly secreted from the plasma membrane and called microvesicles or originate from an endosomal compartment, the multi-vesicular body (MVB), and then called exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>). The levels of circulating tumor EVs tend to correlate with tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galindo-Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Logozzi et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, inhibition of key components of the EV secretion machinery often correlates with decreased metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hyenne et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, Rab27a, which directs exosome secretion by controlling the docking of MVBs to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ostrowski et al., 2010</xref>), promotes breast and melanoma tumor growth and metastasis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bobrie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>) and predicts poor survival in human pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the levels of secreted tumor EVs, their content, and in particular their set of surface adhesion proteins equally orchestrates metastasis formation. For instance, the presence of tetraspanins CD151 and Tspan8 on the surface of pancreatic adenocarcinoma EVs favors metastasis in rats by enhancing their adhesive capacities and controlling their biodistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yue et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, integrin receptors exposed by tumor EVs dictate their organotropism and thereby tune/control the seeding of a premetastatic niche in specific and distant organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoshino et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, accumulating evidence show that both the levels and the content of secreted tumor EVs are instrumental in promoting metastasis.</p><p>However, the molecular mechanisms coordinating these processes remain elusive. In particular, how the machinery governing EV secretion can impact the pro-metastatic properties of tumor EVs deserves in-depth characterization. To address this issue, we focused on the members of the Ral family, RalA and RalB (collectively referred to as RalA/B), acting downstream of RAS and promoting metastasis of different tumor types in both mice and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gentry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yan and Theodorescu, 2018</xref>). We recently found that these versatile proteins are evolutionarily conserved regulators of exosome secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyenne et al., 2015</xref>). We originally observed that, in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Ral GTPase ortholog RAL-1 controls exosome secretion by acting on the biogenesis of MVBs. Importantly, we further showed that RalA/B modulate the levels of secreted EVs in models that are relevant to human breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyenne et al., 2015</xref>) suggesting that these GTPases could influence disease progression through EVs release. Here, we exploited 4T1 cells, an aggressive mammary tumor model that mimics human triple-negative breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaur et al., 2012</xref>) to further decipher how RalA/B tune EV secretion mechanisms and thereby control metastatic progression of the disease.</p><p>In this study, we first provide a detailed dissection of the impact of the Ral GTPases on EV secretion levels and unravel the mechanisms by which they control the homeostasis of MVBs. We have discovered that RalA/B directly acts through the phospholipase D1 (PLD1), which, as we show, also promotes EVs secretion, to favor the maturation of MVBs. We further demonstrate that RalA and RalB promote lung metastasis without affecting the invasive potential of breast carcinoma. Importantly, RalA/B are crucial for the organ targeting of tumor EVs, and, as a consequence, for the seeding of pre-metastatic niches. Finally, we identify the adhesion protein CD146/MCAM as a key EV cargo controlled by RalA and RalB and demonstrate that it conveys, in part, the pro-metastatic function to EVs by controlling the lung tropism of breast cancer EVs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RalA and RalB control exosome secretion levels through the homeostasis of MVBs</title><p>We have previously shown that RalA and RalB control EV secretion in aggressive 4T1 mammary tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyenne et al., 2015</xref>) that reliably mimics the aggressive phenotype of human triple-negative breast cancer. We thus built on this relevant tumor model and decided to test the hypothesis that RalA and RalB could orchestrate pro-metastatic functions by tuning the molecular mechanisms driving the secretion levels and nature of EVs. We first confirmed our initial observations with the nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA) of EVs released by 4T1 cells and isolated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 g pellet). Stable depletion of RalA or RalB by shRNA reduces by 40% the amount of secreted EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>), with no impact on their average size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). RBC8 and BQU57, two previously described specific chemical inhibitors of Ral GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yan et al., 2014</xref>) significantly reduced EV secretion levels in mouse and human mammary tumor cell lines (4T1, MDA-MB231, D2A1, and MCF7 cells) as well as in two other cancer cell lines, human melanoma (A375) and pancreatic carcinoma (Panc1) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Together with evidence previously obtained in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyenne et al., 2015</xref>), this demonstrates that the mechanisms by which RalA/B GTPases tune EV secretion levels are conserved throughout evolution and are notably at play in various cancer cell lines.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RalA and RalB control exosome secretion and multi-vesicular body (MVB) homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) Nanoparticle tracking analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 g pellet) from the supernatant of shCtl, shRalA, or shRalB 4T1 cells (<bold>a</bold>) or from various cell types treated with Ral inhibitors RBC8 (<bold>b</bold>, left) or BQU57 (<bold>b</bold>, right). 231: MDA-MB-231 cells.

Endogenous RalA and RalB localize mostly within CD63-positive endosomal compartments (MVBs and late endosomes), as well as at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Similarly, GFP-tagged RalA and RalB localize both in late endosomal compartments positive for Lysotracker and at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Therefore, in 4T1 cells, Ral GTPases localize both at biogenesis sites of microvesicles (plasma membrane) and exosomes (MVBs). To further determine whether Ral GTPases affect MVBs as previously observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we performed thorough electron microscopy (EM) analysis of endosomal compartments in 4T1 cells. In a first analysis of cells that were processed upon chemical fixation, we quantified the densities of (i) MVBs and (ii) endolysosomes, as well as (iii) the diameter of MVBs, (iv) the number and (v) the diameter of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) per MVB. Strikingly, we found RalA or RalB depletion leads to a 40% decrease in the number of MVB per cytoplasmic surface in 4T1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>), with no impact on the density of endolysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Further analysis of Lysotracker-positive compartments using FACS confirmed that RalA/B depletion has no significant effect on the late endosome-lysosome pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Besides, EM analysis revealed no differences in ILV numbers per MVB surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>), nor in MVB diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e</xref>). However, since chemical fixation is known to affect the morphology of endosomal compartments, we took our EM analysis one step forward by implementing high-pressure freezing (HPF) of cells, which better preserves the ultrastructure of endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klumperman and Raposo, 2014</xref>). A similar decrease in the number of MVBs per cytoplasmic surface in RalA and RalB knockdown cells was observed in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Upon HPF, we further observed a slight decrease in the number of ILVs per MVB surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>) that could be, in part, explained by a slight increase in MVB diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e</xref>). In conclusion, depletion of either RalA or RalB significantly reduces MVB number, while the remaining MVBs are slightly bigger. Overall, thorough EM analysis of intracellular compartments using both chemical fixation and HPF clearly demonstrates that both RalA and RalB control MVB homeostasis in breast mammary tumor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A RalA/B-PLD1-PA axis governs exosome biogenesis</title><p>We further investigated the molecular mechanisms controlling MVB homeostasis downstream of RalA/B GTPases. We decided to focus on phospholipases D (PLDs), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) into phosphatidic acid (PA), for three reasons: (1) PLD1 and PLD2 are two well-known targets of RalA and RalB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vitale et al., 2005</xref>), (2) PLD2 controls exosome secretion in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghossoub et al., 2014</xref>), and (3) PLDs impact cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruntz et al., 2014</xref>). We first verified that both PLD1 and PLD2 are expressed in 4T1 cells by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In the absence of efficient anti-PLD antibody for immunofluorescence, we decided to assess the subcellular localization of PLD-GFP fusion proteins. PLD1 mostly localizes to endosomal compartments positive for RalA, RalB, and lysotracker, whereas PLD2 mostly localizes to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether PLDs could function downstream of RalA/B to control MVBs homeostasis and exosome secretion using two chemical inhibitors, CAY10593 for PLD1 and CAY10594 for PLD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scott et al., 2009</xref>). EM analysis of 4T1 cells revealed that inhibition of PLD1, but not of PLD2, induces a 40% decrease in the number of MVBs per cytoplasmic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This phenotype is consistent with PLDs respective localizations and suggests that PLD1 functions in the RalA/B exosome secretion pathway. Further NTA analysis of treated cells showed that both inhibitors reduce EV secretion levels in 4T1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), suggesting that both PLD isoforms regulate EV secretion potentially through distinct mechanisms. Importantly, PLD1 inhibition fully phenocopies the effect of RalA/B GTPases depletion, both on the cellular density of MVBs and on the level of EV secretion. To determine whether PLD1 acts downstream of RalA/B, we looked at its localization in the absence of RalA or RalB. Confocal analysis revealed that in 40% of shRalA or shRalB cells, PLD1 is uniformly cytoplasmic instead of being endosomal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). By contrast, RalA/B depletion had no major impact on PLD2 localization at the plasma membrane (also its trafficking might be altered) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). This shows that RalA/B GTPases are required for PLD1 localization on endosomes. To further investigate if PLD activity is involved in Ral GTPases-dependent EV secretion, we performed a lipidomic analysis of secreted EVs. As PLD converts PC into PA, we focused on these two lipid species. Importantly, RalA/B depletion significantly reduces the PA/PC ratio of secreted EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). In particular, the PA/PC ratio made of mono- and di-unsaturated lipid species (36:1, 36:2, 38:1, and 38:2), known to be PLD product/target, respectively, showed a tendency to be decreased although not reaching statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). This further implies that PLD’s main product, PA, plays a crucial role in MVB homeostasis. Altogether, these results suggest that Ral GTPases control PLD1 localization on MVBs, which is required for local PA accumulation and ultimately for MVB homeostasis and exosome secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The RalA/B-PLD1-PA axis governs exosome secretion.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative confocal images of 4T1 cells co-transfected with PLD1-GFP and tdTomato-RalA (upper panels) or tdTomato-RalB (lower panels) and incubated with Lysotracker.

Briefly, 4T1 cells depleted or not for RalA or RalB were orthotopically grafted in mammary ducts, and several criteria were tracked over time. First, RalA and RalB have antagonist effects on tumor growth measured in vivo over time and ex vivo after 41 days: while RalA depletion significantly increased tumors growth, RalB depletion induced the opposite effect when compared to control tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Neither RalA, nor RalB affected apoptosis, using caspase3 as a read-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). In contrast, 4T1 cells depleted of RalA and RalB show increased growth rate <italic>in vitro</italic> and a decreased proportion of cells in sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c–d</xref>). A similar increase in proliferation rates was observed <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of RalA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Therefore, while depletion of RalA favors <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth by enhancing 4T1 proliferation potential, it is likely that additional non-cell autonomous factors are responsible for the decreased tumor growth observed upon RalB depletion.</p><p>We obtained the most striking result when carefully assessing the lung metastasis burden of these mice after 41 days. We measured the number and the surface covered by metastatic foci in serial lung sections and observed that RalA or RalB depletion in mammary tumors drastically reduced their metastatic potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). When compared to the tumor growth rate, the most dramatic reduction of metastasis was observed in the case of RalA depletion. These experiments show that although RalA and RalB have antagonist effects on primary tumors, they both promote metastasis. To dissect this phenotype, we tested whether RalA or RalB could impact inherent cell migration and invasion potential of 4T1 cells, as it had been reported for RalB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oxford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zago et al., 2018</xref>). We performed 2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) and 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>) <italic>in vitro</italic> invasion assays and observed no effect of RalA or RalB expression levels on motility potential of 4T1 cells. Therefore, RalA/B seem to promote metastasis independently of cell invasion and are likely to promote metastasis of aggressive breast cancer cells non-cell autonomously by inducing pro-metastatic micro-environmental changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>RalA- and RalB-dependent EVs induce endothelial permeability</title><p>Since RalA and RalB promote metastasis independently of their cell-intrinsic properties, we wondered whether they could control secreted factors that are likely to induce micro-environmental alterations. In addition to EVs, tumor cells secreted soluble factors can promote metastasis by modulating the microenvironment, notably by promoting the formation of a metastatic niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ombrato et al., 2019</xref>). To test this possibility, we examined the impact of RalA and RalB on the soluble secretome of 4T1 cells. Depletion of RalA or RalB had no drastic effect on the soluble factors secreted by 4T1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the secretion of one protein known to promote metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ombrato et al., 2019</xref>), WISP1/CCN4, is significantly decreased in shRalA/B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, RalA and RalB are likely to enhance metastatic potency by promoting the secretion of EVs and possibly as well through WISP1/CCN4. Furthermore, in addition to enhancing the levels of secreted EVs, RalA/B could alter their functionality. To test this possibility, we challenged the pro-tumoral function of RalA/B EVs in an in vitro functional assay.</p><p>Since tumor EVs are known to induce vascular permeability in the vicinity of tumors as well as in distant organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tominaga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Treps et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), we tested the capacity of RalA/B dependent EVs to promote endothelial permeability <italic>in vitro</italic>. When added to a monolayer of endothelial cells, 4T1 EVs increased its permeability in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>). We then tested the impact of EV content on vascular permeability by subjecting endothelial cells to similar amounts of EVs derived from 4T1 cells expressing or not RalA/B. Interestingly, endothelial monolayers became less permeable when treated with a similar amount of EVs derived from shRalA or shRalB cells. Similarly, such EVs fail to disrupt adherent and tight junctions by contrast to EVs derived from 4T1 control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) suggesting that EVs from RalA/B knockdown cells have reduced pro-permeability abilities. Therefore, depletion of RalA/B reduces secretion levels of EVs and leads to the secretion of EVs whose effect on vascular leakiness is hampered. The important observation that vascular permeability could be reduced upon depletion of RalA or RalB, and with a similar amount of EVs, prompted us to further dissect whether RalA or RalB could tune the priming of pre-metastatic niches.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>RalA and RalB control lung tropism of pro-metastatic tumor extracellular vesicles (EVs).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Effect of a similar amount of EVs on HUVEC monolayer permeability <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Since on one hand RalA and RalB positively control the levels and the functionality of secreted tumor EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a</xref>), and on the other hand they promote metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we tested a direct impact of RalA/B-dependent EVs on the promotion of lung metastasis. For this, we decided to directly assess the role of 4T1 EVs in priming lung metastatic niches in vivo, as previously described for other tumor EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costa-Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoshino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Priming of lungs with control EVs significantly enhances lung metastasis over 14 days when compared to PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). In striking contrast, priming of mouse lungs with a similar number of EVs derived from Ral-depleted cells did not promote metastasis. This key experiment demonstrates that RalA/B confer pro-metastatic functions to EVs, in addition to controlling their secretion levels. Indeed, the decreased metastasis observed in absence of RalA/B can result from either drastically reduced EVs secretion or diminished pro-metastatic potential of EVs. To unravel why EVs from RalA/B-depleted cells are unable to promote metastasis, we first determined their capacity to efficiently reach the lungs and prime pre-metastatic niches by tracking the dissemination of fluorescently labeled EVs that were injected in the blood circulation of Balb/c mice. We found that 1 hr after injection 4T1 EVs mostly accumulate in the lungs, as well as the liver and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These three organs are the main metastatic organs of 4T1 cells, and breast carcinoma, showing that the organotropism of 4T1 EVs mirrors the metastatic organotropism of their parental cells and further validates the relevance of our model to human pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lou et al., 2008</xref>). Through a careful analysis of cell types that internalize EVs in these conditions, we observed that 4T1 EVs mostly accumulate in endothelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts of the lung parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Importantly, EVs derived from RalA- or RalB-depleted cells failed to efficiently reach the lungs, even though similar amounts were injected in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e</xref>). Similar results were observed for EVs reaching the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Hence, we can conclude at this stage that RalA/B control the pro-metastatic properties of EVs by tuning their ability to reach vascular regions and local parenchyma and efficiently reach metastatic organs, thereby modulating the formation of a pre-metastatic niche.</p><p>The latter results raised the exciting hypothesis that metastasis impairment could be, in part, explained by a general defect in adhesion of circulating EVs at the vascular wall. We recently showed that EVs target specific vascular regions by first arresting at the surface of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyenne et al., 2019</xref>). We used two complementary models that allow careful tracking of single EVs and assessed early events of EVs internalization in endothelial cells. Using microfluidics, we found that internalization of 4T1 EVs within endothelial cells is decreased after 1 hr when they originate from RalA/B-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Similarly, upon tracking of fluorescent EVs injected in the circulation of zebrafish embryos, we observed that endothelial arrest/internalization of EVs from RalA/B knockdown cells is significantly hampered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Altogether, these experiments suggest that RalA/B knockdown significantly reduced the adhesive properties of EVs to the endothelium, establishing a potential link with their failure to accumulate in mice lungs. Furthermore, our results support a model in which RalA/B GTPases, in addition to promoting EV secretion, also control the pro-metastatic function of these EVs, likely by modulating their content.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>RalA/B promote CD146 EV loading for efficient lung targeting and pre-metastatic niche priming</title><p>These functional experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggest that the content of EVs can directly influence metastasis formation and that such content is likely to be impacted by RalA/B. Therefore, we carried out a careful and thorough molecular comparison of the cargo content of EVs derived from RalA/B-tuned cells. We first analyzed the RNA content of EVs using RNAseq and found that a large proportion of the RNAs present in EVs from shRal cells were different from the control (30–50%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> and 4T1 EVs contain a large number of proteins usually found in small EVs (77 of the top 100 proteins from Exocarta are found in 4T1 EVs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), such as tetraspanins, integrins, ESCRT proteins or small GTPases, such as RalA/B themselves. Importantly, many of these proteins are known to localize to endosomes, suggesting that some of these EVs are bona fide exosomes. Unexpectedly, comparison of the proteome of EVs secreted by RalA or RalB knockdown cells did not reveal major differences, as no protein is exclusive to one type of EVs. Instead, a small proportion of proteins showed differential expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Regarding their protein content, we noted that EVs from control cells are closer to EVs from shRalB cells (97 proteins with differential expression) than to EVs from shRalA cells (217 proteins with differential expression). We then focused on the five proteins over-expressed in EVs from shCtl cells compared to both EVs from shRalA and EVs from shRalB cells. These proteins are CD146/MCAM, Clic4, Glypican 4, BDKRB2, and Abcg2. We verified the expression levels of CD146/MCAM, Clic4 and Glypican4 by western blot of identical number of EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). While Clic4 and Glypican4 are significantly under-expressed in EVs from shRalA or shRalB cells, the long isoform of CD146/MCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>) showed a significant decrease in EVs from shRalA cells, and a tendency to decrease in EVs from shRalB cells, which was confirmed by anti-CD146 ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The hypothesis that Ral GTPases could control CD146 EV loading is further sustained by colocalization analysis. Indeed, by immunofluorescence, we observed that CD146 localizes both at the plasma membrane and in CD63-positive MVB/late endosomes in 4T1 cells, similarly to Ral GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Altogether, content analysis reveals that depletion of either RalA or RalB deeply affects the EV RNA loading and changes the levels of several key proteins.</p><p>We next interrogated whether the impact of RalA/B on the lung targeting and priming potential of EVs could be explained by its effect on the EV levels of MCAM/CD146. MCAM/CD146 (also known as Mel-CAM, Muc18, S-endo1, Gicerin) is an adhesion receptor overexpressed in various cancer types, including breast cancer, where it was shown to promote invasion and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, MCAM/CD146 is present on endothelial cells where it mediates the adhesion of several cell types, including the transendothelial migration of monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardin et al., 2009</xref>). Given, the known function of MCAM/CD146 in cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Yan, 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that it may, at least in part, be responsible for the lung tropism defects observed with EVs derived from RalA/B-depleted cells. To test the involvement of MCAM/CD146 in EVs adhesion, we treated 4T1 EVs with an anti-mouse MCAM/CD146 blocking antibody before injection in zebrafish or mouse circulation. EVs pretreated with MCAM/CD146 blocking antibody failed to successfully arrest on endothelial walls of zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>) and inefficiently reached the lungs in our mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Finally, we assessed the functional role of EV-bound CD146 in priming of pre-metastatic niches. To do this, 4T1 EVs were pre-treated with MCAM/CD146 blocking antibody (or with an isotype control) and injected intravenously, preceding tail-vein injection of 4T1 luciferase cells. Blocking CD146 on EVs significantly reduced their pro-metastatic potential. Therefore, inhibition of MCAM/CD146 precludes their lung accumulation and the subsequent formation of metastasis and thereby phenocopies RalA/B knockdown. These results demonstrate that MCAM/CD146, whose presence at the surface of EVs is tuned by RalA/B, is, at least partly responsible of the adhesion and lung tropism of 4T1 EVs. It further explains why EVs from RalA knockdown cells, which have reduced levels of MCAM/CD146, fail to reach the lungs efficiently. The pro-metastatic role of MCAM/CD146 is further confirmed by the analysis of a human cohort of breast cancer showing that its high expression is associated with worsened prognosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). Altogether, our work demonstrates that RalA/B, by controlling MVB homeostasis, promote the secretion CD146-enriched EVs, whose lung tropism sustains efficient metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The therapeutic limitations of breast cancer metastasis warrant a deeper understanding of its molecular machinery. Our findings highlight the exosome-mediated priming of metastatic niches by Ral GTPases as a critical requisite for lung metastasis during breast cancer progression. We show that RalA and RalB promote the secretion of exosomes by maintaining a high number of multi-vesicular bodies, likely through the PLD1-PA axis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RalGTPases favor the secretion of CD146-rich exosomes, which accumulate in metastatic organs, notably in lungs, where they establish premetastatic niches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>).

Our experiments suggest that RalA/B contribute to exosome secretion in several tumor cell lines, of different origins, implying that they might function pleiotropically over various cancers. Our results suggest that RalA/B and their effector PLD1 affect the levels of secreted exosomes by tuning the levels of cytoplasmic MVBs. While Ral GTPases, partially localized at the plasma membrane, could also affect microvesicle secretion, our data indicate that they function in exosome biogenesis upstream of PLD1. Similarly, a direct correlation between MVB density and levels of secreted EVs was recently suggested by studies showing that chemical or electric stimulation of MVB biogenesis results in increased EV secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanemoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). The formation of MVBs results from dramatic biochemical transformations of endosomes involving multiple protein and lipid switches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scott et al., 2014</xref>). Understanding the steps at which RalA/B and PLD affect this endosome maturation program is critical and remains to be fully deciphered. Our results from mice and <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggest that biogenesis of ILVs, which is a key step in MVB maturation and the initial phase of the exosome secretion pathway, could as well be controlled by RalA/B. Our work further identifies PLD as an effector acting downstream of Ral to control exosome secretion. Whether other Ral effectors contribute to EV secretion remains to be addressed. Interestingly, while PLD2 was found to impact exosome secretion by governing ILV biogenesis in a different breast carcinoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghossoub et al., 2014</xref>), our data rather suggest that PLD1 controls exosome biogenesis in 4T1 cells. Indeed, PLD1 localizes on MVBs and its inhibition, but not the inhibition of PLD2, decreases MVB density. Nevertheless, it should be noted that we measured EV secretion levels and MVB density based on PLD inhibition at previously-published high concentrations of the inhibitors (compared to their respective IC50) and that off-target effect can not be ruled out. By contrast, PLD2 is essentially localized at the plasma membrane of 4T1 cells and its inhibition reduces EV secretion suggesting that PLD2 could rather promote microvesicle secretion in 4T1 cells. Therefore, we speculate that RalA/B-PLD1 control ILV biogenesis in 4T1 cells, possibly through the regulation of PA levels. Alternatively, they could impact the homeostasis of a subclass of MVBs, for instance by controlling their stability or their degradation.</p><p>Priming of metastatic niches by (soluble or) EV-mediated factors takes central stages in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peinado et al., 2017</xref>) and identification of molecular machineries that underlie this condition could point to new therapeutic or diagnostic targets. Our study demonstrates that Ral GTPases enhance the formation of lung metastasis in mouse models, by promoting the secretion of exosomes within primary tumors, while RalA/B expression levels correlates with metastasis in human breast cancer. While the pro-tumoral activity of Ral GTPases was so far mostly attributed to their capacity to promote anchorage-independent cell growth (for RalA) or cell invasion (for RalB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yan and Theodorescu, 2018</xref>), we now show that Ral GTPases have additional non-cell autonomous functions, and that these functions are important contributors to metastasis. Indeed, in 4T1 cells, depletion of either RalA or RalB alters the levels, content and functionality of secreted EVs, without decreasing cell migration or proliferation. Depending on the cell type or the biological process, RalA and RalB can display redundant, synergistic or even antagonist activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gentry et al., 2014</xref>). Since RalA and RalB mostly share similar phenotypes regarding EV secretion, content and function, they likely function in the same pathway. Interestingly, both Ral proteins appear to be essential for exosome secretion, revealing that their functions are not fully redundant. Therefore, both GTPases are required for the generation of a specific subpopulation of EVs with enhanced pro-metastatic properties and further work is needed to fully unravel the downstream molecular pathways. With this work, RalA and RalB add to the list of proteins known to control exosome secretion and to affect tumor progression, such as Rab27a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bobrie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>), Alix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Monypenny et al., 2018</xref>), syntenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Das et al., 2019</xref>), and components of the ESCRT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mattissek and Teis, 2014</xref>). These studies demonstrate that the number of EVs secreted by a primary tumor is an essential element determining the efficiency of metastasis. However, it is important to keep in mind that all these proteins regulating EV trafficking, including RalA/B, contribute to tumor progression through both exosome dependent and exosome independent functions. Altogether, despite pointing to additional functions of RAL GTPases, our study is the first to identify new molecular machinery from its function in EV biogenesis up to its pro-metastatic function in breast cancer lung metastasis.</p><p>Priming of metastatic niches by EVs has, so far, mostly been attributed to increased levels of pro-metastatic EVs with pro-metastatic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bobrie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to controlling the levels of secreted EVs, we show that RalA/B affect their function by enhancing their capacity to induce endothelial permeability <italic>in vitro</italic> and pre-metastatic niches <italic>in vivo</italic>. These two observations could be linked, as RalA/B-dependent EVs could promote endothelial permeability locally in the primary tumor or at distance in lungs, thereby favoring both tumor intravasation and extravasation. Content analysis revealed that RalA/B control the identity and levels of RNAs and proteins present in secreted EVs. Interestingly, Ras, which is known to activate RalA/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gentry et al., 2014</xref>), also controls the protein and RNA cargo of tumor EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demory Beckler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenzie et al., 2016</xref>), although its effect on the levels of secreted EVs is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demory Beckler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenzie et al., 2016</xref>). As McKenzie and collaborators identified a MEK-ERK-Ago2 pathway downstream of Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenzie et al., 2016</xref>), it would be interesting to determine how this pathway connects with the Ral-PLD-PA axis described in our study. Among the few proteins significantly enriched in RalA/B-dependent EVs, we identified CD146, a molecule known to modulate cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Yan, 2013</xref>). We showed, using functional inhibition, that CD146 present on pro-metastatic EVs controls their lung targeting efficiency thereby impacting their biodistribution and niche-promoting function. Accordingly, we and others show that high expression of CD146 correlates with poor prognosis in human breast carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>). CD146 functions as an adhesion molecule involved in homophilic and heterophilic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Yan, 2013</xref>), promoting for instance monocyte transmigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardin et al., 2009</xref>). CD146 can perform trans-homophilic interactions via its immunoglobulin-like extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taira et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Taira et al., 2005</xref>). It also binds to extracellular matrix proteins or other transmembrane proteins, such as VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Yan, 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that CD146 affects the biodistribution and organ targeting efficiency of circulating tumor EVs by mediating their interaction with specific ligands present on the luminal side of endothelial cells of metastatic organs. Other adhesion molecules, such as integrins and tetraspanins were shown to affect the biodistribution of tumor EVs and ultimately the formation of metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoshino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yue et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the combination of these receptors at the surface of tumor EVs, combined with the differential expression of their ligands on endothelial cells throughout the organism will dictate their homing. More work will be needed to characterize this organ specific EV zip code and to identify relevant endothelial ligands for circulating EVs and develop inhibitory strategies to impair their arrest and uptake at metastatic sites. In addition, the presence of other cell types in the circulation, such as patrolling monocytes, which take up large amounts of circulating EVs, could also contribute to the accumulation of tumor EVs in specific organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyenne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Plebanek et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, other factors, such as the vascular architecture and hemodynamic patterns could be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Follain et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyenne et al., 2019</xref>) and the interplay between these mechanical cues and the surface repertoire of metastatic EVs should be a fertile ground for future research. Precisely dissecting the mechanisms by which tumor EVs reach specific organs would allow to understand the priming of premetastatic niches.</p><p>Overall, our study identifies RalA/B GTPases as a novel molecular machinery that regulates the formation and shedding of pro-metastatic EVs. We also discovered CD146 as an EV cargo whose targeting could inspire new therapeutic strategies to impact the progression of metastatic breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The establishment of 4T1 cell lines stably expressing shRNA against RalA, RalB, or a scramble sequence has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyenne et al., 2015</xref>). 4T1-Luciferase (RedLuc) cells were purchased from Perkin-Elmer.

A total of 20 mg samples were denatured at 95°C for 5 min in Laemmli buffer and concentrated in one stacking band using a 5% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was fixed with 50% ethanol/3% phosphoric acid and stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The gel bands were cut, washed with ammonium hydrogen carbonate and acetonitrile, reduced and alkylated before trypsin digestion (Promega). The generated peptides were extracted with 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid followed by a second extraction with 100% acetonitrile. Acetonitrile was evaporated under vacuum and the peptides were resuspended in 10 µl of H20% and 0.1% formic acid before nanoLC-MS/MS analysis.</p><p>NanoLC-MS/MS analysis. NanoLC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a nanoACQUITY Ultra-Performance LC system (Waters, Milford, MA) coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. The solvent system consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). Samples were loaded into a Symmetry C18 precolumn (0.18 × 20 mm, 5 μm particle size; Waters) over 3 min in 1% solvent B at a flow rate of 5 μl/min followed by reverse-phase separation (ACQUITY UPLC BEH130 C18, 200 mm x 75 μm id, 1.7 μm particle size; Waters) using a linear gradient ranging from 1% to 35% of solvent B at a flow rate of 450 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode by automatically switching between full MS and consecutive MS/MS acquisitions. Survey full scan MS spectra (mass range 300–1800) were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 70K at 200 m/z with an automatic gain control (AGC) fixed at 3.10<sup>6</sup> and a maximal injection time set to 50 ms. The 10 most intense peptide ions in each survey scan with a charge state ≥2 were selected for fragmentation. MS/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 17.5K at 200 m/z, with a fixed first mass at 100 m/z, AGC was set to 1.10<sup>5</sup>, and the maximal injection time was set to 100 ms. Peptides were fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation with a normalized collision energy set to 27. Peaks selected for fragmentation were automatically included in a dynamic exclusion list for 60 s. All samples were injected using a randomized and blocked injection sequence (one biological replicate of each group plus pool in each block). To minimize carry-over, a solvent blank injection was performed after each sample. EVs mass spectrometry was performed in triplicate.</p><p>Data interpretation. Raw MS data processing was performed using MaxQuant software1 v1.6.7.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). Peak lists were searched against a database including <italic>Mus musculus</italic> protein sequences extracted from SwissProt (09-10-2019; 17 007 sequences, Taxonomy ID = 10 090). MaxQuant parameters were set as follows: MS tolerance set to 20 ppm for the first search and five ppm for the main search, MS/MS tolerance set to 40 ppm, maximum number of missed cleavages set to 1, Carbamidomethyl (C) set as a fixed modification, Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term) set as variable modifications. False discovery rates (FDR) were estimated based on the number of hits after searching a reverse database and were set to 1% for both peptide spectrum matches (with a minimum length of seven amino acids) and proteins. All other MaxQuant parameters were set as default. Protein intensities were used for label-free quantification. The imputation of the missing values (DetQuantile imputation) and differential data analysis were performed using the open-source ProStaR software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wieczorek et al., 2017</xref>).

The article by Ghoroghi et al. is a very complete and thorough study of the role of 2 small GTPases, RalA and RalB, in extracellular vesicle (EV) release and breast carcinoma progression. The main advance of this manuscript is to describe a signaling role for the GTPases RalA and RalB in regulating phospholipase D (PLD) and multivesicular body function to regulate exosome biogenesis. They also show that RalA and RalB regulate expression of MCAM/CD146 on EVs, and that reduced levels of CD146 on EVs affects efficiency of lung cancer metastasis. Finally, they show RalA, RalB and CD146 levels are indicators poor prognosis for breast cancer patients. Overall these are interesting observations with clinical relevance. The study is extremely carefully performed, in general, with appropriate controls and conclusions. There are a limited number of weaknesses that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 3C shows that RALA and RALB have functions where they do not always act in series with each other. They may for exosome excretion, but not necessarily for proliferation. For Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, this experiment needs to be longer than 72 hours for a proliferation assay to be truly convincing. While interesting that proliferation results differ between mice and growth on plastic, a 10 day growth experiment would lead to greater conviction that this is a sustained difference. Figure 3D better agrees with Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, where loss of RALB gives greater proliferation over control, albeit not as great as RALA loss. Was Figure 3D performed at 12 days? The variable time points make it difficult to assess the role of RALA/B on growth.</p><p>2) Figure 4 carefully describes why RALA/B deficient EVs fail to prime regions for metastasis. As the EVs are not directed to those locations, the contents fail to increase permeability of the regions. However, statistically significant does not mean biologically meaningful; specifically, looking at Figure 4F and 4G, knockdown of RALA/B had little effect on EV internalization. One question that is not answered is whether RALA/B are acting in series or parallel. Concurrent depletion of both RALA and RALB in the types of experiment performed in Figure 4 would help answer this question. If depletion of both isoforms is greater than either alone, then it implies they act in parallel.</p><p>3) How are RALA/B activated in the context of 4T1 cells? The use of the RAL inhibitor in Figure 1B is most effective in cell lines without RAS mutations. Panc1 and MD231 cells have KRAS mutations, yet RALGEF inhibitors are least effective. At the concentrations used, all RALGEF activity should be inhibited. Is RAL expression levels similar between cell lines?</p><p>4) The logic for targeting PLD1 seems rushed. There are several RAL effectors, and while the data on PLD1 are compelling, it is unclear why only this effector was selected. Were other effectors tested? The Hyenne paper, which is cited throughout, provided stronger logic for connecting these pathways. The statement in the Discussion, &quot;Our work further identifies PLD as the most likely effector acting downstream of RAL to control exosome section&quot; is incorrect as stated. This work identified PLD1 as A downstream effector important for exosome secretion. To state that it is the most likely effector is an overstatement as no other RAL effectors were tested.</p><p>5) The use of either PLD inhibitor at 10 μm will have significant inhibition of both PLD1 and PLD2 regardless which inhibitor is being tested, as well as additional off-target effects. Given both inhibitors have nanomolar IC50 values for their specific PLD isoform and low μM IC50 values for the related isoform, these experiments are inconclusive as presented. This section of the text should be reworked to account for the lack of isoform selectivity at the concentrations of inhibitor used.</p><p>a) siRNA or shRNA could be used to validate the PLD1/2 inhibitor data.</p><p>6) In all cases when using inhibitors, there are no western blots or additional validation showing target inhibition in any cell line. In this case, the use of such high concentrations of inhibitor likely resulted in inhibition of the target proteins. However, such high concentrations often result in off-target effects. Determining the lowest efficacious dose to inhibit target function should have been performed and used throughout the experiments.</p><p>7) Would loss of MCAM expression, via direct knockdown, result in EVs that are unable to permeabilize HUVEC cells, as in Figure 4A/B? Alternatively, does loss of MCAM expression (or blocking via anti-CD146) result in decreased metastasis, similar to RALA/B knockdown? While Figure 5G shows a decrease in EV localization to lungs on treatment with Anti-CD146, the rate of metastatic lesion formation was not assessed when CD146 was blocked.</p><p>8) In a previous study (Hyenne et al., 2015) the authors already demonstrated a role for RalA and RalB in controlling MVB and EV secretion in the 4T1 breast cancer model, in a process evolutionarily conserved through nematodes. They also wrote a follow-up review article describing considerable evidence in the literature for RalA controling PLD and ARF6 function to control EV secretion. This diminishes the novelty and interest of the first part of the study, which could be reduced. The more novel and thought-provoking parts of the study are in the definition of the relationship between the RAL proteins and CD146, and the identification of unique properties of the exosomes produced in cells with manipulated RAL proteins (for instance, in regard to influencing exosome permeability). These could be better emphasized.</p><p>9) Almost the entire mechanistic model is based on the work of a single breast cancer cell line, 4T1, which has been described by some as triple negative. This is a significant weakness, as there may be features of that line that make it uncharacteristic of breast cancer in general. At least some of the key conclusions should be functionally confirmed in an additional cell model.</p><p>10) In addition, breast cancer cells fall into multiple different subtypes, which have different metastatic propensities and gene expression patterns. Is the functional relationship between the expression of RALA/B and CD146 in exosomes observed in just triple negative cells, or in other subtypes?</p><p>11) In Figure 5H, K-M analysis of TCGA shows a weak relationship between MCAM expression and survival. Were the tumors analyzed segregated by tumor subtype? Were data corrected for tumor stage? This is important, as the MCAM staining pattern may reflect a propensity for MCAM expression in tumors at a late stage, or subtypes with a poorer prognosis.</p><p>12) The authors provide observations suggesting that RalA and B control primarily the EV secretion pathway involving Multivesicular bodies, hence leading to exosome secretion. This is mainly demonstrated by observation of a decrease in MVBs upon knock-down of RalA/B, demonstrated by thorough electron microscopy analyses. This is correlative, rather than truly demonstrative, but the best one can do so far. In most experiments, the authors use EVs isolated by a relatively crude method, ultracentrifugation, that co-isolates non-specific components, and they do not analyse larger EVs that can be recovered at lower centrifugation speed, thus an effect of RalA/B on these non-exosomal EVs cannot be excluded. The EVs are only characterized by their number (NTA counting), which is not very precise, and not consistent with guidelines of ISEV (MISEV 2018, J Extracell Vesicles 2018, 7: 1535750).</p><p>Maybe the authors can argue that they did perform more complete analyses of their 4T1 EVs in a previous article? Did they use the EV-TRACK website to verify their experimental EV isolation and characterization set up? Of note, the authors also perform quantitative proteomic and RNomic analyses, which gives a better characterization of EVs. The protein composition and its change upon RalA/B KD could have been used to try to confirm (or not) the MVB origin of the EVs controlled by RalA or RalB, but it is not crucial for the message.</p><p>Alternatively, to demonstrate that the CD146-bearing EVs that carry the prometastatic function are bona fide exosomes, the authors could have shown its localization in the cells, upon or not RalA/B depletion, and show if a drastic change in ratio of localization in MVBs vs the PM occurs, but this would be an additional study, not necessary for the current paper.</p><p>13) The authors insist that RalA/B control exosome secretion, and discuss the bases and limitations of their demonstration properly. The summarizing schemes (Figure 2F and Figure 5I) of their model show the release of RalA/B-depent pro-metastatic exosomes, and RalA/B-independent exosomes which are not pro-metastatic. However, EVs that are released in the absence of RalA/B could instead be formed at the plasma membrane, and correspond to ectosomes. Nothing in this study demonstrates the origin of RalA/B-independent EVs, thus PM-derived EVs should be represented in the scheme.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61539.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 3C shows that RALA and RALB have functions where they do not always act in series with each other.

In details, while loss of RalA consistently shows a trend to increased growth in both conditions, loss of RalB shows a slight increase in cell proliferation in vitro but a reduced tumor growth in vivo. To better understand this discrepancy, we carefully analyzed the cell cycle of shRal cells by flow cytometry. We observed a significant decrease in the proportion of cells in the sub-G1 phase in shRalA cells compared to control, potentially explaining the overall increased proliferation observed in this condition. However, the proportion of cells in each phase of the cycle was similar in shRalB and shCtl cells. Overall, this analysis further illustrates the importance of in vivo experiments, and the difficulty to reconcile in vitro with in vivo situations (where microenvironment and non-cell intrinsic parameters are likely to significantly alter these behaviors and impact tumor growth). We have now included the cell cycle analysis in Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and mentioned it in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 4 carefully describes why RALA/B deficient EVs fail to prime regions for metastasis.

If depletion of both isoforms is greater than either alone, then it implies they act in parallel.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to split the reviewer’s comment in 2 parts:</p><p>1) how do we explain the relatively modest defects in shRal EVs internalization in Figure 4F/G (in vitro-in zebrafish) compared to the (more important) effect on metastasis priming (Figure 4D) ?</p><p>2) Do RalA and RalB act in series or in parallel?</p><p>Regarding the (i) first question, we would like to insist on two aspects that are likely to be driven by the inherent differences of the experimental approaches used: first, the shRal EVs targeting defects are stronger in mice lungs (Figure 4D/E) than in vitro (Figure 4F) or in zebrafish (ZF, Figure 4E). This read-out (targeting of EVS to the lung parenchyma) is not exactly comparable to the assays used in vitro and in ZF (internalization in an endothelium). Nevertheless, the experimental approach used in such homologous model is very close to the one used for the metastatic niche priming model. Interestingly, in both cases, shRal EVs show comparably high deficiencies (60-70% decrease) which demonstrates that EV targeting/internalization in mice is directly linked to its effect on metastatic niche priming. In contrast, while assessing internalization of EVs in HUVECs or ZF endothelium offers a level of resolution that can’t be reached in mouse models, comparing these different assays of EV internalization also suggests that the mechanisms involved in the internalization of circulating EVs in mice are more complex that the one taking place in heterologous systems. We hypothesize that HUVECs or ZF take up EVs in a less specific manner and are therefore less sensitive to targeting of specific adhesion receptors. Second, Ral depletion can affect adhesive-independent properties of breast tumor EVs able to influence premetastatic niche priming. Indeed, several proteins and multiple RNAs show alteration of their expression levels in shRal EVs (Figure 5A-D). Some of these cargoes could contribute to the formation of a premetastatic niche without affecting the adhesion properties of the EVs.</p><p>The (ii) second question regarding the potential redundancy of RalA and RalB has puzzled Ral experts for more than two decades. Depending on the context and biological effect, Ral GTPases can have redundant, parallel or antagonist functions. To address this question and determine whether RalA and RalB act in series or in parallel in EV secretion and function, we first generated 4T1 cells with a double knock-down (KD) for both RalA and RalB . We then determined how their co-depletion affects EV secretion. Co-depletion of both RalA and RalB further decreases EV secretion (when compared to single RalA or RalB depletion). To better understand how they could function, we decided to analyze the phenotypes of MVBs in double KD cells by electron microscopy (based on high pressure freezing). Here again, we observed that co-depleting Ral GTPases further decreases the density of MVBs in the cytoplasm when compared to single KD. Therefore, co-depletion of Ral GTPases worsens individual phenotypes, which implies that RalA and RalB act partially in parallel (or independent) ways. However, the decrease observed does not correspond to the sum of their individual depletion, suggesting that they still act on a similar exosomal secretion pathway.</p><p>Understanding precisely how RalA and RalB cooperate in exosome secretion and function would imply a much deeper epistatic analysis. While we have now initiated such analysis, which will certainly require a significant amount of work, we hope the reviewers understand that such analysis goes beyond this study. While we are thankful to the reviewers for raising and confirming this important question, we would like to ask for their understanding as we favor a more thorough analysis and thus exclude these incomplete data from the current study. At this stage, and without an extensive study, it is yet impossible to claim any definitive conclusion, which our future work will allow to solve confidently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How are RALA/B activated in the context of 4T1 cells? The use of the RAL inhibitor in Figure 1B is most effective in cell lines without RAS mutations. Panc1 and MD231 cells have KRAS mutations, yet RALGEF inhibitors are least effective. At the concentrations used, all RALGEF activity should be inhibited. Is RAL expression levels similar between cell lines?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the first question, we currently ignore how RalA/B are activated in 4T1 cells. However, we speculate that they could be activated by the RAS pathway, which is active in 4T1 cells and required for 4T1 cells aggressivity. Indeed, 4T1 cells express KRAS and HRAS (Xi et al., 2017; Hu et al., Nuc. Acid Res. 2019) and the RAS pathway is active in 4T1 cells, as assessed by BRAF and erk phosphorylation status (Phan et al., 2013). Importantly, both 4T1 migration abilities and tumor progression depend on KRAS expression levels (Xi et al., 2017; Booth et al., 2017).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s last question, we measured RAL expression levels in several cell lines by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Interestingly, the 4T1 cell lines thoroughly used in our study displays the highest Ral expression levels. In addition, as pointed out by the reviewer, a higher expression of RalA could explain that the effect of Ral inhibitors on EV secretion is higher in 4T1 cells than in Panc1 or MDAMD231 cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>RAL expression.</title><p>RalA and RalB expression assessed by western blots (Left in multiple cell types and quantified (Right).

Thus, while this reviewer is partly correct since we have only tested PLDs and not other Ral effectors, such decision had been carefully thought based on arguments that are described in the manuscript and summarized here.</p><p>Among all known Ral effectors, PLDs had been uniquely connected to exosome secretion, through the work of Pascal Zimmermann’s group (Ghossoub et al., 2014), and were therefore the most obvious candidates to be targeted. Interestingly, recent independent studies from Borel and colleagues confirmed that PLDs affect EV secretion levels in a Phosphatidic Acid dependent manner in prostate cancer cells (Borel et al., BBA 2020). While other Ral effectors (such as RalBP1, Filamin or exocyst) have, to our knowledge, never been shown to alter EV secretion, they are indeed potential additional candidates whose targeting would require additional work that would go beyond this study.</p><p>Taking this into account, we have now modified the way we introduce PLD1 and toned down our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The use of either PLD inhibitor at 10 μm will have significant inhibition of both PLD1 and PLD2 regardless which inhibitor is being tested, as well as additional off-target effects.

Unfortunately, these experiments failed as we did not manage to specifically detect PLD isoforms by western blotting using commercially available antibodies (data not shown).</p><p>Finally, to further demonstrate that we can indeed observe defects related to each PLD isoform, we subjected cells to decreasing concentrations of PLD inhibitors (in order to reach nanomolar IC50 values) and observed, as expected, a dose-dependent effect of the inhibition on EV secretion levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, see below, #6). These results show that EV secretion levels can be tuned with nanomolar concentrations of PLD inhibitors. Thus, although both PLDs are involved in controlling EV secretion levels (validated here), only PLD1 localization to endosome is perturbed in absence of RalA/B and thus responsible of Ral dependent EV secretion. Nevertheless, in the Discussion, we acknowledge the possibility of off target effects at high inhibitor concentrations.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Effects of PLD doses on EV secretion.</title><p>Each experiment was repeated three times on 4T1 cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61539-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In all cases when using inhibitors, there are no western blots or additional validation showing target inhibition in any cell line.

As suggested by the reviewer, we now used different concentrations of PLD inhibitors (10nM, 100nM, 1µM and 10µM) and analyzed their effect on EV secretion by NTA. As shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, there is a clear dose dependent effect, using both inhibitors. These results show that EV secretion levels can be tuned with nanomolar concentrations of PLD inhibitors. Thus, although both PLDs are involved in controlling EV secretion levels (validated here), only PLD1 localization to endosome is perturbed in absence of RalA/B and thus responsible of Ral-dependent EV secretion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Would loss of MCAM expression, via direct knockdown, result in EVs that are unable to permeabilize HUVEC cells, as in Figure 4A/B? Alternatively, does loss of MCAM expression (or blocking via anti-CD146) result in decreased metastasis, similar to RALA/B knockdown? While Figure 5G shows a decrease in EV localization to lungs on treatment with Anti-CD146, the rate of metastatic lesion formation was not assessed when CD146 was blocked.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and agree that such aspect is determinant to validate our model. In order to test whether blocking CD146 would tune tumor metastasis, we set out a challenging experimental approach allowing to explore the role of EV-bound CD146 in metastatic niches priming. To do so, we set up a classical “priming” experiment where 4T1 EVs are blocked with the anti-CD146 antibody. As shown in Figure 5H and Figure 4C, pre-injection of 4T1 EVs increases lung metastasis of 4T1 cells compared to PBS treatment. However, when pre-injecting a similar amount of 4T1 EVs treated with the blocking anti-CD146 antibody, we observed a striking reduction in lung metatstatic burden, nearing PBS-treated levels (14 mice per group in two independent experiments). This experiment solidly demonstrates that CD146, exposed at the surface of EVs and whose enrichment is tuned by RalA/B, is a key molecular determinant of EV-mediated metastasis. Together with our previous results, it strongly suggests that CD146 molecules present at the surface of tumor EVs favor lung colonization by EVs, likely by favoring binding to the endothelium, thereby allowing pre-metastatic niche formation. As this result provides a new and solid mechanistic insight into the molecular machineries tuned by RalA/B levels and thus consolidates and improves our earlier observations, we decided to add it in Figure 5I of our manuscript and discuss it in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In a previous study (Hyenne et al., 2015) the authors already demonstrated a role for RalA and RalB in controlling MVB and EV secretion in the 4T1 breast cancer model, in a process evolutionarily conserved through nematodes. They also wrote a follow-up review article describing considerable evidence in the literature for RalA controling PLD and ARF6 function to control EV secretion. This diminishes the novelty and interest of the first part of the study, which could be reduced. The more novel and thought-provoking parts of the study are in the definition of the relationship between the RAL proteins and CD146, and the identification of unique properties of the exosomes produced in cells with manipulated RAL proteins (for instance, in regard to influencing exosome permeability). These could be better emphasized.</p></disp-quote><p>We can’t agree more with this reviewer when he claims that the most novel aspect of our study is the relationship between Ral and CD146 levels and role on EVs. In turn, and with the newly added mechanistic data (Figure 5H), we’ve further put the emphasis on this novel aspect of our work.</p><p>Moreover, we wish to maintain the second additional exciting part of this work, which is the careful molecular and cell biological dissection of Ral function in exosome secretion. Our previous description of PLD involvement downstream of Ral (Hyenne at al, 15 + 16) was mostly speculative while, we now provide, within this manuscript, experimental evidences of the molecular links between Ral and PLD1. In the light of the new experiments, we have now modified the Abstract accordingly and have incorporated our latest results on CD146 in priming metastasis as Figure 5I (See Comment #7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Almost the entire mechanistic model is based on the work of a single breast cancer cell line, 4T1, which has been described by some as triple negative. This is a significant weakness, as there may be features of that line that make it uncharacteristic of breast cancer in general. At least some of the key conclusions should be functionally confirmed in an additional cell model.</p></disp-quote><p>With all due respect, we wish to point out that we also had observed that Ral inhibition leads to a significant decrease in EV secretion levels in pancreatic, melanoma and breast cancer cells (Figure 1B). Thus, together with our previous work performed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Hyenne et al., 2015), this suggests that the role of Ral in EV secretion can be extended is likely to be universal or can be at least extended to other models and is conserved in evolution. In addition, additional evidence had been obtained when correlating Ral levels with metastasis in our cohorts (Figure 3A, B) or via access to TCGA public databases (that contain various breast cancer subtypes, see #10), which further demonstrates that high Ral levels (or CD146) correlate with metastasis and poor survival. Thus, altogether, this demonstrates that our discovery can be extended to other breast cancer subtypes. While we appreciate that our in vivo mouse approaches are restricted to the TNBC 4T1 model, such experiments are heavy and challenging and should be seen as an advantage, rather than a pitfall of our work. Further in vivo experiments performed by us (or others) will provide additional insights on the universality of such pathway, but we humbly feel that this beyond the scope of this study. Finally, we now provide additional demonstration that Ral inhibition is effective in other model, including three other breast cancer cell lines (see Point 10; Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In addition, breast cancer cells fall into multiple different subtypes, which have different metastatic propensities and gene expression patterns. Is the functional relationship between the expression of RALA/B and CD146 in exosomes observed in just triple negative cells, or in other subtypes?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we analyzed the role of Ral GTPases in EV secretion by three other breast cancer cell lines with distinct characteristics: MCF7 (human, estrogen receptor<sup>+</sup>, progesterone receptor<sup>+</sup>, HER2<sup>-</sup>), SKBR3 (human, HER2<sup>+</sup>) and D2A1 (murine, estrogen receptor<sup>+</sup>, HER2<sup>+</sup>). In all cases, we found that Ral inhibition with RBC8 drug induces a significant decrease in EV secretion (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). This further demonstrates that all breast cancer types release Ral dependent EVs. This new data is now added as Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and the associated description added in the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Figure 5H, K-M analysis of TCGA shows a weak relationship between MCAM expression and survival. Were the tumors analyzed segregated by tumor subtype? Were data corrected for tumor stage? This is important, as the MCAM staining pattern may reflect a propensity for MCAM expression in tumors at a late stage, or subtypes with a poorer prognosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer recommendation and re-analyzed TCGA data, segregating the patients by tumor subtypes and by tumor stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). This analysis indeed revealed differences between tumor subtypes. High CD146 expression tends to correlate with decreased survival probability in three subtypes (basal, Her2+ and Luminal A) and with increased survival in one subtype (Luminal B). However, statistical significance was only reached for the luminal A subtype. Importantly, high CD146 expression correlates with a decreased survival probability in stage III breast cancer, while stages I and II are inconclusive, due to low patients number.</p><p>We performed similar analysis for RalA and RalB and found that elevated expression of both GTPases show a tendency to correlate with decreased survival in all breast cancer subtypes and stages (with the notable exceptions of basal subtype where high RalB correlates with enhanced survival and Luminal where no clear correlation is observed for RalB). In conclusion, at this stage, while Ral levels clearly correlate with poor survival, such correlation for MCAM/CD146 will require additional work.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Segmentation of TCGA data.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61539-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors provide observations suggesting that RalA and B control primarily the EV secretion pathway involving Multivesicular bodies, hence leading to exosome secretion. This is mainly demonstrated by observation of a decrease in MVBs upon knock-down of RalA/B, demonstrated by thorough electron microscopy analyses. This is correlative, rather than truly demonstrative, but the best one can do so far. In most experiments, the authors use EVs isolated by a relatively crude method, ultracentrifugation, that co-isolates non-specific components, and they do not analyse larger EVs that can be recovered at lower centrifugation speed, thus an effect of RalA/B on these non-exosomal EVs cannot be excluded. The EVs are only characterized by their number (NTA counting), which is not very precise, and not consistent with guidelines of ISEV (MISEV 2018, J Extracell Vesicles 2018, 7: 1535750).</p><p>Maybe the authors can argue that they did perform more complete analyses of their 4T1 EVs in a previous article? Did they use the EV-TRACK website to verify their experimental EV isolation and characterization set up? Of note, the authors also perform quantitative proteomic and RNomic analyses, which gives a better characterization of EVs. The protein composition and its change upon RalA/B KD could have been used to try to confirm (or not) the MVB origin of the EVs controlled by RalA or RalB, but it is not crucial for the message.</p><p>Alternatively, to demonstrate that the CD146-bearing EVs that carry the prometastatic function are bona fide exosomes, the authors could have shown its localization in the cells, upon or not RalA/B depletion, and show if a drastic change in ratio of localization in MVBs vs the PM occurs, but this would be an additional study, not necessary for the current paper.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed by this reviewer, we indeed partially characterized 4T1 EVs in a previous study (Hyenne et al., 2015). More precisely, we characterized and quantified 4T1 EVs (secreted by control, shRalA and shRalB cells) by electron microscopy and western blots using different markers (TSG101, CD63, Hsc70 and Alix). In the present study, we used a complementary quantification method, Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, to assess EV size and concentrations, and characterized the content of these EVs by mass spectrometry, RNA sequencing and lipidomics (measuring PC and PA levels). Therefore, we humbly disagree with the reviewer and rather think that we deeply characterized 4T1 EVs secreted by control and Ral depleted cells. Our data were indeed submitted to EV-Track during the revision process. Regarding the MVB origin of EVs secreted in a Ral-dependent manner, we agree with the reviewer that our observations are mostly correlative. We cannot fully exclude that some of these EVs could originate from the plasma membrane and we now acknowledge this in the manuscript.</p><p>However, the mass spectrometry analysis revealed a large proportion of endosomal proteins, and this aspect is now further emphasized in the Results section. Following the reviewer’s recommendations, we now carefully assessed the localization of CD146 in 4T1 cells by immunofluorescence. We found that CD146 is present both at the plasma membrane and in CD63+ MVBs/late endosomes. Since we had shown that both RalA and RalB colocalize with CD63 (Figure 1C), this suggests that CD146 present on EVs could originate from MVBs, where its loading would depend on Ral GTPases. However, as pointed by the reviewer, describing such trafficking in details would require an independent study. We have added CD146 endosomal localization in 4T1 cells in Figure 5—figure supplement 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The authors insist that RalA/B control exosome secretion, and discuss the bases and limitations of their demonstration properly. The summarizing schemes (Figure 2F and Figure 5I) of their model show the release of RalA/B-depent pro-metastatic exosomes, and RalA/B-independent exosomes which are not pro-metastatic. However, EVs that are released in the absence of RalA/B could instead be formed at the plasma membrane, and correspond to ectosomes. Nothing in this study demonstrates the origin of RalA/B-independent EVs, thus PM-derived EVs should be represented in the scheme.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and modified our scheme in Figure 2F accordingly. However, for the sake of clarity of our final take-home message, we would appreciate if the reviewers agree that we focus on exosome secretion (Ral dependent and Ral independent) in the final model from Figure 5J, and thus exclude Ral-independent microvesicles from this graph (as these have not been tested in our study).</p></body></sub-article></article>
