remains unclear. We studied this question in a grasshopper visual neuron that tracks approaching objects and triggers escape behavior before an impending collision. In response to black approaching objects, the neuron receives OFF excitatory inputs that form a retinotopic map of the visual field onto compartmentalized, distal dendrites. Subsequent processing of these OFF inputs by active membrane conductances allows the neuron to discriminate the spatial coherence of such stimuli. In contrast, we show that ON excitatory synaptic inputs activated by white approaching objects map in a random manner onto a more proximal dendritic field of the same neuron. The lack of retinotopic synaptic arrangement results in the neuron’s inability to discriminate the coherence of white approaching stimuli. Yet, the neuron retains the ability to discriminate stimulus coherence for checkered stimuli of mixed ON/OFF polarity. The coarser mapping and processing of ON stimuli thus has a minimal impact, while reducing the total energetic cost of the circuit. Further, we show that these differences in ON/OFF neuronal processing are behaviorally relevant, being tightly correlated with the animal’s escape behavior to light and dark stimuli of variable coherence. Our results show that the synaptic mapping of excitatory inputs affects the fine stimulus discrimination ability of single neurons and document the resulting functional impact on behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Schistocerca</italic></kwd><kwd>dendritic integration</kwd><kwd>neural computation</kwd><kwd>escape behavior</kwd><kwd>collision avoidance</kwd><kwd>neuroethology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMS-1120952</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabbiani</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-2021795</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabbiani</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY-002520-37</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabbiani</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The processing of light and dark contrast information for detecting impending visual threats within grasshopper neurons reveals new mechanisms of information processing in the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major goal of neuroscience is determining the mechanisms of neural computation – how is information processed within neural circuits and how cellular properties produce these abilities. Neurons receive information about the external world through the pattern of their synaptic inputs. So, determining how they integrate them is critical. For some tasks, such as assessing the presence of an impending threat, sensory discriminations must be quick and reliable for survival. In neural processing, there are trade-offs, though, between speed, high-resolution discrimination, and energy efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vincent and Baddeley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hasenstaub et al., 2010</xref>). Evolution presumably settles on solutions that trend towards minimizing energy expenditure while maintaining required processing abilities.</p><p>Individual neurons process information by discriminating between patterns of synaptic inputs impinging on their dendrites. Presynaptic targeting, dendritic morphology, compartmentalization, and active membrane properties all shape neuronal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Major et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lefebvre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hawkins and Ahmad, 2016</xref>). Many neurons, including the principal excitatory neurons of the mammalian cortex, pyramidal neurons, have distinct dendritic subfields proximal and distal to the site of spike initiation that receive functionally segregated synaptic inputs processed by distinct membrane conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behabadi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Major et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hawkins and Ahmad, 2016</xref>). In these neurons, the role of anatomical segregation within dendrites in integrating inputs from distinct neural pathways remains unclear.</p><p>In the visual system, neural channels transmitting information about luminance increases (ON) and decreases (OFF) constitute one key example of parallel pathways requiring integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Williams et al., 2021</xref>). Although luminance information is largely segregated between ON and OFF cells early on in the retina of mammals and in insect visual neuropils, real-world scenes involve a mix of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leonhardt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazade et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mulholland and Smith, 2021</xref>). The visual world contains more information in luminance decreases, particularly for smaller, faster objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leonhardt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Although the contrast statistics of approaching predators has not been determined, it is likely that they also contain more OFF than ON information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). How these pathways are integrated within individual neurons driving behavior remains unanswered, though.</p><p>To address these questions, we leveraged a well-studied, identified neuron in grasshoppers (<italic>Schistocerca americana</italic>) that receives ON and OFF inputs across three distinct dendritic subfields. It processes these inputs to detect impending collision, resulting in a spiking output critical to the generation of escape behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Shea and Williams, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabbiani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fotowat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). This so-called lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) neuron receives visual information from all ommatidia (facets) of the ipsilateral compound eye after processing in two intermediate neuropils. It is about as large as a human cerebellar Purkinje cell and its output is faithfully relayed by a second neuron, the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), to the cells coordinating escape jumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Shea and Williams, 1974</xref>).</p><p>The LGMD receives retinotopic medullary excitation from columnar projections to dendritic field A through the second, crossed optic chiasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strausfeld and Nässel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu and Gabbiani, 2016</xref>). Dendritic fields B and C receive non-retinotopic ON and OFF inhibition, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fraser Rowell et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strausfeld and Nässel, 1981</xref>). In particular, dendritic field C arborizes in a distinct sub-compartment of the lobula, called the dorsal lobula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Shea and Williams, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosner et al., 2017</xref>). The projections to field C arise from the dorsal uncrossed bundle (DUB), which contains a subpopulation of ~500 neurons with ~10° receptive fields impinging non-retinotopically to dendritic field C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouranton, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strausfeld and Nässel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elphick et al., 1996</xref>). More recent work has shown that the OFF inhibitory inputs to field C have wider receptive fields (~50°) and that only a small subset of the DUB axons likely encodes this inhibitory signal, raising the possibility that the DUB contains more than one type of projection to field C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>The LGMD distinguishes the coherence of dark (OFF) approaching objects through a retinotopic mapping of synaptic inputs onto compartmentalized field A dendrites and through intracellular processing by differentially distributed active conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). These include an H-conductance and an inactivating K<sup>+</sup> conductance localized in dendrites, as well as calcium and calcium-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> conductances localized close to the spike initiation zone (SIZ), and an M-type K<sup>+</sup> conductance presumably localized in the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peron and Gabbiani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018b</xref>). Little is known about the LGMD’s processing of ON inputs.</p><p>Using calcium imaging, electrophysiology, pharmacology, and modeling, we characterized a novel excitatory pathway to the LGMD for ON inputs. We show that the mapping of ON and OFF excitation to distinct dendritic fields has behavioral consequences. Further, we show that the mechanisms of ON–OFF integration within the LGMD’s dendritic arbor allows the detection of approaching objects of any contrast polarity, while maintaining in most cases selectivity for their spatial coherence. Finally, we show that the mapping of ON and OFF excitatory inputs on distinct dendritic subfields allows the implementation of coherence discrimination in an energy-efficient manner, suggesting integration principles likely applicable to other neurons, including within our own brains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Visual circuits are subdivided into ON and OFF pathways, but animals can face approaching threats that are light, dark, or a mottled combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strother et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branco and Redgrave, 2020</xref>). Although extensive work has investigated the role of OFF pathways in detecting impending collision, how ON and OFF signals are integrated to decide whether to initiate escape is unknown. We used grasshoppers that have well-characterized jump escape behaviors initiated by an identified neuron in the optic lobe to explore the neuronal integration of ON and OFF contrast polarities for collision avoidance.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Influence of contrast polarity on jump probability and timing</title><p>In grasshoppers and other species, there has been extensive research on the behavioral responses produced by black looming stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fotowat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heap et al., 2018</xref>).

This was quantified by measuring the range of peak times across subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Despite field C being subdivided into more dendritic subregions than field A, thus biasing it toward a larger range, it consistently had more synchronous activation of dendritic regions than field A. For 12 of 18 animals, all field C subregions had the same dF/F peak time in response to ON looms, and in no experiment did the responses suggest a retinotopic mapping of inputs to field C. Thus, the synaptic mapping of ON inputs onto field C is strikingly different from the previously described, ordered retinotopic organization of OFF synaptic inputs onto field A.</p><p>To further test whether the field C mapping was random, we computed the correlation between the response center of mass (CoM) and stimulus position for small translating stimuli. For field A, the CoM of dF/F moved across the dendritic arbor as the stimulus traversed the visual field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, blue lines). For all trials tested, the CoM position was correlated to stimulus position (p&lt;0.001). For field C, 9 of 21 trials had significant correlations between stimulus position and response CoM, but the CoM trajectories were short, winding, and inconsistent across trials within the same animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, red lines). A 80° change in stimulus position produced a mean shift in CoM of 3.5 ± 5.6 µm (mean ± SD) in one dimension and 1.6 ± 5.0 µm in the second dimension within field C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, right). In comparison, the same change in stimulus position resulted in a mean shift in CoM of 64.5 ± 25.8 µm and 84.3 ± 31 µm for the respective axes in field A. In addition to the smaller magnitude of CoM change, the direction of change was not consistent for either dimension within field C (p<sub>ST</sub> = 0.65 and 0.064 for the respective dimensions) unlike for field A (p<sub>ST</sub> = 0.0005 for each dimension).</p><p>We also compared the CoM trajectories to those of a pixelwise randomization of the responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, green and yellow lines). As expected, CoM trajectories in field A correlated very strongly with stimulus positions (mean correlation coefficients of 0.98 and –0.95) and were significantly different from random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Field C had weaker correlations (mean coefficients of –0.01 and 0.48) and along one of two axes the CoM trajectories were not different from a randomly shuffled version (p<sub>RS</sub> = 0.68 and 0.006). The nonrandom change was observed in the downward direction and was small (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, red lines). The animal with the strongest correlation between field C response CoM and stimulus position is shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>, where it is clear that the correlation is due to a spread in activation rather than activation of distinct regions. In summary, the mapping in field C appears nearly uniform across dendrites, except for slight variations at length scales smaller than 3.5 µm. This indicates that there is no retinotopic mapping of field C excitation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Absence of ON spatial coherence sensitivity in LGMD and behavior</title><p>What are the consequences of the non-retinotopic mapping of ON synaptic inputs to the LGMD? Earlier work showed that in field A both the retinotopic mapping of excitatory inputs and active dendritic processing are critical for grasshoppers’ ability to discriminate the spatial coherence of black looming stimuli, a computation akin to object segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). The large HCN conductance in field A that is necessary for discriminating spatial coherence of black looms is absent in field C, but it is otherwise unknown whether field C harbors active conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). We used electrophysiology to test whether the lack of retinotopy and HCN conductances in field C prevented discrimination of the spatial coherence of white looms. For this purpose, we used the same approach as previously used for black stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>).

We then randomly displaced each pixel at increasingly distant locations to obtain stimuli of decreasing spatial coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom). Indeed, and in contrast to black looms, the peak firing rate of the LGMD did not change with the spatial coherence of white looms. However, the responses during the last second before collision contained more bursts for incoherent looms, a change in firing previously found to decrease escape responses for black looms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Lack of spatial coherence preference for white stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top<italic>:</italic> schematic of looming stimulus.

Thus, this reduced ability to discriminate the spatial coherence of an approaching white stimulus is presumably due to the excitatory ON inputs impinging non-retinotopically onto field C and a lack of HCN conductances devoted to processing them there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-79772-video8.mp4" id="video8"><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>Example response showing a grasshopper jump escape in response to a white 20% spatially coherent looming stimulus.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Similar LGMD calcium responses for black and various mixed ON/OFF stimuli</title><p>So far, we have seen that ON stimuli excite dendritic field C non-retinotopically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which leads to a lack of selectivity for the spatial coherence of ON looms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). But many real-world predators would contain a mix of light and dark regions, which would excite both dendritic fields.

Moving the excitatory inputs from field A to C produced higher firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, dark red). Reducing the number of field C excitatory synapses by 60% without changing the amount of inhibition still produced as much firing as the field A excitation simulation. This was due to the relative electrotonic proximity of field C to the SIZ; consequently, the depolarization elicited by synaptic inputs in field C attenuates less as it propagates toward the SIZ. This was confirmed by additional simulations in which the axial resistance was increased between field C and the primary neurite, after which as much excitation was needed in field C as in field A to elicit the same response.</p><p>Calcium fluorescence showed that looms of all contrasts produced some excitation in both dendritic fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), so we next tested how the LGMD response changed with excitation split between the fields. For simulated looming stimuli, we varied the fraction of excitation distributed between the dendritic fields while removing 60% of the field C inputs since this achieved the same firing output regardless of dendritic field input assignment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The more evenly the inputs were split between the fields, the larger the resulting neural response was (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, splitting of excitation between fields A and C maximizes its effectiveness at triggering LGMD spiking.</p><p>ON synaptic inputs show no retinotopy and are distributed throughout dendritic field C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). Yet, dendritic field C is sufficiently large electrotonically to allow for an approximate retinotopic mapping. Unlike field A, though, its shape does not match that of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peron et al., 2007</xref>), and is not consistent across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consequently, there is no obvious visual input projection scheme leading to a retinotopic mapping in field C. Yet, retinotopy in field C would cause early excitation from a loom to be clustered and then spread across the dendrites from a central point. To test whether the lack of approximate retinotopy changed the LGMD’s output, we simulated such clustered excitatory inputs that spread across field C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that looming excitation in field C with a similar spatial extent as that of field A reduced firing by 15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). A narrower clustering of inputs further reduced responses. Notably, the observed reduction in loom responses translated into changes in escape behavior in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fotowat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>).</p><p>In earlier simulations, inputs to field A also produced larger responses when the retinotopic mapping was changed to a random one, provided the active membrane conductances responsible for coherence discrimination were removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). Thus, in the absence of active membrane conductances, random synaptic localization of ON inputs in field C is more effective at triggering LGMD spiking than one approximating retinotopy. The biophysical explanation for this observation is that the more clustered synaptic inputs cause a larger reduction in synaptic current resulting from a decrease in driving force.</p><p>The LGMD remains sensitive to the spatial coherence of checkered stimuli despite a substantial fraction of excitation impinging on field C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To test whether the model reproduced this result, we simulated checkered looms of different coherence levels. In these simulations, excitation from OFF checkered regions impinged on field A and ON regions excited field C. The model reproduced the decreased firing and increased bursting of spatially incoherent stimuli seen in experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The overall spatial coherence preference was qualitatively similar in model and experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This confirms that for these mixed contrast stimuli, the retinotopic mapping and active filtering of field A produces spatial coherence selectivity even when 50% of the excitatory inputs are removed from field A.</p><p>Based on these simulation results, ON excitation impinging onto field C produces energetic savings compared to the previously hypothesized retinotopic mapping to field A. Considering the 60% reduction in excitatory inputs to field C due to their proximity to the SIZ, this represents a 30% total input reduction without losing sensitivity to spatial coherence for textured stimuli. As solid black looming stimuli partially excite field C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the simulations suggest that energetic savings of ~10% for black stimuli still generate the same spiking output. Stimuli with a mix of ON and OFF inputs would also benefit from higher savings than if all excitation impinged on field A.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Dendritic segregation of ON/OFF excitation shapes looming detection and escape behavior</title><p>We investigated a looming-sensitive neuron that integrates ON and OFF inputs and responds to approaching objects with a characteristic firing profile invariant to object contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simmons and Rind, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gabbiani et al., 2001</xref>). Although the LGMD neuron responds to either white or black approaching objects, whether grasshoppers escape from both was previously untested. We found that animals escaped from simulated white objects approaching a collision course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) even if their spatial coherence was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The behavioral and physiological responses generally occurred slightly earlier for ON than OFF or checkered stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Our results suggest that the ability to detect and respond to white objects but not to discriminate their spatial coherence is due to a previously unknown segregation of ON and OFF excitation and their distinct mapping onto separate dendritic fields. In previous experiments, relatively little attention was devoted to white looms, and there has been no test on the role of the LGMD in producing such escapes in contrast to that established for black stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fotowat et al., 2011</xref>). That the behavioral timing and coherence selectivity both match LGMD response changes suggests that the LGMD is initiating the jump escapes from both white and black looms.</p><p>Unlike the previously described OFF excitatory inputs that are retinotopically mapped with high precision on dendritic field A, the ON excitatory inputs impinge non-retinotopically onto field C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Although it is not known whether field C is passive, it lacks the HCN channels present in field A that were found to be necessary for the animal’s behavioral selectivity to the spatial coherence of black approaching stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate the computational and behavioral consequence of distinct dendritic synaptic input mappings and active conductance localization.</p><p>As real approaching predators likely exhibit nonuniform visual contrast, we also tested responses to stimuli with a mix of ON and OFF regions. Checkered stimuli produced responses very similar to solid black stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The LGMD was responsive to checkered stimuli and discriminated their spatial coherence, demonstrating that only part of the excitation needs to impinge retinotopically onto field A to evoke selective escape responses. The visual detection of approaching predators is believed to rely more on OFF than ON information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, the neural and behavioral selectivity for the spatial coherence of black and checkered stimuli but not white ones indicates that grasshoppers can discriminate the spatial patterns of real-world threats.</p><p>Although we cannot experimentally test the behavioral response of an animal lacking field C from the LGMD, another looming-sensitive neuron laying adjacent to the LGMD called the LGMD2 provides some insight. The LGMD2 has a dendritic field A of the same size and shape as that of the LGMD but lacks analogous fields B or C. It responds with a strong preference to dark objects and exhibits limited ability to detect white approaching stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simmons and Rind, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rind and Leitinger, 2000</xref>). This further suggests the necessity of the additional dendritic field and its ON excitatory inputs for the LGMD’s detection of impending collisions independent of contrast polarity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interpretation of calcium fluorescence</title><p>Both ON and OFF pathways excite the LGMD through calcium-permeable nAChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peron et al., 2009</xref>). This allowed characterization of the functional segregation between fields with an intracellularly injected fluorescent calcium indicator (‘Methods’). The exact relationship between the amount of synaptic excitation and dF/F remains unknown but does not affect qualitatively our interpretation of experimental results. The intracellular injection of the fluorescent dye typically yields an uneven fluorescence distribution within and between cells. This likely contributed to the variability observed across animals for ON vs. OFF selectivity in fields C and A, respectively (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Thus, the dF/F values indicate a general activity level of the dendrites, dependent on a combination of pre- and postsynaptic properties.

In the lamina of the insect optic lobe, the large monopolar cells L1, L2, and L3 postsynaptic to photoreceptors respond differently to luminance and contrast changes of either polarity and distribute this information to ON and OFF neuron classes downstream that become increasingly selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strother et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).

These observations stem from studies in vinegar flies under steady-state luminance conditions. However, during ON and OFF looming the mean luminance level is rapidly changing.</p><p>It remains unknown how this affects ON and OFF contrast selectivity in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>a fortiori</italic> in <italic>S. americana</italic>. It is nonetheless safe to assume that contrast selectivity will be decreased under such conditions. Notably, we found a weaker contrast selectivity to looming stimuli in field C than in field A, mirroring the coarser spatial resolution expected in the excitatory projection to field C. Further, contrast selectivity was improved for both ON and OFF flashes that occurred after the loom when luminance was constant for 2 s, a condition that better approximates steady-state conditions. In summary, although contrast selectivity is weaker in field C than in field A and remains to be fully characterized under the various stimulation conditions of this study, the most parsimonious explanation for responses of dendritic fields A and C to white and black stimuli is that they receive predominantly OFF and ON inputs, respectively, but that neither pathway is wholly selective for contrast polarity.</p><p>In both insects and mammals, the OFF pathway is more sensitive to fast movement than the ON pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leonhardt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazade et al., 2019</xref>). In mammals OFF neurons are biased toward central vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mulholland and Smith, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Williams et al., 2021</xref>). In insects, the columnar organization of the optic lobe likely produces an equal distribution of ON and OFF neurons. The central bias in mammals is related to the smaller receptive fields of OFF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazade et al., 2019</xref>). In the grasshopper, the excitatory OFF inputs to field A of the LGMD have the same spatial resolution as the eye (~2°; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones and Gabbiani, 2010</xref>). Feedforward inhibitory inputs to field C have lower resolution with receptive fields tenfold larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). The similarities of contrast polarity encoding between taxa likely result from visual processing being tuned to the statistics of natural scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark and Demb, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>As this is the first report of ON excitation to field C, the inputs have not yet been characterized and little is known about the presynaptic circuitry.

The DUB that projects to field C contains ~500 neurons that were previously believed to convey feedforward inhibitory input. Since inhibitory input is conveyed by a small set of neurons with larger receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>), these DUB neurons are likely conveying the ON excitation described herein.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of local integration of inhibitory and excitatory inputs in LGMD processing</title><p>Before this study, the LGMD was believed to integrate excitation and inhibition in separate dendritic subfields. That field C receives both excitatory and inhibitory inputs now raises questions about their local integration. Inhibition during a looming stimulus is thought to act mainly through shunting of the membrane resistance. Hence, the influence of OFF inhibition to field C will remain effective even if field C is somewhat excited during an OFF loom. Further, pharmacological block of field C inhibition showed that it mostly influences firing at the end of a loom when it causes the LGMD to stop firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gabbiani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gabbiani et al., 2005</xref>). This termination of firing is thought to be important for triggering escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fotowat et al., 2011</xref>). Assuming that the selectivity of inhibition for ON/OFF polarity is similar to what we observed for excitation, the local integration of inhibition and excitation within field C might contribute to the earlier response peaks for ON looms. Future characterization of ON inhibition and the contrast selectivity of the inhibitory inputs will allow a more detailed examination of this topic.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Energy costs of looming detection</title><p>The nervous system is an energetically expensive organ, estimated to consume over 20% of calories in humans.

Neuronal energy expense increases with cell size, membrane conductance, and active conductances that pass Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> at rest, all of which suggests the LGMD is likely energetically expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hasenstaub et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niven, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhukov et al., 2019</xref>). Excitatory synaptic transmission contributes greatly to this energetic cost, accounting for about 2/3 of the brain’s total ATP consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sibson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niven, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhukov et al., 2019</xref>).

Thus, reducing the number of synaptic events needed to detect an approaching object could potentially generate large energetic savings.</p><p>We estimated the energetic cost of looming-evoked excitation from currents within the model. The model EPSPs carried an average charge of 0.34 pC (see ‘Methods’). A simulated black loom had 80,000 EPSPs within field A, for a total charge of 27 nC or 1.7 • 10<sup>11</sup> ions (after multiplication by Avogadro’s number and division by Faraday’s constant). The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump expels three Na<sup>+</sup> ions per ATP molecule, so if all excitatory current was from Na<sup>+</sup>, 5.7 • 10<sup>10</sup> ATP molecules would be required to pump them out. Some excitatory current is passed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Accounting for the efficiency of the Na/Ca exchanger (one Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion per ATP molecule), our final estimate of energetic expense of a loom with all excitation impinging on field A is 6 • 10<sup>10</sup> ATP molecules. Modeling showed that moving all inputs from field A to field C allows a 60% reduction in excitation while generating the same output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), corresponding to a savings 3.6 • 10<sup>10</sup> ATP molecules per loom if all excitation impinged on field C and half that for split excitation. The estimate of ATP expenses was confirmed using two alternative ways of calculation (see ‘Methods’).</p><p>These energetic savings are due to field C inputs impinging closer to the site of spike initiation. Further, this estimate assumes that the presynaptic circuitry for ON and OFF inputs expends equal amounts of energy and neglects differences in dendritic processing. As the ON inputs likely comprise fewer neurons, the energetic savings from moving some excitation to field C are likely higher than estimated here. The LGMD receives excitatory inputs from a full hemifield of view triggering a sustained rate of visually elicited and spontaneous excitation, so the savings would not be limited to synaptic excitation caused by approaching predators.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Functional significance of synaptic mapping within dendrites</title><p>The additional energetic costs of OFF excitation to field A raise the question of why the LGMD would not have all inputs excite the more proximal field C. The proposed answer lies in the stark difference in selectivity of responses to ON and OFF stimuli. While the LGMD responds to white looms and the animals jump to escape them, the response is not selective to the spatial coherence of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As escaping predation requires not just detecting threats, but discriminating them from nonthreatening stimuli, spatial coherence selectivity is likely critical for survival. As of yet, there has been no examination of whether mammalian looming-detection circuits are sensitive to stimulus spatial coherence or how they integrate inputs from ON and OFF pathways. Mice have a stronger behavioral response to black looms and looming-sensitive neurons in the superior colliculus show a preference for OFF inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branco and Redgrave, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Within the LGMD, the OFF pathway excites in precise retinotopic manner a distal dendritic field with large HCN and inactivating K<sup>+</sup> conductances that enable discrimination of spatiotemporal input patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu and Gabbiani, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). Conversely, the ON pathway results in non-retinotopic excitation of a proximal dendritic field lacking these active channels. Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels, and M-type K<sup>+</sup> channels that control bursting and spike-frequency adaptation are located close to the SIZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peron and Gabbiani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018b</xref>). The more distal position of field A makes integration within its dendrites further removed from the influence of these conductances and more dependent on the channels localized within it. The increased electrotonic distance from the SIZ also increases the resolving power of dendritic integration in response to synaptic input patterns since more excitatory inputs are required to generate action potentials.</p><p>The combination of reduced energy cost of field C inputs with increased discrimination by active processing in field A suggests a possible general principle for dendritic mapping whereby finer discriminations of the synaptic input pattern are implemented in distal, active dendrites while coarser discriminations are implemented by proximal dendrites. Additionally, having excitatory inputs spread between dendritic regions offers energetic savings of its own as concentrating inputs reduces the driving force of the activated receptor channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Examination of integration in neocortical or hippocampal pyramidal neurons that contain distinct dendritic regions and segregated inputs may provide a test for the generality of this mapping principle.</p><p>Within hippocampal pyramidal neurons, distal CA1 dendrites receive excitation from entorhinal cortex while proximal dendrites are excited by inputs from CA3. These dendritic regions also have distinct sets of active channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spruston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lefebvre et al., 2015</xref>). An alternative hypothesis to that put forth above suggests that proximal excitation is the primary driver of spiking while distal excitation is modulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behabadi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hawkins and Ahmad, 2016</xref>). The two ideas are not incompatible, though. Active processing in distal dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons can produce fine discrimination of the spatiotemporal pattern of excitatory inputs even if dendritic compartmentalization and the location-dependence of synaptic integration are variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poirazi and Papoutsi, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Within cortex, feedback from higher cortical areas excites the distal apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons that also have increased active conductances that can produce fine discrimination of distal inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuman et al., 2021</xref>). It has been suggested that the dendritic segregation of feedforward and feedback cortical inputs might underlie the comparison of sensory (bottom-up) inputs with top-down predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larkum, 2013</xref>). In this context, our work suggests that distal feedback inputs might allow a finer discrimination of top-down than proximal bottom-up inputs. Within each neuron type, evolution presumably constrains the energetic costs of neural signaling required for dynamic, nonlinear computations. Systems in which we can simultaneously examine membrane properties, behavioral function, and dendritic mapping are crucial for discovering the underlying biophysical mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation</title><p>The experimental procedures used have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Experiments were conducted on adult <italic>S. americana</italic> grasshoppers 1–4 weeks after their final molt that were housed in a crowded laboratory colony. Preference was given to larger females ~3 weeks after final molt that were alert and responsive. Animals were selected for health and size without randomization. For calcium imaging, the head was opened to expose the brain and optic lobes. After removing the sheath protecting the right optic lobe, the calcium indicator Oregon Green Bapta (OGB-1) was injected by iontophoresis into the LGMD with sharp intracellular electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu and Gabbiani, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). The amplitude and duration of current steps for OGB-1 iontophoresis were manually adjusted to produce a dim stain of the entire dendritic arbor. The variability in injection locations and baseline fluorescence levels produced a wide range of signal strengths across animals, with lower baseline fluorescence producing larger signal-to-noise ratios under visual stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>For the pharmacology experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, ACh was delivered by iontophoresis to three animals and mecamylamine was pressure ejected to seven animals. In both application methods, drugs were applied to field C, but the pressure injection of mecamylamine caused spread to the dorsal half of field A while ACh iontophoresis remained localized close to the tip of the delivery pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Imaging</title><p>Calcium fluorescence was imaged with a CCD camera as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Images were captured through a ×16/0.8 numerical aperture (NA) water immersion objective lens (CFI75 LWD 16XW, Nikon Instruments) and saved at 5 Hz with a Rolera XR camera (Qimaging, Surrey, BC, Canada). The image resolution was 696 × 520 pixels and was saved as lossless 12-bit motion JPEG movies. The spatial resolution of the images was 0.9 µm per pixel. Experiments in which no change in OGB-1 fluorescence was seen in response to looming stimuli were excluded from analysis; this happened when too much OGB-1 was injected and the signal saturated or if not enough OGB-1 was injected to detect signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Visual stimulation</title><p>For calcium imaging experiments, visual stimuli were generated with the Psychtoolbox (PTB-3) and MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). A digital light processing projector (DLP LightCrafter 4500, Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX) displayed stimuli on a screen (nonadhesive stencil film, 0.1 mm thick) placed 20 mm from the right eye. The right eye was exposed, and the head and neck were submerged in saline. A mechanical brain holder was placed under the optic lobe to prevent movement perpendicular to the imaging plane. The DLP was programmed in pattern sequence mode to display 6-bit green-scale images with a refresh rate of 240 Hz and a 912 × 1140 pixel resolution.</p><p>For behavior and electrophysiology data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, visual stimuli were generated by custom C software from a QNX4 computer and displayed on a CRT monitor with a 200 Hz refresh rate at a 640 × 480 pixel resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabbiani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). Stimuli for all experiments were displayed with 6-bit resolution luminance values. For behavioral experiments, looming stimuli had an <italic>l</italic>/|<italic>v</italic>| of 40, 80, or 120 ms, and for calcium imaging stimuli with <italic>l</italic>/|<italic>v</italic>| = 100 or 120 ms were used. The spatial coherence of looming stimuli was reduced by pixelating the stimuli into 2.5° regions and adding a spatial jitter to these coarse pixels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). For behavioral tests of coherence selectivity, the stimuli had an <italic>l</italic>/|<italic>v</italic>| = 80 ms, and for the DCMD recordings an <italic>l</italic>/|<italic>v</italic>|=50ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavior experiments</title><p>Jump experiments were conducted as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fotowat and Gabbiani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). Adult grasshoppers of both sexes were used, and animals were presented stimuli in pseudo-random order, with at least 10 min between trials. Individual animals were presented up to 50 stimulus trials over up to 2 weeks of testing. Animals that did not jump to any stimuli were excluded from analysis. Trials in which the animal moved from the platform and did not see the stimulus were excluded from analysis. Videos were recorded with a high-speed digital video camera (GZL-CL-22C5M; Teledyne Flir), equipped with a variable zoom lens (M6Z 1212-3S; Computar, Cary, NC). Image frames were recorded at 200 frames per second with the acquisition of each frame synchronized to the vertical refresh of the visual stimulation display (Xtium-CL PX4; Teledyne Flir). Videos were made from the 12-bit images and saved in lossless motion JPEG format using custom MATLAB code.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Sample sizes were not predetermined before experiments. All data analyses were carried out with custom MATLAB code (MathWorks). For calcium fluorescence, data was saved in either uncompressed AVI or lossless motion JPEG format using MATLAB’s Image Acquisition toolbox. Most trials had no motion artifacts, but when present, translational motion artifacts were corrected by aligning dendritic locations across frames using the ‘imregcorr’ function of MATLAB’s Image Processing toolbox. After any motion correction, videos were median filtered with a 3 × 3 pixel window to reduce noise. Fluorescence change (dF) was normalized to the baseline fluorescence (F), calculated as the average value in the 2 s before stimulus presentation to calculate dF/F. An example of the movement artifact can be seen in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>; in the raw data, there is translational movement due to breathing that was corrected before calculation of the dF/F. In some trials, the baseline fluorescence changed over time even in the absence of visual stimuli and a linear fit to the fluorescence time course before stimulus presentation was subtracted instead of a single value. Every trial was manually checked to confirm the change in fluorescence before any further data processing.</p><p>All regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn freehand, and the reported dF/F is the mean value of all pixels within the selected region. The period from the start of looming stimuli until 1 s after the end of expansion was considered the looming response. For post-loom flashes, the peak dF/F of the flash response was measured as the difference between the maximum dF/F within 1.5 s after the flash minus the minimum dF/F in the 1 s before the flash.</p><p>For testing whether there was a retinotopic mapping of inputs in field C, the center of mass of the dF/F within a dendritic field was calculated for each frame during the 4 s that the bar was moving using MATLAB’s image processing toolbox (using the ‘weighted centroid’ property of ‘regionprops’). The trajectory of the center of mass was then compared to the stimulus position at each corresponding time. To test the randomness of this mapping, each pixel of the dF/F within the dendritic field was randomly redistributed and the center of mass trajectory was recalculated.</p><p>The box plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4I</xref> are displayed as follows. The central mark indicates the median, and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. The whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers (more than 1.5 times than interquartile range beyond the extent of the box), and the outliers are plotted individually using the ‘+’ symbol.</p><p>For statistical tests between jump probabilities, we used Fisher’s exact test to compare responses across stimulus speed and contrast. The timing of jump behavior was tested with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Paired comparisons of peak dF/F between dendritic fields or within dendritic fields for different stimulus polarities were made using a two-sided sign test. Comparisons across more than two stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) were made with the Kruskal–Wallis test, a nonparametric version of the classical analysis of variance (indicated by KW in text). All correlations were computed using Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Neuronal modeling</title><p>We adapted a detailed biophysical LGMD model within the NEURON simulation environment that successfully reproduces many properties of the LGMD, including its 3D morphology, membrane conductances, and responses to a wide array of current injection protocols and visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2019</xref>). The previous model iterations are available from ModelDB (accession numbers 195666 and 256024). All previously simulated visual responses for this model were limited to OFF stimuli (dark objects on a light background). For the current investigations, we used this model to test the impact of ON/OFF excitatory segregation between fields A and C.</p><p>Briefly, the model morphology was generated from two-photon scans using the software suite Vaa3D (vaa3d.org), producing a resulting model with 2518 compartments, 1352 of which are in field A and 455 in field C. The membrane channels used in the model are the fast Na<sup>+</sup>, delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup>, HCN, inactivating K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>D-like</sub>), KCNQ M-type K<sup>+</sup>, low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>T</sub>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>Ca</sub>), with kinetics and location of the channels constrained by experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2019</xref>). All simulations were run with a time step of 0.02 ms using the standard NEURON integration algorithm.</p><p>The pattern of synaptic inputs for simulating responses to visual stimuli was generated as mentioned previously and is grounded in experimental data. The procedure for generating synaptic patterns consisted of aligning the stimulus to a virtual eye and calculating the time course of luminance within each facet’s receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). Signal transforms were applied to match the membrane potentials recorded from individual photoreceptors and laminar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones and Gabbiani, 2010</xref>). For modeling spiking medullary neurons presynaptic to the LGMD, an additional thresholding was applied. The location of excitatory synapses impinging on field A was constrained by two-photon imaging data during single-facet simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu and Gabbiani, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Each excitatory synapse was modeled as an alpha synapse with a 0.15 ms time constant, a maximal conductance of 14 nS, and a reversal potential of 10 mV. Each inhibitory synapse was modeled as an alpha synapse with a 2 ms time constant, a maximal conductance of 8 nS, and a reversal potential of –78 mV. There were randomly timed spontaneous synaptic inputs at rates of 500 Hz for excitatory inputs and 30 Hz for inhibitory inputs. This level of spontaneous activity reproduced the experimentally recorded noise level of the LGMD membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones and Gabbiani, 2012a</xref>). A simulated looming stimulus had 80,000 excitatory synaptic events and 7000 inhibitory events. Simulation time scales with the number of synapses, so the modeled inputs were implemented with fewer, higher conductance synapses than the actual excitatory inputs.</p><p>The model responses have been previously tuned to reproduce the timing and strength of experimentally recorded LGMD activity generated by single-facet stimulation, small and large flashes, moving bars, and looming stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). The experimental data that was used for constraining the model’s visual responses all used OFF stimuli. As equivalent data is not available for ON stimuli, we used the same synaptic inputs for ON and OFF stimuli except for the differences in dendritic locations and excitatory scaling as described in the section ‘Results.’ The excitatory inputs impinging on field C are believed to have larger receptive fields than those exciting field A due to fewer total neurons covering the visual hemifield. Future studies will be required to determine whether differences in receptive field properties influence the integration of ON and OFF inputs.</p><p>Previous simulations of black looming stimuli had excitation impinging on field A of the model and inhibition impinging on field C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones and Gabbiani, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewell and Gabbiani, 2018a</xref>). For simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> when excitation was moved from field A to field C, an equal percentage of inhibition was moved from field C to field B. For simulations comparing the relative strength of excitation in fields A and C shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, we moved all excitation to pseudo-randomly selected field C compartments. After moving synapses to field C, their strength was changed by either reducing the conductance of each synaptic event or by removal of pseudo-random synaptic subsets. Both methods of reducing the field C excitation had the same effect, that is, a 60% reduction in conductance produced the same activity level as 60% event removal.</p><p>To test integration of split excitation between fields, we moved different pseudo-randomly selected subsets of field A excitatory inputs to field C (and a matching percentage of inhibitory inputs from field C to field B). The excitatory inputs moved to field C were then reduced by 60% (reducing conductance or removing events were both used with equal effect). These simulations were repeated with different random subsets of synaptic events moved, resulting in similar responses (the range of spike count differences for the percentages tested were 0–2 spikes). The mean responses of these simulations are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>.</p><p>To simulate responses to checkerboard stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>), the excitatory inputs from each facet viewing ON checkers (luminance increases) were mapped randomly to field C compartments and excitatory inputs from facets viewing OFF checkers were mapped retinotopically to field A. To simulate spatially scrambled checkerboard responses, 10 different stimuli were generated for each coherence level, and independent synaptic mappings were generated for each. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref> shows the average responses for each coherence level.</p><p>Electrotonic distance between field C and the SIZ was adjusted by increasing the axial resistance in the dendritic segment connecting field C to the main neurite that connects the axon to each dendritic field. The properties of the branches within field C were not altered.</p><p>To impose a retinotopic clustering on field C inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), we chose a compartment near the center of field C to serve as the ‘center’ of the loom response. The earliest looming inputs were set to impinge on this central point, and as the loom expanded the activated region of field C expanded based on a sigmoidal function with steepness of 80 µm. This resulted in a region of spread similar to that seen in experimental data for field A as illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Alternative calculations of energy expenses</title><p>To confirm that the energy expenses presented in ‘Discussion’ are reasonable, we estimated them by two other ways – using published estimates of synaptic cost and extrapolating from current-clamp measurements.</p><p>First, the total energy cost of synaptic transmission is derived from<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the energy cost per synapse, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of synapses, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of spikes of the presynaptic neurons per loom.

interested in dendritic integration. The authors used calcium imaging, pharmacology, and electrophysiology to investigate how a large, loom-sensitive neuron in grasshoppers integrates visual input to respond to both light and dark looming objects. These experiments convincingly support the finding that the integration is done by two distinct arbors of the neuronal dendritic tree, one of which loses retinotopic information. The authors suggest energetic advantages of this dendritic arrangement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79772.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Damon A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03v76x132</institution-id><institution>Yale University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Branco</surname><given-names>Tiago</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02jx3x895</institution-id><institution>UCL</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.10.491323">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.10.491323v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tiago Branco (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this manuscript would be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if the authors address the points below.</p><p>1) Retinotopic mapping in field C: It remains unclear how the columnar organization of the lobula could relate to the proposed lack of retinotopy in field C. Similarly, the ROI based retinotopic analysis should be related to this anatomy. Both of these issues should be addressed.</p><p>2) Modeling: A detailed modeling section is required in the methods, including how excitation and inhibition are included.</p><p>3) Energetics: These claims need to be better supported by direct calculations and clear comparisons.</p><p>4) Optimizing claims: These must be better supported if they are to be included in the manuscript and title. As it stands, the claim is not backed up with concrete evidence that this anatomical organization optimizes the computation.</p><p>5) Inhibition: The contribution of inhibition should be considered when interpreting data and expanded on in the discussion.</p><p>6) Claims: Several smaller claims should be softened, as indicated in the detailed comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There were a few items that seemed incomplete in the manuscript:</p><p>1) There were a few places where claims were perhaps a little too strong:</p><p>a. Lines 152-161: Ach experiments. In principle, all these results are also consistent with an upstream neuron being excited by ach and using a different neurotransmitter to get the excitation to the LGMD. One solution is to simply adjust text. Or could one show that puffing a different excitatory neurotransmitter doesn't cause this?</p><p>b. Figure 4I: The authors say flatly that there is no retinotopic mapping in field C (line 191) and that the input locations are not different from random, but 4I shows that's not true along 1 axis in field C, even if the effect is small. (Or at least, n.s. is only marked for one of two axes in this panel.)</p><p>c. The authors assume that LGMD is mediating behavioral responses to ON looms. Is that proven or could it be here? If not, a caveat might be warranted.</p><p>2) There were two particular results that I thought deserved more explanation:</p><p>a. Field C really responds reasonably to the OFF loom. It's a little hard to reconcile this with treating it as the ON loom responsive field. Relatedly, on line 356: Incomplete rectification doesn't seem like it could explain the lack of selectivity in these fields. Incompletely rectified ON neurons would not also depolarize in response to contrast decrements, for instance. It seems like there would need to be a different parsimonious explanation.</p><p>b. Why does mecamylamine application to field C reduce the field A ON response?</p><p>3) The modeling and energetics arguments need substantially more detail to be convincing.</p><p>a. The authors should provide some details of the model in the methods. It would be helpful to have the basics of the model here; right now, there is nothing. Particularly important are the input transformations used to create the ON and OFF signals for the two fields – are these tonic or transient inputs? It could make a large difference to the energetics of the system.</p><p>b. Figure 7D: I would call 'clustered' 'retinotopic' if I'm understanding this correctly.</p><p>c. The noise in several modeling traces seems to be the same, which suggests this hasn't been averaged over noise (if there's noise in the model) or averaged over looms at different spatial locations. In particular, the noise in traces appears the same in the red and blue traces in 7B. But also in the black and gray traces in 7D. Is the gray really less than the black? The noise appears the same in these two traces (around t = -1), which suggests that this simulation is not averaging over noise instantiations or stimuli as it probably should. If this figure is the argument for why evolution dropped retinotopy to Field C, it's interesting, but it should be made stronger, perhaps with error bars or confidence intervals.</p><p>d. The energetics arguments should be spelled out more clearly:</p><p>i. When the authors write that there would be X savings for the ON Field C arrangement, they need to be clear about what the comparison is to. What is the alternative arrangement they're considering? ON and OFF retinotopic inputs to Field A? No ON inputs at all? I did not find this clear.</p><p>ii. There's a mix of detailed biophysical modeling and back-of-the-envelope style reasoning to come up with various numbers for the savings (in percents and in ATP). Doesn't the biophysical model allow one to compute the energy requirements directly and precisely?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Polarity does not reduce jump probability (Line 91):</p><p>a. The data in figure 1B show a trend towards a reduction in jump probability to white vs dark looms. Lower response rates to white vs dark stimuli have been documented across animals (Yilmaz and Meister 2013, Holmqvist and Srinivasan 1991, etc.), and figure 5G, at 100% coherence, seems to support this, with a &gt;60% response rate for black and ~40% response rate for white looming stimuli. How do the Figure 1B data appear when using paired, individual animal probabilities as the data points, instead of 263 trials from 7 grasshoppers? Are the trials evenly distributed across the 7 grasshoppers?</p><p>2. The contribution of off inhibition for dendrite field C:</p><p>a. Dendrite field C, in addition to receiving on excitation, has been documented to receive OFF inhibition. Could a release of OFF inhibition (inhibitory rebound, for example) also be contributing to the response observed in dendrite C during white loom presentations? The authors should comment on this in the discussion. Additionally, why would off inhibition and on excitation be converging onto this particular dendrite field?</p><p>3. Lack of retinotopy for excitatory on inputs to dendrite field C:</p><p>a. How are the branches of dendrite field C arranged with respect to the columnar structure of the lobula? Dendrite field A spans across the lobula columns so adjacent areas in space are mapped to adjacent areas on the dendrite. In comparison, does the anatomy of dendrite field C provide insight into why an absence of retinotopic arrangement is observed? Are there substructures in the locust lobula where the different dendrite fields reside (Rosner 2017)? Can the authors expand on this, including what has been observed in past anatomical investigations?</p><p>b. Additionally, in analyzing the retinotopy with calcium imaging, can the ROIs for dendrite field C (Figure 4A) be drawn to match the columnar structure of the lobula as in field A, and/or drawn to follow the individual branches instead of combining multiple primary and secondary branches that may result in averaging the signal across multiple regions? The authors note they employed different strategies for drawing the ROI and witnessed similar results, but it would be helpful to include the ROI data that follow the analysis for dendrite field A. Finally, does the smaller size and location of dendrite field C suggest it samples from a much smaller (or different) receptive field than dendrite A? This relates back to (3) where it would be helpful to expand the introduction of the anatomy for the three dendrite fields, and expand on how it aligns or does not align with the ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging results in the Discussion section.</p><p>4. Modeling synapse numbers as a proxy for energetic cost:</p><p>a. There is not a modeling section in the methods. The authors need to recap the methods for the published model and then describe in detail what changes/additions were made for the current manuscripts.</p><p>b. It is indeed interesting that the same firing rate can be achieved after removing 60% of dendrite field C's input, and that this may reduce energetic costs for the LGMD. However, are the starting number of synapses anatomically relevant?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79772.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this manuscript would be suitable for publication in eLife if the authors address the points below.</p><p>1) Retinotopic mapping in field C: It remains unclear how the columnar organization of the lobula could relate to the proposed lack of retinotopy in field C.

Specifically, the previously described field C inputs originate from a bundle of fibers called the dorsal uncrossed bundle (DUB) which projects to the dorsal lobula (O’Shea and Williams, 1974). In contrast to the second optic chiasm between the medulla and lobula, which is a crossed bundle and provides a columnar and retinotopic projection, the DUB is an uncrossed bundle, providing a non-columnar and nonretinotopic projection (Gouranton, 1964; Strausfeld and Nässel, 1981, Figure 67; Elphick et al., 1996, p. 2396). The DUB projection was first described by Gouranton (1964; Figure 1, where it is called fnc2). Further anatomical work on Golgi stains confirmed that LGMD inputs to field C from the DUB are non-retinotopic (Strausfeld and Nässel, 1981, p. 119).</p><p>Additionally, recent work in our lab has shown that only a small number of LGMD inputs to field C originating from the DUB are inhibitory (on the order of 10 neurons; Wang et al. 2018). Thus, the novel ON excitation to field C described here most likely represent the majority of the ~500 non-retinotopic DUB inputs to field C, with receptive fields estimated to be around 8x12º (Rowell et al., 1977; Elphick et al., 1996). In agreement with the anatomical assumption of a few hundred non-retinotopic inputs with wider receptive fields than the columnar projections impinging on field A (~2x2º), modeling the inputs in this way was sufficient to accurately reproduce the data.</p><p>To make this clear we have added one paragraph in the introduction summarizing these results (lines 68-79).</p><p>Please see revised manuscript for all cited references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Modeling: A detailed modeling section is required in the methods, including how excitation and inhibition are included.</p></disp-quote><p>A new section describing modeling detail has been added to the methods (lines 665-740).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Energetics: These claims need to be better supported by direct calculations and clear comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>The corresponding calculations and details were added (lines 488-500 and 742-759).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Optimizing claims: These must be better supported if they are to be included in the manuscript and title. As it stands, the claim is not backed up with concrete evidence that this anatomical organization optimizes the computation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that optimality is a strong claim to make. We have modified the title and text accordingly to emphasize an ‘improvement’ in neural computation rather than its ‘optimization’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Inhibition: The contribution of inhibition should be considered when interpreting data and expanded on in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript does not propose any changes to the described inhibitory inputs, and the modeling section uses the same inhibition as our previous publications. Thus, inhibition is mostly out of the scope of the paper, but a short paragraph discussing its potential impact was added to the discussion (lines 461-473). Better characterizing inhibition and its interaction with excitation is high on our list of future experiments, now that we know that they both impinge on field C. There is no detailed description of the field B ON inhibitory inputs, so the current assumption that the ON and OFF feed-forward inhibition are of the same timing and strength is the simplest assumption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Claims: Several smaller claims should be softened, as indicated in the detailed comments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these issues as detailed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There were a few items that seemed incomplete in the manuscript:</p><p>1) There were a few places where claims were perhaps a little too strong:</p><p>a. Lines 152-161: Ach experiments. In principle, all these results are also consistent with an upstream neuron being excited by ach and using a different neurotransmitter to get the excitation to the LGMD. One solution is to simply adjust text. Or could one show that puffing a different excitatory neurotransmitter doesn't cause this?</p></disp-quote><p>The proposed scenario is theoretically possible, but the data would be very difficult to explain through such an indirect mechanism. Acetylcholine was delivered through iontophoresis directly at field C dendrites. The observed fluorescence change in field C is local, within ~25 µm of the electrode used for iontophoresis. A new supplemental figure showing this has been added (Figure 3S1), and the related text in the Results has been reworded to improve clarity (lines 184-189). If the field C activity was produced by activation of intermediate neurons, their synaptic inputs to field C would have to be perfectly aligned at the same location as the electrode across experiments, which is implausible.</p><p>Another hypothesis that would be consistent with the data is that the presynaptic excitatory neurons projecting to the LGMD field C have nAChRs on their presynaptic axon terminals and that these receptors must be activated to produce synaptic excitation of the LGMD. Although muscarinic acetylcholine receptors have been reported at presynaptic terminals, nicotinic receptors have never been reported there to the best of our knowledge.</p><p>Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, acetylcholine is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the insect brain and we would not know which alterative excitatory neurotransmitter could be selected for puffing. Note that glutamate is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the insect nervous system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Figure 4I: The authors say flatly that there is no retinotopic mapping in field C (line 191) and that the input locations are not different from random, but 4I shows that's not true along 1 axis in field C, even if the effect is small. (Or at least, n.s. is only marked for one of two axes in this panel.)</p></disp-quote><p>We are confident that the mapping is not retinotopic, which matches the expectation from anatomy. This may be best seen by looking at videos 5-7 of moving dot stimuli and comparing the activation of field C and field A. We have changed the text to reduce claims of randomness, and focus on the point that there is no retinotopy. The corresponding Results section (lines 226-237) hopefully better clarifies our claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The authors assume that LGMD is mediating behavioral responses to ON looms. Is that proven or could it be here? If not, a caveat might be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. Earlier work has shown a causal link between LGMD activity and OFF looms, but not for ON looms. The text was changed to explain that the behavioral role of the LGMD for ON loom responses has not been directly confirmed (lines 371-376).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There were two particular results that I thought deserved more explanation:</p><p>a. Field C really responds reasonably to the OFF loom. It's a little hard to reconcile this with treating it as the ON loom responsive field. Relatedly, on line 356: Incomplete rectification doesn't seem like it could explain the lack of selectivity in these fields. Incompletely rectified ON neurons would not also depolarize in response to contrast decrements, for instance. It seems like there would need to be a different parsimonious explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no doubt in our mind from the experimental data that field C has a strong preference for ON stimuli and vice-versa for field A based on the summary data depicted in Figure 2K and L. Please see also videos 2-4. We agree that the wording ‘incomplete rectification’ was not optimal and it has been changed. We also agree that responses to field C are less selective than those to field A. We have expanded the discussion to explain that the exact selectivity likely depends on stimulus type and requires further study (lines 430-440). Another likely source of differences between the two fields may originate in technical aspects of dye injection as now better explained (lines 405415). We have toned down the claims as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Why does mecamylamine application to field C reduce the field A ON response?</p></disp-quote><p>In these experiments, mecamylamine was applied by pressure injection resulting in some spread to field A. We have added a section in the Methods explaining the details of drug application that addresses this point (lines 576-581).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The modeling and energetics arguments need substantially more detail to be convincing.</p><p>a.

A subset of the synapses in the model have random timing, but this does not much change the IFR profile. What appears as noise in the red and blue traces of 7B is actually consistent spike timing across trials (these are Gaussian smoothed firing rates). The consistency in spike timing is similar to that of experimental data, though. For comparison, see the experimental IFR and SD across animals in Figure 5B and C. The early spikes are reliably initiated at a set point of the loom and the model firing reflects this consistency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d.
