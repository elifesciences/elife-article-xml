kinase 3 (RIPK3) normally signals to necroptosis by phosphorylating MLKL. We report here that when the cellular RIPK3 chaperone Hsp90/CDC37 level is low, RIPK3 also signals to apoptosis. The apoptotic function of RIPK3 requires phosphorylation of the serine 165/threonine 166 sites on its kinase activation loop, resulting in inactivation of RIPK3 kinase activity while gaining the ability to recruit RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8 to form a cytosolic caspase-activating complex, thereby triggering apoptosis. We found that PGF<sub>2α</sub> induces RIPK3 expression in luteal granulosa cells in the ovary to cause luteal regression through this RIPK3-mediated apoptosis pathway. Mice carrying homozygous phosphorylation-resistant RIPK3 S165A/T166A knockin mutations failed to respond to PGF<sub>2α</sub> but retained pro-necroptotic function, whereas mice with phospho-mimicking S165D/T166E homozygous knock-in mutation underwent spontaneous apoptosis in multiple RIPK3-expressing tissues and died shortly after birth. Thus, RIPK3 signals to either necroptosis or apoptosis depending on its serine 165/threonine 166 phosphorylation status.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RIPK3</kwd><kwd>necroptosis</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>ovary</kwd><kwd>prostaglandins</kwd><kwd>Caspase-8</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institutional</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A phosphorylation of receptor interacting RIPK3 switches its pro-necroptosis function to apoptosis that promotes luteal regression which induced by Prostaglandin F2alpha.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulated cell death with distinctive associated morphological changes happens either in the form of apoptosis or necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fink and Cookson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kroemer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wallach et al., 2016</xref>). Apoptosis is executed by intracellular caspases, particularly caspase-3, whose cleavage of several intracellular substrates gives rise to characteristic features of apoptotic cell death. Caspase-3 is activated by upstream caspase-8 or caspase-9, which are known to be activated respectively by being part of plasma membrane-associated death-inducing signaling complexes induced by the TNF family of cytokines, or being part of the cytosolic apoptosome, which is formed as a result of cytochrome c release from mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Cells that die by apoptosis maintain their plasma membrane integrity and break down into small vesicles phagocytosed by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kroemer et al., 2009</xref>). Cells that die by regulated necrosis are executed by membrane-disrupting proteins that, when activated, translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and disperse cellular contents into the cell surroundings. This process is often associated with inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christofferson and Yuan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vandenabeele et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wallach et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>One form of regulated necrosis, necroptosis, is executed by a pseudokinase, namely mixed lineage kinase-domain protein, MLKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). MLKL is a substrate of receptor-interacting kinase RIPK3, which becomes activated either by (1) the TNF family of cytokines through a related kinase RIPK1 that interacts with RIPK3 through a RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domain or (2) by other RHIM domain-containing proteins, such as TRIF or ZBP1/DAI, that relay necroptotic signals from Toll-like receptors or intracellular Z-RNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Degterev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Upton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).

On the other hand, mice homozygous with another kinase-dead mutant, K51A RIPK3, do not share this phenotype. However, cells that harbor this mutation are sensitive to apoptosis induction when treated with several small-molecule RIPK3 inhibitors that bind to its ATP-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mandal et al., 2014</xref>). Whether this apoptosis-inducing activity of RIPK3 is an anomaly of the mutant protein, the small-molecule inhibitor bound form, or a true physiological function of RIPK3 remains to be resolved.</p><p>Apoptosis and necroptosis play important physiological and pathological roles in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christofferson and Yuan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vandenabeele et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wallach et al., 2016</xref>).

From the neonatal stage to sex maturation, most eggs within primordial follicles fail to develop and undergo a process called atresia – a process driven by apoptosis of the egg and surrounding granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rimon-Dahari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tilly and Sinclair, 2013</xref>). After sex maturation, follicles develop from primordial to primary and secondary follicles accompanied by the proliferation of surrounding granulosa and theca cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rimon-Dahari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sánchez and Smitz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tilly and Sinclair, 2013</xref>). After egg release from the follicle during ovulation, the remaining granulosa and theca cells become progesterone-producing sources, namely corpus luteum, which is easily recognizable under a microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rolaki et al., 2005</xref>). If the egg is unfertilized, the corpus luteum dies through apoptosis and becomes corpus albicans, a scar tissue with a mixture of cell debris, macrophages, type I collagen, and fibroblasts, and is light in color compared to the luteum. The process is also known as luteal involution or luteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rolaki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stocco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tilly, 2001</xref>). Such a process stops the production of progesterone and triggers another cycle of ovulation. When mammals age, their follicles and corpora lutea are gradually lost, and the ovary eventually becomes a corpus albicans-filled organ that ceases to produce eggs and hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perheentupa and Huhtaniemi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tilly, 2001</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we report that RIPK3 specifically induces apoptosis instead of necroptosis in certain contexts and cell types. The apoptosis-inducing function of RIPK3 requires phosphorylation of the evolutionarily conserved serine 165/threonine 166 sites (mouse origin) on its kinase activation loop, resulting in the inactivation of its kinase activity and acquiring the ability to recruit RIPK1-FADD-caspase-8, which leads to activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. The apoptosis vs. necroptosis function of RIPK3 seemed to be determined by the cellular level of a RIPK3 chaperone Hsp90/CDC37. We also found that the serine 165/threonine 166 phospho-RIPK3 signal specifically appeared in corpora lutea/albicans when mice reached more than 4 months of age and PGF<sub>2α</sub> can specifically trigger this apoptotic pathway during the process of corpus luteum involution in a mouse hyper-ovulation model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ectopic expression of RIPK3 in cultured MCF7 or human granulosa lutein cells activated apoptosis through the RIPK1-FADD-caspase-8 pathway</title><p>We engineered three Dox-inducible RIPK3 expressing cell lines: HeLa/TO-RIPK3, MCF7/TO-RIPK3, and KGN/TO-RIPK3, all of which do not express endogenous RIPK3.

Cell death induced by Dox could be blocked by caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) but not by MLKL inhibitor NSA, nor RIPK1 kinase inhibitor RIPA-56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the observed RIPK3-mediated cell death was apoptotic. However, this form of apoptosis did not signal through the classic intrinsic mitochondrial pathway as the loss of cell viability through this pathway could not be blocked by caspase inhibitors nor was the apoptosis triggered by the TNF receptor family, which would be RIPK1 kinase-dependent.</p><p>To further explore the molecular mechanism of this apoptosis pathway, we expressed a previously reported kinase-dead mutant (K50A) of RIPK3 in MCF7 cells and found that this kinase-dead mutant RIPK3(K50A) did not cause cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of this kinase-dead mutant RIPK3(K50A) plus RIPK3 kinase inhibitor GSK’872 resulted in robust apoptosis, similar to what was described by Mandal et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mandal et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the mutations at the RHIM domain of RIPK3 known to disrupt RHIM-RHIM interaction also caused complete loss of cell death induction, indicating that RHIM domain interaction, possibly with another RHIM domain-containing protein, is required for apoptotic induction by RIPK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>RIPK3’s dependence on the RHIM domain but not its kinase activity suggested that the observed apoptosis might be through the RIPK1-FADD-caspase-8 pathway, as was seen in apoptosis induced by the D161N mutant RIPK3, a kinase-dead mutant of RIPK3 that causes spontaneous apoptosis and prenatal lethality in mice carrying this knock-in mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Newton et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore immunoprecipitated the Flag-tagged RIPK3 and probed the immune-precipitate with antibodies against RIPK1, caspase-8, and FADD. Indeed, all three proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with RIPK3. The amount of RIPK1 and caspase-8 associated with RIPK3 increased when a caspase inhibitor was present, indicating the complex had increased stability when caspase-8 activity was blocked, presumably by preventing caspase-8-mediated cleavage of RIPK1, which serves as an adaptor protein between RIPK3 (through the RHIM domain) and FADD (through the DEAD domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mandal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Newton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 1999</xref>).

Interestingly, different from the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mandal et al., 2014</xref>), knocking out the <italic>cFLIP</italic> gene did not block RIPK3-induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells but rather enhanced it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RIPK3-induced apoptosis was dependent on RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cultured MCF7/TO-RIPK3 cells were treated with DMSO or Dox plus the indicated agent for 24 hr.

To this end, we immunoprecipitated Flag-RIPK3 from HeLa cells and MCF-7 cells and performed a detailed mass spectrometry analysis. We found two amino acid residues at the activation loop of the RIPK3 kinase domain, serine 164 and threonine 165, that were specifically phosphorylated in MCF7 cells but not in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To validate this phosphorylation event, we generated a monoclonal antibody against the phospho-S164/T165 peptide. This phospho-specific antibody only recognized RIPK3 protein expressed in KGN or MCF7 cells but not in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We further validated our monoclonal antibody’s specificity by expressing a RIPK3 protein bearing phosphorylation-resistant mutations S164A/T165A in MCF and KGN cells. The expressed S164A/T165A RIPK3 was then analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against RIPK3 or phospho-S164/T165 RIPK3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>, Dox-induced wild-type RIPK3 was recognized by anti-RIPK3 and anti-phospho-S164/T165 RIPK3 antibodies in both MCF7/TO-RIPK3 and KGN/TO-RIPK3 cells. The phosphorylation-resistant S164A/T165A mutant protein could only be recognized by the anti-RIPK3 antibody but not the anti-phospho-S614/T165 antibody. Notably, this anti-phospho-S164/T165 antibody did not recognize any non-specific protein band across the entire set of protein size markers (15–250 kDa), nor in cells without Dox addition to their media. Additionally, the expression of two kinase-dead mutants RIPK3 D160N and RIPK3 K50A (equivalent of mouse D161N and K51A, respectively) failed to generate the phospho-S164/T165 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Remarkably, in HeLa cells, the phospho-mimic mutant S164D/T165E gained the ability to induce apoptosis similar to the kinase-dead mutant D160N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), indicating that phospho-mimic mutations activated RIPK3’s apoptosis-inducing function that is normally silenced in HeLa cells. Since the phospho-mimic mutations inactivate RIPK3 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), this S164D/T165E mutant was no longer able to induce necroptosis in HeLa cells when treated with necroptosis stimuli TSZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The corresponding phospho-mimic mutations of mouse RIPK3(S165D/T166E), like RIPK3(D161N) kinase-dead mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Newton et al., 2014</xref>), failed to auto-phosphorylate the serine 232 site, the equivalent of the human serine 227 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Furthermore, these mutant RIPK3 proteins induced apoptosis in mouse L929 (<italic>Ripk3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) cells after ectopic expression but not necroptosis when treated with the necroptosis stimulus TSZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Previously, we noticed that when we used a clinical relevant dose of 17AAG (200 nM) to treat mouse cells, the necroptosis was augmented instead of inhibited like in human or rat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore suggested that the Hsp90/CDC37 chaperone might not work in mouse cells. Given the importance of this chaperone system in determining the apoptotic or necroptotic fate and the conservation of the apoptosis-causing phosphorylation site in mice, we explored the possibility that the previously tested concentration of human Hsp90 inhibitors was simply not enough to inhibit the mouse Hsp90. Indeed, when the higher dose of 17AAG was used, the compound dose-dependently blocked TSZ-induced necroptosis in L929 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, when we knocked down Hsp90 using shRNA or inhibits Hsp90 using higher concentrations of 17AAG in L929 (<italic>Ripk3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>)/TO-RIPK3 cells, we saw the switch of the cellular necroptosis response to apoptosis after Dox induced RIPK3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). The serine 165/threonine 166 phosphorylation of RIPK3 also occurred after the inhibition of Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

To this end, we first induced hyper-ovulation in young female mice 4 weeks of age with gonadotropins and then treated them with DT as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carambula et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carambula et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The hyper-ovulation induced by gonadotropins generated multiple corpus lutea in the ovaries of these young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The subsequent DT treatment induced the elevation of RIPK3 protein in their corpus lutea, and the induced RIPK3 was phosphorylated at the serine 164/threonine 165 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>). Moreover, the treatment of DT caused active caspase-3 signal to appear in the corpus lutea of wild-type ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F, G</xref>). Mice with their <italic>PTGFR</italic> gene knocked out failed to elevate the RIPK3 level in response to PGF<sub>2α</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Although DT treatment induced the elevation of phosphorylation-resistant RIPK3(S165A/T166A) protein in the ovaries of <italic>Ripk3<sup>S165A-T166A/S165A-T166A</sup></italic> knock-in mice to the same level as wild-type RIPK3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), significantly less active caspase-3 signal was observed in these ovaries, similar to the ovaries of <italic>Ripk3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Fadd<sup>-/-</sup>/Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, or <italic>Ptgfr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, confirming that the observed DT-induced apoptosis in luteal cells was through the RIPK3/FADD-mediated apoptosis pathway triggered by the phosphorylation of serine 165/threonine 166 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F, G</xref>). We further co-stained the ovaries with antibodies against active caspase-3 and phospho-S165/T166 RIPK3 and found that most of the positive signals were overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), indicating that serine 165/threonine 166 phosphorylated RIPK3 activates apoptosis in corpus luteum, triggered by PGF<sub>2α</sub>. Interestingly, although significantly lower overall, there was more active caspase-3 in <italic>Ripk3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Ripk3<sup>S165A-T166A/S165A-T166A</sup></italic> ovaries than in <italic>Fadd<sup>-/-</sup>/Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ovaries, suggesting that there might be a redundant RIPK3-independent but FADD-dependent apoptosis pathway that also functions in resolving the corpus luteum in this model. This residue cell death could be through the classic extrinsic apoptosis pathway described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carambula et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2001</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrated that most of the corpus luteum involution induced by PGF<sub>2α</sub> is through the RIPK3-RIPK1/FADD/caspase-8 pathway triggered by RIPK3 induction and phosphorylation at serine 165/threonine 166.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The function of RIPK3 in apoptosis and necroptosis is controlled by phosphorylation of the amino acid residue serine 164</title><p>The apoptotic role of RIPK3 has been observed ever since RIPK3 was first identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 1999</xref>). The initial characterization of RIPK3, mainly by ectopic overexpression, indicated that it functioned in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 1999</xref>). Later, however, RIPK3 was identified as a key signaling molecule for necroptosis due to its ability to specifically phosphorylate MLKL, the executioner of this form of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). The debate of the apoptotic or necroptotic role of RIPK3 was further brought to the front by the observation that the D161N mutation of RIPK3 (D160N of human origin), a mutation that takes out the key DFG motif of the kinase active site and renders RIPK3 kinase-inactive, caused spontaneous apoptosis by activating caspase-8 through RIPK1 and FADD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Newton et al., 2014</xref>). Yet surprisingly, another kinase-dead mutant of RIPK3, the K51A mutant, does not induce apoptosis like D161N, but instead only starts to signal to apoptosis in the presence of small-molecule RIPK3 kinase inhibitors that occupy the ATP-binding site of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mandal et al., 2014</xref>). These observations suggest that it is not the inactivation of kinase activity per se that switches RIPK3 function from necroptosis to apoptosis. It is more likely the conformational change that happens due to particular mutations or kinase inhibitor binding that triggered such a change. We now propose that this mutation-induced change of RIPK3 function from pro-necroptotic to apoptotic most likely mimicked the specific phosphorylation at the serine 164 (mouse 165) site. The serine 164 amide nitrogen forms a conserved H-bond with the carbonyl oxygen of phenylalanine 160 (part of the DFG motif of kinase), a feature important to maintain the RIPK3 active configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). Introducing a phosphate group at this site conceivably disrupts this critical interaction, resulting in loss of function of the RIPK3 kinase and a conformational change that allows the RHIM domain to be available for RHIM-RHIM interaction between RIPK3 and RIPK1. Since it is the amide, not the side chain of serine 164 that participates in maintaining the active configuration of RIPK3, it is not surprising that the phosphorylation-resistant mutant S164A/T165A retains the kinase activity and is still able to signal to necroptosis, although such a mutation loses its apoptosis-inducing activity. Interestingly, RIPK1 protein functions here purely as an adaptor for the recruitment of FADD and caspase-8, and its kinase activity is not required for this apoptosis function. Therefore, unlike the apoptosis and necroptosis-inducing functions of RIPK1 when it responds to the activation of the TNF receptor family of proteins, the apoptosis-inducing activity of RIPK1 that is initiated by RIPK3 phosphorylation is not sensitive to RIPK1 kinase inhibitors.</p><p>Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of another yet to be identified kinase(s) that carries out the phosphorylation of serine 164/threonine 165 of RIPK3, our current data favor the idea that the phosphorylation is catalyzed by RIPK3 itself. Both D160N and K50A kinase-dead mutant RIPK3 failed to generate the phospho-serine 164/threonine 165 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Especially, the K50 site is not in the proximity of the S164/T165 phosphorylation sites, thus, the loss of phosphorylation is unlikely due to interference with substrate recognition that might have occurred with the D160N mutant, if the phosphorylation is carried out by another kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The level of RIPK3 chaperone Hsp90/CDC37 determines the cellular necroptotic or apoptotic function of RIPK3</title><p>Our investigation has now clearly shown that RIPK3 naturally has dual roles in both necroptosis and apoptosis. In cells in which the RIPK3 kinase predominantly signals to necroptosis, like in human colon cancer HT29 cells, the RIPK3 chaperone Hsp90/CDC37 level is relatively high, which allows RIPK3 to fold into a configuration that can only be activated by upstream signaling molecules, be that either RIPK1 in response to TNF receptor family members, or TRIF and ZBP1/DAI in response to toll-like receptors or Z-RNA, respectively. In this case, RIPK3 kinase activity is silent, and no auto-phosphorylation signal or downstream substrate MLKL phosphorylation occurs before upstream activation signals arrive.</p><p>However, in cells in which Hsp90/CDC37 chaperone level is relatively low or artificially inhibited by Hsp90 inhibitors or knocked down by the specific shRNA, the newly generated RIPK3, either by artificial induction (through transient transfection or Dox-induced expression) or by physiological signals like PGF<sub>2α</sub>, can auto-phosphorylate its serine 164/threonine 165 sites of its conserved kinase activation loop, triggering apoptosis through the RIPK3-RIPK1-FADD-caspase-8 pathway. Consistently, mice bearing the phospho-mimic mutations of these sites (S165D/T166E) showed spontaneous activation of apoptosis in all RIPK3-expressing tissues, including lung, intestines, and spleen, and these mice die within a month after birth. However, whether the apoptotic events observed in those S165D/T166E knock-in mouse tissues are caused by the activation of the RIPK1-FADD-caspase-8 pathway still requires genetic verification. if indeed the case, knocking out either <italic>caspase-8</italic> or <italic>FADD</italic> gene in those mice should rescue the phenotype.</p><p>We noticed previously that Hsp90 inhibitors developed against human Hsp90 did not block necroptosis in mouse BMDM but was efficacious in BMDM from rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2015</xref>). We now know that such a difference is mainly due to species specificity of these Hsp90 inhibitors. Using higher concentrations of human Hsp90 inhibitor 17AAG or knockdown Hsp90 protein in mouse cells, we recapitulated the similar necroptosis to apoptosis switch as in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). We thus realized that the previous conclusion that Hsp90/CDC37 chaperone system is not working in mouse cells is wrongly drawn due to lower efficacy of the Hsp90 inhibitors tested, which was developed to inhibit human Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2015</xref>). The chaperone level of Hsp90/CDC37 relative to RIPK3 is important to dictate the necroptotic or apoptotic function of mouse RIPK3 as well. Consistently, the levels of Hsp90 and CDC37 in the mouse luteum granulosa in which RIPK3-mediated apoptosis happens are much lower than that in the follicle granulosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Serine 164/threonine 165 phosphorylation of RIPK3 seems to be a unique biomarker for this RIPK3-mediated apoptosis pathway.

Ovarian mid-sagittal sections were used for immunohistochemical analysis with RIPK3 or cleaved-caspase-3 antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Mass spectrometry and data analysis</title><p>HeLa/TO-RIPK3 and MCF7/TO-RIPK3 cells were treated with Dox plus z-VAD for 24 hr. Then the cell extracts were prepared and used for immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer. The beads were then eluted with 0.5 mg/ml of the corresponding antigenic peptide for 6 hr or directly boiled in 1× SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. RIPK3 bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gel and then dissolved in 2 M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and reduced in 2 mM DTT at 56°C for 30 min followed by alkylation in 10 mM iodoacetamide at dark for 1 hr. Then the protein was digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) (1: 40 enzyme to total protein) at 37°C overnight. The tryptic peptides were separated by an analytical capillary column (50 μm × 15 cm) packed with 5 μm spherical C18 reversed phase material (YMC, Kyoyo, Japan). A Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, USA) was used to generate the following HPLC gradient: 0–30% B in 40 min, 30–70% B in 15 min (A = 0.1% formic acid in water, B = 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The eluted peptides were sprayed into a LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with a nano-ESI ion source. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode with one MS scan followed by four collision-nduced dissociation and four high-energy collisional dissociation MS/MS scans for each cycle. Database searches were performed on an in-house Mascot server (Matrix Science Ltd, London, UK) against Human RIPK3 protein sequence. The search parameters are 7 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 0.5 Da mass tolerance for product ions; three missed cleavage sites were allowed for trypsin digestion and the following variable modifications were included: oxidation on methionine, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were repeated at least twice, with similar results. Data represent biological replicates. Statistical tests were used for every type of analysis. The data meet the assumptions of the statistical tests described for each figure. Results are expressed as the mean ± s.e.m or SD. Differences between experimental groups were assessed for significance using a two-sided unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test using GraphPad prism5 and Excel software. The <italic>*</italic>p&lt;0.05, *<italic>*</italic>p&lt;0.01, and <italic>***</italic>p&lt;0.001 levels were considered significant. NS indicates not significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Alex Wang for critically reading and editing the manuscript.

However, RIPK3 could also promote apoptotic cell death under certain conditions. However, the mechanism by which RIPK3 promotes apoptosis and the physiological relevance of this apoptotic activity was not understood. The study aims to address this gap.</p><p>The study identifies a new phosphorylation event on RIPK3 (S164/T165) that appears to inhibit its capacity to induce necroptosis and make it a potent inducer of apoptosis. Low levels of the chaperone HSP90/CDC37 are posited to favor S164/T165 RIPK3 phosphorylation. RIPK3 activity identified in this work is positioned in the context of luteal regression by inducing apoptosis in luteal granulosa cells in the ovaries of female mice. Outcomes of in vitro mechanistic studies, based on overexpression of the different mutants in cell lines would be interesting to extend to cells from the knock-in mice expressing the mutated proteins at endogenous levels. Further, characterization of phenotypes of mice that lack RIPK3 kinase activity vis-a-vis mice that harbor mutations that mimic this phosphorylation would further strengthen the conclusions of this study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors showed that doxycycline-induced RIPK3 in the human cancer cells MCF7 and KGN led to apoptosis and phosphorylation at S164/T165. However, similar Dox-induced RIPK3 expression in HeLa cells did not promote S164/T165 phosphorylation or apoptosis. The authors attributed this differential response to the lower expression of the RIPK3 chaperone HSP90/Cdc37 in MCF7 and KGN cells. The phosphomimetic mutant S164D/T165E RIPK3 was defective for classical TZB-induced necroptosis but induced apoptosis in HeLa cells despite high HSP90/CDC37 expression. By contrast, S164A/T165A-RIPK3 failed to cause apoptosis but restored TBZ-induced necroptosis in MCF7 and KGN cells. The authors propose that this process is particularly important in luteal granulosa cells and provide evidence suggesting that RIPK3 phosphorylation on S164/T165 occurs in the ovaries of older mice. This seems counterintuitive given that corpus luteum involution occurs as part of the ovulation cycle and should therefore be especially relevant in young, sexually mature mice.</p><p>The authors are commended for the amount of work they have put in this study, going from the identification of this phosphorylation site to in vitro and in vivo functional studies including the generation of knock-in mice to address its function. The authors have successfully identified a protein phosphorylation that controls the form of cell death mediated by RIPK3. Key questions remain as to how this modification prevents RIPK3 from promoting necroptosis. There are some aspects of the study that could be strengthened, particularly regarding the mechanism of regulation and the physiological significance of this phosphorylation event.</p><p>1. Using cells from the knock-in mice expressing the mutated proteins at endogenous levels would be a more appropriate experimental system to assess the mechanistic underpinnings such as the interaction with HSP90/CDC37. For example, in figure 5G, cell death can be assessed in BMDMs from both the phosphomimetic and the alanine mutants in a more comprehensive manner. Do BMDMs or other primary cells (MEFs, lymphocytes, etc) from the phosphomimetic mutant knock-in mice undergo spontaneous apoptosis in the absence of zVAD, and if not why?</p><p>2. The authors implied that the kinase activity of RIPK3 is critical in this switch to apoptosis. However, the phenotypes of mice that lack RIPK3 kinase activity do not match that of the mice that harbor mutations that mimic this phosphorylation. Do RIPK3 deficient or S165a/T166A mutant mice show expected reproductive defects that may be attributed to the lack of the proposed RIPK3-mediated apoptosis program in luteal granulosa cells?</p><p>3. The heterozygous expression of the phosphomimetic mutants does not cause any pathology in vivo. The authors speculate that a threshold of expression is required for activation of this mutant, however, an alternative explanation could be that the presence of the wild-type protein prevents its activation, e.g. by trans-autophosphorylation on S227. Introducing a RIPK3 null allele to generate heterozygous RIPK3S165D/T166E mice that do not express wild-type RIPK3 could in principle help resolve this question, as in that case the phosphomimetic mutant will be expressed at the same level but in the absence of the wild type protein. We hope the authors can discuss this further.</p><p>4. The in vivo data in the knock-in mouse models clearly show that phosphomimetic mutations (RIPK3S165D/T166E) on RIPK3 cause severe pathology in multiple organs associated with increased numbers of dying cells. However, definitive evidence that the pathology is induced by apoptosis is not provided. The authors should incorporate a statement that clarifies this or provide evidence implicating an apoptotic pathway. For instance, rescue experiments by crossing to caspase-8 knockout mice would be one mechanism to establish that pathology is indeed induced by apoptosis.</p><p>5. The histological data and particularly the cleaved caspase-3 immunostainings are very hard to evaluate and could be improved. A question that deserves some discussion in the paper is also why the S165D/T166E mice don't die during embryonic life like the D161N mutants.</p><p>6. Information on the reproducibility of the experiments, including technical versus biological replicates and how many times each experiment was repeated, is not included in many figures. In addition, for all in vitro experiments in transfected and CRISPR knockout clones, it would help to include information on the number of independent clones tested. Statistical analysis needs to be included in all figures.</p><p>7. RIPK3 immunoblots often show 2 or three bands, which sometimes seem to correspond to phosphorylated versions and other times FLAG-tagged versus wild type. It would be helpful to label these accordingly in the figures to make the data easier for the readers to assess.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The protein kinase RIPK3 was widely known to promote a form of lytic cell death termed necroptosis.

They identified a new phosphorylation event on RIPK3 (S164/T165) that appears to inhibit its capacity to induce necroptosis and make it a potent inducer or apoptosis.

The authors provide experimental evidence supporting that phosphorylation on S164/T165 promotes apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, however the mechanisms regulating this transition remain poorly understood. The data on HSP90/CDC37 is supportive but largely correlative. The authors speculate that association with this chaperone is necessary for proper folding of RIPK3 into a configuration that can only be activated by upstream necroptosis inducers, while at low HSP90/CDC37 levels RIPK3 is not correctly folded and likely auto-phosphorylates on S164/T165, however this remains to be demonstrated. The authors propose that this process is particularly important in luteal granulosa cells and provide some evidence suggesting that RIPK3 phosphorylation on S164/T165 occurs in the ovaries of older mice. This seems counterintuitive given that corpus luteum involution occurs as part of the ovulation cycle and should therefore be especially relevant in young, sexually mature mice. Most importantly, there is no evidence that RIPK3 phosphorylation at these sites is important for female reproductive function, questioning its physiological significance. It would be important to know whether RIPK3 deficient or S165a/T166A mutant mice show any reproductive defects that would be expected by the lack of the proposed RIPK3-mediated apoptosis program in luteal granulosa cells.</p><p>The in vivo data in the knock-in mouse models clearly show that phosphomimetic mutations (RIPK3S165D/T166E) on RIPK3 cause severe pathology in multiple organs associated with increased numbers of dying cells.

That is the precise reason we painstakingly searched various mouse tissues of different age using our phosphoSerine165/theronine166 specific antibody for the sign of endogenous activation of this pathway. So far, the luteal granulosa are the only cell type we found that naturally activates this pathway when mice reach to a certain age. We were able to recapitulate the activation event with primary granulosa cells cultured in vitro and in ovaries from hyper-ovulated mice with an addition of a prostaglandin<sub>2α</sub> analog (Figure 7A-7C). Similar experiments are not possible with BMDM or fibroblasts. We also cordially disagree that further study of interactions between phospho-mimic and phosph-resistant mutant RIPK3 and HSP90/CDC37 would yield additional mechanistic insight in how RIPK3 adapts apoptotic and necroptotic functions. With this said, we did appreciate this comment and added a sentence in the text and in the method section stating that we do need to add caspase inhibitor when culture these BMDMs from the phosphor-mimic knock-in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This pathway seems to be specific for age-related, prostaglandin<sub>2α</sub>-induced apoptosis in luteal granulosa cells. We thus proposed in the Discussion that the effect of this pathway will only show up in aged animals. As the S165A/T166A mice are still young, and considering this manuscript is already data packed, we would like to publish the paper now and report the possible reproductive impact of the RIPK3 KO and KI mice when these mice grow older. We cannot anticipate such results in reasonable time frame because we do not know when the potential phenotype will become obvious. To clearly stating the fact that this pathway is only working in prostaglandin-induced luteal regression, not during normal reproductive cycle, we added “Prostaglandin<sub>2α</sub>-induced corpus luteal regression” in the title of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Given that similar apoptosis phenotype could be rescued by cross with caspase-8 KO mice as previously report (Newton, K. et al.
