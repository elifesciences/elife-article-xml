In <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, while genome-wide loss-of-function screens have been extensively used to reveal mechanisms of a variety of biological processes, approaches for performing genome-wide gain-of-function screens are still lacking. Here, we describe a pooled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screening platform in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and apply this method to both focused and genome-wide screens to identify rapamycin resistance genes. The screens identified three genes as novel rapamycin resistance genes: a member of the SLC16 family of monocarboxylate transporters (<italic>CG8468</italic>), a member of the lipocalin protein family (<italic>CG5399</italic>), and a zinc finger C2H2 transcription factor (<italic>CG9932</italic>).

Genome-scale loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) genetic perturbations facilitate functional genomic studies. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, genome-wide LOF screens using RNA interference or CRISPR-Cas9 have helped elucidate the mechanisms of a variety of biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boutros et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">BjÃ¶rklund et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DâAmbrosio and Vale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Viswanatha et al., 2018</xref>). However, genome-wide GOF screens have not been feasible, largely due to a lack of the reagents for genome-scale GOF perturbation. Current state-of-the-art for <italic>Drosophila</italic> GOF studies utilizes cDNA library overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stapleton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2011</xref>), which only covers a subset of the genome and underrepresents genes with long open reading frames (ORFs).</p><p>CRISPRa is a complementary approach for GOF studies. Nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) is fused with different transcriptional activators and targeted to the promoter region by single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to facilitate transcription at endogenous loci. Synergistic activation mediator (SAM) complex is one of the most efficient CRISPRa systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Konermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chavez et al., 2016</xref>). With the SAM system, synthetic transcriptional activators dCas9-VP64 and MCP-p65-HSF1 are recruited to the promoter region of endogenous genes by MS2 hairpin-containing sgRNAs. Genome-scale perturbation with CRISPRa can be achieved by synthesizing a genome-wide sgRNA library, bypassing the need to generate a genome-wide ORF library. CRISPR-based GOF approaches have been used for genome-wide genetic screens in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Konermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">RodrÃ­guez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sofer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>), but the feasibility has not yet been tested in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</p><p>To address this gap, we developed a pooled genome-wide CRISPRa screening platform in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells using the SAM complex. To demonstrate the feasibility of this platform, we performed focused and genome-wide CRISPRa screens and identified novel candidates conferring rapamycin resistance. Next, we focused on one of the top candidates, a member of the lipocalin protein family (<italic>CG5399</italic>), and demonstrate that it positively regulates the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway by regulating cholesterol and clathrin-coated pits at the cell membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inducible CRISPRa using the SAM complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells</title><p>To establish CRISPRa in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells in an inducible manner, the synthetic transcriptional activators of the SAM complex (dCas9-VP64 and MCP-p65-HSF1) were placed under a metallothionein promoter, which can be induced in the presence of copper ions. VP64, p65, and HSF1 are transcriptional activators while the MS2 coat protein (MCP) recognizes and binds to MS2 hairpins present in the sgRNAs, recruiting the fused transcriptional activators to gene promoters targeted by sgRNAs. In addition, the MS2 hairpin-containing sgRNA was expressed from a separate plasmid under the control of the U6 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine whether this system can mediate transcriptional activation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, plasmids with sgRNAs targeting the promoter regions of <italic>Jon25Biii</italic> or <italic>Sdr</italic> were transfected into <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2<italic>R</italic>+ cells stably expressing the metallothionein promoter-driven SAM complex. Without copper induction, sgRNAs moderately activated the target genes, likely due to leaky expression of the SAM complex from the metallothionein promoter. In the presence of copper, sgRNAs robustly upregulated the target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), showing that the SAM complex is able to mediate gene activation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2<italic>R</italic>+ cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inducible transcriptional activation by the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the SAM complex for inducible transcriptional activation. dCas9-VP64 and MCP-p65-HSF1 were driven by an inducible metallothionein promoter. dCas9-VP64 and MCP-p65-HSF1 were expressed as T2A-containing bicistronic transcript. single-guide RNA (sgRNA) was expressed from pLib8 plasmid, which contains an <italic>attB</italic> flanking GFP-T2A-PuroR cassette for <italic>attP</italic> sites recombination.

In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, 32% of genes form divergent gene pairs with transcriptional start sites (TSS) &lt;1 kb apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang and Yu, 2009</xref>). Thus, we next assessed the potential for collateral activation by the SAM complex of the closely spaced promoters. <italic>CG9877</italic> and <italic>CG13538</italic> are a divergent gene pair with transcriptional start sites 908 bp apart, thus this gene pair is a good test case for assessing collateral activation. sgRNAs were designed within a region 300 bp upstream of the TSS of <italic>CG9877</italic> and ~600 bp away from the TSS of <italic>CG13538</italic>. The sgRNAs specifically activated <italic>CG9877</italic>, but not <italic>CG13538</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that the SAM complex activates the target gene without affecting nearby genes at least in some divergent gene pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pooled CRISPRa screening with a focused library</title><p>Next, we used the SAM complex to perform a pooled CRISPRa screen. Unlike in mammalian cells, lentivirus vectors are extremely inefficient in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. To overcome this limitation, we previously established a pooled library delivery method based on site-specific recombination following plasmid transfection of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Viswanatha et al., 2018</xref>). In this method, <italic>attB</italic> sites flanking sgRNAs are integrated into <italic>attP</italic> sites flanking landing cassette in the presence of phiC31 integrase. We used the S2<italic>R</italic>+ PT5 cell line in which the <italic>attP</italic> cassette is inserted into the <italic>Clic</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">NeumÃ¼ller et al., 2012</xref>). To establish pooled library cells for CRISPRa screens, we first generated SAM cells that stably expressed the metallothionein promoter-driven SAM complex. Then, using phiC31-mediated cassette exchange, we integrated a pooled guide RNA library into the landing cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To test the pooled screen approach, we performed a CRISPRa screen to identify rapamycin resistance genes. Rapamycin is an allosteric inhibitor of the kinase mTOR, a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Rapamycin inhibits <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2<italic>R</italic>+ cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Cell proliferation was partially inhibited by rapamycin at 0.1 nM and almost completely inhibited at 1 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). To identify a suitable rapamycin treatment condition for a pooled CRISPRa screen, we performed a pilot-focused screen with different rapamycin concentrations and treatment durations. The focused library consists of 6335 sgRNAs targeting the promoter regions of 652 genes, which include genes involved in the mTOR signaling pathway as well as candidates from our previous CRISPR knockout screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Viswanatha et al., 2018</xref>). Pooled library cells were subjected to passaging in 0.1 nM, 1 nM rapamycin, or DMSO (vehicle) containing culture medium in parallel for 15 days or 30 days. After treatment, we examined sgRNA abundance in each condition by next-generation sequencing. First, we identified genes affecting cell fitness by comparing the final population after passaging in DMSO with the initial population. <italic>Scyl</italic> and <italic>Cyp12a4</italic> are significantly depleted (false-discovery rate (FDR)&lt;0.05) after passaging in DMSO for 15 days and 30 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>), suggesting that overexpression of <italic>scyl</italic> or <italic>Cyp12a4</italic> affects cell fitness. Consistent with this, <italic>scyl</italic> is known to inhibit cell proliferation and act as a cell death activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reiling and Hafen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corradetti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scuderi et al., 2006</xref>). These results demonstrate that pooled CRISPRa screen can be used to identify genes affecting cell fitness.</p><p>We next identified rapamycin resistance genes by comparing the rapamycin-treated population with the DMSO-treated population, reasoning that sgRNAs that lead to activation of rapamycin resistance genes would be enriched after treatment due to a growth advantage in the presence of rapamycin. The focused screen revealed that one candidate, <italic>CG8468</italic>, was significantly enriched (FDR&lt;0.05) in the population treated with 1 nM rapamycin. Moreover, with prolonged treatment, <italic>CG8468</italic> was further enriched as we observed a higher fold-change value at day 30 than at day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E and F</xref>). However, no gene was significantly enriched in the 0.1 nM rapamycin treatment condition, probably because cells have a higher proliferation rate at 0.1 nM rapamycin concentration compared to 1 nM. Taken together, these data demonstrate that pooled CRISPRa screen using the SAM complex is feasible in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genome-wide pooled CRISPRa screen</title><p>Next, we sought to screen for rapamycin resistance genes at the genome-wide scale. A previous study showed that multiplexed sgRNAs performed better than single sgRNAs for CRISPRi and CRISPRa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Replogle et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we designed a dual-sgRNA library in which each vector expressed two distinct sgRNAs targeting the promoter region of the same gene within 500 bp upstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The library consists of 84,143 vectors targeting the promoter regions of 13,293 protein-coding genes and 2332 non-coding genes. The dual-sgRNA library was constructed using a three-step pooled cloning strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref> and Methods). After library construction, we checked the quality of the dual-sgRNA library by deep sequencing, which revealed that ~98.5% of designed vectors were present in the final library. The difference in representation between the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile of the final library (19 reads) and the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile (292 reads) was 15.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). The integrity and distribution of our dual-sgRNA library are comparable to other published genome-wide libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>), indicating the high quality of the library.</p><p>To establish the pooled library cells, we integrated the genome-wide dual-sgRNA library into SAM cells by phiC31-mediated cassette exchange. The pooled library cells were then passaged in 1 nM rapamycin or DMSO-containing medium for 3 weeks. The abundance of dual-sgRNA vectors in the initial and final cell populations following rapamycin or DMSO treatment was analyzed by next-generation sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). First, we identified genes affecting cell fitness by comparing the final population after passaging in DMSO for 3 weeks with the initial population. Consistent with the results of the focused screen, <italic>scyl</italic> is also significantly depleted (FDR&lt;0.05) in the genome-wide screen dataset. In addition to the <italic>scyl</italic>, the screen also identified other genes known to be involved in the suppression of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide CRISPR activation screen for rapamycin resistance genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of CRISPR activation screen (See methods).

The target activation efficiency of each vector was evaluated in individual cell lines by qPCR. The dual-sgRNA vectors showed variable activation efficiency, probably due to the complex transcriptional regulation of the target genes or different sgRNA binding efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, F and I</xref>). Interestingly, the enrichment of each dual-sgRNA vector in the screen was highly correlated with its target activation efficiency, as only the vectors that efficiently activate target genes were enriched in the rapamycin-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, G and J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3BâD</xref>).

We reasoned that if a dual-sgRNA vector confers resistance to rapamycin, cells with the vector will proliferate more than wild-type SAM cells in the presence of rapamycin, leading to a higher proportion of GFP-positive cells in the rapamycin-treated sample as compared to the DMSO-treated sample. As expected, we only observed higher proportions of GFP for vectors that efficiently activate target genes, but not for inefficient vectors or an empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, H and K</xref>).

To address this gap, we generated a genome-wide dual-sgRNA library that covers both protein-coding genes and non-coding genes. This library also captures transcriptional complexity by targeting alternative promoters of the same gene, making it suitable for screens in different contexts in the future. Moreover, in this library, each gene is targeted by 4â6 dual-sgRNA vectors, which helps overcome the inefficient activation by some sgRNAs to some extent. Indeed, we observed that some dual-sgRNA vectors failed to activate the target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and I</xref>), possibly due to steric hindrance by pre-existing proteins in the promoter regions, or due to different sgRNA binding efficiency, which might be optimized by applying machine learning to large screen datasets in the future. In our method, the synthetic transcriptional activators of the SAM complex (dCas9-VP64 and MCP-p65-HSF1) are driven by the metallothionein promoter. Due to the leaky expression of this promoter, we observed moderate gene activation without copper induction. Availability of a tighter controlled promoter may be required for more sensitive screens. As the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome is relatively compact, one concern for CRISPRa is the collateral activation of adjacent genes. Previous work has shown that sgRNAs targeting areas beyond â600 bp from the TSS in <italic>Drosophila</italic> lose efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mao et al., 2020</xref>), which may alleviate the concern of collateral activation when the sgRNAs target sites are over 600 bp away from the TSS of neighboring genes. In some cases, sgRNAs are designed within both promoters of closely spaced divergent genes. If the hits from the screen form closely spaced divergent gene pairs, e.g., <italic>Lis-1</italic> and <italic>Ptp52F</italic> in the cell fitness screen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), more experiments will be required to identify which one contributes to the phenotype. Currently, in our CRISPRa system, spCas9 requires NGG as a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which limits sgRNA design in the small region upstream of TSS, especially for closely spaced genes. Next-generation CRISPRa system could use PAMless Cas9 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Walton et al., 2020</xref>) to remove the PAM constraint for sgRNA design, allowing the construction of libraries with more sgRNAs per gene.</p><p>Our genome-wide genetic screen identified some known rapamycin resistance genes and novel candidates. Overexpression of <italic>CG5399</italic>, which encodes a lipocalin family protein, confers resistance to rapamycin and activates RTK-Akt-mTOR signaling. The activation of InR by <italic>CG5399</italic> requires cholesterol and clathrin-coated pits at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). CG5399 is predicted to have a transmembrane helix at the C-terminus by PredictProtein and be located on the cell membrane by DeepLoc. As InR is embedded in the cell membrane and the rearrangement of InR transmembrane domain is crucial for tyrosine kinase domain activation, changing the lipid environment is a reasonable possible mechanism for the regulation of InR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gutmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scapin et al., 2018</xref>). A recent study showed that lipid exchange to form ordered domains at cell membranes induces InR autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Suresh et al., 2021</xref>). In our experiment, we observed higher InR activity in <italic>CG5399</italic>-overexpressing cells without insulin stimulation, suggesting that InR activation can be regulated by the lipid environment. The clinical relevance of this InR activation mechanism needs to be further investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, we have established a genome-wide CRISPRa platform in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and identified novel rapamycin resistance genes using a genome-wide CRISPRa screen platform. This platform can be applied broadly to help elucidate the cellular mechanisms of a variety of biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Raghu Padinjat (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. As you can see, the suggestions for revision are readily addressable. We look forward to receiving a revised manuscript speedily.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While we strongly recommend this manuscript for publication some corrections and revisions are listed.</p><p>1. The authors used attP cells to integrate sgRNA, and it would be useful to know the copy number of attP sites per cell and whether the cells are homogeneous. If this information is available, it should be added to the manuscript.</p><p>2. Due to the inherent nature of the metallothionein promoter, the authors observed significant leaky activation. While this may not be an issue while studying the rapamycin pathway, it could be problematic when studying sensitive signaling processes. Therefore, a clear disclaimer should be added to the discussion.</p><p>3. The manuscript demonstrates that CRISPRa is specific and does not activate neighboring genes with just a single example. However, it is possible that insulator sequences protect neighboring gene activation in this case. Therefore, the authors should either show more examples to demonstrate this convincingly or explicitly state this in the discussion.</p><p>4. It would be helpful to know the abundance of gRNA in the library compared to the hits identified in the screen. Was there a greater probability of a target showing up as positive in the screen when its abundance is overrepresented in the library?</p><p>5. The authors may want to speculate as to why Cyp12a4 did not come up on the second screen.</p><p>6. It would be useful to know whether p-Akt was checked in CG9932 knockdown and why it was excluded from the experiment.</p><p>7. The experiments to suggest insulin-independent activation of InR by CG5399 require more conclusive experiments. Serum starvation is not sufficient to conclusively state this, and the authors should discuss this limitation.</p><p>8. The discussion lacks clarity and focus, particularly in the second paragraph. Instead, the authors could focus on the tools generated in the article and compare and discuss similar tools available in other model systems. They could also speculate on how such a tool in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model will serve in new research questions.</p><p>9. Although the work seems more focused on generating a fly tool for CRISPRa, there are some nice discoveries of new functions for some of the fly genes. This could be better illustrated with a model showing signaling pathways and highlighting the gene functions identified in this study. It would be helpful to include an overall description of the InK-AktmTOR pathway with only major signaling cascade molecules for understanding.</p><p>10. It is recommended to expand abbreviations at their first mention. For example, the full form of InR should be included in Line 51.</p><p>11. It would be helpful to briefly explain the role of each component of the SAM complex- VP64, MS2, p65, and HSF1 for a better understanding of the use of the SAM complex.</p><p>12. In Line 100 and in a few parts of the same section, it is unclear what &quot;cell fitness&quot; indicates. It would be useful to specify whether it refers to cell viability, proliferation rate, or cell functionality and what parameters were measured to assess fitness.</p><p>13. In Line 124, the authors should state the rationale for including non-coding genes in the study with respect to rapamycin resistance. Were any non-coding targets identified in the screen?</p><p>14. The details of the software used for statistical analysis are missing. The details of FACS, its gating, and control parameters could be added.</p><p>15. In general, the legends for the figures could be better explained in detail. Eg: Appropriate statistical explanations for * needed wherever mentioned in figures. Abbreviations in plasmid constructs needed better explanations.</p><p>16. Authors have taken a number of measures to maintain the integrity of the CRISPRa library, including multiple gRNA targets per gene, 1000 cells per gRNA, and deep sequencing. However, do the authors have an idea of what percentage of the gRNA vectors are functional? Looking at the data they show for the 3 candidate genes, at least half of them are not functional, which could be either because of gRNA location or efficiency. Considering this to be an average situation, there might be a large number of genes for which all gRNAs might not function at all. We understand this might be a caveat for all such studies, but an estimate of some kind in discussion might be useful for anyone who might want to use these resources.</p><p>17. As the authors mention that ~32% of genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have transcription start sites &lt;1kb apart, off-targeting (neighboring genes getting activated in addition to the intended gene) will be an issue. To address this, the authors describe one example of genes where although the genes TSS are within one kb of each other, the sgRNA specifically activated only one gene and not the other. However, since following this, authors have generated genome-wide resources keeping 500bp upstream as their benchmark, a large percentage of these 32% genes might have off-targets. It would be useful to know the estimates of off-targeting for such a resource. In addition, have authors looked at the transcripts of genes close to the specific genes they have studied? CG9932 is in close proximity to (although not within the 1 kb range) a few genes including mTOR.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85542.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While we strongly recommend this manuscript for publication some corrections and revisions are listed.</p><p>1.

Moreover, for the same genes, we observed that some sgRNA vectors can activate target genes while others cannot (Figure 2f and 2I). In our original manuscript, we speculated that this is possibly due to steric hindrance by pre-existing proteins in the promoter regions, or due to different sgRNA binding efficiency, which can be further optimized in the future by applying machine learning to large screen datasets. Although we do not know how many sgRNAs are functional in the library, it is worth noting that while some sgRNA vectors fail to activate CG5399 and CG9932, these two genes can still be identified as top hits by MAGeCK-RRA analysis. Next generation CRISPRa sgRNA library should include more sgRNA vectors per gene to overcome the inefficient activation of some sgRNAs. We have added the following text to the discussion: âCurrently in our CRISPRa system, spCas9 requires NGG as protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which limits sgRNA design in the small region upstream of TSS, especially for closely spaced genes. Next generation CRISPRa system could use PAMless Cas9 variants to remove the PAM constraint for sgRNA design, allowing the construction of libraries with more sgRNAs per gene.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17.

CG9932 is in close proximity to (although not within the 1 kb range) a few genes including mTOR.</p></disp-quote><p>When we designed the genome-wide sgRNA library, if a sgRNA is located within 500 bp upstream of two genes, both genes are annotated as the target genes of the sgRNA. In our genome-wide sgRNAs, 14% of sgRNA vectors are annotated to target more than one gene. In the original manuscript, we discussed that if the hits from the screen form closely spaced divergent gene pairs, more experiments will be required to identify which one contributes to the phenotype. We have also added some discussion to the manuscript about next generation sgRNA library with closer space to target gene using PAMless Cas9 variants. For <italic>CG8468</italic>, <italic>CG5399</italic> and <italic>CG9932</italic>, none of them form divergent gene pairs with neighboring genes within 1 kb. <italic>CG9932</italic> is over 50 kb away from mTOR, sgRNAs targeting <italic>CG9932</italic> are unlikely to active mTOR according to the previous study (PMID: 33020192).
