centrioles for their formation. In mouse olfactory epithelium, the centrioles originate in progenitor cells near the basal lamina, often 50–100 μm from the apical surface. It is unknown how centrioles traverse this distance or mature to form cilia. Using high-resolution expansion microscopy, we found that centrioles migrate together, with multiple centrioles per group and multiple groups per OSN, during dendrite outgrowth. Centrioles were found by live imaging to migrate slowly, with a maximum rate of 0.18 µm/minute. Centrioles in migrating groups were associated with microtubule nucleation factors, but acquired rootletin and appendages only in mature OSNs. The parental centriole had preexisting appendages, formed a single cilium before other centrioles, and retained its unique appendage configuration in the mature OSN. We developed an air-liquid interface explant culture system for OSNs and used it to show that centriole migration can be perturbed <italic>ex vivo</italic> by stabilizing microtubules. We consider these results in the context of a comprehensive model for centriole formation, migration, and maturation in this important sensory cell type.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>sensory neuron</kwd><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>expansion microscopy</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM130286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stearns</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS082208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stearns</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99GM131024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jennifer T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ching</surname><given-names>Kaitlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D-G16E5 6518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ching</surname><given-names>Kaitlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Olfactory sensory neurons have centrioles that are amplified in number and that migrate from the cell body to the end of the dendrite relatively slowly and in groups, becoming mature only after they reach their destination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemosensation in many animals is mediated by ciliated neurons that have a sensory cilium at the end of a dendrite, positioned to sense the external environment. In vertebrates, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), found within the olfactory epithelium, have multiple cilia in a dendritic knob exposed to odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cuschieri and Bannister, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Menco, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McEwen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oberland and Neuhaus, 2014</xref>). The structure and function of these cilia are critical to olfaction. They provide a specialized membrane area for signaling via G protein-coupled olfactory receptors, and disruption of cilium structure and function can result in anosmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jenkins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kulaga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McEwen et al., 2007</xref>). The microtubule structure of each cilium is templated by a centriole at its base, which is also referred to as a basal body. Centrioles in many cell types also recruit pericentriolar material (PCM) to form the centrosome, the major microtubule organizing center.</p><p>To create the requisite number of olfactory cilia, cells must amplify centrioles from an initial pair. We previously demonstrated that centriole amplification occurs in mitotically active progenitor cells located near the basal lamina of the olfactory epithelium in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ching and Stearns, 2020</xref>). This is unique among cells with multiple cilia as epithelial cells with multiple motile cilia in the trachea, oviduct, and brain ependyma (multiple motile cilia cells, MMCCs) amplify centrioles only after mitotic divisions are completed.</p><p>Progenitor cells generate OSNs during embryonic development and throughout adult life, continuing to generate new ciliated olfactory neurons long after the epithelium has been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moulton and Beidler, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulvaney and Heist, 1971</xref>). As a daughter cell from the progenitor division differentiates into an immature OSN, it extends projections in opposite directions: a dendrite toward the apical surface to detect odorants, and an axon through the basal lamina toward the olfactory bulb. <italic>In vivo</italic> fate mapping in mouse has shown that this process begins 1 day after the progenitor’s last cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2015</xref>). During neurite extension, the cell body of the neuron remains close to the basal lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Centrioles in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) migrate tens of micrometers to the apical surface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the olfactory epithelium.

Using transmission electron microscopy, migrating centrioles have been previously observed in mammalian OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heist and Mulvaney, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulvaney and Heist, 1971</xref>). Within the thin, 1- to 2-µm-wide dendrites, centrioles were found to be grouped, with more groups being found in the most apical portion of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulvaney and Heist, 1971</xref>). Six days after the progenitor cell’s last cell cycle, immature OSNs differentiate into mature OSNs and express markers of maturation, such as olfactory marker protein (OMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2015</xref>). Upon maturation, they form multiple cilia at the apical end of the dendrite, and their nuclei migrate towards the apical surface in the days to weeks that follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In OSNs, centrioles must be moved to the apical surface of the olfactory epithelium to assemble sensory cilia where they will have access to odorants. Many cell types across a variety of organisms are known to relocate or reorient their centrioles, including ciliating vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dawe et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> nurse cells in the germarium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mahowald and Strassheim, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolvar et al., 2001</xref>), and macrociliary cells in the comb jelly <italic>Beroe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tamm and Tamm, 1988</xref>). A particularly relevant example is the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> PQR neuron, in which a single centriole migrates approximately 5 μm along the dendrite by the activity of the minus-end directed microtubule motor, dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to the PQR neuron, vertebrate OSNs each contain multiple centrioles, move those centrioles over a 10-fold greater distance, and develop throughout the life of the animal, which frequently requires centrioles to migrate through an established epithelium. Despite these biologically interesting challenges, the mechanisms of movement and the molecular composition of migrating OSN centrioles are not known.</p><p>Here, we develop new techniques for imaging and manipulating OSNs and use these to explore the mechanisms by which multiple centrioles migrate and become competent to form the multiple cilia that are important for the sensory function of OSNs. Our findings inform our understanding of OSN cell biology, as well as long-range organelle movement more broadly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of migrating and mature centrioles in the olfactory epithelium</title><p>The olfactory epithelium is composed of multiple cell types, including OSNs and non-neuronal cell types known as sustentacular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the migration of OSN centrioles, we imaged them in fixed olfactory epithelium taken from mice expressing eGFP-centrin2, a component of centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bangs et al., 2015</xref>).

We were able to reproducibly expand these samples approximately four-fold and could resolve olfactory cilia in mature OSNs, as well as migrating centrioles in immature OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>) by staining for acetylated tubulin, which marks centrioles, cilia, and, more faintly, the microtubules of the dendrite. <italic>En face</italic> imaging of the dendritic knob using expansion microscopy identified groups of centrioles at the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Side views of the olfactory epithelium identified groups of migrating centrioles positioned below the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>With the increased resolution afforded by expansion microscopy, we counted centriole number in progenitor cells and mature OSNs by staining for acetylated tubulin and using a semi-automated volume segmentation and counting pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We found that basally positioned progenitor cells with amplified centrioles harbored, on average, approximately 26 centrioles (SEM = 2.234; standard deviation = 9.992; n = 20 cells from two mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In mature OSNs that had completed centriole migration with centrioles docked at the dendritic knob, each cell had, on average, approximately 36 centrioles (SEM = 1.665; standard deviation = 8.156, n = 24 dendritic knobs from two mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We imaged growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a marker of immature OSNs and some progenitor cells, to observe the extent of dendrites during outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McIntyre et al., 2010</xref>). We observed centrioles in partially elongated dendrites, indicating that the dendrite does not fully extend prior to centriole migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The leading portions of the dendrites had a variety of growth cone morphologies, and centriole groups lagged behind the end of the dendrite by as much as 8.4 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, mean = 3.68 µm, SEM = 0.80 µm, standard deviation = 2.76 µm, n = 12 dendrites, N = 2 animals). By probing for β-tubulin III (TUBB3), a tubulin isotype expressed primarily in neurons, we observed that microtubules were present both apical to and basal to the migrating centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These data indicate that the leading group of centrioles migrates in tandem with dendrite extension and can be followed by lagging groups within the dendrite.</p><p>We established an <italic>ex vivo</italic> live imaging system for dissected olfactory epithelium to begin to assess the mechanisms by which centrioles migrate. To measure rates of centriole movement in the final stage of migration, we used time-lapse confocal microscopy to image migrating eGFP-centrin2-labeled centrioles. Flattened olfactory epithelium was mounted on agarose pads and imaged <italic>en face</italic> immediately after dissection. Z-stacks were acquired to track the movement of centriole groups in the apical 15–25 µm of the epithelium. We found that the cells in the excised olfactory epithelium remained intact, with normal nuclear morphology and few delaminating cells over the time course of imaging. Considering net movement over the course of the sequences, centriole groups moved slowly, with the fastest moving at approximately 0.18 µm/min (n = 22 centriole groups, N = 3 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Most centriole groups exhibited net movement in the apical direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>, n = 14 out of 22 groups observed), although approximately one-third had either net movement in the basal direction or no movement during the imaging period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>, n = 8 out of 22 groups observed).</p><p>Our results show that centrioles often migrate in groups, moving relatively slowly towards the apical end of the dendrite. How might these groups of centrioles remain together during migration? Centrioles in dividing cells are kept in close proximity by two forms of linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breslow and Holland, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nigg and Stearns, 2011</xref>). Newly formed centrioles are attached to their associated mother centriole by an engagement linker, which is broken by passage through mitosis, and disengaged centrioles are linked by cohesion fibers. Our inability to resolve the centriole-centriole relationships that define engagement in the migrating groups due to tight packing within the narrow dendrite prevents us from being able to determine whether the engagement link is responsible for their grouping. However, we consider it unlikely that all centrioles are held together this way, based on our previous results showing that centriole amplification is initiated prior to mitotic divisions in progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ching and Stearns, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Given that centriole engagement is unlikely to be the major determinant of grouping, we tested whether grouping is mediated by centriole cohesion. Cohesion fibers contain rootletin (CROCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>), which is also a component of the striated rootlet that anchors centrioles bearing cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). We performed expansion microscopy to detect rootletin on centrioles. Strikingly, migrating centrioles lacked rootletin signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that these groups are not held together by rootletin-based cohesion fibers. We also observed that migrating centrioles not only move in multiple groups, but that some centrioles are not grouped at all, localizing singly between migrating groups in immature OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The rootletin antibody did detect rootlets associated with centrioles in mature OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as well as cohesion fibers in tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Menco et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McClintock et al., 2008</xref>).

During this maturation process, they lose proteins associated with the early steps of centriole formation, including components of the cartwheel, and acquire proteins associated with microtubule nucleation, as well as distal and subdistal appendages. To understand the progression of centriole maturation in the olfactory epithelium, we examined proteins associated with centriole formation and microtubule nucleation in progenitors, immature OSNs, and mature OSNs.</p><p>First, we examined the procentriole markers STIL (SCL/Tal1 interrupting locus protein) and SASS6 (spindle assembly abnormal protein 6) using expansion microscopy. In cycling mammalian cells grown in culture, these proteins are present during procentriole formation in S-phase and are lost from centrioles in mitosis following centriole disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arquint and Nigg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Strnad et al., 2007</xref>). In the olfactory epithelium, both STIL and SASS6 were present on amplifying centrioles in progenitors and localized to the proximal end of newly formed centrioles, supporting the model that these proteins are involved in centriole amplification from rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Remarkably, STIL and SASS6 are retained on at least some of the migrating centrioles in immature OSNs and are associated with the presumptive proximal end of these centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In mature OSNs, STIL and SASS6 are absent from centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Together, these results suggest that immature procentrioles are capable of migrating, while the dendritic knob is primarily formed of mature centrioles that lack STIL and SASS6.</p><p>In many differentiated neurons, centrioles lose the microtubule nucleating capability that allows them to function as centrosomes. PCM proteins involved in microtubule organization, including gamma-tubulin, CDK5RAP2 (CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 2), and pericentrin (PCNT), are reduced at centrosomes in these neurons and relocalized to non-centrosomal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leask et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stiess et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yonezawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sánchez-Huertas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilkes and Moore, 2020</xref>). We were interested in assessing the association of PCM proteins with centrioles in OSNs. We first probed for the microtubule nucleator gamma-tubulin using expansion microscopy. In both progenitor cells with amplifying centrioles and in immature OSNs, gamma-tubulin localizes to a diffuse cloud around centriole barrels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In mature, fully ciliated OSNs, gamma-tubulin was also associated with centrioles. Next, we determined the localization of CDK5RAP2 and pericentrin, PCM proteins involved in recruiting and activating gamma-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delaval and Doxsey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Both CDK5RAP2 and pericentrin are present in progenitor cells with amplifying centrioles, as well as migrating centrioles in immature OSNs. In dendritic knobs, CDK5RAP2 was present, while pericentrin signal decreased. Our data show that groups of migrating OSN centrioles remain associated with microtubule nucleation proteins and PCM, in contrast to the centrioles of many other types of mammalian neurons. This is similar to MMCCs, where amplified centrioles were also reported to have associated PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jurczyk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vladar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Immature OSNs form a single cilium from the parental centriole</title><p>We next used expansion microscopy to examine the events associated with arrival of the centrioles at the dendritic knob and formation of cilia.

We supposed that this reflected an inherent asymmetry in centriole states, such that only one centriole is competent to form a cilium at this stage prior to formation of the full complement of cilia. Ciliogenesis is a multistep process that, in many organisms, requires a mature centriole to bear distal and subdistal appendages. To assess distal appendage acquisition, we used expansion microscopy to image CEP164 (centrosomal protein 164), a distal appendage protein required for ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cajanek and Nigg, 2014</xref>).

Based on our previous results regarding centriole amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ching and Stearns, 2020</xref>), we hypothesized that in progenitor cells a single, mature, parental centriole segregates to each daughter cell, whereas the newly amplified centrioles remain immature and do not acquire appendages. In support of this hypothesis, we found that both in migrating centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) and in centrioles in the process of amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), only a single centriole was found to have distal and subdistal appendages. These data suggest that the centriole modifications required to make cilia occur after centriole migration during OSN differentiation, and that the already-modified parental centriole is able to make a cilium before all other centrioles. The temporal progression of centriole maturation is consistent with the presence of markers of immature centrioles on some migrating centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>).</p><p>In tracheal MMCCs, the parental centriole retains its unique structural characteristics even in mature cells after all cilia form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, the parental centriole has a radial array of subdistal appendages, in contrast to all other centrioles, which bear a single basal foot. Radial subdistal appendages and basal feet share molecular components, but can be distinguished by the arrangement of these components around centrioles. To test whether the parental centriole could be distinguished from the other centrioles in mature OSNs, we stained for the shared component centriolin using expansion microscopy. In migrating centrioles, centriolin was present on only one centriole, surrounding that centriole in a subdistal appendage-like pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In cells in which this centriole formed a single cilium, centriolin retained this subdistal appendage-like pattern around the base of the cilium, while other centrioles had acquired single puncta of centriolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In mature OSNs with multiple cilia, one centriole was surrounded by centriolin, whereas the other centrioles still had only single foci of centriolin, consistent with basal feet as observed in multiciliated epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We conclude that in OSNs, as in multiciliated epithelial cells, the cilium nucleated by the parental centriole has unique structural characteristics compared to the other cilia at the mature dendritic knob.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Microtubule dynamics are necessary for centriole migration in OSNs</title><p>Microtubules are a critical component of the neuron cytoskeleton, involved in neurite structure and transport.

We found that EdU, which labels newly replicated DNA, incorporated into nuclei near the basal lamina in the explant, indicating that cells were able to replicate DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). In addition, many of the EdU-positive cells appeared to have amplified centrioles, in accordance with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ching and Stearns, 2020</xref>). We treated explants with EdU at two time points, 1 and 6 hr post-dissection, and found that the number of EdU-positive nuclei increased from 0.63 nuclei per 100 µm basal length of epithelium to 0.96 nuclei per 100 µm of epithelium (total lengths quantitated = 634.84 µm and 621.52 µm for 1 and 6 hr, respectively). Treatment during the time course did not affect overall morphology of the olfactory epithelium. These results demonstrate that cells in the explant cultures can synthesize DNA and amplify centrioles, and that the culture retains its characteristic architecture during the time course. This early step in OSN development, in combination with our live <italic>ex vivo</italic> imaging of the end of centriole migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), suggests that many aspects of OSN differentiation continue to occur in the hours after olfactory epithelium is removed from the animal.</p><p>Next, we used this explant culture system to assess the role of microtubules and microtubule dynamics in centriole migration. To characterize migration, we used a scoring method derived in part from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulvaney and Heist, 1971</xref>, in which the authors use the stereotyped positioning of the sustentacular cells to define centriole position in OSNs. We defined the subapical compartment (sustentacular cells and OSN dendrites in final stage of extension) as the space between the bottom of the sustentacular cell nuclei, and the middle and basal compartment (progenitors and OSN dendrites in early stage of extension) as the space between the actin-rich apical domain and the bottom of the sustentacular cell nuclei and the basal lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In observing samples fixed prior to placement on filters, we noticed a high degree of variability in the number of migrating centriole groups between samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), though all samples contained more centriole groups were found in the subapical compartment than in the middle and basal region, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulvaney and Heist, 1971</xref>). To prevent this variability from obscuring migration defects, we analyzed paired samples in which one half of the septum received drug treatment and the other half from the same animal was treated with DMSO as a control. Olfactory epithelium treated with 10 µg/mL nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules showed only a subtle change in the number of migrating centriole groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This may reflect that in OSNs, as is the case in many types of neurons, a portion of the microtubules are stable, even under depolymerizing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baas et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To test if the dynamic nature of microtubules is necessary for normal migration of centriole groups, we treated explant cultures for 1 hr or 6 hr with paclitaxel (taxol), a microtubule stabilizing drug, or DMSO as a vehicle control. Treatment with DMSO or paclitaxel for 1 hr or 6 hr did not affect overall tissue morphology, including the actin-rich apical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). In all conditions, more centriole groups were found in the subapical compartment than in the middle and basal region, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulvaney and Heist, 1971</xref>), and suggesting that the explant cultures recapitulate this aspect of <italic>in vivo</italic> development. We scored the number of migrating centriole groups in distinct regions of the olfactory epithelium with paclitaxel treatment. In sum, we found that upon treatment with paclitaxel, more centriole groups were found in the subapical and middle/basal compartments, likely in transit (p=0.0084 by paired permutation test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To resolve the basis for this effect, we compared the 1 hr and 6 hr treatment samples. At the 1 hr time point, explants treated with paclitaxel had only slightly more (1.38-fold) centriole groups in the subapical compartment than control (N = 2 animals, n = 39 and 29 centriole groups, total basal lengths quantitated = 905.37 µm and 988.17 µm for paclitaxel and DMSO, respectively). In contrast, after 6 hr of paclitaxel treatment, the subapical compartment had 2.58-fold more centriole groups compared to control (N = 2 animals, n = 70 and 29 centriole groups, total basal lengths quantitated = 1019.76 µm and 1126.44 µm for paclitaxel and DMSO, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The accumulation of centriole groups with paclitaxel treatment, particularly in the subapical compartment, suggests that microtubule dynamicity is required for centriole groups to complete their progression to the apical membrane.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>OSNs in vertebrates have a morphology specialized for their role, with an array of sensory cilia at the tip of a dendrite. We showed previously that the centrioles required to form these cilia are produced in progenitor cells that undergo centriole amplification and divide before becoming OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ching and Stearns, 2020</xref>). Here, we have examined centriole migration and maturation in OSNs, with a focus on the unique biology of OSNs. We established new techniques for manipulating and studying the olfactory epithelium, applying expansion microscopy, live imaging, and an explant system. These will be useful for future experiments on the cells of this tissue, important for their sensory role and as a point of entry for respiratory infection.</p><p>Our results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Progenitor cells, located near the basal lamina of the olfactory epithelium, amplify centrioles from an initial pair. The progenitor cell divides and the daughter cell differentiates into an immature OSN, which extends a dendrite towards the apical surface. Centrioles migrate in multiple groups within a single dendrite in immature OSNs. The leading group of centrioles moves in tandem with dendrite extension and can be followed by lagging groups. Centriole groups move relatively slowly towards the apical end of the dendrite. The maximum rate observed indicates that centrioles could take greater than 9.26 hr to traverse an epithelium 100 µm thick. This timing is well within the multiple days required for dividing progenitors to give rise to fully mature OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McClintock et al., 2020</xref>). During migration, most of the centrioles retain markers associated with immature centrioles and lack the appendages required to make cilia. The exception is a single migrating centriole, presumably an original parental centriole, which has appendages and is able to form a single cilium in the dendritic knob, prior to the others. Finally, most centrioles acquire distal and subdistal appendages and form the dozens of olfactory cilia found in the mature OSN. The parental centriole retains structural characteristics that differentiate it from the other centrioles within the same cell.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Summary of centriole migration and maturation during olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) differentiation.</title><p>Diagram summarizing the migration and maturation of centrioles over the course of OSN differentiation.

Newly formed centrioles lacking appendages are represented as green dots, centrioles with appendages as magenta dots, and the parental centriole as a magenta dot with a yellow outline. After centriole amplification and mitosis in the progenitor, the immature OSN extends a dendrite toward the apical surface. Centrioles migrate primarily in groups during dendrite elongation. At the apical surface, a single cilium forms from the appendage-bearing, parental centriole, before multiple cilia form in the mature OSN.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74399-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We previously showed that centrioles in OSNs are amplified, at least in part, by formation of centriole rosettes in progenitor cells, without deuterosomes like those seen in MMCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ching and Stearns, 2020</xref>). Here, we exploited the resolution afforded by expansion microscopy to precisely count centrioles, finding that the number of centrioles during migration and in mature OSNs was even higher than previously reported, with a mean of approximately 36 centrioles in the latter. The number of centrioles was similar for both states, suggesting that all centriole amplification takes place prior to the initiation of migration and dendrite extension. This is a higher number of centrioles than reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uytingco et al., 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ukhanov et al., 2022</xref>; this could be due to differences in microscopy and counting methods, regional differences in the mouse olfactory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Challis et al., 2015</xref>), or variation between animals. Based on the new evidence we present here, a parsimonious explanation for how OSNs achieve their final centriole number is that amplification is initiated by rosette formation around the two parental centrioles in progenitor cells, followed by a single mitotic division and centriole disengagement from the rosettes, and further amplification in post-mitotic cells that become OSNs.</p><p>OSNs are, to our knowledge, unique in that they undergo a mitotic division with amplified centrioles, which is then followed by further amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ching and Stearns, 2020</xref>). Thus, an immature OSN potentially has centrioles of three different ages: the parental centriole, amplified centrioles formed prior to mitosis, and those that may have formed after mitosis. We found that some of the amplified centrioles in immature OSNs have nucleation-associated proteins of the PCM, including gamma-tubulin, CDK5RAP2, and pericentrin, consistent with a portion of the amplified centrioles having undergone the centriole-to-centrosome conversion as described in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, some of the centrioles in immature OSNs have the cartwheel components SASS6 and STIL, as might be expected for those centrioles formed after the mitotic division, whereas all centrioles lack these components in mature OSNs.</p><p>Centrioles in mature OSNs have the proteins associated with rootlets, distal appendages, and subdistal appendages/basal feet, typical of centrioles underlying cilia in other multiciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Brenner, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Menco et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McClintock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sorokin, 1968</xref>). It is interesting that the final modification of the non-parental centrioles with these components in OSNs appears to be controlled spatially and/or temporally, by their arrival in the forming dendritic knob, as they were absent on migrating centrioles in immature OSNs. This might occur, for example, by localized translation or accumulation of the protein components of these structures, or by temporal control of the expression of those components. In cycling mammalian cells grown in culture, centriole maturation is driven by cell cycle progression and the activity of PLK1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shukla et al., 2015</xref>). In MMCCs, low-level activation of mitotic kinases is important for centriole amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Jord et al., 2017</xref>). In OSNs, it is possible that centriole maturation is also controlled by PLK1 and other mitotic regulators, with the added element of spatiotemporal control. Interestingly, it has also been shown that loss of centrin-2 results in fewer cilia on OSNs as well as more OSNs with centrioles below the apical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ying et al., 2014</xref>). This would be consistent with a defect in acquisition of appendages, although the mechanism by which centrin-2 affects centriole docking is unclear.</p><p>The presumptive parental centriole differed from all others in OSNs in having subdistal and distal appendage proteins prior to its migration to the dendrite tip. This was apparent during migration of centrioles and in the early stage of cilium formation when only this centriole was associated with a cilium. The presence of a single cilium before formation of the full complement of multiple cilia might enable signaling important for OSN differentiation, as has been proposed for the primary cilium of MMCCs that precedes multiciliated differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jain et al., 2010</xref>), although we note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwarzenbacher et al., 2005</xref> found that the earliest OSN cilia formed lack olfactory receptors. The parental centriole retained a radial array of the subdistal appendage component centriolin even in the mature OSN, whereas all other centrioles had a single focus of centriolin, consistent with them having basal feet. This is remarkably similar to the situation in MMCCs in which a single parental centriole also differed from other centrioles and was associated with what was termed a ‘hybrid cilium’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). It is unclear what prevents the parental centriole from forming a cilium prior to reaching the dendritic knob, although it might be due to the same spatiotemporal regulation that we postulated to control centriole maturation.</p><p>How do centrioles migrate from the cell body to the tip of the dendrite? Our work rules out several possibilities. First, centrioles within a single cell often travel in multiple groups separated by relatively long distances along the dendrite. This excludes the possibility that forces act upon only a single centriole, for instance, the parental centriole. Second, our data also exclude the possibility that centrioles might migrate by docking to membranes as only the presumptive parental centriole bears the distal appendages required for membrane association during migration. Third, migrating centrioles lack rootletin, ruling out models in which centrioles are moved by attachment of centriolar rootlets to actin filaments, as observed during macrociliary cell development in the comb jelly <italic>Beroe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tamm and Tamm, 1988</xref>).</p><p>Our data support a model in which the microtubule cytoskeleton is critical for centriole migration. Using a novel explant system, we found that inhibiting microtubule dynamics disrupts centriole migration to the apical surface. In this respect, OSNs are similar to MMCCs of the oviduct, in which paclitaxel-mediated stabilization of microtubules does not affect centriole biogenesis, but can inhibit centriole migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lemullois et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boisvieux-Ulrich et al., 1989</xref>). Because of the very different cell and tissue architectures in MMCCs compared to OSNs, it is unclear whether the mechanism of inhibition by microtubule stabilization is the same in these cell types. Our establishment of an explant system will be useful for future work in distinguishing the exact mechanisms by which cytoskeletal elements influence centriole migration in OSNs.</p><p>How do forces act upon migrating centrioles? One possibility is that microtubule motors are directly involved in centriole transport. In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ciliated PQR neuron, SAS-5, an ortholog of STIL, directly interacts with a dynein light chain (DLC-1/LC8), suggesting that centrioles may be cargos of cytoplasmic dynein in the dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the rate of migration for the single centriole that migrates in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons is similar to that of mouse OSN centrioles (in OSNs: maximum of 0.18 µm/min; in <italic>C. elegans</italic>: 0.076 µm/min, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that similar mechanisms may drive centriole migration in both contexts. However, dynein motors acting processively exhibit velocities much higher than those observed in OSNs or the PQR neuron, approximately 60 µm/min in cells and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Presley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King and Schroer, 2000</xref>). Thus, dynein might act non-processively and/or interact with centrioles transiently in OSNs. This is reminiscent of slow axonal transport, which drives the anterograde transport of cytoskeletal elements within neuronal axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baas and Buster, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roy, 2020</xref>). Although mechanisms of fast and slow axonal transport were once thought to be distinct, more recent work has indicated that cargos undergoing slow axonal transport interact with the same type of molecular motors, though intermittently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roy, 2020</xref>). Prolonged pauses in transport of centrioles due to motor disengagement or reaching the end of a microtubule track could cause ‘traffic jams’ in the dendrite, resulting in centrioles appearing as groups. Hence, it is plausible that transient interactions similar to slow axonal transport are responsible for centriole movement in OSN dendrites.</p><p>Our finding that microtubule nucleation proteins are present in migrating centrioles suggests another, non-mutually exclusive hypothesis: that migrating centrioles are microtubule organizing centers, with self-nucleated microtubules involved in their motility. Force could be derived from microtubule polymerization itself or by interaction of nucleated microtubules with an existing dendritic microtubule array. In other mammalian neurons, centrioles remain near the nucleus and lose microtubule nucleating proteins as the cell differentiates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leask et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stiess et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yonezawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sánchez-Huertas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilkes and Moore, 2020</xref>). In cycling mammalian cells, PCM nucleates microtubule asters that center and position the centrosome. This occurs through pushing forces driven by microtubule nucleation, and pushing and pulling forces driven by molecular motors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burakov and Nadezhdina, 2020</xref>). Similarly, microtubule nucleation may help orient and position centrioles toward the apical surface in OSNs. This would be consistent with a model in which forces are acting upon multiple centrioles, perhaps even individual centrioles, within the same dendrite.</p><p>In addition to migration within dendrites, the PCM of OSN centrioles might also influence dendrite microtubule organization itself. OSN dendrites have a polarized microtubule cytoskeleton, in which the microtubule minus ends are oriented out, toward the dendritic tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burton, 1985</xref>). This polarity, observed in bullfrog mature OSNs, is in contrast to dendrites of many neurons, which have a mixed polarity. Although the microtubule polarity is not known in the immature mouse OSNs that we study here, an attractive possibility is that the centrioles positioned at the tip of the dendrite function as a centrosome, nucleating microtubules, with their minus ends out. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed that PCM proteins are present at centrioles in both immature and mature OSNs. An interesting parallel is that microtubule polarity in dendrites of non-ciliated <italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD neurons is established by a non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center that is present at the dendritic tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liang et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that this may be a conserved mechanism of establishing and maintaining microtubule polarity in dendrites.</p><p>Finally, we have focused here on microtubule-based mechanisms, but acknowledge that other mechanisms, for example, based on the actin cytoskeleton, might also be important for centriole migration and docking in OSN dendrites. We expect that the new techniques for manipulating and studying the olfactory epithelium that we describe will facilitate further research into these and other questions about how multiple centrioles and cilia are formed in OSNs and participate in their structure and function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Olfactory epithelium samples were taken from both male and female mice, euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, for all experiments.

All stainings were performed at least twice, in olfactory epithelium taken from both a male and a female mouse. After initial snout removal, fine dissection was performed in a dish of cold Tyrode’s solution (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM glucose in ddH<sub>2</sub>O), as in other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oberland and Neuhaus, 2014</xref>) and at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/katieching/Protocols">http://github.com/katieching/Protocols</ext-link>. Whole olfactory epithelia, turbinate epithelia, or septum epithelia were fixed immediately in 4% PFA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C for 3–24 hr. Samples were then washed in PBS and stored at 4°C. Before mounting, samples were equilibrated in 1–5 mL of 30% sucrose solution in water for a minimum of 12 hr at 4°C. Samples were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Tissue-Tek) on dry ice and stored at –80°C. Embedded samples were sectioned at 14 µm on a Leica cryostat and adhered to charged slides by drying at room temperature for approximately 1 hr. Slides were stored with drying pearls (Thermo Fisher) at –80°C and thawed under desiccation no more than twice. Sections were outlined with a hydrophobic pen. Residual-free aldehydes were quenched while samples were rehydrated in PBS with 0.3 M glycine, 1% calf serum, and 0.1% Triton-x 100 for 0.5 hr at room temperature. Samples were blocked and permeabilized for an additional 0.5–4 hr in PBS with 1% calf serum and 0.1% Triton-x 100. Antibodies were also diluted in PBS with 1% calf serum and 0.1% Triton-x 100 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Slides were incubated with primary antibodies for approximately 3 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, washed in PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies for approximately 1 hr at room temperature, washed in PBS, incubated in DAPI diluted 1:1000 for 5 min, washed in PBS, and mounted in MOWIOL. Where phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 was used, it was included at the secondary antibody step at a 1:1000 dilution (Molecular Probes). Where EdU was used, incorporation was visualized using the Click-iT Alexa Fluor 594 kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Probes). Slides were imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy, and images were acquired with the SlideBook software by Intelligent Imaging Innovations (3i). Images were processed in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Images are rotated to orient the apical surface toward the top of the page. For images with high background, contrast in the representative images was adjusted uniformly across the image such that the area outside of cells was black and areas of high signal were just below saturation.

All stainings were performed at least twice in olfactory epithelium taken from both a male and a female mouse. Samples were embedded in OCT (Sakura Tissue-Tek) on dry ice and stored at –80°C. Embedded samples were sectioned at 14 µm thickness on a Leica cryostat, placed on charged glass slides within a border pre-drawn with hydrophobic pen, and allowed to thaw for 1 min. Sections were then washed three times in PBS for approximately 5 min per wash. PBS was removed, and sections were incubated in a monomer fixative solution (0.7% formaldehyde and 1% w/v acrylamide in water) for 2 hr at room temperature. Sections were washed once in monomer solution (19% w/v sodium acrylate, 10% w/v acrylamide, and 0.1% BIS in PBS). Solution was removed, and slides containing sections were inverted onto droplets of cold gelation solution (monomer solution with TEMED and ammonium persulfate added to a final concentration of 0.5% each). Stacks of approximately five coverslips were used as spacers to achieve the desired gel thickness. Gels were set for 5 min on ice and then overnight at room temperature in a sealed chamber with wet paper towels. Slides with gels attached were incubated at 95°C in a large volume of denaturation buffer (200 mM SDS, 200 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris in water) for approximately 4–6 hr. Gels were washed and then pre-expanded in water overnight. Gels were then incubated in PBS for at least 30 min. Gels were incubated in primary antibody solution in PBS with or without 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton-x100 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) overnight on a nutator at 4°C. Gels were washed three times in PBS for 10–30 min per wash and then incubated in a solution of secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluors plus DAPI, diluted 1:500 or 1:1000, overnight with gentle agitation at 4°C. Gels were washed in PBS for at least 30 min, then in water three times for 30 min per wash. Gels were then allowed to fully expand in water for at least an hour before mounting in a glass-bottom imaging dish and imaging by spinning disk confocal microscopy. Native fluorescence signal from eGFP and mCherry was not preserved. As needed, gels were imaged in a poly-lysine-coated dish to reduce sample movement during acquisition. Centriole counts were semi-automated: an initial volume segmentation was performed in Imaris, followed by manual inspection.

The procedure for mounting was partly based on work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 2014</xref>. For this study, dissected samples were pulled onto a coverslip containing an agarose pad made of 1% low-melt agarose (Lonza #50100) dissolved in Tyrode’s buffer. The coverslip with the sample was then inverted into the center of an imaging dish containing 150 µL of imaging buffer (Tyrode’s with 5% cosmic calf serum and 5 µg/mL Hoechst 34580 [Invitrogen #H21486], mixed by pipette and vortexed) and allowed to sit for at least 5 min before imaging. Coverslips were sealed into place with melted Vaseline as needed. Samples were imaged <italic>en face</italic> by spinning disk confocal microscopy at approximately 37°C with low laser power until no more than 4 hr after euthanasia. Files were acquired and scored using the SlideBook software by Intelligent Imaging Innovations (3i). For scoring, centriole groups below the apical surface were identified in a 4D volume view and measured in a maximum intensity projection over the y-axis with respect to a group of nearby mature OSN centrioles as a fiducial mark. Locations for each group were scored in the first and last frame during which they were visible in the maximum projection, and average rates were calculated from the difference between those measurements. Kymograph analysis was performed using Dynamic Kymograph in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Culture and analysis of septum explants grown on air-liquid interface</title><p>Details about growing and scoring olfactory epithelium explants can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/katieching/Protocols">http://github.com/katieching/Protocols</ext-link> and are partly based on the procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oberland and Neuhaus, 2014</xref>. In brief, septum epithelia from 1- to 4-month-old mice were dissected mechanically in cold Tyrode’s buffer and placed apical side up on transwell polycarbonate filters with 0.4 µm pore size with the bottom compartment containing additional Tyrode’s buffer. All experiments were performed in explants taken from both male and female mice. Once all samples were placed, buffer was aspirated from the bottom compartment and replaced with warm explant medium (15% fetal bovine serum and 0.02% L-ascorbic acid in Waymouth’s media; Thermo Fisher Scientific #11220035; based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farbman, 1977</xref>). No medium was added to the top compartment, preserving the air-liquid interface. Relevant treatments (10 µM EdU [Thermo Fisher Scientific #A10044], 15 µM paclitaxel [EMD Millipore #580555], 10 µg/mL nocodazole [Thermo Fisher #AC358240500], or an equivalent volume of DMSO) were mixed into media by pipetting and vortexing before addition. Samples were incubated in a 33°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, humidified incubator for 1 hr or 6 hr before forceps were used to transfer them from the filters to 4% PFA in PBS for overnight fixation. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, samples within each replicate were obtained from the same animal. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>, samples were matched such that explants taken from the two conditions came from the same animal at the same time point. Where explants were taken from the same animal, conditions were randomized between the right and left halves of the septum. Samples were then washed and processed by the same method of immunofluorescent staining described above. To score explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), sample size was selected by (1) measuring the average length between areas of high amplification (approximately 250 µm), (2) scoring a length greater than that for the condition with the most limited sample, and (3) scoring progressively (i.e., not selecting regions) along the epithelium of all other conditions until the length was matched. For all experiments except nocodazole treatment, this was then repeated in samples from the opposite sex. Differences in the number of centriole groups were evaluated by a paired permutation test in R in which each category (e.g., animal 1, number of subapical groups at t = 1 hr) was treated as a pair of data points (drug vs. control), and resampling was simulated 10,000 times.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers were impressed by the technical advances and beautiful data obtained by expansion microscopy, but felt the study was primarily descriptive and needed some additional mechanistic insight for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In consultation, the reviewers felt it would be most straightforward to better define the role of microtubules in centriole migration. Specifically,</p><p>1) Extend inhibitor treatments to include nocodazole.</p><p>2) Define the orientation of MT plus and minus ends during migration. This would indicate whether migrating centrioles nucleate MTs in an oriented manner and test the hypothesis that &quot;migrating centrioles are microtubule organizing centers, with self-nucleated microtubules involved in their motility&quot;.</p><p>3) Provide a more in depth characterization of the relationship between dendrite extension and centriole migration, as the reviewers felt these data were less convincing than data throughout the rest of the paper.</p><p>Full reviews from all three reviewers are included below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The live imaging experiments measure the centriole migration rate as 0.18 μm per min. So it should take about 9 hours for them to traverse the whole distance. Is that timing consistent with the known development of these neurons and other observations? Can the authors comment on this in the discussion?</p><p>2. Figure 2B examines centrioles in immature OSNs to determine whether migration coincides with, or follows dendrite extension. I'm not really sure what I'm looking at in these images. It is not very clear that this is an extending/not fully extended dendrite. Compared to other images in this paper, this one is not particularly convincing.</p><p>3. Figure 5 characterizes the migration defect upon paclitaxel treatment, but I feel this data could be improved in its presentation. Provide an indication of where the boundaries of basal, middle and subapical positions are scored within a schematic or better yet representative image. Also providing the number of centrioles in each category at time=0 would also be helpful. Is the a decrease in the number of fully apically-docked centrioles? I'm trying to get an idea of what percentage of centrioles would have been migrating during this 6 hour time period and how many of these are affected by the MT stabilizing drug.</p><p>4. Is the mature, presumptive parental, centriole ever observed in a lagging cluster? Or is there reason to think it initiates the migration?</p><p>5. To address concerns about the descriptive nature of the study, and provide some mechanistic insight into some aspect of this fascinating cell biology, the discussion mentions the possibility that Plk1 could control the timing of centriole maturation. Inhibitors of cell cycle kinases work well in explant cultures. The authors could test this hypothesis directly in explant culture, and I don't think it would be beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The ALI culture is really impressive and important but I think needs a little more data to justify its usefulness. While the authors have shown nicely that there is still some proliferation (based on EdU), I am not sure that they have sufficiently shown that the whole migration process is actually happening. While this is somewhat inferred from the taxol data it is an important aspect to this experimental paradigm that should be more clearly shown.</p><p>2. The MT analysis seems very preliminary. &quot;Our finding that microtubule nucleation proteins are present on migrating centrioles suggests another, non-mutually exclusive hypothesis: that migrating centrioles are microtubule organizing centers, with self-nucleated microtubules involved in their motility&quot;….I think this is very likely and really should be addressed. I think a deeper analysis (see point 3) and additional drug treatments (eg nocodazole) are necessary. While genetic analysis of motors would be exciting and likely to yield interesting results it is appreciated that this is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>3. OSN dendrites have a polarized microtubule cytoskeleton, in which the microtubule minus ends are oriented out, toward the dendritic tips (Burton, 1985)…While Burtons work is certainly beautiful, I think the relevant question here is what is the orientation of MTs during migration. One might not expect (-) ends at the OSN dendrite until centrioles arrive. Do migrating centrioles nucleate MTs in an oriented manner? This seems critical to determine the role of MTs in centriole migration. Additionally, what does the MT network look like during this centriole migration. I think better imaging of MTs/(-) end markers and (+) end markers would help explain the role of MTs in this process better.</p><p>4. Do the dendritic knobs position properly in the absence of centrioles / MTs. Perhaps this is known but it was unclear to me from the data and it seems important to know if the dendrites are positioned prior to centriole migration or do the first wave of centrioles act as leaders that push (or pull) the dendrite to its proper site (as is sort of drawn in the cartoon).</p><p>5. &quot;the subapical region, and the middle and basal region (regions marked in Figure 1A)&quot; ….please explain how these were defined experimentally.</p><p>6. The quantifications need statistical analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>One of the most interesting aspects highlighted by the authors in this and their previous study is the atypical regulation of centriole assembly in olfactory neuron progenitors. However, some important aspects of these mechanisms remain unclear. As proposed by the authors in the discussion paragraph, it is possible that centrioles are also assembled in immature OSNs. The migrating centrioles would then belong to 3 different generations – a mother centriole, daughter centrioles formed in the previous cycle, and procentrioles formed in the OSNs. This could explain that the number of centrioles is slightly lower in immature OSNs than in mature ones (although this might result from experimental issues, as in Supplementary Figure 1A, centriole labeling appears sometimes incomplete and difficult to interpret), that only some of the migrating centrioles still possess SAS6 and STIL, and that migrating centrioles appear to vary in length (Supplementary Figure 1A, Figure 2A, 3B).</p><p>It would be important to establish whether STIL and SAS-6 labeled centrioles can be formed at the previous cell cycle, or whether they are formed in immature OSNs. Is it possible to analyze immature OSNs in G1 phase? Alternatively, could they use centrinone to block centriole duplication in immature OSNs and determine if this leads to a loss of STIL/SAS6 signaling during migration?</p><p>– The authors propose that there may be spatial control of centriole maturation (e.g., line 393). However, it is also possible that this control is simply temporal. In the first case, inhibition of dendrite extension should block centriole maturation. Is it possible to block dendrite extension and/or centriole migration, for example by using drugs that depolymerize actin or microtubules?</p><p>Regarding the mechanisms underlying centriole migration, the observation that dendrite extend concomitantly to centriole migration is interesting but could be more substantiated. Ideally, this would involve specifically blocking one or the other, which is probably difficult to achieve in this context.

We have tried nocodazole treatment in our explant system, and found that 6 hours of 10 μg/mL nocodazole had a minor effect on centriole migration. These results are summarized in a new supplementary figure (Figure 5 – Supplementary Figure 1). However, it is important to note that in neurons, nocodazole treatment is insufficient to depolymerize all microtubules due to the presence of stabilizing factors (Baas et al., Cytoskeleton 2016). It is likely that these olfactory sensory neurons also harbor a stable population of microtubules that are resistant to nocodazole treatment. We conclude that further work is needed to define the relative roles of the stable and labile microtubule populations in centriole migration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Define the orientation of MT plus and minus ends during migration. This would indicate whether migrating centrioles nucleate MTs in an oriented manner and test the hypothesis that &quot;migrating centrioles are microtubule organizing centers, with self-nucleated microtubules involved in their motility&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this important question. The definitive experiments to address microtubule orientation in OSN dendrites are outside the scope of the current manuscript, as they would involve challenging experiments either to express a fluorescently-tagged microtubule end-binding protein to observe microtubule growth in live OSNs, or to use microtubule hooking experiments in which microtubule polarity in immature OSNs might be observed by electron microscopy. However, we have performed immunofluorescence experiments on fixed tissues to address this question to the best of our ability. In the original manuscript, we find that γ-tubulin is present at migrating centrioles, which marks the location of some microtubule minus ends. In attempting to define the location of microtubule plus-ends, we found that EB1/Mapre1 is expressed in iOSNs using a previously published scRNAseq dataset (Fletcher et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2017). However, a widely-used EB1 antibody did not result in any specific staining in the olfactory epithelium, despite its ability to detect microtubule plus-ends in NIH3T3 cells grown in culture. We summarize these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>EB1 staining in cultured NIH3T3 cells and olfactory epithelium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Mitotic 3T3 cell.

We were able to obtain another GAP43 antibody that greatly improves the visualization of OSN dendrites (antibody previously used in Pluznick et al., PLoS One, 2011 and Rodriguez-Gil et al., J Comp Neurol, 2008). The results are included in a new version of Figure 2. In brief, we find that migrating centrioles lag behind the growth cone by as much as 8.4 μm (average=3.68 μm). We have edited the text in accordance with these new results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Full reviews from all three reviewers are included below.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The live imaging experiments measure the centriole migration rate as 0.18 μm per min. So it should take about 9 hours for them to traverse the whole distance. Is that timing consistent with the known development of these neurons and other observations? Can the authors comment on this in the discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We believe that this timing is consistent with the known development of these neurons, (McClintock et al., Chemical Senses 2020, Rodriguez-Gil et al., PNAS 2015). We have included text about this in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2B examines centrioles in immature OSNs to determine whether migration coincides with, or follows dendrite extension. I'm not really sure what I'm looking at in these images. It is not very clear that this is an extending/not fully extended dendrite. Compared to other images in this paper, this one is not particularly convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the original Figure 2B was not convincing, and have now included a new figure with a new GAP43 antibody. We have also edited the text, as explained above for essential revision 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 5 characterizes the migration defect upon paclitaxel treatment, but I feel this data could be improved in its presentation. Provide an indication of where the boundaries of basal, middle and subapical positions are scored within a schematic or better yet representative image. Also providing the number of centrioles in each category at time=0 would also be helpful. Is the a decrease in the number of fully apically-docked centrioles? I'm trying to get an idea of what percentage of centrioles would have been migrating during this 6 hour time period and how many of these are affected by the MT stabilizing drug.</p></disp-quote><p>We had mistakenly neglected to include this information in the original manuscript, and have now included a new figure, Figure 5 – Supplementary Figure 1A, that indicates the boundaries between the middle/basal and the subapical groups. We believe the best comparison is between t=1 h vs t=6 h, because the t=1 h time point represents a reasonable time for the explant to equilibrate to the culture conditions. Note that these are paired samples, so it was not possible to have a t=0 time point, however, we have also included a new figure, Figure 5 – Supplementary Figure 1B that shows t=0 samples from different mice. Also, we note that the question as to whether fewer centrioles are fully docked under inhibitor treatment conditions is interesting and important, but we have not been able to address that here due to (1) the technical challenge of imaging the apical surface (requires phalloidin staining) and centriole docking (requires expansion microscopy, or preferably an even higher resolution method) simultaneously, and (2) the time points used, which are likely too short to capture loss of mature OSNs and the resulting population-level changes at the apical surface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Is the mature, presumptive parental, centriole ever observed in a lagging cluster? Or is there reason to think it initiates the migration?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not see clear examples of centriole clusters in which the parental centriole was found in the lagging cluster, but there are technical challenges to being able to address this, and we cannot rule out this possibility. The challenge is due to the large distance between lagging and leading clusters and the inability to capture all of a single dendrite in the expanded images required for imaging the markers of centriole maturity. With respect to whether the mature centriole initiates migration, it is possible for a group that contains a mature centriole, although there is only one such centriole per cell so many migrating groups would not have a mature centriole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. To address concerns about the descriptive nature of the study, and provide some mechanistic insight into some aspect of this fascinating cell biology, the discussion mentions the possibility that Plk1 could control the timing of centriole maturation. Inhibitors of cell cycle kinases work well in explant cultures. The authors could test this hypothesis directly in explant culture, and I don't think it would be beyond the scope of the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to test whether Plk1 inhibition could affect centriole maturation. We chose not to pursue these experiments at this time, in part because it would be difficult to validate the extent of Plk1 inhibition given that the effects of Plk1 inhibition are best observed in mitotic cells and there are relatively few such cells in the explants. But we do take the recommendation for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The ALI culture is really impressive and important but I think needs a little more data to justify its usefulness. While the authors have shown nicely that there is still some proliferation (based on EdU), I am not sure that they have sufficiently shown that the whole migration process is actually happening. While this is somewhat inferred from the taxol data it is an important aspect to this experimental paradigm that should be more clearly shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and believe that this system can replicate the important early steps of centriole amplification and migration to the apical surface. By EdU incorporation, we show that DNA synthesis occurs in the explant system. As the reviewer notes, after perturbation of the system with taxol treatment, we show that early steps of migration are occurring in the system. Finally, using live imaging, we also show that late steps of migration, including incorporation into the apical surface, are occurring. We’ve added more text addressing these points in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The MT analysis seems very preliminary. &quot;Our finding that microtubule nucleation proteins are present on migrating centrioles suggests another, non-mutually exclusive hypothesis: that migrating centrioles are microtubule organizing centers, with self-nucleated microtubules involved in their motility&quot;….I think this is very likely and really should be addressed. I think a deeper analysis (see point 3) and additional drug treatments (eg nocodazole) are necessary. While genetic analysis of motors would be exciting and likely to yield interesting results it is appreciated that this is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be helpful to have more information about the microtubule requirement. Please see response to Essential Revision 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. OSN dendrites have a polarized microtubule cytoskeleton, in which the microtubule minus ends are oriented out, toward the dendritic tips (Burton, 1985)…While Burtons work is certainly beautiful, I think the relevant question here is what is the orientation of MTs during migration. One might not expect (-) ends at the OSN dendrite until centrioles arrive. Do migrating centrioles nucleate MTs in an oriented manner? This seems critical to determine the role of MTs in centriole migration. Additionally, what does the MT network look like during this centriole migration. I think better imaging of MTs/(-) end markers and (+) end markers would help explain the role of MTs in this process better.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to Essential Revision 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Do the dendritic knobs position properly in the absence of centrioles / MTs. Perhaps this is known but it was unclear to me from the data and it seems important to know if the dendrites are positioned prior to centriole migration or do the first wave of centrioles act as leaders that push (or pull) the dendrite to its proper site (as is sort of drawn in the cartoon).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting to further explore these possibilities, but have limited ability to do so given the available tools. We can say that the ends of growing dendrites can be far (as much as 8.4 μm in our experiment) from the closest group of centrioles, suggesting that the centrioles don’t “lead from the tip.” However, they could be providing the microtubules required for outgrowth and/or dendrite knob positioning. We did try to perturb microtubules with nocodazole treatment, but can make only limited conclusions because of the likely presence of stable microtubules in the dendrites, as described above. We hope in the future to be able to leverage tools to prevent centriole duplication, ideally specifically in developing OSNs, to directly test the contribution of amplified centrioles to the process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. &quot;the subapical region, and the middle and basal region (regions marked in Figure 1A)&quot; ….please explain how these were defined experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight on our part. We have now described this more fully in the text and in a new figure, Figure 5-Supplementary Figure 1A. See also the response to reviewer 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The quantifications need statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We now included statistical analysis for the taxol treatment. Using all categories for male and female samples, we performed a permutation test on the paired data (see R file referenced in Methods for details). Overall, we found the mean difference between paclitaxel treatment and the DMSO control condition to be 1.38 centriole groups per 100 μm with a p-value of 0.0084 when resampling 10,000 times.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>One of the most interesting aspects highlighted by the authors in this and their previous study is the atypical regulation of centriole assembly in olfactory neuron progenitors. However, some important aspects of these mechanisms remain unclear. As proposed by the authors in the discussion paragraph, it is possible that centrioles are also assembled in immature OSNs. The migrating centrioles would then belong to 3 different generations – a mother centriole, daughter centrioles formed in the previous cycle, and procentrioles formed in the OSNs. This could explain that the number of centrioles is slightly lower in immature OSNs than in mature ones (although this might result from experimental issues, as in Supplementary Figure 1A, centriole labeling appears sometimes incomplete and difficult to interpret), that only some of the migrating centrioles still possess SAS6 and STIL, and that migrating centrioles appear to vary in length (Supplementary Figure 1A, Figure 2A, 3B).</p><p>It would be important to establish whether STIL and SAS-6 labeled centrioles can be formed at the previous cell cycle, or whether they are formed in immature OSNs. Is it possible to analyze immature OSNs in G1 phase? Alternatively, could they use centrinone to block centriole duplication in immature OSNs and determine if this leads to a loss of STIL/SAS6 signaling during migration?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s question is a good one – is the presence of STIL and SAS-6 indicative of the time in OSN differentiation when a given centriole formed? We believe that the most parsimonious explanation for the presence of only some centrioles bearing these markers is that the STIL/SAS-6 labeled centrioles are formed in immature OSNs after mitotic divisions and before (or during) dendrite outgrowth, i.e., they should all be in G1. This is based on both our previous publication about centriole amplification in OSNs (Ching and Stearns, 2020) and the current manuscript. We would very much like to inhibit centriole duplication to address this question, as described above in response to reviewer #2, but have yet to work out the methods to do so (for example, genetic methods, nasal delivery of centrinone, or long-term explant culture, etc.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors propose that there may be spatial control of centriole maturation (e.g., line 393). However, it is also possible that this control is simply temporal. In the first case, inhibition of dendrite extension should block centriole maturation. Is it possible to block dendrite extension and/or centriole migration, for example by using drugs that depolymerize actin or microtubules?</p><p>Regarding the mechanisms underlying centriole migration, the observation that dendrite extend concomitantly to centriole migration is interesting but could be more substantiated. Ideally, this would involve specifically blocking one or the other, which is probably difficult to achieve in this context. Again, is it possible to use cytoskeleton drugs against actin or microtubules to do so? Alternatively, do leading centriole groups sometimes move backwards, and if so, does the dendrite continue extending?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the control of centriole maturation could be temporally regulated, for example as part of the differentiation program of OSNs, and have edited the manuscript to account for this possibility. With respect to uncoupling centriole migration and dendrite outgrowth, we note, as above, that nocodazole treatment is probably not able to depolymerize all microtubules in this system, and depolymerization of actin is likely to alter the overall tissue architecture, and thus was not attempted. In live imaging we do see examples of centriole groups moving backwards or remaining stationary during a period and it would be interesting to ask the fate of the dendrite tip in such cases, but we do not yet have the ability to co-label centrioles and the dendrite membrane for live imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The absence of rootletin labeling in centrioles is used as an argument to exclude a rootlet involvement in migration. However, the labeling is also rather weak in centrioles of mature OSNs. Is it known that the rootlet is poorly developed in these cells (e.g., as seen by EM), or is this due to labeling issues with the antibody used in this study? In this case, it is not clear that developing rootlets would be detected efficiently in migrating centrioles.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, our work represents the first description of ciliary rootlets in OSNs. As reviewed in McClintock et al., Chem Senses (2020), “Although OSNs have been shown to express components of the ciliary rootlet (Yamamoto 1976; McClintock et al. 2008), it is still unknown whether olfactory cilia have a rootlet.” Based on that characterization, which includes the absence of prominent rootlets as one sees in some other ciliated cell types, we believe that the “rather weak” labeling in OSNs probably does reflect the nature of rootlets in this tissue. The antibody that we used does robustly label rootletin in cohesion fibers in cycling cells grown in culture, and we have added a figure showing this (Figure 3- Supplementary Figure 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
