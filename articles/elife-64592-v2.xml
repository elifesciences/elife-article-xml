property that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Cell size homeostasis is brought about by the co-ordination of cell division with cell growth and requires restriction of smaller cells from undergoing mitosis and cell division, whilst allowing larger cells to do so. Cyclin-CDK is the fundamental driver of mitosis and therefore ultimately ensures size homeostasis. Here we dissect determinants of CDK activity in vivo to investigate how cell size information is processed by the cell cycle network in fission yeast. We develop a high-throughput single-cell assay system of CDK activity in vivo and show that inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK encodes cell size information, with the phosphatase PP2A aiding to set a size threshold for division. CDK inhibitory phosphorylation works synergistically with PP2A to prevent mitosis in smaller cells. Finally, we find that diploid cells of equivalent size to haploid cells exhibit lower CDK activity in response to equal cyclin-CDK enzyme concentrations, suggesting that CDK activity is reduced by increased DNA levels. Therefore, scaling of cyclin-CDK levels with cell size, CDK inhibitory phosphorylation, PP2A, and DNA-dependent inhibition of CDK activity, all inform the cell cycle network of cell size, thus contributing to cell size homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>cell size

population cell size by controlling cell size at mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fantes et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ginzberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wood and Nurse, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lloyd, 2013</xref>). This homeostasis is driven by larger cells being more likely to divide than smaller cells, resulting in the correction at cell division of cell size deviances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fantes et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fantes, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patterson et al., 2019</xref>). Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK<sup>Cdc2</sup>) is the master regulator of mitosis and cell division, and therefore the propensity for smaller cells not to divide must ultimately feed into the regulation of CDK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</xref>).</p><p>CDK activity is subject to several mechanisms of control: cyclin synthesis and subsequent binding of cyclin to CDK, which drives CDK into a catalytically competent form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Solomon et al., 1990</xref>; Wee1 kinase and Cdc25 phosphatase act to inhibit or activate CDK, respectively, through regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nurse, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russell and Nurse, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gould and Nurse, 1989</xref>); and PP2A phosphatase works to remove phosphates deposited by CDK reducing its net activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kinoshita et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kinoshita et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mochida et al., 2016</xref>), and also controls the phosphorylation state of Wee1 and Cdc25 to regulate the level of CDK tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lucena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hutter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamenz et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, the CDK control network also co-ordinates cell division with cell growth through an unknown mechanism that responds to cell ploidy, with cell size generally doubling as ploidy doubles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wood and Nurse, 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is likely that potential size control pathways will be integrated at the level of CDK activity control because CDK activity is the driver of mitosis. For example, in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, it has been proposed that size control was mediated by the DYRK kinase Pom1, which ultimately inhibits mitotic onset by causing the inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK by signalling through the Wee1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). However, in both the absence of Pom1 itself or the absence of inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation, cells are able to maintain cell size homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wood and Nurse, 2013</xref>). Thus, there must exist alternative mechanisms by which fission yeast cells integrate cell size information into the CDK control network.</p><p>Much of our understanding of cyclin-CDK network regulation has been derived from in vitro studies, but these have limitations when considering cellular parameters such as cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mochida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pomerening et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pomerening et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sha et al., 2003</xref>). Here, therefore, we have studied in vivo regulation of cyclin-CDK activation at mitosis in the fission yeast. Using a novel CDK activity sensor, we have monitored cell size, CDK activity, and cyclin-CDK complex level simultaneously, whilst genetically varying regulators of the cyclin-CDK control system. We propose that CDK activity regulation through inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation and PP2A work synergistically to communicate information about cell size to the CDK control network. Furthermore, we show that cyclin-CDK complex level scales with cell size, and this aids in the prevention of division in small cells. Finally, we show that in cells lacking PP2A and inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation, haploid and diploid cells of equivalent size and similar cyclin-CDK concentration have differing cyclin-CDK activities, with diploid cells exhibiting a lower activity. This suggests that cyclin-CDK activity is increased in cells of lower ploidy. These experiments inform our understanding of the regulation of cyclin-CDK and illuminate how cell size is integrated into this regulatory network.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Given the complexity of the CDK regulatory network, we have used fission yeast cells containing a reduced CDK control system, with the cell cycle driven by a monomeric cyclin-CDK fusion-protein (C-CDK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</xref>). This simplifies the CDK control network by eliminating cyclin binding to CDK as a regulatory component and allows co-expression of both cyclin and CDK from a single promoter. This C-CDK fusion-protein is expressed under the Cyclin B<sup>Cdc13</sup> promoter, and therefore C-CDK expression mimics endogenous Cyclin B expression. Using this system, inhibitory Wee1-dependent phosphoregulation can also be removed using a non-phosphorylatable C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wood and Nurse, 2013</xref>). These C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> strains are healthy and viable, but have markedly distinct cell cycle profiles from C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> expressing strains, as they spend a significantly longer period in G1 than C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> cells co-ordinate cell division with cell growth and maintain cell size homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wood and Nurse, 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell size and C-CDK concentration dictate probability of division and CDK activity in C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> and C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of major components influencing C-CDK activity at mitosis, and in red, the pathways that do not influence C-CDK<sup>AF</sup>. The negative relationship between C-CDK activity and cell growth refers to the block of cell length extension in mitosis. PP2A opposes CDK activity by dephosphorylating CDK substrates, and also by opposing the activation of CDK at mitosis by opposing the phosphorylation of Wee1 and Cdc25. Reciprocally, CDK causes the downregulation of PP2A activity in mitosis. (<bold>b</bold>) Example cell lineage traces from time-lapse microscopy.

This analysis showed clear oscillations of C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> and C-CDK<sup>AF</sup>, with degradation of C-CDK occurring just before cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> oscillations were more variable, and 5% of the C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> cells trigger C-CDK degradation in the absence of division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), similar to what has been observed in CDK1<sup>AF</sup> expressing human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pomerening et al., 2008</xref>). In both backgrounds, C-CDK concentration scaled with cell size, with C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> exhibiting a higher amount of C-CDK at mitotic entry compared to C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). On investigating the links between the probability of a given cell to divide, cell size, and C-CDK level, we found that for C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> both cell size and C-CDK level reach sharp thresholds at which cell division rates increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). In the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation, a sharp threshold for C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> levels still is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), but occurs at a lower level than C-CDK<sup>WT</sup>. C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> cells fail to generate a sharp threshold for cell size, but even without a clear size threshold, C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> cells still restrict smaller cells from division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>C-CDK level is not a direct measure of C-CDK activity because of the multiple regulatory networks affecting CDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pomerening et al., 2005</xref>). To investigate CDK activity, cell size, and C-CDK level at the same time, we developed an in vivo single-cell assay of CDK activity. We used Cut3, the Smc4 homolog, as a CDK activity biosensor, because it translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus upon CDK-dependent phosphorylation of a single site in its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sutani et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, the Cut3 nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio can be used to assess CDK activity, a method that has been applied to other protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araujo et al., 2016</xref>). As a test of this assay, we blocked cells expressing fluorescently tagged Cut3 in the background of a bulky ATP-analogue-sensitive C-CDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2000</xref>) using 1NM-PP1, and tracked single cells following their release from G2 arrest into a range of 1NM-PP1 doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The response of the maximum nuclear Cut3 concentration to 1NM-PP1 was similar to the one measured in our previous phosphoproteomics study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swaffer et al., 2016</xref>), confirming that the sensor reflects in vivo CDK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). Subsequently, we examined CDK activity in unperturbed cells measured by the Cut3 N/C ratio and showed that it both rises to a higher level in C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> cells in comparison to C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> cells and also that progress through mitosis in C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> cells is slower and more variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated the links between C-CDK protein levels, CDK activity, and cell size in C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> and C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> cells, which have been enlarged beyond their physiological cell size. During a G2/M block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), cell size and C-CDK enzyme concentration (as measured by C-CDK-YFP fluorescence intensity) scaled with each other in both backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j,k</xref>). After the release from CDK inhibition, C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> activity correlated well with both cell size and C-CDK protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l,n</xref>). However, peak C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> activity correlated better with protein level than with cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m,o</xref>). The link between cell size and CDK activity was much clearer for C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> than for C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> in these low-throughput time-lapse assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>). Therefore, we repeated this experiment using a high-throughput assay based on imaging flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>) and observed that peak CDK activity in both C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> and C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> was clearly size dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5e</xref>). Thus, CDK tyrosine phosphorylation helps to inform the cell division machinery of cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,l</xref>). However, in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation, C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> cells are still able to generate a threshold C-CDK level for division and prevent small cells from division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,o</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5e</xref>).</p><p>A complication of the above assay is that cell size scales with C-CDK level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patterson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Navarro and Nurse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,j,k</xref>). To uncouple cell size from C-CDK level, and study if small cells are prevented from entering mitosis due to low C-CDK level or for some other reason, we developed a more flexible single-cell CDK assay system. This assay was also based on Cut3 translocation into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) but used a brighter synthetic C-CDK activity sensor, synCut3-mCherry to allow its co-detection with C-CDK in a high-throughput assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This sensor was expressed in a strain where the endogenous CDK network can be switched off using a temperature-sensitive CDK1 allele, <italic>cdc2<sup>TS</sup></italic>. A tetracycline-inducible C-CDK tagged with superfolder GFP (sfGFP) was constructed and made non-degradable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamano et al., 1998</xref>) as well as sensitive to inhibition by 1NM-PP1. Induction of C-CDK at the <italic>cdc2<sup>TS</sup></italic> restrictive temperature allows the study of the activity of the inducible C-CDK without either wild-type CDK activity or C-CDK-sfGFP proteolysis during mitosis. Using this assay, we acquired hundreds of thousands of images of single cells, which allowed us to study the in vivo biochemistry of CDK activity in response to a wide range of C-CDK concentrations in physiologically sized cells. C-CDK level was uncoupled from cell size as induction of C-CDK was not dependent on cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). Results from this assay demonstrated that in vivo CDK activity was dependent on C-CDK level and was reduced when CDK activity was inhibited using 1NM-PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cell size is able to modulate CDK activity independently of canonical CDK regulation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimental outline for figure for (<bold>b</bold>–<bold>d</bold>).

C-CDK levels increased similarly upon induction in all mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Population mean C-CDK activity was comparable between all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>); however, C-CDK activity displayed differences at the single-cell level when activity was measured in cells of different sizes. In all genetic backgrounds at the same level of C-CDK enzyme, maximum C-CDK activity increases with cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). This is particularly noticeable when directly comparing the maximum C-CDK activity of cells with a C-CDK level of ~750 AU in the 8 μm bin to the 14 μm bin in all backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, dashed lines). The single-cell dose–response of CDK activity on C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> concentration background is clearly bistable, with cells existing in either an ‘on’ or an ‘off’ state. The mean CDK activity is relevant directly for strains expressing C-CDK<sup>AF</sup>, as these cells exhibit little bistability in CDK activation. In the C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> expressing cells, there are two population distributions demonstrating bistability. We averaged the two population means as the gradient of this line shows the degree of bifurcation between the lower and the upper CDK activity populations. The C-CDK concentration required to switch cells ‘on’ decreases with increasing cell size, and the sharpness of the transition increases with size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i,k</xref>). This bistable behaviour is heavily dependent on CDK tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i,k,l</xref>). Removal of PP2A allows the attainment of the ‘on’ state at lower cell sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>), effectively shifting the C-CDK dose–response curve towards lower sizes without altering the shape of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>). In addition, PP2A also adds switch like behaviour to the C-CDK activity dose-response, as bistable behaviour with C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> is not present with C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> PP2AΔ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref> dashed box, inset and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>).</p><p>When looking across all size bins, maximum C-CDK activity increases with cell size in all genetic backgrounds, but plateaus at about 12–13 μm in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>). However, it is clear that cell size is able to regulate C-CDK activity even in the absence of both tyrosine phosphorylation and PP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i,j</xref>). These results are consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), that although tyrosine phosphorylation has a role in informing the cell cycle machinery of cell size, small cells are still restricted from mitosis when tyrosine phosphorylation is absent.</p><p>Inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation directly results in a reduction of intrinsic CDK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry and Gould, 1996</xref>), whilst PP2A has a dual mechanism of CDK activity modulation: PP2A is able to regulate inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation by controlling the phosphorylation state of Wee1 and Cdc25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lucena et al., 2017</xref>), and in addition can directly oppose the phosphorylation of CDK substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Godfrey et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore sought to calculate the contributions of tyrosine phosphorylation and PP2A in restricting CDK activity, both in contexts with and without tyrosine phosphorylation. This was carried out to examine if their combined contribution was greater than the sum of their parts. To calculate the individual contributions of tyrosine phosphorylation and PP2A in restricting C-CDK activity, first we measured the threshold C-CDK level required for 50% of cells to reach a C-CDK activity determined as being &gt;5 in arbitrary units (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend) in different strain backgrounds within different size bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This value was chosen as an approximate value of the C-CDK concentration required in vivo to trigger mitotic entry in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). When this C-CDK threshold level was plotted across all size bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), the threshold was seen to be size dependent in all strain backgrounds, with wild-type cells exhibiting the strongest capacity to raise the C-CDK level threshold for mitosis in smaller cells. By subtracting the curves of cell length vs mitotic C-CDK level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) for various backgrounds, we were able to estimate the contributions of tyrosine phosphorylation and PP2A in a given background. For example, C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> PP2AΔ–C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> PP2AΔ estimates the ability of tyrosine phosphorylation alone to restrict mitotic entry in a background lacking PP2A. Inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation is able to restrict cells with 600 units of C-CDK from entering mitosis at 8 μm cell length, but only 200 units of C-CDK at 10 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, yellow). If the different components of the CDK control network act separately, adding individual threshold contributions together would generate a threshold curve similar to the wild-type curve. However, when the contributions of tyrosine phosphorylation and PP2A were added to the C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> PP2AΔ curve, they did not re-capitulate the wild-type curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Thus, this analysis suggests that there is synergy between the tyrosine phosphorylation network and PP2A activity and that this synergy is important for establishing the C-CDK level threshold for division.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>CDK tyrosine phosphorylation and PP2A act synergistically to restrict division in small cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scatter plots of C-CDK level against CDK activity.

Strikingly however, in the absence of these major regulators, small cells are still able to restrict division by lowering CDK activity as a result of some other factor related to cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h,i,j</xref>). This unknown factor is able to lower CDK activity in small cells despite high C-CDK levels, thus restricting them from division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>).</p><p>Given the positive relationship between maximum C-CDK activity and increasing cell size in the C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> PP2AΔ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>), we hypothesized that cells dilute a CDK inhibitor as they grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fantes et al., 1975</xref>), perhaps through a titration-based mechanism. Cell size is linked to ploidy through an unknown mechanism, and so we tested whether DNA concentration could influence CDK activity, and therefore be a candidate for the unknown factor able to lower C-CDK activity in small cells. We induced C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> in haploid and diploid variants of the C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> PP2AΔ strain, thereby eliminating all major CDK regulation at mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Both haploid and diplod cells were present almost uniformly in G2 after endogenous CDK1 inactivation, as cells with 2C and 4C DNA content respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), and expressed C-CDK<sup>AF</sup>-sfGFP in a largely size-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Strikingly, diploid cells exhibited lower C-CDK activity in response to the same C-CDK enzyme concentration as haploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The EC50 of the diploid dose–response curve was almost double that of the haploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Looking at single-cell, volume-resolved data, the inhibition of C-CDK activity is most marked in smaller diploid cells, with larger diploid cells having almost indistinguishable dose–response curves from their haploid equivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). The effect of cell size on CDK activation is much less marked in larger than normal haploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). The diploids, which feature cells of physiological diploid size, still experience DNA concentration-dependent inhibition of their CDK activity. The effect of equal C-CDK levels resulting in lower C-CDK activity in small diploids when compared to equivalent sized haploids is readily seen from the raw images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Therefore, cells of different ploidies, but otherwise equivalent volume, experience variable CDK activity in response to equal C-CDK level. This suggests that even in the absence of all major CDK regulation, DNA concentration is able to lower CDK activity and prevents division in small cells. At higher volumes, this inhibition of CDK activity disappears, and so the regulation may operate through titrating out an inhibitor.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cellular DNA content inhibits CDK activity independently of tyrosine phosphorylation or PP2A activity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimental outline for panels (<bold>b</bold>)-(<bold>h</bold>).

A number of regulatory components have been shown to be conserved across these model systems, including the CDK-activating cyclin B, inhibitory CDK tyrosine phosphorylation, and the CDK-counteracting PP2A phosphatase which both opposes CDK substrate phosphorylation and regulates CDK inhibitory phosphorylation through the Wee1/Cdc25 control loop. Despite extensive study, these studies have yet to reveal a fully satisfactory mechanism for cell size homeostasis at the onset of mitosis. To improve our understanding of this control system, we have focused on how CDK activity itself is directly regulated in the context of cell size. Our approach has demonstrated that three mechanisms inform the cell cycle control network of cell size through CDK activity control: C-CDK enzyme concentration scaling with cell size, synergistic PP2A and tyrosine-phosphorylation-dependent C-CDK threshold scaling, and DNA concentration-dependent inhibition of CDK activity. Our results demonstrate that C-CDK activity vs C-CDK level dose–response curves previously demonstrated in vitro operate in vivo, but in addition, we show that they are dependent on cell size in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pomerening et al., 2003</xref>). We also demonstrate a link between ploidy and CDK activity, with higher ploidy causing a reduction in CDK activity. We propose that CDK activity can be inhibited by a DNA-related mechanism in keeping with early work showing that increasing DNA content delays mitosis, with the removal of DNA by irradiation causing acceleration of the following mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Devi et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sachsenmaier et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilson, 1925</xref>). Our experiments show that DNA inhibits CDK activity more in smaller cells, potentially reducing CDK activity by a titration mechanism. This may be related to the mechanism by which cell size is linked to ploidy across cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilson, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amodeo and Skotheim, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prescott, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tzur et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, we show that tyrosine phosphorylation, PP2A activity, and DNA-dependent inhibition of CDK activity act together to restrict small cells from division, forming a mechanism to generate the robust cell size threshold behaviour observed in normal cells.</p><p>Our observations suggest that cell size control over the onset of mitosis involves several molecular mechanisms. If it is assumed that the accumulation of the C-CDK cyclin chimera driven by the cyclin promoter mimics the accumulation of cyclin, then one mechanism is the accumulation of cyclin through the cell cycle, which scales with the increase in cell size. A second is a synergistic interaction between the inhibitory CDK tyrosine phosphorylation pathway and the PP2A phosphatase, which acts on both the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway and dephosphorylation of CDK substrates. The third is a DNA-concentration-dependent inhibition of CDK activity. Given the conservation of all these molecular regulators, these mechanisms can be expected to have direct relevance in other eukaryotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>S. pombe</italic> genetics and cell culture</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> media and standard methods are as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moreno et al., 1991</xref>).

This was done as diploids are wider than haploids, and thus a simple length metric cannot be employed for size binning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Strain table</title><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title><italic>S. pombe</italic> strains.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Strain ID</th><th valign="top">Strain genotype</th><th valign="top">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">JP223</td><td valign="top">h? leu1::cdc13P:cdc13-cdc2.as<sup>†</sup>-YFP:cdc13T::ura4 cdc13Δ::natMX6 cdc2::scLeu2</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP224</td><td valign="top">h? leu1::cdc13P:cdc13-cdc2AF.as<sup>†</sup>-YFP:cdc13T::ura4 cdc13Δ::natMX6 cdc2::scLeu2</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP670</td><td valign="top">h? leu1::cdc13P:cdc13-cdc2.as<sup>†</sup>-YFP:cdc13T::ura4 cdc13Δ::natMX6 cdc2::scLeu2 ura4::Ppcna1-CFP-pcna cut3-mCherry::hphMX6</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP671</td><td valign="top">h? leu1::cdc13P:cdc13-cdc2AF.as<sup>†</sup>-YFP:cdc13T::ura4 cdc13Δ::natMX6 cdc2::scLeu2 ura4::Ppcna1-CFP-pcna cut3-mCherry::hphMX6</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP310</td><td valign="top">h? leu1::cdc13P:cdc13-cdc2.as<sup>†</sup>:cdc13T::ura4 cdc13Δ::natMX6 cdc2::scLeu2 cut3-tdTomato::hphMX6</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP311</td><td valign="top">h? leu1::cdc13P:cdc13-cdc2AF.as<sup>†</sup>:cdc13T::ura4 cdc13Δ::natMX6 cdc2::scLeu2 cut3-tdTomato::hphMX6</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP295</td><td valign="top">h? leu1::cdc13P:cdc13-cdc2AF.as<sup>†</sup>:cdc13T::ura4 cdc13Δ::natMX6 cdc2::scLeu2 cut3-GFP::ura4</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP296</td><td valign="top">h? leu1::cdc13P:cdc13-cdc2.as<sup>†</sup>:cdc13T::ura4 cdc13Δ::natMX6 cdc2::scLeu2 cut3-GFP::ura4</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP501</td><td valign="top">h? cdc2.as<sup>‡</sup>::blastMX6 synCut3-mNeongreen:: leu1+</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP507</td><td valign="top">h? cdc2.as<sup>‡</sup>::blastMX6 synCut3-T19V-mNeongreen:: leu1+</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP601</td><td valign="top">h? synCut3-mCherry:: leu1 + cut3-GFP::ura4</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP602</td><td valign="top">h? cdc2.as<sup>‡</sup>::blastMX6 synCut3-mCherry::leu1 + cut3-GFP::ura4</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP591</td><td valign="top">h? cdc2-M26 synCut3-mCherry::leu1 + leu1::enoTetP:cdc13-sfGFP-cdc2.as<sup>†</sup>:adh1T::hphMX6 TetR1<sup>3</sup></td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP593</td><td valign="top">h? cdc2-M26 synCut3-mCherry::leu1 + leu1::enoTetP:cdc13-sfGFP-cdc2AF.as<sup>†</sup>:adh1T::hphMX6 TetR1*</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP603</td><td valign="top">h? cdc2-M26 synCut3-mCherry::leu1 + leu1::enoTetP:DBΔcdc13-sfGFP-cdc2.as<sup>†</sup>:adh1T::hphMX6 TetR1*</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP605</td><td valign="top">h? cdc2-M26 synCut3-mCherry::leu1+ (JPp178) leu1::enoTetP:DBΔcdc13-sfGFP-cdc2AF.as<sup>†</sup>:adh1T::hphMX6 TetR1*</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP679</td><td valign="top">h? cdc2-M26::blastMX6 synCut3-mCherry::leu1 + leu1::enoTetP:DBΔcdc13-sfGFP-cdc2.as<sup>†</sup>:adh1T::hphMX6 TetR1* ppa2Δ::kanMX6</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JP680</td><td valign="top">h? cdc2-M26::blastMX6 synCut3-mCherry::leu1 + leu1::enoTetP:DBΔcdc13-sfGFP-cdc2AF.as<sup>†</sup>:adh1T::hphMX6 TetR1* ppa2Δ::kanMX6</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">SB175</td><td valign="top">h? cdc2-M26 synCut3-mCherry::leu1 + leu1::enoTetP: DBΔcdc13-sfGFP-cdc2AF.as<sup>†</sup>:adh1T::hphMX6 TetR1* ppa2Δ::kanMX6</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">SB176</td><td valign="top">h?/h? cdc2-M26/cdc2-M26_ synCut3-mCherry::leu1+/synCut3-mCherry::leu1+ <break/>_leu1::enoTetP: DBΔcdc13-sfGFP-cdc2AF.as<sup>†</sup>:adh1T::hphMX6/leu1::enoTetP: DBΔcdc13-sfGFP-cdc2AF.as<sup>†</sup>:adh1T::hphMX6_ TetR1*<sup>/</sup> TetR1*_ppa2Δ::kanMX6/ppa2Δ::kanMX6</td><td valign="top">This work</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*TetR1 – CMVP:TetOx1:TetR-tup11Δ70 (described originally by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patterson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p><sup>†</sup>Cdc2(F84G).</p></fn><fn><p><sup>‡</sup>Cdc2(F84G, K79E).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jessica Greenwood and Clovis Basier for their extensive efforts in editing the manuscript.

that influence CDK1 activity and therefore cell cycle progression. A key question in this field is how cell size influences CDK1 activity, which allows cells to maintain their size. This work shows that CDK1 activity remains influenced by cell size when known pathways are eliminated and makes the novel observation that ploidy influences CDK1 activity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Synergistic CDK control pathways maintain cell size homeostasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Patterson et al. use genetic techniques in fission yeast to understand how cell size impacts CDK activity and entry into mitosis. By disrupting several regulators of CDK activation and using single-cell readouts of cell size, CDK level, and CDK activity, they show that several layers of control synergistically contribute to making CDK activation dependent on cell size. Their data suggest that DNA concentration affects CDK activity and prevents entry into mitosis in cells that have not reached a certain size threshold.</p><p>The experiments' technical level is impressive. The authors have developed a novel sensor, synCut3-mCherry, as single-cell read-out for CDK1 activity, and, for the first time, experimentally demonstrate bistability of CDK regulation in fission yeast. The results will be of interest to researchers studying the cell cycle and cell size control.</p><p>The paper could be strengthened by directly examining size homeostasis (as is claimed in the title). In addition, the reviewers had some concerns that cell cycle state is not taken into account as one more variable that could influence the experimental results, and felt that the authors need to provide additional information both on their methods and on their interpretation of the results to make this paper understandable to a wider group of researchers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The authors do not mention that the cell cycle driven by phosphorylatable and non-phosphorylatable (AF) versions of cyclin-CDK fusion proteins could be very different. The data in Figure 1c/k strongly suggests that this is the case. This is also supported by prior findings (Figure 5 in Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010) despite some differences in the genetic background (CCP deletion). Overall, the data suggest that G1 phase is extended in the AF-carrying strain. For the experiments in Figure 2h, what is the cell cycle distribution (G1/S/G2) in the different size bins for the different strains, and does cell cycle state/DNA content (S vs. G2) influence the results?</p><p>At the very least, the differences in cell cycle structure between the strains need to be discussed. In addition, please specify which of the PP2A genes has been deleted, and how this influenced the cell cycle profile.</p><p>(2) Figure 4 shows that small diploid cells display a lower CDK activity than haploids of the same size. This suggests that a titration mechanism prevents the increase in CDK activity when DNA concentration is too high. These data would be strengthened by a direct readout of DNA content (e.g. DAPI) to measure the amount/concentration of DNA in single cells and its relation to CDK activity. Since DNA staining will also reveal cell cycle state (S phase vs. G2 phase), this would also allow it to exclude cell cycle effects by binning for G2 cells.</p><p>(3) PP2A has a dual effect on CDK activity, which is insufficiently discussed. PP2A regulates inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK through the feedback enzymes (Wee1 and Cdc25) as was shown by Chica et al., 2016 (which should be cited) and PP2A controls the phosphorylation state of CDK substrates. These two effects should be distinguished, because one of them influences the intrinsic CDK activity, while the second has an effect on net CDK phosphorylation of substrates. The authors need to check their text for statements that are not clear enough in that regard, e.g. in line 151 &quot;PP2A and inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation constitute two fundamentally different modes of lowering CDK activity&quot; is not entirely correct.</p><p>(4) The major claim in the title is about cell size homeostasis, but size homeostasis is not examined directly. What is the cell size distribution at division in a C-CDK-AF PP2A-Δ strain and do these cells show size homeostasis (as judged by a &quot;Fantes plot&quot;)? In the absence of any such data, the title would need to be revised.</p><p>(5) Showing the bistable behavior of CDK activity in Figure 2h is a beautiful experimental result. The authors show that the fusion-protein threshold to activate CDK is cell size dependent. But the authors do not explain why the CDK activity above the threshold is constant rather than increasing with the fusion-protein level on the x-axis. What is the limiting factor for CDK activity above the threshold? Does the sensor become saturated at high activity levels?</p><p>Furthermore, these important results would deserve a better presentation: calculating the mean CDK activity for a bimodal distribution seems meaningless and confusing. The main point here is at which threshold of fusion-protein levels the CDK activities bifurcate.</p><p>(6) In Figure 1j-o, the Pearson correlation coefficient should be provided to support the conclusions of the authors. On line 101, the authors mention that &quot;C-CDK-AF cells… show size-dependent CDK activity scaling&quot;. Yet, in Figure 1m it does look like this dependency is significantly impaired. It is actually unclear why that is, knowing size scales with C-CDK level, and C-CDK levels correlate with CDK activity. Please discuss this.</p><p>(7) Either title or abstract should mention the experimental system being used.</p><p>(8) The paper is very dense and will be hard to understand for people not very familiar with this field. Please expand the introduction and discussion to make the text more accessible. It would be interesting if the authors could elaborate on the implications of their results regarding the mechanism(s) of size control, how their findings relate to (extensive) existing literature, and potentially other model systems in which these questions have been investigated. The introduction would benefit from citing one of the many excellent, recent reviews on the topic.</p><p>(9) More details need to be provided in the Methods section in order to allow other researchers to evaluate, and possibly reproduce, these experiments. For example:</p><p>– The authors should specify which of the two pp2a genes has been deleted and what effect it had on the cell cycle.</p><p>– The authors should explain how they measured the level (concentration) of the fusion protein which accumulates in the nucleus. It makes a huge difference whether the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration or the number of molecules of the fusion-protein.</p><p>– When referring to 'custom Matlab scripts', the authors should at least describe the steps that the scripts are executing.</p><p>– Please specify what 'our segmentation algorithm' is.</p><p>– Presumably FOV stands for 'field of view' – please spell out.</p><p>– Is there text missing between line 247 and 248?

As the reviewers suggest, a stoichiometrically binding DNA dye may be used as a readout for DNA concentration, however the dyes that we have used provide weak signal when in live cells. This problem is compounded when coupled with the ImageStream X imaging flow cytometer we have used for analysis. This machine is able to rapidly sample a large number of cells but, given the rapidity of sampling, lacks the excitation time to sufficiently excite weak fluorophores, thus preventing the use of these DNA binding dyes.</p><p>However, we have conducted additional experiments to ensure that the majority of both haploid and diploid cells are in G2 after the cell cycle block. Given that all cells are in G2 at the point of cyclin-CDK induction, we believe that cell cycle effects are largely accounted for. We now include this additional experimental data that demonstrates blocked cells are in G2 as Figure 4b, and provide an explanation on lines 238-240.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) PP2A has a dual effect on CDK activity, which is insufficiently discussed.

We did not make this clear in the original text, and apologise for this. We have clarified this issue on lines 45-47.</p><p>Furthermore, we have clarified throughout the text that PP2A can exert its influence through both tyrosine phosphorylation and opposing CDK substrate phosphorylation – particularly with regards to the effects of PP2A and its removal [lines 195-198, 262-266, 290-292].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The major claim in the title is about cell size homeostasis, but size homeostasis is not examined directly.

Unfortunately, the C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> PP2AΔ strain is inviable, and so we were unable to carry out this experiment.</p><p>Given that we are unable to directly assess size homeostasis directly, we agree with the reviewer that our title was overstated. Therefore, we have altered the title to “The CDK control network integrates cell size and ploidy status to control cell division”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Showing the bistable behavior of CDK activity in Figure 2h is a beautiful experimental result.

The CDK activity sensor is probably not saturated above the CDK activity threshold, as the N/C ratio of synCut3 plateau at different levels in different size bins. Although it may be the case that the sensor reaches saturation in the largest size bin, it cannot be the case in smaller size bins. We suspect that some other factor related to size is limiting, such as nuclear/cytoplasmic transport capacity, but we have no evidence to support this or any other explanation for the limiting factor, and would prefer not to speculate about this.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that it is inappropriate to calculate a mean of data distributed between two populations. A mean line is appropriate in Figure 2h (now figure 2i) for C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> expressing strains as these strains show less bistability than C-CDK<sup>WT</sup>. For the C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> expressing strain we have plotted the average of the two means derived from the two populations because the gradient of this line also provides information about the degree of bifurcation in the C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> expressing strain. We now explain what we have plotted, and why, for both C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> and C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> expressing cells more thoroughly [lines 174-178].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In Figure 1j-o, the Pearson correlation coefficient should be provided to support the conclusions of the authors.

This analysis involves 81 cells so we repeated this experiment in a high-throughput assay with &gt;400,000 cells, where size dependent CDK activity scaling of C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> expressing cells is apparent (Figure 1, figure supplement 5e). We have explained this in the main text, stating that the size dependent activity scaling is less clear in C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> expressing strains when compared to C-CDK<sup>WT</sup> (Figure 1m), but is apparent when repeated in a high-throughput assay [lines 129-135].</p><p>As for why this relationship is less clear when compared to C-CDK<sup>WT</sup>, we suggest that this is due to a minority of cells at all cell lengths with low amounts of C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> protein, which impairs the correlation. A population of cells with low C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> protein level is visible in Figure 1k. However, given this data, we have now deleted the sentence in question, and now only state that C-CDK<sup>AF</sup> cells can generate a C-CDK threshold for division [lines 136-138]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Either title or abstract should mention the experimental system being used.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include the model organism in the abstract [Line 21].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The paper is very dense and will be hard to understand for people not very familiar with this field.

In the introduction, we now elaborate on the previously suggested model of size control in fission yeast [lines 51-58], as well as highlighting experimental results that suggest our current understanding of cell size control is incomplete [lines 55-58]. In the discussion, we place our work in the context of these results [lines 260-269], and suggest that size control is unlikely to arise from any singular molecular control pathway due to cell size feeding into the CDK control network at multiple points [lines 286-295]. In light of the reviewers comments we have included reviews on cell size control in our introduction [references 2,3,4] and more generally improved our referencing of previous work throughout the text. We thank the reviewers for their useful comment that our original text was too dense to be readily understood and required better referencing and discussion.

The line was widened by one pixel either side, and the mean fluorescence intensity within that line extracted. The standard peak finding algorithm within Matlab was then used to identify nuclear fluorescence (either a dip in the case of a low CDK activity cell or a peak in the case of a high CDK activity cell).
