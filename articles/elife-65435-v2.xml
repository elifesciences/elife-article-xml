While thymocytes whose TCRs interact too weakly or too strongly with self-pMHC undergo death by neglect or negative selection, respectively, thymocytes whose TCRs react moderately with self-pMHC can survive and give rise to mature CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive (SP) T cells. Naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells that emerge from the thymus were initially thought to be relatively homogeneous, with differences emerging only after antigenic stimulation. However, recent studies have shown that positively selected T cells span a range of self-reactivities, and that positive selection results in functional tuning of T cells based on their degree of self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Persaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mandl et al., 2013</xref>). On naïve T cells, surface expression levels of the glycoprotein CD5 serve as a reliable marker for self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzam et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hogquist and Jameson, 2014</xref>). CD5 also negatively regulates TCR signals, thereby serving as part of the tuning apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzam et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hogquist and Jameson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Persaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tarakhovsky et al., 1995</xref>). T cells with relatively high self-reactivity (CD5<sup>high</sup>) expand more rapidly upon priming and exhibit greater sensitivity to cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Persaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gascoigne and Palmer, 2011</xref>), whereas T cells with relatively low self-reactivity (CD5<sup>low</sup>) survive better in the absence of cytokines and exhibit stronger proximal TCR signals upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Persaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Palmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smith et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2016</xref>). How these distinct functional properties are imprinted during positive selection in the thymus remains unknown.</p><p>Positive selection is a multi-step process in which CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes experience TCR signals, migrate from the thymic cortex to the medulla, and eventually downregulate either CD4 or CD8 co-receptor. During this process, thymocytes remain motile and experience serial, transient TCR signaling events, to eventually reach a threshold of signaling in order to complete positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Au-Yeung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ross et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melichar et al., 2013</xref>). Thymocytes bearing MHC-II specific TCRs take 1–2 days to complete positive selection and become mature CD4 SP thymocytes, whereas thymocytes bearing MHC-I specific TCRs give rise to CD8 SP thymocytes about 2–4 days after the initiation of positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lucas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kurd and Robey, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, some studies report that CD8 T cells continue to emerge more than 1 week after the beginning of positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lucas et al., 1993</xref>). It remains unknown why some thymocytes move expeditiously through positive selection, while others require more time to mature.</p><p>TCR signaling leads to a rise in cytosolic calcium concentration, and calcium flux during positive selection induces a migratory pause that may prolong the interaction between thymocyte and APC, thus promoting positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhakta and Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhakta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melichar et al., 2013</xref>). Calcium flux in thymocytes is also important for activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and the downstream transcription factor NFAT, both of which are required for normal positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canté-Barrett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Macian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hernandez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oh-hora and Rao, 2008</xref>). Although the initial calcium flux following TCR stimulation comes from the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, calcium influx from the extracellular space is needed for prolonged calcium signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oh-hora and Rao, 2008</xref>). During mature T cell activation, depletion of ER calcium stores triggers the influx of calcium via calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. However, components of the CRAC channels are not required for positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oh-hora, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gwack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vig and Kinet, 2009</xref>), and the mechanisms that maintain intracellular calcium levels during positive selection remain unknown.</p><p>Just after completing TCRαβ gene rearrangements and prior to positive selection, DP thymocytes (termed preselection DP) are highly sensitive to low-affinity ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lucas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaud et al., 2018</xref>). This property is thought to enhance the early phases of positive selection, but must be downregulated to prevent mature T cells from responding inappropriately to self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hogquist and Jameson, 2014</xref>). A number of molecules have been identified, which are involved in modulating TCR signaling in DP thymocytes and which are downregulated during positive selection. These include the microRNA miR-181a, which enhances TCR signaling by downregulating a set of protein phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2007</xref>); Tespa1, a protein that enhances calcium release from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lyu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liang et al., 2017</xref>); components of a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), which prolongs calcium flux via an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lo et al., 2012</xref>); and Themis, a TCR-associated protein with controversial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kakugawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Patrick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lesourne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mehta et al., 2018</xref>). While a diverse set of potential players have been identified, a clear understanding of the mechanisms that render preselection DP thymocytes sensitive to low-affinity self-ligands remains elusive.</p><p>To understand how self-reactivity shapes TCR tuning during thymic development, we compared the positive selection of thymocytes with MHC-I-restricted TCRs of low, intermediate, or high self-reactivity. We show that positive selecting signals in thymocytes with low self-reactivity occur with a more transient calcium flux and without a pronounced migratory pause. In addition, thymocytes with low self-reactivity proceed through positive selection more slowly, with a substantial fraction taking over a week to complete positive selection. Furthermore, we show that cells with lower self-reactivity retain higher expression of a ‘preselection’ gene expression program as they mature. This gene set including genes known to modulate TCR signals and a novel set of ion channels genes. These results indicate that T cell tuning during thymic development occurs via developmentally layered sets of T cell tuning genes, maximizing the TCR signaling potential of thymocytes with low self-reactivity throughout their development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Altered TCR signaling kinetics during positive selection of thymocytes with low self-reactivity</title><p>To investigate how self-reactivity impacts CD8 SP development, we used TCR transgenic (TCRtg) mice expressing MHC-I-restricted TCRs of low, intermediate, or high self-reactivity.

Compared to CD8SP from wild-type mice, CD8SP thymocytes from TG6 mice express low levels of CD5, a reliable surface marker of T cell self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mandl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Persaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzam et al., 2001</xref>). CD8SP thymocytes from TG6 mice also have relatively low expression of Nur77, a marker of recent TCR signaling that also correlates with self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, CD8SP from two well-characterized TCRtg models, OT-1 and F5, have high and intermediate levels of these markers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Palmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ge et al., 2004</xref>). The relative levels of CD5 and Nur77 in TCRtg lymph node T cells follow a similar pattern, except that expression of Nur77 in F5 T cells decreases somewhat in lymph node relative to thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This may reflect weaker recognition of peripheral versus thymic self-peptides by F5, and the loss of β5t-derived peptides in the periphery, in line with the β5t-dependence of F5 thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nitta et al., 2010</xref>. Thus, these three TCRtg models span the range of self-reactivity for CD8 T cell-positive selection, with TG6 providing an example of low self-reactivity coupled with relatively efficient positive selection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TG6, F5, and OT-1 CD8SP cells express CD5 and Nur77 across the polyclonal spectrum.</title><p>CD8SP cells were harvested from the thymus and lymph nodes of wild-type (B6), TG6, F5, and OT-1 TCRtg mice and analyzed by flow cytometry.

To address this possibility, we examined the timing of different stages of positive selection using thymic tissue slice cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ross et al., 2015</xref>). We previously showed that MHC-I-specific preselection DP thymocytes undergo a synchronous wave of maturation after introduction into positive selecting thymic tissue slices. This includes transient upregulation of the TCR activation marker CD69, followed by a switch in chemokine receptor expression from cortical (CXCR4) to medullary (CCR7) in DP thymocytes, and eventually CD4 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ross et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melichar et al., 2013</xref>). To examine the impact of self-reactivity on the timing of these landmarks in positive selection, we overlaid preselection TG6, F5, or OT-1 thymocytes onto selecting and nonselecting thymic slices and analyzed progress through positive selection by flow cytometry after 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr of thymic slice culture. Slice-developed TG6, F5, or OT-1 CD8SPs exhibit the same relative CD5 levels as their in vivo counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), indicating that thymic slices culture provide a good model for examining the impact of self-reactivity on positive selection. In all three models, thymocytes exhibited a transient increase in CD69 expression; however, cells with lower self-reactivity reached peak CD69 expression later than cells with higher self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In addition, the switch in cortical to medullary chemokine receptor expression (CXCR4−CCR7+) and the appearance of CD8SP were delayed in thymocytes with lower self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To further investigate this question, we identified a gene signature associated with preselection DP thymocytes using microarray data from the Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heng et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, we compared non-TCR transgenic, preselection (CD69−) DP thymocytes to their immediate progeny (CD69+) DP thymocytes, and to their immediate precursor (DN4 thymocytes), and identified a set of 11 genes using the dual criteria of high expression in CD69− DP, and largest fold increase in CD69−DP relative to both DN4 and CD69+DP (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, top, red dots). We then examined expression of these 11 genes in TG6, F5, and OT-1 thymocytes at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, bottom). Interestingly, all 11 genes correlated with low self-reactivity, particularly at the early DP stage of development.

Preselection DP thymocytes are highly sensitive to low-affinity self-ligands, and gradually downmodulate their sensitivity as they mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lucas et al., 1999</xref>). However the factors that modulate TCR sensitivity during positive selection are not well understood. Moreover, there is a growing appreciation that thymocytes differentially adjust their response to self-ligands based on their degree of self-reactivity, although little is known about how positive selection differs for thymocytes of relatively low versus relatively high self-reactivity. Here we show that thymocytes with low self-reactivity experience briefer TCR signals and can take more than twice as long to complete positive selection, compared to those with relatively high self-reactivity. Thymocytes with low self-reactivity retain a preselection gene expression program as they progress through development, including elevated expression of genes previously implicated in modulating TCR signaling during positive selection, and a novel set of ion channel genes. In addition, a separate set of ion channel genes that peaks at the CD8SP stage is also selectively upregulated in mature CD8SP thymocytes of low self-reactivity. These results indicate that the modulation of TCR sensitivity during T cell development occurs with distinct kinetics for T cells with low self-reactivity and associates membrane ion channel expression with early and late stages of T cell development as well as T cell self-reactivity.</p><p>Our results contrast with an earlier study, which reported that the overall time for positive selection was constant for different CD8 T cell clones, with an accelerated early phase compensating for a delayed late phase for CD8 T cells of low self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, that study relied on the decrease in Rag-GFP reporter expression to infer the timing of development, rather than directly tracking cohorts of positively selecting cells as we have done in the current study. While the slow loss of Rag-GFP reporter due to GFP protein turnover can provide an indication of the elapsed time after shutoff of rag expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCaughtry et al., 2007</xref>), reporter expression during the early phase of positive selection may be impacted by the timing of rag shutoff and cell turnover, making this an unreliable indicator of developmental time in this experimental setting.</p><p>A variety of molecules have been implicated in modulating the TCR sensitivity of DP thymocytes, including the TCR-associating protein Themis, ER-associating protein Tespa1, microRNA mir-181a, and components of a VGSC (encoded by <italic>Scn4b</italic> and <italic>Scn5a</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lesourne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Patrick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kakugawa et al., 2009</xref>). Here we show that the VGSC is part of a larger group of ion channel genes, that also includes components of voltage-gated calcium channels (<italic>Cacna1e, Cacnb3</italic>), that are both upregulated in preselection DP thymocytes, and selectively retained during the positive selection of thymocytes with low self-reactivity. We also identified another group of ion channels whose expression peaks at the CD8SP stage, and that are also upregulated in CD8 T cells of low self-reactivity. This group includes <italic>Kcna2,</italic> a component of a voltage-gated potassium channel, and <italic>Tmie</italic>, a gene essential for calcium-dependent mechanotransduction in hair cells within the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qiu and Müller, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, ion channel expression appears to be selectively modulated based on the degree of self-reactivity at two distinct stages of T cell development and may help to enhance weak TCR signals both during the initial phase of positive selection and during T cell homeostasis in the periphery.</p><p>Voltage-gated ion channels are best known for their role in generating action potentials in neurons and muscle cells, but they also play roles in nonelectrically excitable cells such as T cells and thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feske et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahalan and Chandy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trebak and Kinet, 2019</xref>). In these cells, voltage-gated ion channels have been proposed to be regulated by local fluctuations of membrane charge, or alternative mechanisms such as phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rook et al., 2012</xref>). While the link between ion channels and T cell tuning is not known, the modulation of calcium entry is a potential mechanism. TCR triggering initially leads to a rise in cytosolic calcium via release of ER stores, and the calcium rise is sustained in mature T cells when depletion of ER calcium stores triggers the opening of CRACs. However, CRACs appear to be dispensable for positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oh-hora, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gwack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vig and Kinet, 2009</xref>), and it remains unclear how thymocytes sustain calcium signals during the days required to complete positive selection. Evidence suggests that the VGSC promotes prolonged calcium flux in response to TCR triggering in DP thymocytes, although the mechanism remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lo et al., 2012</xref>). Our data indicates that, not only sodium, but also potassium, chloride, and calcium channels are upregulated in preselection DP thymocytes and positive selecting thymocytes with low self-reactivity, implying that positive selection leads to broad changes in transmembrane ion flux. In addition to potentially promoting calcium influx, it is tempting to speculate that changes in membrane ion flux could directly impact TCR triggering by regulating local membrane charge at the receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Altered ion flux in T cells with low self-reactivity may also impact ion-coupled transport of nutrients. In this regard, it is intriguing that the sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter gene <italic>Slc6a19</italic> is also consistently upregulated in thymocytes and CD8 T cells with low self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results support a model in which gene expression is altered in two, temporally distinct phases based on the degree of self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thymocytes with low self-reactivity (dashed lines) experience briefer TCR signals and accumulate TCR signals more slowly, resulting in a delayed time course of positive selection. During phase 1, a ‘preselection DP’ gene expression program (including <italic>Themis, Scn4b</italic>, and <italic>Cacna1e</italic>) is downregulated in all thymocytes undergoing positive selection, but more gradually and incompletely in thymocytes with low self-reactivity. During phase 2, a distinct set of genes (including <italic>Kcna2</italic> and <italic>Tmie</italic>) whose expression peaks in CD8 SP are upregulated to a greater extent in thymocytes with low self-reactivity. In combination with previously published findings, our model suggests that phase 1 and phase 2 genes help to sustain TCR signals throughout positive selection. Thus, high expression of phase 1 and phase 2 genes, early and late in development (respectively), may allow thymocytes with low self-reactivity to continue to receive survival and differentiation signals in spite of their low reactivity.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for temporal signal accumulation and gene expression changes during development in cells with relatively high and low self-reactivity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) (Left) Positively selected cells with relatively high self-reactivity (SR) (solid, red lines) receive serial, brief (minutes) TCR signals, allowing for signal accumulation over a period of days, to eventually complete positive selection.

We also suggest that, later in positive selection, phase 2 genes (including <italic>Kcna2</italic> and <italic>Tmie</italic>) are upregulated to a greater extent in thymocytes with low self-reactivity and could help to increase sensitivity to self-ligands late in development and in the periphery.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65435-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Previous work has shown that CD8 T cells can take three or more days to complete development, but it was unclear why positive selection takes longer for some cells than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lucas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kurd and Robey, 2016</xref>). Our data show that positive selection can take considerably longer for cells with low self-reactivity compared to those with high self-reactivity. In particular, EdU pulse labeling in adult TG6 transgenic mice shows that some thymocytes are still converting from DP to CD8SP after more than 1 week of positive selection. It has been previously noted that CD8 T cells that arise in the neonatal period have higher CD5 levels and are more proliferative and responsive to cytokines compared to CD8 T cells that arise in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). This phenomenon may be explained in part by the shorter time required for T cells with high self-reactivity to complete positive selection. However, distinct mechanisms independent of TCR specificity also contribute to this phenomenon. For example, T cells that arise in the neonatal period are derived from fetal stem cells and are intrinsically programmed to be more proliferative than those derived from adult stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ikuta et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bronevetsky et al., 2016</xref>). There are also indications that age-related changes in the thymic environment may alter the TCR affinity thresholds for positive and negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, three distinct mechanisms may all contribute to a bias toward high self-reactivity T cells in young individuals, with T cells of lower self-reactivity accumulating with age. It is tempting to speculate that this arrangement is evolutionarily advantageous, since highly self-reactive T cells can provide a rapid response against acute infections, which are the biggest threat to a young individual. As the organism ages, however, it may become advantageous to have a more diverse, specialized T cell repertoire, particularly to fight chronic infections. In line with this notion, we recently reported that TG6 T cells are resistant to exhaustion and provide a protective response to <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> chronic infection, properties that are linked to limited binding of self-peptides to the restricting MHC-I molecule L<sup>d</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanchard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsitsiklis et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the work presented here provides insight on the differences in the development of T cells with low and high self-reactivity that may impact their distinct peripheral functions.

Samples for thymic slice experiments were excluded if the culture had very low viability (&lt;15%) or &lt;0.2% of donor derived thymocytes of total live cells in the final sample. For EdU experiments, samples that did not incorporate detectable EdU (&lt;0.001% of live cells that were EdU+) were excluded. For experiments where thymic slices from the same genotypic background received multiple treatments, slices were randomly allocated to treatment conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Thymic slices</title><p>Preparation of thymic slices has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dzhagalov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ross et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, thymic lobes were gently isolated and removed of connective tissue, embedded in 4% agarose with a low melting point (GTG-NuSieve Agarose, Lonza), and sectioned into slices of 400–500 μm using a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica). Slices were overlaid onto 0.4 μm transwell inserts (Corning, Cat. No. 353090) set in six well tissue culture plates with 1 ml cRPMI under the insert. 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> thymocytes in 10 μl cRPMI were overlaid onto each slice and allowed to migrate into the slice for 2–3 hr. Afterwards, excess thymocytes were removed by gentle washing with PBS and cultured at 37°C 5%CO<sub>2</sub> until harvested for flow cytometry or two-photon analysis. For flow cytometry, thymic slices were dissociated to single-cell suspensions and then stained with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies.

For thymic slices, cells were first stained for 60 min in a 37°C water bath with CXCR4 (L276F12 or 2B11) and CCR7 (4B12) antibodies in 2.4G2 supernatant. Cells were then surfaced stained for 15 min on ice in 2.4G2 supernatant containing the following antibodies: CD4 (clone GK1.5 or RM4-5), CD8α (53–6.7), CD5 (53–7.3), and CD69 (H1.2F3). Finally, cells were washed in PBS and stained in Ghost Dye Violet 510 (Tonbo Biosciences, Cat. No. 13–0870 T100) for 10 min on ice. The following antibodies were used for flow cytometric analysis of whole thymuses and spleens: CD4 (GK1.5 or RM4-5), CD8α (53–6.7), CD5 (53–7.3), and CD69 (H1.2F3), CD24 (M1/69), TCRβ (H57-597), CXCR4 (L276F12), CCR7 (4B12), Vα2 (B20.1), Vβ8.1/8.2 (KJ16-133.18), and Vβ2 (B20.6).

All imaging was performed 3–6 hr after the addition of thymocytes to thymic slices. Thymic slices were glued onto glass cover slips and fixed to the bottom of a petri dish being perfused at a rate of 1 ml/min with 37°C oxygenated, phenol red–free DMEM during imaging using an MPII Mini-Peristaltic Pump (Harvard Apparatus) and a 35 mm Quick Exchange Platform (QE-1) in conjunction with a TC-324B temperature controller (Warner Instruments). Samples were imaged in the cortex of the thymus, determined by proximity to the thymic capsule. Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 7 MP upright, two-photon microscope with a 20×/1.0 immersive Zeiss objective and a Coherent Chameleon laser tuned to 720 nm for imaging Indo-1. Ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were collected with 440-nm-long pass dichroic mirror and 400/45 and 480/50 bandpass filters. Ca<sup>2+</sup> hi signals (~401 nm) were collected using a bialkali PMT; Ca<sup>2+</sup> lo signals (~475 nm) were collected using a GaASP PMT. Image areas of up to 212 × 212 μm to a depth of up to 55 μm were acquired every 10 s for 15 or 20 min with 3 μm z steps starting from beneath the cut surface, using Zen 2010 software from Zeiss.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Two-photon movies were processed and rendered using Imaris software (Bitplane Scientific Software) to collect x, y, and z coordinates and fluorescence intensity as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melichar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ross et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Au-Yeung et al., 2014</xref>). Imaging data were then analyzed using a custom MATLAB script (MathWorks; as previously described [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lylutes/sparky5">github.com/lylutes/sparky5;</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">lylutes, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ross et al., 2014</xref>]), ImageJ, and Microsoft Excel.

The background calcium ratio is average Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio under nonselecting conditions (0.675 for OT-1 and TG6) from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio of the raw fluorescence values at each time point per run. To calculate the average event length, cells were considered to be signaling when the average Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio was ≥0.2 above the background calcium ratio for ≥2 consecutive time points on a cell track. A trigger event was defined by the first of two consecutive time points to have a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio ≥ 0.2 above background. The end of a signaling event was defined by when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio returned to &lt;0.1 above background for two consecutive time points. Only events that had a defined beginning and end were included in calculating signal duration. For tracks with multiple events, only the first signaling event was used to calculating signal duration. For calculating speed over time, we averaged speed values from Imaris over two time points (20 s). The speed of signaling and nonsignaling time points was measured by averaging the instantaneous speed for each time point. The frequency of events was calculated by dividing the number of events compiled from all runs by the cumulative track imaging time (the sum of all of the track durations for all compiled runs), for each condition. For this calculation, events were defined as ≥2 consecutive time points of high Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio bound by periods ≥ 4 min of nonsignaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA preparation, sequencing, and analysis</title><p>Thymocytes from OT-1 Rag2<sup>−/−</sup>, F5 Rag1<sup>−/−</sup>, and TG6 H2<sup>b/d</sup> mice were sorted using a BD Influx or BD FACSAria Fusion into CD4+CD8+CXCR4+CCR7− (early positive selection), CD4+CD8+CXCR4-CCR7+ (late positive selection), and CD4−CD8+CXCR4−CCR7+ (Mature CD8SP) populations for RNA sequencing.

The findings come from a series of both in vitro and in vivo experiments implicating self-reactivity by T cell receptors on thymocytes in determining the time to completion of positive selection. An RNA-sequencing analysis suggests that gene expression differences from the pre-selection to the single-positive thymocyte stage is self-reactivity dependent, correlating in particular the level of ion channel expression with positive selection completion rates.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;T cell self-reactivity during thymic development dictates the timing of positive selection&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: JC Zúñiga-Pflücker (Reviewer #1); Nicholas Gascoigne (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please address the shared concern regarding the potential role of ion channel expression by extending the discussion of their potential as highlighted in the reviewers comments.</p><p>2. The detailed comments (1-4) from reviewer #2 provide the a clear set of required revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Suppl. Fig. 4 provides a wonderful analysis of the different TCR-tg DP cells undergoing selection on the thymic slices, and clearly illustrates different progression phenotypes. It is curious to see that Tg6 thymocytes appear to closely follow the Kinetic Signaling Model of selection quite nicely, while F5 and OT1 cells show an abridged version. Given the context of the present work, it would be important for the authors to discuss these results (and others in their work) in the framework of the kinetic signaling model, which would be highly beneficial to field. The need for further discussion can also extend to the recently published scRNAseq and scATACseq analysis of developing CD4+CD8+ cells adopting CD4 or CD8 lineage outcomes (Chopp et al., PMID: 33242395).</p><p>2. In Figure 1, it is curious that F5 TCR-tg cells show increased CD5 but not Nur77 expression levels compared to Tg6 cells, while OT1 are clearly much higher for both. One thought, which the authors may or may not want to discuss is the possibility that Tg6 TCRs may require β5T (Psmb11) dependent peptides for selection, like was shown for F5 TCRs (Nitta et al., PMID: 20045355), while OT1 TCRs appear to be less dependent on those peptides, which would differentially affect thymic vs peripheral peptide repertoires and thus their TCR reactivities. Perhaps, one critical difference in the selection events described by the authors is not whether the TCRs are low or high self-reactive but rather whether they require β5t processing for the peptides that then support their positive selection. If the authors agree with this possibility, then it could be mentioned in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. For Figure 2, a better use/analysis making use of the single-cell resolution of the datasets would greatly strengthen the conclusions. This would include:• An example of the raw video data (eg. a single cell before and during Ca flux) to illustrate the thresholding imposed.</p><p>• From the tracks in (b) it appears that most TG6 tracks have few Ca flux events, and the tracks that have such signaling events often have multiple subsequent events. Could this be commented on? Is it due to cells staying on the antigen presenting cell for the duration of the video, are cells circling back or are there cell-to-cell variations even within the transgenics that would be important to consider?</p><p>• For (c) a per-track summary of the data would be more informative and interpretable than the per-video summary provided. For instance: what % of tracks had any Ca events in the TG6 vs. OT1? What % of tracks had &gt;1 flux event? It is difficult to interpret the values provided in (c) and the individual-cell resolution is lost.</p><p>2. The authors might consider merging Figures 2 and 3, such that together, these data presented then more directly address the question of frequency of interactions versus strength of signal per interaction, which is currently not clearly distinguished by the authors and is a clear advantage of their single-cell resolution measures. For the data presented in figure 3 some additional comments:</p><p>• One cause for concern is that there appears to be a clear difference in speeds of non-signaling TG6 and OT1 cells at 6 hours – why would this be?</p><p>• A more informative measure than average track speed would be the time stopped (as also shown in panels a and b), and perhaps a more direct relation (eg. x,y plot) of Ca flux duration by time spent stopped with a distinct coding of the TG6 versus OT1 cells in a single plot would make a much more compelling case for per-signal strength differences observed across transgenics.</p><p>3. The use of in vivo EdU-labelling approach (Figure 6) provides nicely complementary data to the thymic slice data in Figure 4. To strengthen the conclusions in (d-e), could the authors also provide the CD5 gMFI data for the individual transgenics? If their conclusions are correct, CD5 levels within transgenics over time in the SP population would remain constant (in contrast to the polyclonal SP). Moreover, a summary statistic of the data in (c), such as the time to half maximum SP appearance of each TCR Tg would enable statistical comparison between transgenics. Finally, why is the CD5 decrease is less striking in the CD8 SP compared to the CD4 SP population (panel f)?</p><p>4. The summary figure 8 is confusing, introduces new terminology not previously used (phase 1 versus phase 2 genes), and includes a graph on 'TCR sensitivity over time' which is not based on data provided in this study. Please simplify to summarize the model based on the data in the paper (perhaps a diagram tracking a low versus high self-reactivity cell would be more useful here, highlighting stage transitions and accompanying changes in gene expression).</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>None.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65435.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Interestingly, intact OT1 TCR transgenic mice do contain a prominent CD4+CD8lo population, although this population is much less prominent when preselection OT1 thymocytes give rise to CD8 SP thymocytes in thymic slice culture (Ross et al., 2014, PMID: 24927565 [Fig 1]; and current study). It is also noteworthy that while some MHC-1 TCR transgenic models have a prominent CD4+CD8lo population (OT1, P14), others do not (HY, F5, TG6). The observation that the CD8 SP thymocyte can efficiently develop under conditions in which they do not pass through an obvious CD4+CD8lo stage suggests that this may not be an obligatory developmental intermediate for CD8 T cell development. This is also in line with early observations that constitutive expression of CD8 transgenes, which also prevent the appearance of a CD4+CD8lo population, does not prevent the efficient development of CD8 SP (Robey et al., 1991, PMID: 1898873; and numerous subsequent studies). Given that it would require a lengthy section of text to adequately discuss this issue and given there are already numerous published models for CD8 development that do not align perfectly with the kinetic signaling model, we would prefer to keep the focus of the discussion on the impact of self-reactivity within MHC-1 specific thymocytes destined for the CD8 lineage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 1, it is curious that F5 TCR-tg cells show increased CD5 but not Nur77 expression levels compared to Tg6 cells, while OT1 are clearly much higher for both. One thought, which the authors may or may not want to discuss is the possibility that Tg6 TCRs may require β5T (Psmb11) dependent peptides for selection, like was shown for F5 TCRs (Nitta et al., PMID: 20045355), while OT1 TCRs appear to be less dependent on those peptides, which would differentially affect thymic vs peripheral peptide repertoires and thus their TCR reactivities. Perhaps, one critical difference in the selection events described by the authors is not whether the TCRs are low or high self-reactive but rather whether they require β5t processing for the peptides that then support their positive selection. If the authors agree with this possibility, then it could be mentioned in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an intriguing point regarding whether self-reactivity may be related to the dependence of the TCRs on β5T for their development. Indeed the β5T dependence of the TCR transgenic models shown in Nitta et al. shows an overall inverse correlation with CD5 expression; with F5 (CD5 intermediate) being relatively dependent, and OT-1 (CD5 high) independent of β5T. However, for the set of 5 TCR examined in that study, the correlation between CD5 and β5T dependence was not perfect. Interestingly, our data in Figure 1 show a decrease in CD5 and Nur77 expression when comparing F5 lymph node T cells to thymic CD8 SP, suggesting a drop in F5 self-reactivity from the thymus to the periphery due to a loss of β5T-derived peptides in the periphery. In contrast, TG6 maintains similar or slightly higher levels of CD5 and Nur77 in the periphery, suggesting it may not preferentially recognize β5T-derived peptides. Because we have no information regarding the β5T dependence of TG6, we have chosen not to discuss this topic in detail in the manuscript. However, we have updated the text to acknowledge the impact β5T may have on shifting CD5 and Nur77 expression of F5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. For Figure 2, a better use/analysis making use of the single-cell resolution of the datasets would greatly strengthen the conclusions. This would include:</p><p>• An example of the raw video data (eg. a single cell before and during Ca flux) to illustrate the thresholding imposed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified our supplemental videos to show the raw data, the ratiometric image, and the graph indicated calcium ratio and speed over time for each cell shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• From the tracks in (b) it appears that most TG6 tracks have few Ca flux events, and the tracks that have such signaling events often have multiple subsequent events.

In addition, the signaling cells that experience subsequent events are not arrested in one location but remain motile between events. Therefore, we consider it unlikely that they are remaining in close proximity to the same APC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• For (c) a per-track summary of the data would be more informative and interpretable than the per-video summary provided.

Thus, the comparison of the average speed during signaling and nonsignaling portions of the tracks shown in Figure 3c (Figure 2e and f of the revised manuscript) accurately captures the differences in speed that relate to signaling during positive selection.</p><p>The reviewer also astutely notes that at 6 hours, during non-signaling timepoints, OT-1 cells are migrating more quickly than TG6 cells. There is indeed a significant difference in the speed of the nonsignaling portions of track for OT-1 and TG6 thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We reported previously that thymocytes increase their overall speed as they progress through positive selection (Ross et al., 2014, PMID: 24927565, Figure 2a and b). Thus the increase in basal (nonsignaling) speed for OT-1 compared to TG6 thymocytes after 6 hours of culture in a positive selecting environment is a reflection of their more rapid maturation. When we calculate the signal-associated pausing, we compare the speed within the same track during the signaling versus nonsignaling portions of the track to adjust for this difference.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Average speed of nonsignaling (nonsig) timepoints in tracks with at least one signaling event.</title><p>Each dot represents a single track.

The use of in vivo EdU-labelling approach (Figure 6) provides nicely complementary data to the thymic slice data in Figure 4. To strengthen the conclusions in (d-e), could the authors also provide the CD5 gMFI data for the individual transgenics? If their conclusions are correct, CD5 levels within transgenics over time in the SP population would remain constant (in contrast to the polyclonal SP).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion, and the requested data has been included in a new supplemental figure, Figure 5—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript. The EdU+ CD8SP CD5 gMFI is not significantly different within each transgenic regardless of the day post injection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, a summary statistic of the data in (c), such as the time to half maximum SP appearance of each TCR Tg would enable statistical comparison between transgenics.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we appreciate the reviewer’s excellent suggestion.

This panel displays the percent maximal EdU CD8SP accumulation for each transgenic, at each timepoint post EdU injection. Additionally, we provide statistical analysis for this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, why is the CD5 decrease is less striking in the CD8 SP compared to the CD4 SP population (panel f)?</p></disp-quote><p>CD4SP cells have higher CD5 in general and emerge more quickly compared to</p><p>CD8SP thymocytes (Azzam et al., 1998; Saini et al. 2010; Lucas, Vasseur, and Penit 1993). Thus, at day 4 post EdU injection we are able to capture a larger population of EdU+ CD4SP cells compared to CD8SPs, which could result in the significant difference we see in CD5 expression between day 4 and day 7 EdU+ CD4s.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
