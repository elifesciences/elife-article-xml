The study of cerebellar folding is challenging due to the small size and abundance of its folia. In consequence, little is known about its anatomical diversity and evolution. We constituted an open collection of histological data from 56 mammalian species and manually segmented the cerebrum and the cerebellum. We developed methods to measure the geometry of cerebellar folia and to estimate the thickness of the molecular layer. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to study the diversity and evolution of cerebellar folding and its relationship with the anatomy of the cerebrum. Our results show that the evolution of cerebellar and cerebral anatomy follows a stabilising selection process. We observed two groups of phenotypes changing concertedly through evolution: a group of ‘diverse’ phenotypes – varying over several orders of magnitude together with body size, and a group of ‘stable’ phenotypes varying over less than 1 order of magnitude across species. Our analyses confirmed the strong correlation between cerebral and cerebellar volumes across species, and showed in addition that large cerebella are disproportionately more folded than smaller ones. Compared with the extreme variations in cerebellar surface area, folial anatomy and molecular layer thickness varied only slightly, showing a much smaller increase in the larger cerebella. We discuss how these findings could provide new insights into the diversity and evolution of cerebellar folding, the mechanisms of cerebellar and cerebral folding, and their potential influence on the organisation of the brain across species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>folding</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>histology</kwd><kwd>mammals</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic comparative methods</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101033485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heuer</surname><given-names>Katja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-DATA-0025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heuer</surname><given-names>Katja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-21-CE45-0016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heuer</surname><given-names>Katja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A computational neuroanatomy analysis of cerebellar and cerebral folding in 56 mammalian species reveals groups of highly variable 'diverse' phenotypes, and strongly conserved 'stable' phenotypes, providing new insights into the diversity, evolution, and influence of cortical folding on brain organisation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain folding may play an important role in facilitating and inducing a variety of anatomical and functional organisation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Welker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toro, 2012</xref>). Among the many folded structures of the mammalian brain, the cortices of the cerebrum and the cerebellum are the two largest ones. In humans, the cerebellum has ~80% of the surface area of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sereno et al., 2020</xref>), and contains ~80% of all brain neurons, although it represents only ~10% of the brain mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo et al., 2009</xref>). Both cortices are organised in layers, with neuronal cell bodies occupying a superficial position and principal neurons – pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum – sending axons towards an internal white matter. Many aspects of the organisation, development, and evolution of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex are, however, very different. While the cerebral cortex is unique to mammals, the cerebellum is present in all vertebrates, with cerebellum-like structures which can be even identified in invertebrates such as octopuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nieuwenhuys et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shigeno et al., 2018</xref>). While the main target of pyramidal cells is the cerebral cortex itself (through profuse cortico-cortical connections), Purkinje cell afferents are mostly feedforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramnani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nieuwenhuys et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>). While dendritic trees of pyramidal neurons can be found in all cortical layers, those of Purkinje cells are restricted to the molecular layer – their nuclei forming a boundary between the molecular and granular layers. While the cortex is only folded in relatively large mammals, the cerebellum is folded in all of them, and is also folded in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cunha et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cunha et al., 2021</xref>), some fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yopak et al., 2007</xref>) but not in reptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Larsell, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nieuwenhuys et al., 1998</xref>). It is interesting then to compare folding in both structures as a first step towards understanding how the mechanics of folding could influence the organisation in these two different types of tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franze, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kroenke and Bayly, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foubet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heuer and Toro, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we aimed at characterising the folding of the cerebellar cortex using histological data from a sample of 56 mammalian species. The analysis of cerebellar folding is made difficult by the small size of the folia. Magnetic resonance imaging, the main tool for studying the folding of the cerebral cortex, does not provide the resolution required to distinguish and reconstruct cerebellar folding. Histological data, even at low scanning resolution, can provide sufficient information to distinguish folia as well as cerebellar cortical layers. However, data is only 2D, and sectioning often induces non-trivial deformations which make it challenging to create full 3D reconstructions (see, however, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sereno et al., 2020</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>). Using histological data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashwell, 2020</xref>, was able to estimate the surface area in 90 species of marsupials and 57 species of eutherian mammals, but did not study folia, of which the measurement remains challenging.</p><p>In our analyses we manually segmented the surface of the cerebellum and developed a method to automatically detect the boundary between the molecular and granular layers, allowing us to estimate the median thickness of the molecular layer. We also developed a method to detect individual folia, and to measure their median width and perimeter. Buckling models of brain folding suggest an inverse relationship between folding frequency and cortical thickness, with thicker cortices leading to lower frequency folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toro and Burnod, 2005</xref>). This has been verified in the mammalian cerebrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mota and Herculano-Houzel, 2015</xref>), and we aimed at studying it in the cerebellum. The analysis of phylogenetic data is challenging, because different species share a varying degree of genetic relationship. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to condition our analyses on the phylogenetic tree and tested different evolutionary scenarios, which allowed us to study the evolution of the cerebellum and its relationship with the cerebrum and with body size.</p><p>Our results showed two very different groups of phenotypes: those like brain size, that changed over several orders of magnitude, and those like folial width which were much more conserved. We confirm the strong allometry between the size of the cerebellum and the cerebrum across mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barton and Harvey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whiting and Barton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herculano-Houzel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smaers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashwell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Magielse et al., 2023</xref>) and show similarly strong relationships for the width of cerebellar folds and the thickness of the molecular layer, although with a much narrower range of variation. This deeply conserved pattern suggests the presence of a common mechanism underlying the development of the cerebellum and cerebellar folding across mammals.

We considered that image resolution was in all cases sufficient to estimate the length and area of the cerebellum sections, however, we excluded some species from our estimation of molecular layer thickness when resolution was deemed insufficient.

We processed the histological images to convert them to grey levels, denoise them, and equalise their histograms, using functions from the Scikit-image package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>). Starting from the manual segmentation (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), we created a binary mask and masked out the non-cerebellar regions (e.g., the neighbouring cerebrum). The molecular layer of the cerebellum appears as a light band followed by the granular layer which appears as a dark band. We applied a Laplacian smoothing to the masked image, which created a gradual change in grey level going from white close to the surface of the cerebellum to black towards the granular layer. We computed the gradient of the image, which produced a vector field from the outside to the inside. We integrated this vector field to produce a series of lines, one for every vertex in the manual cerebellar segmentation. The vector field was integrated only if the grey values decreased, and if a minimum was reached, the vector field was continued linearly. At the end of this procedure, all lines had the same length, computed so as to cover the whole range from the surface of the cerebellum to the granular layer. The grey levels in the original image were sampled along each scan line, producing a grey level profile. The grey level profiles were derived, and a peak detection function was used to determine the point of maximum white/grey contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, where the red dot shows the detected boundary), indicating the boundary between the molecular and granular layers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> shows the part of the profile lines starting at the cerebellar surface and ending at the detected boundary. For each scan line the corresponding thickness of the molecular layer was defined as the length from the manual cerebellar segmentation until the maximum contrast point (red point). Finally, for each species, a single thickness value was computed as the median of the thickness measured for each profile line, to make our estimation robust to outliers.

We tested three different models. First, the randomly varying phenotype that we mentioned could be modelled as a Brownian motion (BM) process. BM can be used to model fluctuating selection and genetic drift, for example.

These difficulties can be addressed, for example, through the use of AICc instead of likelihood for model selection, as well as the use of penalised likelihood frameworks, which is the approach implemented in mvMORPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clavel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clavel et al., 2019</xref>). To better understand our ability to decide among different models, we estimated our statistical power through simulations. We ran 1000 simulations where each time we generated nine correlated traits following a BM process, and counted the number of times the BM model was selected over the OU model based on their AICc.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Correlation structure, bivariate, and multivariate allometry</title><p>We aimed at describing the main patterns of variation among our phenotypes by looking at their matrix of correlations, partial correlations, principal components, and allometry. Our measurements were not independent because species are linked by different phylogenetic relationships. Our analyses used the phylogenetic tree to model covariance structure, as well as the model selected using the methods described in the previous subsection.</p><p>All our phenotypes were strongly correlated. We used partial correlations to better understand pairwise relationships. The partial correlation between two vectors of measurements <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> is the correlation between their residuals after the influence of all other measurements has been covaried out. Even if the correlation between <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> is strong and positive, their partial correlation could be 0 or even negative. Consider, for example, three vectors of measurements <bold><italic>a</italic></bold>, <bold><italic>b</italic></bold>, <bold><italic>c</italic></bold>, which result from the combination of uncorrelated random vectors <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><italic>, <bold>y</bold>, <bold>z</bold></italic>.

The measurements <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> will be positively correlated because of the effect of <bold><italic>x</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>z</italic></bold>. However, if we compute the residuals of <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> after covarying the effect of <bold><italic>c</italic></bold> (i.e., <bold><italic>x</italic></bold>), their partial correlation will be negative because of the opposite effect of <bold><italic>y</italic></bold> on <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>b</italic></bold>. The statistical significance of each partial correlation being different from 0 was estimated using the edge exclusion test introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Whittaker, 1990</xref>. We evaluated our statistical power to detect partial correlations of different strengths using simulations. Code is included in the accompanying source code along with a Jupyter notebook providing an executable version of our partial correlations example together with further details on our power analysis. A non-executable version of this notebook is provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p>The main patterns of correlation among phenotypes, that is, the way in which different groups of phenotypes vary together, can be further studied using principal component analysis (PCA). The first principal component (PC1) is a vector of loadings showing how much each variable contributes to the main pattern of variation. The loadings of the second principal component (PC2) show the contribution of each variable to the second most important pattern of variation, etc. Each principal component captures a certain amount of variance, which indicates the importance of the pattern of variation it represents. By construction, the different principal components are orthogonal (another way of understanding PCA is as the rigid rotation of the data that will produce the best alignment with a set of orthogonal axes). Since species are non-independent data points due to evolutionary relatedness, it is important to take phylogenetic tree structure into account. For example, in the case of traits generated by a BM process, the main axis of variation could be due to traits being different because of biological reasons, or just because the species where they were measured had diverged a long time ago as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felsenstein, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Revell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clavel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we also use allometry to study the relationships between measurements in organisms of different shape and size. Consider, for example, the case of isometry: when a series of objects have identical shapes but different sizes. Their surface area will increase proportionally to the second power of their length, and volume will increase as the third power of their length. A measurement is said to be hypo-allometric or to have negative allometry relative to another if it changes less than what would be expected by isometry. This is the case of brain volume, which increases proportionally less than body volume across species. A measurement is said to be hyper-allometric or to have positive allometry relative to another if its changes are larger than what would be expected by isometry. For example, cortical surface area increases disproportionately when brain volume increases: in the case of isometry, we would expect the surface area of an object to increase proportionally to the ⅔ power of its volume. In mammals, however, the increase is almost linear (which is explained by the presence of brain folding, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Toro et al., 2008</xref>). The allometric scaling between two measurements is often estimated by considering the slope of their linear regression in a log-log scale. More accurately, orthogonal regression can be used, which distributes errors across both variables. The orthogonal regression approach can be also easily extended to the case of multivariate allometry: the loadings of the first principal component of the log-converted measurements allow us to estimate the allometric scaling of all variables at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jolicoeur, 1963</xref>). Consider the case of volumetric measurements of different brain regions (log-converted). The loadings of PC1 will indicate the contribution of the corresponding brain region to the main pattern of variation, and the scaling between any pair of regions can be obtained as the ratio between their corresponding loadings (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Toro et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In what follows we report allometric slopes obtained using linear regression and orthogonal regression for selected pairs of variables, as well as the slopes obtained using multivariate allometry (i.e., ratios of loadings from their phylogeny-controlled PC1).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Estimation of ancestral phenotypes</title><p>Fitting of evolutionary models allows us to obtain estimation of the ancestral states of the phenotypes under study.

Someone equally frustrated replied that the available diagrams were too simple to construct even a primitive radio, so more information was urgently needed before any meaningful model could be conceived.</italic>’- M Ito, The Cerebellum (2011)</p><p>Whereas the circuits of the cerebral cortex are characterised by the presence of profuse re-entering loops (most connections of the cerebral cortex originate in other regions of the same cerebral cortex), the cerebellum exhibits an almost perfect feedforward structure, with an organisation whose regularity and simplicity has baffled generations of experimentalists and theoreticians. The impressive multi-scale regularity of cerebellar structure led to the idea of the ‘neuronal machine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eccles et al., 1967</xref>). The quote from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>, illustrates the challenge of imagining how the obstinate repetition of a single interconnection pattern among a reduced number of components could lead to the complex cerebellar function. However, its impressive evolutionary conservation suggests that its function has to fulfil an important role, for motion and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whiting and Barton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramnani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barton and Venditti, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Magielse et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>One possibility is that the complexity of cerebellar function should not be found at the level of the individual circuits – as would be the case for a radio – but that those circuits would provide the substrate over which complexity would emerge, as waves in the ocean or patterns in a vibrating Chladni plate. A deeper understanding of the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales of organisation would be probably more appropriate to understanding phenomena unique to this level of organisation, complementing the extensive exploration of microscopic circuits and molecular properties of cerebellar cells.</p><p>Our results provide a closer look into the nature of macroscopic cerebellar anatomy, its relationship with cerebral anatomy, its diversity across mammalian species, and its evolution. First, we showed that our computational neuroanatomy workflow, for which code and data have been made available open source, produces reliable results comparable with those of the literature. Second, we showed that the OU model, often used to model stabilising selection, is the one that fits phenotypic diversity the best. The OU model tended to dampen extreme variation, driving phenotypes towards the mean faster than the BM model would. Third, we showed that brain phenotypes segregated into a group of ‘diverse’ phenotypes, which increased over several orders of magnitude together with body size, and a second group of ‘stable’ phenotypes, which increased only slightly with brain size. Both groups were linked by significant negative partial correlations. The stable phenotypes were related to the local shape of cerebellar folding: folial width, folial perimeter, and thickness of the molecular layer. They changed over only ~0.5 order of magnitude between species with differences in brain size of ~2.5 orders of magnitude and difference in body size of ~11 orders of magnitude. Fourth, our allometric analyses confirmed the strong correlation between cerebellar and cerebral size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barton and Harvey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whiting and Barton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herculano-Houzel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smaers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashwell, 2020</xref>), and we extended these results to show that the same strong relationship holds for cerebellar folding: larger cerebella appear to be disproportionately more folded than smaller ones. Additionally, the allometric law for the increase of cerebellar folding was the same as for the increase of cerebral folding. Fifth, we estimated the evolutionary trajectories which may have led to the current phenotypic diversity. The main evolutionary trajectory showed the concerted increases and decreases in body size, brain size, cerebellar and cerebral size. Primates appeared as an outlier to this trend, with large brains relative to their body sizes. Focusing on brain phenotypes, our results showed a decoupling between diverse and stable phenotypes operating in several branches of the phylogenetic tree. This second pattern was, however, much more subtle than the global concerted increase in body and brain size.</p><p>Our results are influenced by a series of methodological choices. We will discuss the most important ones. First, we use a single cerebellar section and a single cerebral section for each species. More sections would increase the accuracy of our measurements, but would require a substantial manual segmentation effort. For our research question, having global measurements for many species was more relevant than having dense measurements for a few species. The previous work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sultan and Braitenberg, 1993</xref>, is remarkable in this respect, providing beautiful representations of the unfolded cerebellar surface for 15 different species. However, their method produced smaller cerebellar surface areas than in the same species using a more precise method, suggesting that it underestimates the actual values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sereno et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>), and hence the magnitude of cerebellar folding. Producing complete reconstructions of the cerebellar surface remains challenging, and as far as we know, only three cerebella have been precisely reconstructed: two from humans and one from a macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sereno et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>). Second, we decided to use global measurements of brain anatomy. Although we computed folial width and folial perimeter for each folium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>), and molecular layer thickness at numerous points for each brain section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we condensed all these local measurements into three median values. The cerebrum and the cerebellum show significant regional variability, but using local measurements would increase the number of phenotypes, largely exceeding the number of species. Fitting phylogenetic models with a significantly greater number of phenotypes than species is challenging (in particular, there is an ongoing debate regarding the use of OU models, see the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grabowski et al., 2023</xref>). The use of penalisation techniques and constraints in the model’s structure holds great promise and will enable the exploration of new hypotheses regarding the evolution of complex phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clavel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clavel et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, we decided to measure the raw material without aiming at correcting for shrinkage. Our reasoning was that if the relationships were sufficiently robust, we should still be able to see them despite shrinkage. This appeared to be the case: accounting for shrinkage should enhance the accuracy of our measurements making our correlations even stronger and our estimations more precise, but should not change our conclusions. Shrinkage correction is often performed using correction factors obtained from the literature, which introduces a new source of methodological variability. A more precise account of shrinkage would require, for example, acquiring MRI data before and after fixation for each species (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wehrl et al., 2015</xref>). Sections could be then registered to the undeformed MRI, allowing us to estimate deformation due to slicing and shrinkage.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>The measurement of folding</title><p>Previous studies of cerebellar folding have relied either on a qualitative visual score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yopak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lisney et al., 2008</xref>) or a ‘gyrification index’ based on the method introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zilles et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zilles et al., 1989</xref>, for the study of cerebral folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iwaniuk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cunha et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cunha et al., 2021</xref>). Zilles’s gyrification index is the ratio between the length of the outer contour of the cortex and the length of an idealised envelope meant to reflect the length of the cortex if it were not folded. For instance, a completely lissencephalic cortex would have a gyrification index close to 1, while a human cerebral cortex typically has a gyrification index of ~2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zilles et al., 1988</xref>). This method has certain limitations, as highlighted by various researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Germanaud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Germanaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stanković and Sejdić, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schaer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Toro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heuer et al., 2019</xref>). One important drawback is that the gyrification index produces the same value for contours with wide variations in folding frequency and amplitude, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>. In reality, folding frequency (inverse of folding wavelength) and folding amplitude represent two distinct dimensions of folding that cannot be adequately captured by a single number confusing both dimensions. To address this issue we introduced two measurements of folding: folial width and folial perimeter. These measurements can be directly linked to folding frequency and amplitude, and are comparable to the folding depth and folding wavelength we introduced previously for cerebral 3D meshes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heuer et al., 2019</xref>). By using these measurements, we can differentiate folding patterns that could be confused when using a single value such as the gyrification index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Additionally, these two dimensions of folding are important, because they can be related to the predictions made by biomechanical models of cortical folding, as we will discuss now.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Modelling of cortical folding</title><p>Based on our results, we hypothesise that the process leading to cerebellar and cerebral folding is the same. In both cases, partial correlations showed strong direct links between section area and length. The allometric scaling slopes for section area and length – which describe the increase in degree of folding with size – were also the same. The conservation of folial width and perimeter is similar to the conservation of folding wavelength that we have reported previously in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heuer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The folding of the cerebral cortex has been the focus of intense research, both from the perspective of neurobiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borrell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Llinares-Benadero and Borrell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández and Borrell, 2023</xref>) and physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toro and Burnod, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tallinen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kroenke and Bayly, 2018</xref>). Current biomechanical models suggest that cortical folding should result from a buckling instability triggered by the growth of the cortical grey matter on top of the white matter core. In such systems, the growing layer should first expand without folding, increasing the stress in the core. But this configuration is unstable, and if growth continues, stress is released through cortical folding. The wavelength of folding depends on cortical thickness, and folding models such as the one by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tallinen et al., 2014</xref>, predict a neocortical folding wavelength which corresponds well with the one observed in real cortices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tallinen et al., 2014</xref>, provided a prediction for the relationship between folding wavelength <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and the mean thickness (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) of the cortical layer: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. If we consider the stiffness of the cortex (<italic>μ</italic>) and the substrate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) to be similar (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>), we obtain in the case of humans, with an average cortical thickness of 2.5 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischl and Dale, 2000</xref>), a prediction of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>~10.9 mm. This corresponds well with the human folding wavelength of ~11.2 mm reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heuer et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>In the case of the cerebellum, it has been suggested that the transitory external granular layer may play the role of the expanding cortical layer in the models of cerebral cortical folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lawton et al., 2019</xref>). During development, the external granular layer produces an astonishingly large number of small granule cells. These cells migrate towards the inside of the cerebellum past the Purkinje cells to constitute the granular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leto et al., 2016</xref>). This idea was expanded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Essen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Essen et al., 2018</xref>, who proposed in particular that tangential tension along parallel fibres (axons of granule cells) constrains the orientation of folds and may be the reason for their accordion-like orientation.</p><p>We hypothesise alternatively that the expanding layer leading to cerebellar folding is the molecular layer, that growth is not driven by granule cell proliferation but by the growth of the dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells – the orientation of cerebellar folding resulting from their characteristic expansion: the dendritic trees of Purkinje cells grow mostly in 2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaneko et al., 2011</xref>), which could result in anisotropic cortical growth leading to the observed parallel folds. Indeed, in the cerebrum the growth of dendritic trees seems to be the main factor leading to cortical expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Welker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rash et al., 2023</xref>). By the end of neuronal migration from the ventricular and outer subventricular zones, the cerebral cortex is still largely lissencephalic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Welker, 1990</xref>). Most cerebral cortical folding starts after the end of neuronal migration and is concomitant with the development of cortico-cortical connectivity and the elaboration of neuronal dendritic trees. If the expansion of the molecular layer were the main driving force for cerebellar folding, we would expect folial width to be proportional to the thickness of the molecular layer according to the same formula as for the cerebral cortex. This appears to be the case, and we observe that (1) in our data folial width and molecular layer thickness are, as expected, related by a significant positive partial correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>); and (2) for a molecular layer thickness estimation across species of <italic>t</italic>~200 µm, the wavelength expected from Tallinen et al.’s formula of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>~0.87 mm corresponds well with our observed mean folial width across species of ~1 mm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Role of cerebellar folding: a constraint for modularity?</title><p>A striking characteristic of cerebellar anatomy is the multi-scale nature of its folding: in small cerebella we can observe only a first level of folding, but a pattern of folding within folding appears progressively as cerebellar size increases. For example, in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we can distinguish at least three such levels of folding. The addition of new levels of folding could be the reason why we observed relatively smaller folial width in larger cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) such as those of humans, as new smaller folds develop atop existing ones. In the human cerebrum, folding has been reported to show one level of folds on top of folds, or ‘frequency doubling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Germanaud et al., 2012</xref>). This phenomenon has also been observed in swelling gels and mechanical models of folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mora and Boudaoud, 2006</xref>). We expect that such mechanical models should be able to produce additional levels of folding if more growth were allowed or if cortices were made thinner.</p><p>For both the cerebellum and the cerebrum, the thickness of the expanding layer appears to be very stable compared with the large diversity in total volume, which could reflect to some extent a conservation of local circuits across species. Regarding the cerebellum, we could speculate that the hierarchical organisation induced by folding promotes a similar hierarchical functional organisation on top of conserved local circuits. The addition of an increasing number of folial ‘modules’ and the constitution of a nested hierarchy of super modules should induce a similar modularity of white matter connections. Cerebellar folding could then constrain the cerebellum to develop a regular, hierarchical pattern of variation in fibre length with an associated modular pattern in timing of neuronal spikes. Then, through synaptic plasticity, this could lead to a preferential potentiation of neurons within the same folium, and next within their super-folium, etc. The timing of the development of cerebellar folding could also have an influence on the constitution of cerebellar networks, reinforcing the influence of early modules (trees) on late modules (leafs).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The human dataset used has been made openly available through the BigBrain project.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of species included in this study, sorted alphabetically by orders and binomial name.</title><p>Excluded<sub>W&amp;P</sub>: excluded from width and period analyses.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Diversity and evolution of cerebellar folding in mammals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jessica Dubois as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Felipe Cunha (Reviewer # 1); Héloïse de Vareilles (Reviewer #2); Robert A Barton (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers acknowledged the importance and originality of your study. But they also raised a number of important concerns to consider.</p><p>The most critical one concerns the statistical analyses performed (see Reviewer #3's comments). Further evidence should be provided regarding the superiority of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. Besides, the objectives and relevance of the partial correlations and principal component analyses to all included variables should also be better argued given the possible over-fitting and the underlying theoretical hypotheses which are not always clear.</p><p>The reviewers were also concerned about the global presentation of the manuscript. Additional description of some methods is required. The different results should be better linked, and potentially reordered. The discussion should also be reviewed in depth. Better highlighting the methodological novelties should also be considered.</p><p>We hope that you will be able to take all these general comments into account, as well as the more detailed comments of the reviewers (see below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study is both rich and generous, and I thank the authors for the beautiful work presented and shared with the community. The investigation of the cerebellum is both essential to our general understanding of the brain and under-explored, making the efforts developed in this article essential.</p><p>I find the analyses well-led. Nevertheless, I think the reach of the current work would gain from a better emphasis on why the analyses have been conducted and what they imply. There are also aspects of the structure of the article which I find unconventional and potentially confusing for the reader.</p><p>I will address my general recommendations following the current structure of the article.</p><p>I will not address more specific concerns (specific wording, punctuation marks…) that I have in this step of the review for two reasons:</p><p>1) I believe the more general recommendations may lead to a restructuring of the article which would make some of the specific concerns irrelevant.</p><p>2) The current draft does not include line numbers, making it challenging to address line-specific recommendations (please add line numbering to the next version if possible).</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>– I have identified that the last three paragraphs match an Aims (bottom of p.2) – Methods (first paragraph p.3) – Results (second paragraph p.3). Then, the buckling models consideration of the Methods paragraph is rather an aim than a method and should be addressed in the previous paragraph.</p><p>– In my opinion, the results should not be addressed in the introduction, as there is yet no information to support them. They should be summarized at the start of the discussion instead.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>– Histological data: the microdraw.pasteur.fr/project/brainmuseum-cb webpage was not publicly available at the time of writing of this review (Not authorized to view project – 14.03.23). Please ensure that you make it available.</p><p>– Histological data: what are the anatomical criteria to identify the mid-cerebellar slice? Do these criteria ensure that you are looking at comparable structures between species? (this can either be addressed in methods or in discussion).</p><p>– Histological data: exclusion threshold – It would be nice if you included it in supp. Mat. An example of images that are just under and just over this threshold for the reader to get a grasp of the image quality requirement of the study.</p><p>– Measurement of section area and length of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex: The implications of measurements not being modified to account for shrinkage should be briefly addressed in the discussion.</p><p>– Figure 2/Table 1: the cerebellar section area/length would gain from its boundary being more explicitly defined in Figure 2's legend: is it the black contour in both cases? Is there a difference between &quot;cerebellar mid-slice section&quot; and &quot;cerebellar pial surface of mid-slice section&quot; as a boundary for those two items?</p><p>– Measurement of molecular layer thickness: From &quot;We applied a Laplacian smoothing […]&quot; to &quot;from the outside of the image.&quot; Is it the same concept with two different wordings? Maybe blend the two sentences together or delete one as it may appear that two different gradients are computed.</p><p>– Figure 4: I find image 4c confusing: is it related to images 4a and 4b? If so, why are the red dots creating such an angular curve when the black region's boundary appears very smooth on 4a and 4b? Please add more details to the legend.</p><p>– Please address all the numerical analyses led in the Results section within the methods section.</p><p>1) It would be helpful if some of the more complex types of results were introduced in the methods section, such as partial correlations conditional to all remaining measurements, or multivariate allometric scaling slopes.</p><p>2) It would be helpful if the impact of genetic model choice on the other analyses was clarified (as in, which subsequent analyses rely on this model selection).</p><p>Results:</p><p>I could not find the common thread linking all the results together. Can you either make the logical structure of the results explicit or change it so that it follows a logical order? As an example, it could go from simpler to more complex analyses.</p><p>In addition, I would move some results to the discussion. This could lead to the following structure: – statement of numerical results (including section areas if relevant and mean thickness of the molecular layer) – correlation structure – allometries – genetic models assessment – phylogenetic PCA – Ancestor character state estimation.</p><p>I suggest moving comparisons with anterior studies in the discussion, both for the very first and very last section of the results.</p><p>– Correlation structure: p.9 – please detail partial correlations and their meaning in methods.</p><p>– Correlation structure: p.9 – please detail &quot;phylogenetic&quot; PCA in methods.</p><p>– Correlation structure: p.10 – The PCA analyses should have their own subsection.</p><p>– Correlation structure: p.11 – please detail allometric slopes and multivariate allometric slopes in methods (are they used anywhere?).</p><p>– Figure 8: the method for creating coloured clusters for each group should be briefly explained, maybe in the methods section?</p><p>– Allometry: p.14 – you could re-quote the grey area in figure 10 when mentioning significance since it is not very visible and it may not be obvious to the reader that it is present in the figure.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>In my opinion, the discussion needs to be thoroughly reworked. The current content of the discussion is very general and seems to address questions related to the work proposed rather than the work in itself. Discussing related topics is interesting and relevant, but should only take a subsection of the discussion.</p><p>Here is a list of subsections that I would expect in a discussion (the order can be changed):</p><p>– summary of the results demonstrated.</p><p>– considerations about the work in a link to the state of the art (maybe 1st section of the results, considerations about coherence with the Tallinen model, and considerations about limits of the Sultan and Braitenberg pioneer study).</p><p>– discussion of methodological decisions and potential limitations (not taking into account shrinkage, comparability of mid-cerebellar slice between species, the necessity of a sophisticated method for measurement of molecular layer thickness, …).</p><p>– discussion about the interpretation of the results, ideally creating an overall link about the different results and what they tell.

There are still two statistical issues requiring a response:</p><p>1. The justification for the OU model. Grabowski et al. do not actually demonstrate that the critique by Cooper et al. is misleading – mainly they just show that Cooper et al. were correct! That is not to say that the OU model can never be justified (although some query its basis in biological reality), but that instances of its superiority over BM need to be treated very cautiously. I don't think their simulation solves the problem – the reason the OU is biased is because it does not conform to the data distributions assumptions of AIC (which has strong assumptions about normality or AICc) – this would be the same for other tree transforms like δ (Pagel). This results in the OU being statistically favoured when the 'pull' parameter is so weak it is essentially the same as the Brownian model.</p><p>2. The authors reject the criticism of overfitting by stating that their analyses do not involve fitting models. This is technically correct in strict terms but misleading. Exactly the same issues around small sample sizes per parameter (or variable) arise in partial correlation networks as in fitting a multiple regression model. Partial regression coefficients and partial correlation coefficients are susceptible to the same problem- neither can be estimated accurately without sufficient statistical power. Say you have 20 variables and 20 data points – no one would (hopefully) run a partial correlation on the 20 variables, or even 10 variables, or 5 – maybe just 2 could be justified. Here, the authors have 9 variables and 56 data points – with only 6 data points per variable, they don't have the statistical power to tease apart the relationships as they imply. Added to this, even with large samples, throwing in a bunch of variables without some explicit model that you are testing does indeed result in a correlational salad. Typically, such a partial correlation network would be liable to instability, and the more variables you add the harder it is to make sense of the individual relationships between them. Their explanation of how a negative correlation can arise between variables after controlling for their relationship to other variables is not necessary – this is obvious. What is not so obvious is why in principle there should be a negative (partial) correlation within their network – what is its interpretation? If they started with a model that predicted this or had some compelling explanation, I would be more impressed, but as it is I suspect it is an artefact for the reasons stated above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85907.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers acknowledged the importance and originality of your study. But they also raised a number of important concerns to consider.</p><p>The most critical one concerns the statistical analyses performed (see Reviewer #3's comments). Further evidence should be provided regarding the superiority of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by Reviewer #3, we evaluated our ability to decide correctly for the Brownian Motion model over the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model by simulating multivariate correlated phenotypes (9 variables) for 56 species using our phylogenetic tree. Over 1000 simulations, the Brownian Motion model was correctly selected 99.3% of the times (see the answer to Reviewer #3 for more details). This additional analysis is added to the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Besides, the objectives and relevance of the partial correlations and principal component analyses to all included variables should also be better argued given the possible over-fitting</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a more detailed description of the objectives of our analysis of partial correlations, principal component analysis, and allometry. We have aimed at providing an intuitive explanation. Neither partial correlations nor principal components rely on the fitting of a model, so there is no possible over-fitting. We hear, however, Reviewer #3’s concern about the number of phenotypes per species becoming too large for the complexity of the models, and the temptation to run arbitrary comparisons. We share that concern, and the primary objective of these two methods is to avoid the “correlation salad” evoked by the Reviewer by looking at global multivariate patterns of covariation. Our simulations also provide evidence that the complexity of our model remains adequate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>and the underlying theoretical hypotheses which are not always clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have completely re-structured our manuscript to make our theoretical standpoint more clear, providing a lengthier discussion of our methodological approach, and a more clear structure of our results and discussion, as suggested by the Reviewers. Our approach is not to test particular hypotheses, but to provide a characterisation of the phenomenon of cerebellar brain folding and its relationship with the folding of the cerebrum, as we indicate in the introduction.</p><p>From this characterisation we were able to advance hypotheses (presented in the discussion) which could be tested in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers were also concerned about the global presentation of the manuscript.

We introduce, as suggested by the Reviewers, an introduction to the measurement of folding and the advantages of our method (illustrated in Figure 3d), an introduction to the phylogenetic comparative models that we used, including an illustration showing their importance for the study of comparative data (Figure 5b), an introduction to the analysis of partial correlations with an example that aims at making their meaning more intuitive, especially concerning negative partial correlations, an introduction to principal components analysis for phylogenetic data, and an introduction to the study of allometry for bivariate and multivariate data, with examples from the literature. We have aimed at finding a good compromise between making a clear exposition, while keeping the size of the methods section reasonable. The examples that we have introduced can be reproduced and explored further in Jupyter notebooks which are included in the accompanying Github repository.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The different results should be better linked, and potentially reordered.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-structured the Results section and provided a more clear description of their links, following the advice of Reviewer #2.

The investigation of the cerebellum is both essential to our general understanding of the brain and under-explored, making the efforts developed in this article essential.</p><p>I find the analyses well-led. Nevertheless, I think the reach of the current work would gain from a better emphasis on why the analyses have been conducted and what they imply. There are also aspects of the structure of the article which I find unconventional and potentially confusing for the reader.</p><p>I will address my general recommendations following the current structure of the article.</p><p>I will not address more specific concerns (specific wording, punctuation marks…) that I have in this step of the review for two reasons:</p><p>1) I believe the more general recommendations may lead to a restructuring of the article which would make some of the specific concerns irrelevant.</p><p>2) The current draft does not include line numbers, making it challenging to address line-specific recommendations (please add line numbering to the next version if possible).</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a way of adding line numbers in Google docs, and moving to LibreOffice completely broke the layout… However, the information the Reviewer provided was very clear and we did not have difficulties finding the sections in the paper that were being discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>– I have identified that the last three paragraphs match an Aims (bottom of p.2) – Methods (first paragraph p.3) – Results (second paragraph p.3). Then, the buckling models consideration of the Methods paragraph is rather an aim than a method and should be addressed in the previous paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised version of the manuscript provides additional context which highlights the novelty of our approach, in particular concerning the measurement of folding and the use of phylogenetic comparative models. The limitations of the previous approaches are stated more clearly, and illustrated in Figures 3 and 5.</p><p>Following the Reviewer’s advice, we have thoroughly restructured our results and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In my opinion, the results should not be addressed in the introduction, as there is yet no information to support them. They should be summarized at the start of the discussion instead.</p></disp-quote><p>The brief mention of buckling models at the end of the introduction provides our justification for our measurement of folial width and molecular layer thickness. The idea of that short summary of our results is to allow readers to decide if they want to keep reading further. They are not described in any detail, just listed. A more detailed summary is provided in the discussion, as suggested by the Reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods:</p><p>– Histological data: the microdraw.pasteur.fr/project/brainmuseum-cb webpage was not publicly available at the time of writing of this review (Not authorized to view project – 14.03.23).

Do these criteria ensure that you are looking at comparable structures between species? (this can either be addressed in methods or in discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>We realised that the term mid-slice may have been confusing, and we now call it mid-section throughout the manuscript. It is simply the section in the middle of the cerebellum: there is one section that is the first one to contain the cerebellum, another one that is the last one to contain the cerebellum, this is the one that is in the middle (or the nicest of the 2 middle ones if there’s an even number of slices). The exact index of the sections is included in the repository with our data and code.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Histological data: exclusion threshold – It would be nice if you included it in supp. Mat. An example of images that are just under and just over this threshold for the reader to get a grasp of the image quality requirement of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Our whole project is now public, giving access to the raw images, and allowing for easy visual inspection of their differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Measurement of section area and length of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex: The implications of measurements not being modified to account for shrinkage should be briefly addressed in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, the revised version of our manuscript includes a more detailed description of our methodological decisions and their limitations. We discuss in particular the issue of shrinkage:</p><p>“Finally, we decided to measure the raw material without aiming at correcting for shrinkage. Our reasoning was that if the relationships were sufficiently robust, we should still be able to see them despite shrinkage. This appeared to be the case: accounting for shrinkage should enhance the accuracy of our measurements making our correlations even stronger and our estimations more precise, but should not change our conclusions. Shrinkage correction is often performed using correction factors obtained from the literature, which introduces a new source of methodological variability. A more precise account of shrinkage would require, for example, acquiring MRI data before and after fixation for each species (see Wehrl et al. 2015). Sections could be then registered to the undeformed MRI, allowing us to estimate deformation due to slicing and shrinkage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2/Table 1: the cerebellar section area/length would gain from its boundary being more explicitly defined in Figure 2's legend: is it the black contour in both cases?

Maybe blend the two sentences together or delete one as it may appear that two different gradients are computed.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to 2 different things. Laplacian smoothing produces a potential field which has a gradual change. The gradient (the mathematical operation) gives the direction of maximum change along this potential field. We changed the formulation from “We applied a Laplacian smoothing to the masked image, which created a gradient going from (…)” to “We applied a Laplacian smoothing to the masked image, which created a gradual change in grey level going from…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4: I find image 4c confusing: is it related to images 4a and 4b?

Please add more details to the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>The Figure 4a-b show a small excerpt of the whole contour, which may give the impression of regularity. Figure 4c, shows all the profiles of the section. The revised version of the manuscript includes a more detailed legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please address all the numerical analyses led in the Results section within the methods section.</p><p>1) It would be helpful if some of the more complex types of results were introduced in the methods section, such as partial correlations conditional to all remaining measurements, or multivariate allometric scaling slopes.</p><p>2) It would be helpful if the impact of genetic model choice on the other analyses was clarified (as in, which subsequent analyses rely on this model selection).</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide an introduction to partial correlations, with an example illustrating their meaning, especially for the negative ones.

This could lead to the following structure: – statement of numerical results (including section areas if relevant and mean thickness of the molecular layer) – correlation structure – allometries – genetic models assessment – phylogenetic PCA – Ancestor character state estimation.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we have displaced the allometry subsection after the subsection on correlation structure. The new structure is as follows: (1) validation of measurements, (2) evolutionary model selection, (3) correlation structure, (4) allometry, (5) ancestral phenotype estimation.

We indicate that multivariate slopes are used for all our allometric analyses, and we included a new table, Table 3, with the loadings of PC1 which describe the multivariate allometric relationships.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 8: the method for creating coloured clusters for each group should be briefly explained, maybe in the methods section?</p></disp-quote><p>The coloured clusters are only used to facilitate the visualisation of the groups. They are computed by the ggscatter package in R by fitting a normal distribution to the data points, and selecting a threshold.

We have also explicitly added the numeric CI ranges to all figures, in addition to their graphical representation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>In my opinion, the discussion needs to be thoroughly reworked.

During cerebellar development, there is a transient layer of cell nuclei close to the surface, composed of migrating granular cells. Hence, during cerebellar development, there is not only one but two layers of neuronal nuclei (dark), one external and one internal. Migrating granule cells move from the external to the internal layer, which is why in mature cerebellar cortex only one layer of neurones is present (i.e., the internal dark band observed in histological data). The aim of our algorithm is then to detect the border of this dark layer.

Figure 4b shows profile lines going from the manually drawn surface in Figure 4a to the granular layer. Each of the columns in Figure 4c corresponds to one of the profile lines in Figure 4b. Figure 4b shows just an excerpt of the whole cerebellar slice, and then just a subset of all profile lines. Figure 4c, on the contrary, shows all the profile lines for that cerebellar slice. The vertical coordinate of each profile line in Figure 4c represents the distance from the cerebellar surface; the horizontal coordinate represents the gradient (in mathematical terms) of the profile grey level. When a value changes little, the gradient is small, but when there is a large change, the gradient is large. We use this to detect the border between the molecular layer (light) and the granular layer (dark), which produces a large change in gradient. In Figure 4c these points are indicated with a red spot. We have added additional precision to our explanations.</p><p>“We estimated the thickness of the molecular layer automatically (Figure 4). We processed the histological images to convert them to grey levels, denoise them and equalise their histograms, using functions from the Scikit-image package (van der Walt et al. 2014). Starting from the manual segmentation (blue line in Figure 4a), we created a binary mask and masked out the non-cerebellar regions (for example, the neighbouring cerebrum). The molecular layer of the cerebellum appears as a light band followed by the granular layer which appears as a dark band. We applied a Laplacian smoothing to the masked image, which created a gradual change in grey level going from white close to the surface of the cerebellum to black toward the granular layer. We computed the gradient of the image, which produced a vector field from the outside to the inside. We integrated this vector field to produce a series of lines, each for every vertex in the manual cerebellar segmentation. The vector field was integrated only if the grey values decreased, and if a minimum was reached, the vector field was continued linearly. At the end of this procedure, all lines had the same length, computed so as to cover the whole range from the surface of the cerebellum to the granular layer. The grey levels in the original image were sampled along each scan line, producing a grey level profile. The grey level profiles were derived, and a peak detection function was used to determine the point of maximum white/grey contrast (Figure 4c, where the red dot shows the detected boundary), indicating the boundary between the molecular and granular layers. Figure 4b shows the part of the profile lines starting at the cerebellar surface and ending at the detected boundary. For each scan line the corresponding thickness of the molecular layer was defined as the length from the manual cerebellar segmentation until the maximum contrast point (red point). Finally, for each species, a single thickness value was computed as the median of the thickness measured for each profile line, to make our estimation robust to outliers.

Grabowski et al. do not actually demonstrate that the critique by Cooper et al. is misleading – mainly they just show that Cooper et al. were correct! That is not to say that the OU model can never be justified (although some query its basis in biological reality), but that instances of its superiority over BM need to be treated very cautiously. I don't think their simulation solves the problem – the reason the OU is biased is because it does not conform to the data distributions assumptions of AIC (which has strong assumptions about normality or AICc) – this would be the same for other tree transforms like δ (Pagel). This results in the OU being statistically favoured when the 'pull' parameter is so weak it is essentially the same as the Brownian model.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s comment include 2 sub-points:</p><p>1) The meaning of Grabowski et al.’s work. The reviewer indicates that Grabowsky et al.’s work mainly shows that Cooper et al. were correct. It is not immediately evident that this is what Grabowsky et al. intended to convey. Referring to Cooper et al.’s work, they write: “we argue that these results have little relevance to the estimation of adaptation with Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models for three reasons.” which they detail. Further in the introduction they write “We disagree, however, with Cooper et al.’s (2016) claim to have detected specific problems with the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck method and we find their recommendations against the application of the method to be unfounded”. The reviewer’s comment points, however, to an important issue, which goes beyond the specific details of Cooper et al.’s and Grabowsky et al.’s papers: that OU models (as well as any other models) need to be appraised critically, and their results not taken at face value. This is especially relevant in the case of our work, which aims at being read by an audience that in many cases will not be familiar with phylogenetic comparative methods. In the revised version of our manuscript we have aimed at making this point more clear, pointing the readers to the relevant literature. We modified our Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“Fitting phylogenetic models with a significantly greater number of phenotypes than species is challenging (in particular, there is an ongoing debate regarding the use of OU models, see the work of Cooper et al. 2016, Clavel et al. 2019, and Grabowsky et al. 2023). The use of penalisation techniques and constraints in the model’s structure holds great promise and will enable the exploration of new hypotheses regarding the evolution of complex phenotypes (Clavel et al. 2015, 2019).”</p><p>2) Justification of the OU model. We have followed the reviewer’s advice and inspected our selection of the OU model over the BM model at greater detail. We did this using simulations, as suggested in the reviewer’s previous review. Our simulations aimed at replicating the procedure adopted by Cooper et al. – i.e., simulating BM data and evaluating the number of times the OU model is incorrectly selected – while using AICc for model selection which takes model complexity into account (unlike the comparison of log-likelihoods used by Cooper et al). The reviewer comment does not make it clear why our simulations would be incorrect. AIC and AICc criteria are grounded on information theory (they evaluate the amount of information lost by modelling) and do not make distribution assumptions. AIC and AICc require the models to be estimated by maximum likelihood because one can show that asymptotically the deviance plus twice the number of degrees of freedom is proportional to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between models and the observed data, for any probability distribution (Akaike 1974). Moreover, the OU process is a Gaussian diffusion process, and by definition it has a normal distribution. So, if normality were required (which is not the case) that would not violate it. If the “pull” parameter (α in our equations) were close to 0 the OU model would reduce to the BM model and should provide the same fit, however, it would also have more parameters which will result in a higher AIC (AIC = 2k – 2 ln (likelihood)) leading to the selection of the simpler model (BM over OU). Our simulations, which use the same number of variables and species as in our data, show this to be indeed the case. In addition to our simulations, the work of Clavel et al. (2019) provides a thorough exploration of the ability of the penalised likelihood framework implemented by mvMORPH to select the correct model in different scenarios. Finally, as Clavel et al. (2019) show, the instances where one would select OU rather than BM come from upward bias in estimating α, so that we would tend to detect it to be stronger than it is rather than having it shrinking to zero as the reviewer suggests. Again, our aim is not to dismiss the reviewer’s concern, but given the evidence at hand and the results of our analyses, we have no justification for selecting a BM model by principle when both our model selection methodology and our power analysis indicate that we should select the OU model. All our data and code are openly available for criticism, and we make clearer in the revised version of the manuscript that model selection is not without controversy.</p><p>“Fitting phylogenetic models with a significantly greater number of phenotypes than species is challenging (in particular, there is an ongoing debate regarding the use of OU models, see the work of Cooper et al. 2016, Clavel et al. 2019, and Grabowsky et al. 2023). The use of penalisation techniques and constraints in the model’s structure holds great promise and will enable the exploration of new hypotheses regarding the evolution of complex phenotypes (Clavel et al. 2015, 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors reject the criticism of overfitting by stating that their analyses do not involve fitting models. This is technically correct in strict terms but misleading. Exactly the same issues around small sample sizes per parameter (or variable) arise in partial correlation networks as in fitting a multiple regression model. Partial regression coefficients and partial correlation coefficients are susceptible to the same problem- neither can be estimated accurately without sufficient statistical power. Say you have 20 variables and 20 data points – no one would (hopefully) run a partial correlation on the 20 variables, or even 10 variables, or 5 – maybe just 2 could be justified. Here, the authors have 9 variables and 56 data points – with only 6 data points per variable, they don't have the statistical power to tease apart the relationships as they imply.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for misinterpreting the reviewer’s previous comment. We have addressed the reviewer’s criticism and performed simulations to estimate our statistical power to detect large, medium and small partial correlations. In general, the assessment of statistical power includes 4 main components: (1) sample size, (2) α value (significance threshold), (3) effect size, and (4) power level. The sample size on its own is not sufficient to estimate statistical power. Neither a sample size of N=20 nor one of N=1,000 are intrinsically small or large: that will depend on the effect size and the α value. N=1,000 may be a large sample size for estimating differences in height between males and females, but would be completely insufficient for a GWAS where effect sizes are infinitesimal. In our case, our effect sizes (the correlations we observe) are extremely large, and our sample size largely sufficient (to clarify, we have a sample of 56 species, with 9 – strongly correlated – variables measured for each species, resulting in 504 data points). We computed our statistical power to detect large (“3 asterisks”, approx. |r|&gt;0.5), medium (“2 asterisks”, approx. |r|&gt;0.34) and small (“1 asterisk”, approx. |r|&gt;0.25) partial correlations. We had over 95% power to detect large partial correlations (α=0.05), over 90% power for medium partial correlations, and over 75% for small partial correlations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1a</xref>). For this, we generated 1000 simulations of multivariate data following our observed variance-covariance matrix (capturing the correlation structure across our 9 variables) and computed the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives. Sensitivity (power) was computed as TP/(TP+FN). We repeated the same procedure for sample sizes going from 20 to 100 species. The reason for this is that the allometric pattern in our data is so strong (PC1 captures &gt;90% of the variance) that large and medium partial correlations could be detected with 80% power even with less than 40 species. Indeed, modifying our observed variance-covariance matrix to weaken the strength of the allometric pattern (PC1) resulted, as expected, in a decreased statistical power level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1b</xref>). The criticism of the reviewer would apply in the limit where all 9 variables would be independent.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Statistical power for partial correlation analysis.</title><p>(a) Power to detect the observed effect size was computed using 1000 simulations. At each run a sample size varying from 20 to 100 species was generated with 9 variables using the observed variance-covariance matrix. We estimated our power to detect large, medium and small partial correlations. The simulations show that with N=56 species we had excellent power to detect large and medium partial correlations, and close to 80% power to detect small partial correlations. (b) Power would decrease if the allometry in our data were not as strong as it is, which makes our 9 variables strongly correlated instead of independent. For illustration, we modified the observed variance-covariance matrix to weaken its allometry: we took the square root of all eigenvalues, and scaled the resulting variance-covariance matrix so that its determinant would be the same as in the observed matrix. This results in a less anisotropic, more “spherical” variance-covariance matrix. As expected, statistical power decreases (however, it is still ~90% for large partial correlations).

Both approaches are, however, equally valid and used, yet with different aims in mind. Here we interpret it as “an unprincipled selection of variables and their bivariate correlations”. First, our selection of variables is justified, and their more thorough presentation was already addressed following the previous comments from reviewers #1 and #2. Briefly, they cover different but complementary aspects of anatomical diversity (body size, brain size, section area and length) and stability (folial width, folial perimeter and thickness of the molecular layer). The first group of variables is widely used in the literature, and their inclusion facilitates comparison (some of these comparisons are the subject of our subsection on “validation”). The second group of variables is more infrequent, however, they are fully justified in theoretical terms, in particular given biomechanical models of folding (as described at length in our manuscript). Second, our methodology for the exploration of the correlation structure of the data is based on well established multivariate methods (principal component analysis, partial correlations analysis) whose aim is exactly to avoid an unprincipled choice of arbitrary bivariate correlations. Our analyses also take phylogenetic structure into account – in a multivariate manner. However, if “correlational salad” refers only to the presence of many correlations, then yes, our multivariate analysis of correlation structure could be seen as many bivariate correlations (although they all result from a single matrix decomposition operation in the case of PCA, and a single matrix inversion in the case of partial correlations), but this is a valid approach for data exploration that is able to provide helpful insight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typically, such a partial correlation network would be liable to instability, and the more variables you add the harder it is to make sense of the individual relationships between them.</p></disp-quote><p>Our simulations help address this concern, as they show that we have excellent statistical power to detect the partial correlations conveyed by the variance-covariance matrix of our variables. While we acknowledge that in many instances partial correlations may offer unreliable information, in the current scenario this is not applicable due to the exceptionally strong allometric pattern present in our data (strong effect size).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Their explanation of how a negative correlation can arise between variables after controlling for their relationship to other variables is not necessary – this is obvious. What is not so obvious is why in principle there should be a negative (partial) correlation within their network – what is its interpretation? If they started with a model that predicted this or had some compelling explanation, I would be more impressed, but as it is I suspect it is an artefact for the reasons stated above.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for having misunderstood the previous comment of the reviewer concerning the impossibility to interpret negative partial correlations. Our aim was to provide a simple example showing how they arise and which type of information they may convey. Partial correlation analysis is one of the basic tools for exploratory data analysis, and we believe their general usefulness is beyond doubt.</p><p>In the precise case of our results, partial correlation provides interesting perspectives on several aspects. For example, they suggest that the strong correlation between cerebellar and cerebral section area and length is not completely the reflection of a common correlation with body size or brain weight: cerebellar section area would be significantly correlated (Figure 7c, r=0.328) with cerebral section area even if the influence of all other variables were removed. Additionally, the two significant negative correlations (r&lt;-0.34, r&lt;-0.36, p&lt;0.01) are also interesting, as they suggest a decoupling between diverse and stable phenotypes. This information is particularly relevant for the discussion concerning cerebral and cerebellar folding, as they point to a similar folding mechanism for both structures. We do not pretend to provide a definitive answer on the issue, but our results provide a compelling direction for future investigation. The statistical significance of our findings, reported in the previous revision, provided evidence on their robustness, which is now reinforced by our power analysis.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for his comments, which have motivated us in particular to perform additional analyses which demonstrate more clearly the validity of our results, while also stating more clearly their potential limitations. The reviewer had concerns about sample sizes, and the pertinence of OU models and partial correlation analyses which we have tried to operationalise and approach through simulations and analyses of statistical power. We hope the exposition of our results is now more clear, as well as the evidence of their robustness.</p><p>References</p><p>Akaike, H. (1974). A new look at the statistical model identification.
