Yet how these changes influence the neuronal computations necessary for normal brain function are not well understood. To identify cellular mechanisms underlying the maturation of synaptic integration in interneurons, we combined patch-clamp recordings of excitatory inputs in mouse cerebellar stellate cells (SCs), three-dimensional reconstruction of SC morphology with excitatory synapse location, and biophysical modeling. We found that postnatal maturation of postsynaptic strength was homogeneously reduced along the somatodendritic axis, but dendritic integration was always sublinear. However, dendritic branching increased without changes in synapse density, leading to a substantial gain in distal inputs. Thus, changes in synapse distribution, rather than dendrite cable properties, are the dominant mechanism underlying the maturation of neuronal computation. These mechanisms favor the emergence of a spatially compartmentalized two-stage integration model promoting location-dependent integration within dendritic subunits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>dendritic integration</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>neuronal computation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-BSV4-00166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cathala</surname><given-names>Laurence</given-names></name><name><surname>DiGregorio</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Patch-clamp electrophysiology, fluorescence imaging, and computational modeling were used to identify cellular mechanisms underlying maturation of dendritic computations in interneurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dendritic integration of spatiotemporal synaptic activity is fundamental to neuronal computation, which shapes the transformation of input activity into output spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Silver, 2010</xref>).

SCs receive excitatory inputs from granule cells and, in turn, modulate the excitability and firing precision of the cerebellar output neurons, Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arlt and Häusser, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Häusser and Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mittmann et al., 2005</xref>). The thin SC dendrites (~0.4 μm diameter) filter synaptic potentials as they propagate to the soma and confer sublinear summation of synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the maturation of these dendritic operations and neuronal computation of interneurons have not been explored.</p><p>Here, we study in detail the maturation of the synaptic and integrative properties of SCs in the cerebellar cortex. We combined patch-clamp recordings with fluorescence-guided electrical stimulation, fluorescence and electron microscopy three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, and numerical simulations, to examine synapse strength and spatial distribution. Unlike unitary inputs in other neuron types, we found that adult SCs had smaller and slower miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) than those observed in immature SCs. This could be explained by enhanced electrotonic filtering since immature SCs are thought to be electrotonically compact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carter and Regehr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Llano and Gerschenfeld, 1993</xref>). However, we found that their dendrites are as thin as in adult SCs and capable of robust electrotonic filtering and sublinear summation of synaptic inputs. Using a novel fluorescence synaptic tagging approach, we found a significantly larger contribution of distal dendritic synapses in adult SCs, due to a substantial increase in dendritic branching combined with constant synapse density. Multicompartment biophysical modeling confirmed that developmental changes in synapse distribution could reproduce the developmental reduction and slowing of recorded mEPSCs and the increased sublinear integration observed in adult SCs. Our findings provide evidence that SCs implement different neuronal computations throughout development: a predominant global summation model in immature SCs shifts to sublinear dendritic integration in adult SCs, favoring the developmental emergence of the two-layer integration model. This work provides a mechanistic description of the maturation of neuronal computation resulting from both functional and anatomical changes in synaptic transmission and integration. Our findings and approach also provide a framework for interpreting the functional implications of dendritic morphology and connectivity alterations on information processing within neural circuits during disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs become smaller and slower during development</title><p>The strength and time-course of synaptic transmission are fundamental to information processing within neural networks since they influence the efficacy and temporal precision of the transformation of synaptic inputs into neuronal outputs. Excitatory synaptic inputs trigger postsynaptic conductance changes due to the opening of neurotransmitter-gated receptors, which are activated following transmitter release. These conductance changes are integrated within dendrites into local excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that then propagate to the cell body and contribute to somatic voltage. The strength and time-course of synaptic conductances are known to change during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cathala et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koike-Tani et al., 2005</xref>) and can affect dendritic integration, which in turn may alter neuronal computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To identify factors that shape the postnatal development of SC integrative properties, we first compared excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded in acute brain slices from immature SCs soon after they reach their final position in the outer layer of the cerebellar cortex (postnatal days P13–19) and from adult SCs (postnatal days P35–57). Because of their low release probability, excitatory synapses formed by granule cell axons (parallel fibers, PFs) release on average only one synaptic vesicle per synaptic contact, despite the presence of multiple release sites per synaptic contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foster et al., 2005</xref>). We, therefore, examined these physiologically relevant ‘quantal synaptic events’ using somatic recordings of spontaneously occurring AMPAR-mediated miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in the presence of TTX to block spontaneous presynaptic activity. mEPSCs arise from the release of a single neurotransmitter vesicle and occur randomly at all synapses converging onto a single neuron. We did not examine NMDAR currents since they are located extrasynaptically and do not contribute to postsynaptic current under low-intensity and low-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carter and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs can provide an unbiased assessment of the effective distribution of postsynaptic strengths throughout the entire somatodendritic compartment.</p><p>We found that AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs occurred with a similar frequency at both ages (1.37 ± 0.27 vs. 1.14 ± 0.13 Hz, p &gt; 0.05), but mEPSCs were significantly smaller and slower in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>).

Taking advantage of the orthogonal projection of PFs, we used parasagittal cerebellar slices to stimulate specific PF beams that are synaptically connected to well-defined regions of an Alexa 594-loaded SC by placing an extracellular electrode either above the soma or close to the distal part of an isolated dendrite branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We recorded evoked qEPSCs using whole-cell voltage clamp of the SC soma. This approach allows precise control of the location of the activated synapses, in contrast with mEPSCs that can arise from unknown synapse locations anywhere along the somatodendritic axes. Dendritic filtering could then be examined by measuring the amplitude and time-course (response width at half-peak, half-width) of these synaptic events, typically used to estimate cable filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rall, 1967</xref>). To isolate qEPSCs, PFs were stimulated in low release probability conditions (EPSC success rate of &lt;10 %; 0.5 mM extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and 5 mM [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]). In these conditions, the average EPSC generated from all successful trials is a good approximation of the quantal current amplitude and time-course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Silver, 2003</xref>). When stimulating somatic synapses, qEPSCs recorded at the soma had a mean peak amplitude of 62 ± 3 pA, a 10–90% rise time of 0.14 ± 0.004 ms, and a half-width of 0.60 ± 0.02 ms (<italic>n</italic> = 25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). In contrast, the stimulation of distal synapses, in the outer third of the dendritic field, produced somatically recorded qEPSCs that were significantly smaller (mean amplitude: 46 ± 3 pA) and slower (10–90% rise time of 0.24 ± 0.012 ms and a half-width of 0.88 ± 0.04 ms; <italic>n</italic> = 18; all p &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Simulated qEPSCs generated from a dendritic location 45 µm from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) exhibit amplitude and kinetics values with the range of experimental values. Taken together, these results are consistent with cable filtering of EPSCs as they propagate along dendrites in immature SCs.</p><p>The decreased amplitude of qEPSCs evoked in the dendrite could also be due to lower AMPAR content of dendritic synapses. As AMPAR density in SC synapses is constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Masugi-Tokita et al., 2007</xref>), we used postsynaptic density (PSD) size as a proxy for the number of AMPARs. We measured PSD area of somatic and dendritic synapses from 3D electron microscopy reconstruction of immature SCs. We reconstructed the soma and the dendritic tree of two SCs (P14 and P17) loaded with Alexa 594 and biocytin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Immunogold labeling of biocytin made it possible to identify PSDs along soma and dendrites originating from the labeled SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). PSD area was constant along somatodendritic axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), ruling out synaptic scaling as a mechanism for reducing dendrite-evoked qEPSCs.

Therefore, the developmental reduction in postsynaptic strength most likely results from fewer AMPARs activated by the release of glutamate from the fusion of a single vesicle.</p><p>To confirm the reduction in synaptic AMPARs during maturation, we compared somatic PSD areas between immature and adult SCs. In immature SCs, mean somatic PSD size was 0.039 ± 0.002 μm<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 83 synapses; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which is 39 % larger than that of adult SCs (0.028 ± 0.0015 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 97, p &lt; 0.05; data obtained by the same method from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2012</xref>).

We hypothesized that changes in synapse distribution could underlie the slowing of mean mEPSCs time-course observed adult SCs. In support of this hypothesis, immature SC mEPSC rise and decay kinetics are similar to those of somatic qEPSCs (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), whereas adult SC mEPSC kinetics are closer to those of dendritic qEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, in immature SCs the mean mEPSC decay (<italic>τ</italic><sub>decay</sub> = 0.68 ± 0.06 ms) is similar to the qEPSC decay from somatic synapses (half-width = 0.60 ± 0.02 ms; p &gt; 0.05), but significantly different from those of dendritic synapses (half-width = 0.88 ± 0.04 ms; p &lt; 0.05). This suggests that synaptic responses from distal synapses do not participate significantly to the mean mEPSC at this developmental stage. In contrast, the adult mEPSC decay (<italic>τ</italic><sub>decay</sub> = 1.31 ± 0.14 ms) is close to the dendritic qEPSC decay (half-width = 1.14 ± 1.92, p &gt; 0.05), but significantly different from that of somatic synapses (half-width = 0.59 ± 0.06, p &lt; 0.05), estimated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2012</xref>). These results are consistent with mEPSCs in adult SCs arising more often from more distal synapses.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we examined the distribution of excitatory synaptic inputs along the somatodendritic compartment in immature and adult SCs. Since SC dendrites lack spines, we used transgenic mice conditionally expressing Venus-tagged PSD95 to label putative excitatory synapses. We then mapped Venus-tagged PSD95 puncta associated with the somata and dendritic trees of Alexa 594-filled immature and adult SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>), defining puncta located within 200 nm of the dendritic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) as excitatory synapses targeting the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; see Methods). Venus-tagged PSD95 puncta within the soma and dendritic tree of nine immature and eight adult 3D-reconstructed SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), showed ~80 % more puncta on adult SCs (582 ± 48 puncta vs. 324 ± 21 in immature SCs, p &lt; 0.05; of which 27 ± 3.2 and 21.17 ± 2.5 are at the soma of immature and adult SCs, respectively). Synapse distribution was assessed by counting the number of PSD95 puncta within 10 µm segments at increasing distance from the soma. In immature SCs, ~ 80 % are within 35 µm of the soma, in contrast to only ~40 % this close to the soma in adult SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). However, the ratio of detected puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) to dendritic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) shows that puncta density remained constant across the dendritic tree at both ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, the larger number of puncta located further from the soma in adult SCs is not due to increased puncta density with distance, but larger dendritic lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>) and many more distal dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, Sholl analysis) due to a larger number of branch points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), but not a &quot;greater number of primary dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). The similarity between the shapes of synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and dendritic segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) distributions was captured by a similarity in their skewness (0.38 vs. 0.32 for both distributions in immature and −0.10 and −0.08 for adult distributions). These data demonstrate that increased dendritic complexity during SC maturation is responsible for a prominent shift toward distal synapses in adult SCs. Therefore, if mEPSCs were generated from a homogeneous probability of release across all synapses, the bias toward distal synapses in adult SC will generate quantal responses that experience stronger cable filtering.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>PSD95 puncta distribution on immature and adult stellate cell (SC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Maximum intensity projection of merged images showing a P14 (top) and P42 (bottom) SC labeled with Alexa 594 (magenta) and Venus-tagged PSD95 puncta (green).

We simulated qEPSCs evoked by synaptic activation at the soma and at 10 µm intervals along the somatodendritic axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Assuming that mEPSCs are generated randomly with an equal probability at all synapses, we generated a simulated <italic>mean mEPSC</italic> by summing the qEPSCs generated at each distance (qEPSC<sub>d</sub>) each weighted by its relative frequency according to the synapse distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, right panel). For each dendritic segment, the obtained weighted qEPSC<sub>d</sub> describes its relative contribution to the mean mEPSC waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, left panel). One can see that qEPSC<sub>d</sub>s arising from distal locations in the adult were relatively larger in amplitude as compared to immature SCs and therefore would contributed more to the simulated mean mEPSC waveform. As an example, the contribution of the weighted qEPSC<sub>d</sub> at 45 µm to mEPSC was small in immature SC while it was more prominent in adult SC (compare the green traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As a result, the mean mEPSC was smaller in adult SCs than in immature SCs (26.0 ± 0.6 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 9 dendrites vs. 52.2 ± 0.4 pA, <italic>n</italic> = 7 for <italic>R</italic><sub>i</sub> 150 Ω.cm) and its time-course had slower rise (10–90% rise time = 0.24 ± 0.05 vs. 0.17 ± 0.01 ms) and decay (half-width = 1.11 ± 0.04 vs. 0.77 ± 0.01 ms; for all p &lt; 0.05). Thus, distally generated qEPSC<sub>d</sub>s dominate the mean mEPSC more strongly in adult than in immature SCs, making the mean mEPSC smaller and slower in adult SCs.

These simulations show that immature dendrites demonstrate sublinear summation, supporting experimental difference between somatic and dendritic STP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p>To estimate the impact of development changes in synapse distribution on the maturation of SC computations, we compared simulated subthreshold I/Os between immature and adult SCs with their respective age-dependant <italic>g</italic><sub>syn</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). For immature SCs we examined subthreshold I/Os when activating synapses at 15 µm along reconstructed dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, green), a distance with the highest relative number of synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and compared to I/Os generated from synapse activation at 45 µm in adult SCs (distance with the largest relative number of synapses).

Because large <italic>g</italic><sub>syn</sub> can generate sublinear integration at the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), we estimated the dendrite-specific sublinearity for each <italic>g</italic><sub>syn</sub> by taking the ratio between the relative sim eEPSPs amplitude (normalized to quanta) at a given distance and the normalized sim eEPSP amplitude for somatic synapses. The final estimate of dendritic sublinearity was then defined as one minus this ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). While both immature and adult SCs exhibited sublinear integration, dendritic sublinearity was larger in adult SCs for all postsynaptic strengths, supporting an increased difference between the two layers of integration (i.e., soma vs. dendrite). The smaller difference in sublinearity between soma and dendrite in the immature SC resulted from both fewer distal synapses and the larger <italic>g</italic><sub>syn</sub>. Thus, the developmental increase in dendritic field complexity and decreased postsynaptic strength together contribute to the establishment of a two-stage integration model and provide a cellular substrate for a developmental increase in computational power of SCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Dendritic integration of synaptic inputs is a critical component of neuronal information processing, but little is known about how it matures during neuronal network formation and maturation. We took advantage of the late development of the cerebellar cortex to characterize developmental changes in synaptic and dendritic properties. By combining patch-clamp recording of cerebellar SC interneurons, 3D reconstructions of their aspiny dendrites, along with the identification of excitatory synapse locations, and numerical simulations, we showed for the first time how the maturation of synapse distribution within interneurons combines with changes in postsynaptic strength and increased dendritic branching to shape the development of neuronal computation. This maturation process favors the emergence of a compartmentalized two-stage integrator model, which extends the repertoire of transformations of synaptic inputs into neuronal output in adult SCs. These results highlight the importance of characterizing not only dendritic morphology, but also synapse placement and synaptic strength, in order to correctly infer a neuron’s computational rules.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comparison of synaptic properties between immature and adult SCs</title><p>Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in immature and adult SCs showed a developmental decrease in mEPSC amplitude and slowed kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results contrast with findings in other neurons that show faster mEPSCs during maturation due to changes of AMPAR subunits, vesicular content of neurotransmitter, and/or synapse structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cathala et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koike-Tani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>). Knowing that dendritic inputs could be electrotonically filtered, we took advantage of the ability to selectively stimulate somatic synapses to isolate somatic qEPSCs for comparison between the two ages. Evoked qEPSCs showed a developmental reduction in amplitude (~40%), with no change in kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This likely results from the smaller adult PSD size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and hence a lower AMPAR number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Masugi-Tokita et al., 2007</xref>), rather than a developmental reduction in the peak glutamate concentration at the postsynaptic AMPARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or change in AMPAR subunits composition (see Results).</p><p>A defining feature of immature SCs is the high propensity of quantal EPSPs to generate spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carter and Regehr, 2002</xref>). However, the observed developmental decrease in synaptic conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and increased filtering of mEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) will tend to reduce the influence of single synaptic inputs on somatic voltage in adult SCs, increasing their dynamic range of subthreshold integration. Therefore, individual synaptic inputs are less likely to influence adult SC neuronal output. Moreover, since PSD area is constant along the somatodendritic axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the observed developmental reduction in synaptic conductance can be extrapolated to the whole dendritic tree. Thus, there is no evidence of synaptic conductance scaling mechanisms that offset dendritic filtering, as described for pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Magee and Cook, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Menon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nicholson et al., 2006</xref>).

However, combining experiments and simulation we showed that immature SCs have similar dendritic integration properties as adult SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2012</xref>): (1) dendrite-evoked qEPSCs are smaller and slower than those evoked at the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), consistent with cable filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); (2) STP differed between dendrite and somatic stimulation and did not reveal supralinear recruitment of voltage-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nevian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>); and (3) simulated subthreshold I/Os were sublinear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These results are supported mechanistically by several experimental findings such as (1) the measured membrane time constants that are identical at the two developmental stages, (2) the dendritic diameters being similarly small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and (3) the paired-pulse facilitation difference between dendrite and soma which is reproducible with a passive biophysical model like in adult SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

The narrow dendritic diameters at both ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) suggest that the local input resistance is only slightly different. We cannot rule out that developmental changes in gap junction expression could contribute to the maturation of SC dendritic integration, since they are thought to contribute to the axial resistivity and capacitance of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Szoboszlay et al., 2016</xref>). All the recordings were made with gap junctions intact, including for membrane time constant measurements.

Previous studies have shown that synapses are not uniformly distributed along dendrites, allowing pyramidal neuron dendrites to operate as independent computational units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Menon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polsky et al., 2004</xref>), and retinal starburst amacrine interneurons to compute motion direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vlasits et al., 2016</xref>). We considered the possibility that the distribution of synapse locations within the dendritic tree was altered during SC maturation. We found that synapses were uniformly distributed along the somatodendritic axis with a similar density at the two ages. However, adult SCs had more synapses located at further electrotonic distances (~2/3 vs. 1/3 of synapses were more than 30 μm from the soma; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) due to increased dendritic branching. Thus, the distal-weighted synaptic distribution in adult SCs favors inputs that experience stronger cable filtering. This was confirmed by simulating a mean mEPSC at the two ages, that fully reproduce the mEPSC recorded experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), by weighting simulated qEPSCs according to the relative number of synapses at specific distances along the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, the large fraction of distal synapses in adult SCs was sufficient to account for the observed developmental difference in mEPSC amplitude and time-course. Moreover, since the space constant does not change significantly with development and the dendritic tree complexity increases, the number of computational segments is expected to increase with age.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Developmental changes in computational rules</title><p>Our findings highlight the critical importance of understanding both the structural and functional mechanisms underlying developmental refinement of synaptic integration that drives a neuron’s computational properties and, the emergence of mature microcircuit function. While a defining feature of immature SCs is the high propensity of quantal EPSPs to generate spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carter and Regehr, 2002</xref>), the observed developmental decrease in synaptic conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and increased filtering of mEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) will tend to reduce the influence of single synaptic inputs on somatic voltage in adult SCs, increasing their dynamic range of subthreshold integration. Although dendrites in immature and adult SCs exhibit similar electrotonic filtering, the distal bias in synapse location promotes sublinear subthreshold dendritic integration in adult SCs. Unlike pyramidal neurons, where synapse strength and density are scaled to normalize the contribution of individual inputs to neuronal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Magee and Cook, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Menon et al., 2013</xref>), the spatially uniform distribution of synapse strength and density in SCs do not compensate the electrotonic filtering effects of the dendrites or the increased number of distal synapses due to branching.</p><p>These properties of quantal synaptic responses, together with the larger difference in sublinearity between soma and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), will favor the emergence of a spatially compartmentalized two-stage integration model in adult SCs, thereby promoting location-dependent integration within dendritic subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polsky et al., 2004</xref>) and enhanced neuronal computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cazé et al., 2013</xref>). In immature SCs, the repertoire of computations is more similar to a simple single-stage integration model where large and fast synaptic potentials will promote reliable and precise EPSP–spike coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cathala et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fricker and Miles, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2010</xref>), which may be critical for driving the functional maturation of the local microcircuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akgül and McBain, 2020</xref>). In contrast, synaptic integration and summation in adult SCs can obey different rules depending on synapse location within the dendritic tree enabling to discriminate a larger number of spatial patterns of synaptic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2015</xref>) and therefore favor spatially sparse synaptic representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cazé et al., 2013</xref>) that might be essential for the development of enhanced pattern separation by Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cayco-Gajic et al., 2017</xref>). Since a recent theoretical study showed that sublinear integration is also a property of hippocampal fast-spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tzilivaki et al., 2019</xref>) that influence memory storage, it will also be important to determine if these interneurons exhibit a similar maturation of their neuronal computation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders</title><p>The increasing complexity of dendritic arbors, accompanying changes in synaptic connectivity and function during development is not limited to the cerebellum.

Asymmetrical synapses made by axon terminals onto SC somata and dendrites were analyzed only if they were fully present within the serial sections. The PSD length of the asymmetrical synaptic membrane specialization was measured on each ultrathin section, and the PSD area was calculated by multiplying the summed synaptic length from each synapse with the thickness (70 nm) of the ultrathin sections.

Maximal intensity projections of confocal images were performed using a ×100 1.1 NA Nikon dipping objective in 0.2 μm increments as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2012</xref>). Dendritic diameters were estimated from the FWHM of pixel intensity line profiles on 1 µm segments of dendrites, made perpendicular to dendritic length using the same procedure as for adult SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2012</xref>). In brief, we selected dendritic segments for measurement throughout the dendritic tree to homogeneously sample the diversity of diameters. We collected 430 line profiles from 18 immature SCs, then averaged the profiles from the same dendritic segments (<italic>n</italic> = 93). The imaging resolution within the molecular layer was estimated from the width of intensity line profiles of SC axons. The FWHM was 0.30 ± 0.01 µm (<italic>n</italic> = 57 measurements over 16 axons) and a mean of 0.27 ± 0.01 µm (<italic>n</italic> = 16) when taking into account the thinnest section for each axon. Only 2 % of all dendritic measurements are &lt;270 nm, suggesting that the dendritic diameter estimation is hardly affected by the resolution of our microscope.</p><p>2P imaging: The two-photon scanning microscope (2PLSM, Ultima IV, Bruker) was equipped with a Ti:Sapphire Laser (Chameleon II, Coherent Inc) at 940 nm (SC body, Alexa 594) and 810 nm (Venus-tagged PSD95 puncta) using a ×60 water-immersion objective (LUMFL N, 1.10 NA, Olympus). The point spread function of the microscope was estimated from the FWHM value of the x-, y-, and z-intensity line profiles from 3D images of 200 nm yellow-green fluorescent latex beads (FluoSpheres, F8811, Thermo Fisher Scientific): PSF<sub>810x/y</sub> = 325 ± 27 (SD) nm, PSF<sub>810z</sub> = 1178 ± 121 (SD) nm, and PSF<sub>940x/y</sub> = 390 ± 23 (SD), and PSF<sub>940z</sub> = 1412 ± 141 (SD) nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>3D reconstructions and puncta detection from 2P images</title><p>We examined the distribution of excitatory synaptic inputs along the somatodendritic compartment in SCs from a transgenic mouse line that conditionally expresses Venus-tagged PSD95 under the control of the nitric oxide synthase one promoter (PSD95-Enabled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fortin et al., 2014</xref>] × Nos1 Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2014</xref>]). We patch-loaded single SCs with the fluorescence indicator Alexa 594, then performed live two-color 2PLSM to identify Venus-tagged PSD95 puncta associated with the labeled somata and dendritic trees. <italic>Z</italic>-Stacks were acquired for each wavelength with a <italic>z</italic>-step of 300 nm, a pixel size of 154 nm, and an image size of 512 × 512 pixels. To correct for a shift in the focal point for the different wavelengths and a potential drift in <italic>x</italic>/<italic>y</italic>-directions, the individual stacks were registered to each other using as a reference the dendritic structure imaged using Alexa 594 emission, which is primarily excited at 810 nm, but weakly excited at 940 nm which allows to record both the puncta and the cell body simultaneously. The registration was performed using the IMARIS <italic>stitcher</italic> tool. Fluorescence emission was spectrally separated from laser excitation using a custom multipass dichroic (zt 405/473–488/nir-trans; Chroma) and a short pass IR blocking filter (ET680sp-2p8; Chroma). Venus and Alexa 594 fluorescence emission were spectrally separated and detected using detection filter cubes consisting of a long-pass dichroic (575dcxr; Chroma) and two bandpass filters (HQ525/70 m-2p and HQ607/45 m-2p, respectively; Chroma). A multialkali (R3896, Hamamatsu, Japan) photomultiplier tubes was used to detect Alexa 594 fluorescence and gallium arsenide phosphide tube (H7422PA-40 SEL, Hamamatsu) for the Venus channel. Proximal and substage detection were used to increase signal to noise.</p><p>Dendrite tracing: The image analysis software IMARIS 9.5 (Bitplane) was used for dendritic tracing and fluorescence puncta detection. Fluorescence images were filtered using a 3 × 3 px median filter to remove noise. Image stacks were then further combined using the IMARIS <italic>stitcher</italic> tool to create one contiguous file that permits tracing of the entire dendritic tree. Dendrites, but not axons, were traced in IMARIS using the <italic>filament</italic> tool in a semiautomatic mode using the <italic>AutoPath</italic> method and the options <italic>AutoCenter</italic> and <italic>AutoDiameter</italic> activated. The soma center was chosen as the starting point with centripetally tracing along dendrites. Dendritic lengths were estimated as the dendritic path distance from the center of the soma and Sholl analysis was performed with IMARIS from all reconstructed SC.</p><p>PSD-95 Venus puncta detection: Fluorescence puncta were detected using the IMARIS spot creation tool, using background fluorescence subtraction to compensate for different levels of fluorescent intensity along the <italic>z</italic>-axis of the stack. The initial minimal spot search size was set to 300 × 300 × 1100 nm, slightly smaller than the PSF at 810 nm. No further thresholds or criteria were applied inside IMARIS. Parameters describing the fluorescent puncta, including the intensity at the center, their spatial coordinates, and their diameters, were exported as excel files via the Statistics tab and further analyzed using custom python scripts. In order to separate the PSD95 puncta from false detection of noise, two threshold criteria were applied. (1) All spots with a diameter smaller than and equal to the PSF (300 × 300 × 1100 nm) were rejected. (2) Only spots with a peak intensity larger than the mean of the background intensity plus three times its standard deviation of the background noise, were considered for subsequent analysis. In combination, the thresholds ensure that the spots originated from fluorescent puncta and not false positives generated from noise fluctuations. The background intensity and its corresponding standard deviation were measured for each file in <italic>Fiji</italic>, by selecting regions without puncta and using the <italic>Measure</italic> tool to calculate the mean and standard deviation. In order to ensure consistent sampling of the background, mean and noise estimates were made from at least ten different regions at different <italic>z</italic> positions in each stack, corresponding to an area between 17–27 μm<sup>2</sup> (790–1210 pixels) and 10–40 μm<sup>2</sup> (430–1850 pixels), for the immature and adult SCs, respectively. This approach is limited by the resolution of 2P fluorescence imaging to differentiate individual synapses within clusters and thus may result in an underestimate of absolute synapse density, but allowed for an unbiased estimate of synapse distributions at the two developmental stages.</p><p>Puncta located on somata were selected from the total pool of detected puncta (described above) using the following criteria: (1) spots were associated with the soma if the peak intensity at the position of the spot center in the Alexa 594 channel was larger than half the maximum of the whole stack, (2) detected spot diameters were greater than the size PSF (300 × 300 × 1100 nm), and (3) spot intensities were larger than the mean plus 3*SD of background intensity of the PSD95-Venus channel, measured from within the soma. Puncta from somata that showed saturation in the Alexa 594 channel were not included in the analysis.</p><p>Analysis of spot and dendrite distances: The structure of the dendritic tree, as well as the position of the puncta, were further analyzed using custom python scripts (Rückerl F.2021.

The dendritic tree was reconstructed with the center of the soma as its root using the python <italic>NetworkX</italic> package. Fluorescence puncta were considered to arise from the labeled dendrite if they were located within a maximal distance from the center of the dendrite. This distance was taken as the dendritic radius, estimated from IMARIS, plus 200 nm (~HWHM of the PSF<sub>810</sub>). The estimation of local radius was made from IMARIS binary masks using a threshold of the local contrast (<italic>DiameterContrastThreshold</italic>) set at three times the standard deviation above the background fluorescence noise. The diameter is then calculated using the <italic>Shortest Distance from Distance Map</italic> algorithm, which estimates the diameter as the distance from the center of the dendrite to the closest part of the surface determined by the above threshold. The average dendritic radius, using this approach, was found to be 0.66 ± 0.28 (SD) µm for adult, and 0.72 ± 0.27 (SD) µm for immature mice. As this value was larger than that estimated from single-photon confocal imaging, it was only used as a part of the criteria for assigning a fluorescence puncta to a reconstructed dendrite. For each dendritic branch, the number of PSD95 puncta and their distance to the soma surface were calculated. As the data points of the dendrite structure obtained from IMARIS are not homogeneously spaced, the dendritic structure was resampled in 100 nm intervals with the distance for each segment recalculated with respect to the starting point of each corresponding branch from the soma surface (estimated using the binary mask as for the dendrites). Histograms for the distribution of PSD95 puncta and the number of dendritic segments at a given distance from the soma were then generated in 10 µm bins and used to estimate the puncta density along the dendritic tree. Cumulative plots were sampled at 1 µm intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using the Neuromatic analysis package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rothman and Silver, 2018</xref>) written within the Igor Pro environment (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA). mEPSCs were detected with a threshold detection method and mEPSC population average is calculated from the mean EPSC response calculated for each SC. All EPSCs were baseline subtracted using a 1 ms window before the stimulation artifact. Peak amplitudes were measured as the difference between the baseline level immediately preceding the stimulation artifact, and the mean amplitude over a 100 μs window centered on the peak of the response. EPSC rise time was estimated as the time the EPSC rose from 10 to 90% of the peak amplitude (in ms). Decay kinetics were assessed either as the width of the EPSC at the amplitude one-half of the peak (half-width in ms) or as the weighted time constant of decay (<italic>τ</italic><sub>decay</sub>) calculated from the integral of the current from the peak, according to:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>t</italic><sub>peak</sub> is the time of the EPSC peak, <italic>t<sub>∞</sub></italic> is the time at which the current had returned to the pre-event baseline, and <italic>I</italic><sub>peak</sub> the peak amplitude of the EPSC.</p><p>All data are expressed as average ± SEM otherwise noted.

Here the authors delineate the contribution of these parameters to synaptic integration in developing cerebellar stellate cells. Using a range of cutting edge approaches, they report that changes in synaptic distribution dominate the observed maturation of dendritic integration, providing new insight into the mechanisms contributing to neuronal maturation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Developmental emergence of two-stage nonlinear synaptic integration in cerebellar interneurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Foster et al., 2005 shouldn't be used to support exclusive uni-vesicular release at PF-MLI synapses, since it addresses multi-vesicular release and AMPAR saturation at PF-PC synapses. In general, a central assumption that mEPSCs provide an unbiased assessment of the effective synaptic strength is not convincing because there is abundant evidence that PF-MLI synaptic contacts are heterogeneous in terms of the number of vesicles released per action potential (Malagon et al., 2016; Pulido and Marty, 2019; Vaden et al., 2019). Nahir and Jahr (2013) provide support that a majority of evoked release is mediated by a single vesicle at PF-MLI synapses in adolescent rats, but considering the goals of this manuscript to assess the contribution of 'synaptic strength&quot; over development, the authors should address whether this variable contributes to the differences between mEPSC and qEPSCs as well as qEPSCs over development.</p><p>2) Figure 2. It looks like the amplitude of the simulated EPSC drops off faster as a function of distance in the mature vs. immature SC (these data should be presented on the same scale). Is this due to increased branching in the mature cell that in turn mediates the difference in Figure 8D? Please discuss more explicitly.</p><p>3) Figure 7. It would strengthen the conclusion to see this model validated experimentally with electrical stimulation, such as by plotting the qEPSC amplitudes and kinetics as a function of distance of the stim electrode from the soma. It seems like these data might already exist, but aren't presented directly. Including experimental data like what is shown in Figure 1 and 2 of Abrahammson et al., but in the adolescent SCs would validate that the previously established model still applies in cells from younger animals, and help rule out other contributions from AMPARs or dendritic membrane properties, or synaptic glutamate concentration (see pt 1).</p><p>4) Figure 8 B,C,D. It is not surprising that the same biophysical model with smaller dendritic branches recapitulates the behavior of the adult SC with minor quantitative differences (it is hard to imagine a different outcome). But one wonders whether this simulation can be verified experimentally or perhaps more importantly, whether conclusions would be generalizable if NMDAR activation (which seems likely to change over maturation) is considered. The exclusive focus on AMPAR-only integration seems of limited relevance for understanding the computational changes occurring over SC development.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>P. 7 l. 197 the different sections of the dendrites per cell should have been quantified separately to determine whether there are variations among dendrites in the same cell and among different cells. The question of how locations for diameter measurements (see also the next point) were chosen is relevant in particular when adult SCs presenting higher dendritic complexity reflected in more branches are being compared to immature SCs. It would be worth considering to break down the diameters per branch order, instead of collating all data in a global mean (see below P15, l. 429-430). All this could affect the properties of dendrites as well as the distribution of synapses along the dendrites (see Figure 2B p33).</p><p>P. 31 Figure 2A,B how did the authors ensure fair sampling of the dendritic tree for the measurement of dendritic diameters?</p><p>P. 31 Figure 2B Compare to Abrahamsson et al., 2012 Figure 4B: it would be helpful to see the two distributions (immature and mature SC) together.</p><p>P. 9 l. 280 &quot;PSD area was constant….&quot; But in Figure 3G there is no quantification of this. It is just an observation. Provide quantitative data about PSD are at the soma vs dendrites and distance from the soma, as well as cumulative plots and bin distributions instead of Figure 3G (as done for LM data in Figure 6).</p><p>P. 10 l. 298-299 n = 83 from 3 cells (see Figure 4C legend) vs n = 97 from 2 cells from Abrahamsson et al., 2012. N = 83 from 3 cells from immature when n=97 from 2 cells in mature: is the number of excitatory synapses onto the soma the same in immature vs mature SC? A density measurement would be more appropriate to compare variations, if any.</p><p>P. 9 l. 277: Why did the authors not compare (and pool if statistically possible) the data from the 3 unloaded SCs (Figure 4C) and the 2 loaded cells (used in Figure 3F)?</p><p>P. 10 l. 306-311 &quot;In addition to cable filtering of synaptic currents, a neuron's somatic response to dendritic input is also affected by synapse distribution within its dendritic tree,…..&quot; and P. 10 l. 320-321 &quot;To test this hypothesis, we examined the distribution of excitatory synaptic inputs along the somato-dendritic compartment in immature and adult SCs.&quot; Light microscopy was utilized to quantify these parameters (Figure 6). These parameters should also be quantifiable from the EM data the authors already have. From these data it should be possible to quantify and plot &quot;synapse number vs distance from the soma&quot;. These data should then be compared to the data presented at P. 11 l. 326-336, as well as to the previous EM data about PSD size once these have also been quantified (P. 9 l. 280). EM data should accompany the LM data even more so when the authors themselves point out in Methods (l. 719-722) &quot;This approach is limited by the resolution of 2P fluorescence imaging to differentiate individual synapses within clusters and thus may result in an underestimate of absolute synapse density, but allowed for an unbiased estimate of synapse distributions at the two developmental stages.&quot;</p><p>P. 11 l. 323-324 &quot;We then mapped Venus-tagged PSD95 puncta associated with the somata and dendritic trees of Alexa 594-filled immature and adult SCs (Figure 5A-D)&quot; and l. 326-328 &quot;Venus-tagged PSD95 puncta within the soma and dendritic tree of 9 immature and 8 adult 3D-reconstructed SCs (Figure 5G), showed ~ 80 % more puncta on adult SCs (582 {plus minus} 48 puncta vs. 324 {plus minus} 21 in immature SC, p&lt;0.05).&quot;</p><p>No data about the PSD95 puncta on somata only are presented (i.e. separated from the puncta on dendrites data). These should be added and compared to the data obtained by EM.</p><p>In the data presented in Figure 6B, in mature SCs the mode of the synapse distribution is in the 45 µm bin from the soma, whereas in the immature SCs it is in the 15 µm bin. But the distributions are different in shape: in mature SCs, the distribution is quite gaussian whereas in immature SC it is skewed. It might be interesting to know the skewness of the two distributions. This is particularly evident in Figure 6A cumulative plot where the mature is very shifted to the right compared to the immature. As pointed out, interestingly the synapse distribution at the two ages (Figure 6B) is very similar to the shape of the Sholl analysis in Figure 6F. Overall how do these LM data compare to EM data quantified as suggested above?</p><p>P. 11 l. 351 &quot;EPSCs arising from distal locations in the adult were larger and contributed relatively more to the simulated mean mEPSC waveform (Figure 7B).&quot;: This is confusing. The colour scheme (including especially the white bars) in Figure 7B is also highly confusing. Please choose a better way of presenting this key result of the paper in the text and Figure 7 – distally generated mEPSCs dominate the mean mEPSC more strongly in adult than in immature SCs, making the mean mEPSC smaller and slower in adult SCs.</p><p>P. 14 l. 467 &quot;Voltage-clamp recordings of mEPSCs showed that their time course and amplitude are both halved during development (Figure 1).&quot;: confusing. The amplitude is halved but the rise and decay time constants are doubled.</p><p>P. 19 The authors state that &quot;For the area measurement of synapses on soma, serial sections through three unlabeled neighbor SCs were also used to avoid potential turbulence due to the patching.&quot; (l. 627-629) Are the data presented for the PSD size of synapses onto the soma in Figure 3G from these 2 patched cells or are they from the 3 unloaded cells in Figure 4C? These should be specified and only used if the data from the patched cells in Figure 3 are statistically comparable to those from the unloaded cells in Figure 4. The data for Figure 3F and 4C have also been obtained with two different EM sectioning and imaging methods. The rationale should be explained behind passing from a 300-400 section long ribbons on tape (ATUM), that allows proper 3D reconstructions of synapses, to a &quot;classic&quot; serial section on grid/slots with much lower number of sections per ribbon as well as the higher risk of losing sections containing part of synapses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Modeling throughout the manuscript is done without taking into consideration the effect of series resistance. In the methods section the authors note that no series resistance compensation was used for the recordings, which considering the 6-8 MΩ tip resistance is presumably substantial. This may have a dramatic effect on the recorded current kinetics.</p><p>– Dendritic width are calculated from fluorescent images, even though the dendritic diameter is around the limit of diffraction limited techniques. The authors may have access to relevant electron microscopic data, which could be used for comparison to check for accuracy if possible.</p><p>– Dendritic impedance needs to be investigated electrophysiologically for young SCs, or the model needs to be repeated and illustrated for several different dendritic input impedance profiles.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65954.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The principal factors required for generating insightful predictions about dendritic integration are (a) the passive membrane properties, (b) the dendritic morphology and (c) an estimate of voltage gated channels expression.</p><p>Immature SC passive membrane properties. We estimated the passive membrane properties (membrane time constant) of immature SCs using the same method as for adult SCs (Abrahamsson et al., 2012) and found similar values. The procedure is described in the Methods. To perform model simulations considering these immature SC values we adjusted the specific membrane resistance (Rm) to match the experimentally determined membrane time constant for all biophysical models types (idealized and 3D reconstructed SC models). Developmental differences in morphology were explicitly incorporated for each model.</p><p>Immature SC dendritic tree morphology. We quantified developmental changes in dendritic morphology in two ways: (1) by directly measuring the dendritic diameter (430 measurements over 93 dendritic segments) – which critically influences dendritic filtering, and (2) by performing full dendritic tree reconstruction of two-photon images. In this manner, we were able to assess the developmental changes in dendritic tree length and branching, and synapse density. Because neither the small changes in membrane time constant or dendritic diameter could account for the developmental slowing of mEPSCs, we proposed that the larger relative number of synapses at longer electrotonic distances could account for a slower averaged mEPSC. This was confirmed by comparing model simulations from careful manual reconstructions of immature and adult morphology and synapses distribution SCs.</p><p>– We modified the Results and Discussion sections (see below for details) to reiterate the measured biophysical and morphological parameters estimated for the two developmental stages and used in numerical simulations. The principal motivation for model simulations was for illustration of proof of principle. First, we showed that immature SCs exhibit cable filtering of their synaptic responses. Secondly, we used biophysical models based on full 3D reconstructions to show that increased electrotonic filtering of mEPSCs is a result of a larger fraction of synapses at longer distance from the soma. Our conclusions are sufficiently justified by model simulations that explicitly implement the difference in synaptic conductance and morphological properties (line 533):</p><p>“However, combining experiments and simulation we showed that immature SCs have similar dendritic integration properties as adult SCs (Abrahamsson et al., 2012): (a) dendrite-evoked qEPSCs are smaller and slower than those evoked at the soma (Figure 3), consistent with cable filtering (Figure 2); (b) STP differed between dendrite and somatic stimulation and did not reveal supralinear recruitment of voltage-gated channels (Nevian et al., 2007) (Figure 8); and (c) simulated subthreshold I/Os were sublinear (Figure 8). These results are supported mechanistically by several experimental findings such as (a) the measured membrane time constant that are identical at the two developmental stages, (b) the dendritic diameters being similarly small (Figure 2), and (c) the paired-pulse facilitation difference between dendrite and somatic reproducible with a passive biophysical model like in adult SCs (Figure 8). Taken together, the data are consistent with SCs displaying little developmental changes in voltage-gated channel expression (Molineux et al., 2005) and low densities of sodium (Myoga et al., 2009) and calcium channels (Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016).</p><p>The integration of fast synaptic events such as AMPAR-mediated EPSC is critically influenced by the intracellular resistivity, the local membrane capacitance, and dendritic diameter (Equation 2). Since internal resistivity is a challenge to estimate without dual electrode recordings, we examine a wide range of internal resistivities and found that they did not alter qualitatively our conclusions. The narrow dendritic diameters at both ages (Figure 2B) suggest that the local input resistance is only slightly different. We cannot rule out that developmental changes in gap junction expression could contribute to the maturation of SC dendritic integration, since they are thought to contribute to the axial resistivity and capacitance of neurons (Szoboszlay et al., 2016). All the recordings were made with gap junctions intact, including for membrane constant measurements. However, their expression in SCs is likely to be lower than their basket cell counterparts (Hoehne et al., 2020; Rieubland et al., 2014). Overall, the basic electrotonic machinery to filter synaptic responses is already present as soon as SC precursors reach their final location in the outer third of the molecular layer.”</p><p>Lack of voltage-gated channels in immature SCs: Dendritic nonlinearities can arise from the expression of voltage-gated channels that can amplify or counteract EPSPs. We did not explicitly examine the contribution of voltage-gated channels in immature SCs in this study, as we did for adult SCs (Abrahamsson et al., 2012). Still, for the following reasons, we did not implement voltage-gated channels in our simulations:</p><p>1) Studies on young animals (P14) and older (P24) suggest similar voltage-gated channel expression (Molineux et al. 2005), indicating that the results from Abrahamsson et al., 2012 apply to immature SC.</p><p>2) Sodium channels are expressed at low densities in SC dendrites, if at all (Myoga and Regehr, 2009).</p><p>3) Paired-pulse ratios of evoked multi-quantal EPSCs in immature SCs show no evidence of voltage-gated channel recruitment (see Nevian et al., 2007). They are also well-predicted by our passive biophysical models, which we have now added to Figure 8 (panel B).</p><p>4) Most of the study focuses on quantal EPSCs, which are less likely to depolarize dendrites to recruit voltage-gated channels.</p><p>Regarding the potential contributions of developmental changes in AMPAR to EPSC. At some synapses, properties of synaptic AMPAR have been shown to change during development, underlying a developmental speeding of mEPSCs. EPSC in immature SC have been shown to be mediated by CP-AMPAR predominantly containing GluR3 associated with TARP γ2 (Stargazin) and TARP γ7 (Soto et al., 2007; Bats et al., 2012). During development, GluR2 subunits are inserted into synaptic AMPARs in an activity-dependent manner (Liu et al., 2000), affecting calcium permeability of the receptors (Liu et al., 2002: Soto et al. 2007) without impacting EPSC kinetics (Liu et al., 2002) or channel conductance (Soto et al. 2007). Consistent with these findings, we did not observe any changes qEPSC kinetics for somatic synapses between immature and adult SCs. We, therefore, concluded that the developmental slowing of mEPSCs is unlikely due to alterations in AMPAR subunits or associated proteins.</p><p>We have modified the Results.</p><p>“This reduction in synaptic conductance could be due to a reduction in the number of synaptic AMPARs activated and/or a developmental change in AMPAR subunits. SC synaptic AMPARs are composed of GluA2 and GluA3 subunits associated with TARP γ2 and γ7 (Bats et al., 2012; Liu and Cull-Candy, 2000; Soto et al., 2007; Yamazaki et al., 2015). During development, GluR2 subunits are inserted to the synaptic AMPAR in an activity-dependent manner (Liu and Cull-Candy, 2002), affecting receptors calcium permeability (Liu and Cull-Candy, 2000). However, those developmental changes have little impact on AMPAR conductance (Soto et al., 2007), nor do they appear to affect EPSC kinetics (Liu and Cull-Candy, 2002); the latter is consistent with our findings. Therefore the developmental reduction in postsynaptic strength most likely results from fewer AMPARs activated by the release of glutamate from the fusion of a single vesicle.”</p><p>We have also modified the Discussion.</p><p>“Comparison of synaptic properties between immature and adult SCs</p><p>Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in immature and adult SCs showed a developmental decrease in mEPSC amplitude and slowed kinetics (Figure 1). These results contrast with findings in other neurons that show faster mEPSCs during maturation due to changes of AMPAR subunits, vesicular content of neurotransmitter, and/or synapse structure (Cathala et al., 2005; Chen and Regehr, 2000; Koike-Tani et al., 2005; Yamashita et al., 2003). Knowing that dendritic inputs could be electrotonically filtered, we took advantage of the ability to selectively stimulate somatic synapses to isolate somatic qEPSCs for comparison between the two ages. Evoked EPSCs showed a developmental reduction in amplitude (~ 40%), with no change in kinetics (Figure ). This likely results from the smaller adult PSD size (Figure 4), and hence a lower AMPAR number (Masugi-Tokita et al., 2007), rather than a developmental reduction in the peak glutamate concentration at the postsynaptic AMPARs (Figure 1) or change in AMPAR subunits composition (see Results section).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Broaden the scope of the conclusions by exploring additional implications of the observed developmental changes, for example, by testing whether inclusion of NMDARs alters the relative strength of distal inputs, how gap junction coupling between SCs would affect the results, and testing different dendritic impedance scenarios.</p></disp-quote><p>NMDARs:</p><p>In this manuscript, we focused on the integration of single-vesicle release events, which comprise those synaptic events during low-frequency stimulation (see below for a detailed justification). NMDARs are expressed in SC, but due to extrasynaptic localization, are not significantly activated by single vesicle release of neurotransmitter. This observation has been well-documented by several labs in immature (Glitsch et al., 1999; Carter et al., 2000; Clark et al., 2002) and adult SC (Abrahamsson et al., 2012, Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016), which have shown that EPSC and EPSP integration is insensitive to NMDAR antagonist. As a result, NMDARs would not alter the relative strength of distal inputs under low-frequency stimulation and thus will not contribute to synaptic integration of quantal EPSPs in either somata or dendrites.</p><p>It is now addressed in the Result:</p><p>“We did not examine NMDAR currents since they are located extrasynaptically and do not contribute to postsynaptic current under low intensity and low-frequency stimulation (Carter and Regehr, 2000; B. A. Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002; Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016). Therefore, AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs can provide an unbiased assessment of the effective distribution of postsynaptic strengths throughout the entire somato-dendritic compartment.”</p><p>Gap junctions:</p><p>All recordings were performed without perturbing gap junction and therefore implicitly account their contribution to the passive properties of SCs. Gap junctions are expected to contribute to the axial resistivity and capacitance of neurons (Szoboszlay et al., 2016). Unlike in Golgi cells (Szoboszlay et al., 2016), the precise location and conductance of gap junctions in SCs is not known and thus difficult to implement accurately in biophysical models. Moreover, Gap junctions in SCs are likely to be much less prominent than their basket cell and Golgi cell counterparts both in both immature (Rieubland 2015) and mature SCs (Hoehne et al., 2020). We, therefore, think that accurate and explicit modeling of gap junctions in SCs is beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, because we matched the membrane time constant of the model to that experimentally measured with any gap junctions intact, we do not expect any impact on our conclusions.</p><p>We now discuss the implication of gap junctions in the Discussion:</p><p>“We cannot rule out that developmental changes in gap junction expression could contribute to the maturation of SC dendritic integration, since they are thought to contribute to the axial resistivity and capacitance of neurons (Szoboszlay et al., 2016). All the recordings were made with gap junctions intact, including for membrane constant measurements. However, their expression in SCs is likely to be lower than their basket cell counterparts (Hoehne et al., 2020; Rieubland et al., 2014).”</p><p>Testing dendritic impedance scenarios:</p><p>The most important parameter required for accurate estimation of the local impedance is the dendritic diameter. For fast AMPAR mediated synaptic conductances, cable filtering primarily depends on the internal resistivity, the dendritic diameter, and the membrane capacitance (Abrahamsson et al., 2012 and equation 2). Lack of influence of Rm was verified in adult SC models (see the panel A of Figure S4 in Abrahamson et al. 2012). For this reason, we did not think it was necessary to explore this issue here. The specific membrane capacitance is assumed to be 0.9 uF/um2, a well-accepted value for rodent neurons. In simulations, we varied Ri over a range of published estimates, which we show as errors on most simulation plots. Because variations in Ri do not alter our conclusions, the critical parameter to be estimated is the dendritic tree morphology, particularly the dendritic diameter, which critically influences input impedance. We, therefore, conscientiously measured dendritic diameter in young SCs using confocal microscopy, the same method used for adult dendrites (Abrahamsson et al., 2012).</p><p>We have added the following sentence to the Discussion section:</p><p>“The integration of fast synaptic events such as AMPAR-mediated EPSC is critically influenced by the intracellular resistivity, the local membrane capacitance, and dendritic diameter (Equation 2). Since internal resistivity is a challenge to estimate without dual electrode recordings, we examine a wide range of internal resistivities and found that they did not alter qualitatively our conclusions. The narrow dendritic diameters at both ages (Figure 2B) suggest that the local input resistance is only slightly different.”</p><p>Equation 2 from manuscript:<inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>AC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3).

Nahir and Jahr demonstrated both multivesicular and univesicular release. However, importantly, when the number of vesicles released per AP per synapse increases, partly due to presynaptic facilitation of release and temporal summation of residual glutamate, spillover onto extrasynaptic receptors is observed. They and others (Clark et al., 2002) have shown that this does not occur in response to single vesicle fusion. Since in this study, mEPSCs and qEPSCs are responses to the release of single vesicles, we focused on the influence of dendritic morphology contributed to the filtering of single vesicle release events without considering NMDAR activation. Consideration of the nonlinear recruitment of NMDARs during high-frequency burst stimulation is beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, the slow time course of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents would produce synaptic responses that are less sensitive to cable filtering in SCs.</p><p>We have modified the Results section accordingly:</p><p>“We did not examine NMDAR currents since they are located extrasynaptically and do not contribute to postsynaptic current under low intensity and low-frequency stimulation (Carter and Regehr, 2000; B. A. Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002; Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016)”.</p><p>In our study, we define mEPSCs as spontaneous synaptic currents that arise from synapses throughout the dendritic tree in the absence of presynaptic APs (recordings performed in the presence of TTX), whereas qEPSCs are elicited from specific locations along the somatodendritic axis following extracellular stimulation of a presynaptic AP, but under very low release probability conditions such that only single vesicle release events are evoked. Thus, both synaptic current types can be used to assess postsynaptic strength. The contribution of release probability and the number of release sites are not pertinent to our study of mEPSCs and qEPSCs.</p><p>We have also clarified throughout the manuscript that our study primarily examines</p><p>developmental alterations in postsynaptic strength.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2. It looks like the amplitude of the simulated EPSC drops off faster as a function of distance in the mature vs. immature SC (these data should be presented on the same scale).

It would strengthen the conclusion to see this model validated experimentally with electrical stimulation, such as by plotting the qEPSC amplitudes and kinetics as a function of distance of the stim electrode from the soma. It seems like these data might already exist, but aren't presented directly.</p></disp-quote><p>A systemic study of the distance-dependence of quantal EPSCs was not performed. Such an experiment requires two-photon imaging for precise estimates of stimulus electrode to soma distance and is not available in the PI’s laboratory. Nevertheless, dendritic stimulation was performed by placing the stimulation electrode on the outer third of the dendritic field on isolated dendrites. However, in a subset of recording combined with 2P imaging, we obtained dendritic qEPSC with a peak amplitude of 42.5 +/- 7 pA , a 0.24 +/- 0.02 ms RT and 0.83 +/- 0.07 ms halfwidth at a distance of 51.57 μm (range 43 to 63 um, n = 5), similar to the data set described in the manuscript. Since those data represent only represent a subset of results, they were not included in the manuscript. We, however, clarified in the manuscript the location of the dendritic simulation:</p><p>“In contrast, stimulation of distal dendritic synapses, in the outer third of the dendritic field, produced somatically recorded qEPSCs that were significantly smaller (mean amplitude: 46 ± 3 pA) and slower (10-90 % rise time of 0.24 ± 0.012 ms and a half-width of 0.88 ± 0.04 ms; n = 18; all P&lt;0.05, Figure 3C, 3D). Simulated qEPSCs generated from a dendirtic location 45 μm from the soma (Figure 2C) exhibit amplitude and kinetics values with the range of experimental values. Taken together, these results are consistent with cable filtering of EPSCs as they propagate along dendrites in immature SCs.”</p><p>Specific validation of the model by direct comparison of simulations and recorded EPSCs is a standard challenge in studying dendritic integration. The variability of passive properties combined with morphological difference across dendrites and cells and variability in synaptic strength make it difficult to predict specific experimental results from simulations using mean parameters obtained from a different population of neurons. While these challenges are not unsurmountable, they are well beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, simulations by immature SC models reproduce the reduction in qEPSCs amplitude and slowing in their kinetics that falls within the range (+/- SD) of the experimental qEPSCs evoked at distal dendritic and somatic synapses. In addition, the simulations in Figure 7 using the reconstructed morphology of a single immature SC and a single adult SC reproduce experimental mEPSC data. Nevertheless, to better describe how the simulation match experiments, we modified Figure 2C by adding plots illustrating the distance-dependence of EPSC amplitude, rise time, and half-width and now directly compare measured qEPSCs to those predictions:</p><p>“Simulated qEPSCs were large and fast for synapses located at the soma (magenta trace, Figure 2C), but qEPSCs evoked from synapses located on the dendrites (grey trace; at 45 μm from the soma, Ri of 150 Ohm·cm) were 48% smaller and showed a 195% slower rise time and a 180% slower half-width. This dendritic filtering was also associated with a large increase in the local synaptic depolarization (gren trace, Figure 2C) that would substantially reduce the local driving force during synaptic transmission onto dendrites, potentially causing a sublinear read-out of the underlying conductance, as observed in adult SCs (Abrahamsson et al., 2012; Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016). Examination of the amplitude, rise time, and half-width as a function of synapse distance shows that beyond ~40 μm there is little additional cable filtering (Figure 2C, right).”</p><p>“Similarly, activation of synaptic inputs along a dendrite at increasing distance from the soma produced soma-recorded qEPSCs that become smaller and slower with distance (Figure 2F), similar to those in the idealized passive model (Figure 2C) with a dendritic diameter matching that obtained from confocal images (Figure 2B). We also simulated qEPSCs from a reconstructed adult SC (Figure 2G, 2H), which showed a similar distance-dependent decrease in amplitude as for the immature SC (Figure 2F). These simulations suggest that, like their adult counterparts, the passive morphometric characteristics of immature SCs should also produce significant cable filtering of both the amplitude and time course of EPSCs.”</p><p>“In contrast, stimulation of distal dendritic synapses, in the outer third of the dendritic field, produced somatically recorded qEPSCs that were significantly smaller (mean amplitude: 46 ± 3 pA) and slower (10-90 % rise time of 0.24 ± 0.012 ms and a half-width of 0.88 ± 0.04 ms; n = 18; all P&lt;0.05, Figure 3C, 3D). Simulated qEPSCs generated from a dendirtic location 45 μm from the soma (Figure 2C) exhibit amplitude and kinetics values with the range of experimental values. Taken together, these results are consistent with cable filtering of EPSCs as they propagate along dendrites in immature SCs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Including experimental data like what is shown in Figure 1 and 2 of Abrahammson et al., but in the adolescent SCs would validate that the previously established model still applies in cells from younger animals, and help rule out other contributions from AMPARs or dendritic membrane properties, or synaptic glutamate concentration (see pt 1).</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding a possible developmental change in synaptic glutamate concentration, we ruled this out directly by performing low-affinity antagonist experiments. Postsynaptic AMPAR blockade using γDGG produced an identical reduction in EPSC peak amplitude in immature and adult SCs (Figur 1E), with no effect on kinetics (Figure 1F). In addition, we found that the ~30% in qEPSC amplitude observed at the soma (Figure 4B) is associated with a similar reduction in PSD size (figure 4C) indicative of a smaller number of AMPAR activated upon glutamate release rather than a change in the glutamate concentration waveform. This point is discussed in the Results.</p><p>We also ruled out a contribution of different AMPAR subunits because qEPSCs recorded at the soma have identical kinetics at both ages (Figure 4B). It, therefore, seems unlikely that development changes in AMPAR subunits contribute to the observed kinetic changes, consistent with the observation that the insertion of GluR2 subunits to the synaptic AMPAR does not affect EPSC kinetics (Liu et al., 2002). This point is now discussed in the Results.</p><p>We ruled out developmental changes in passive membrane properties by examining membrane time constant, which we found almost identical for the two developmental stages.

It is not surprising that the same biophysical model with smaller dendritic branches recapitulates the behavior of the adult SC with minor quantitative differences (it is hard to imagine a different outcome).

We agree with the reviewer that experimental validation is important. We, therefore, demonstrated that dendritic the EPSC paire-pulse ratio is lower than at the soma due to sublinear summation (Figure 8A), as shown in adult SCs (Abrahamsson et al., 2012). Moreover, we now show in a new panel (Figure 8B) that the dendritic PPR from immature SCs can be reproduced with our passive model of immature SCs. Description of the new panel starts on line 441.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>or perhaps more importantly, whether conclusions would be generalizable if NMDAR activation (which seems likely to change over maturation) is considered. The exclusive focus on AMPAR-only integration seems of limited relevance for understanding the computational changes occurring over SC development.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that our study of exclusively AMPAR mediated synaptic responses is relevant since NMDAR are extrasynaptic and require long, high-frequency trains of presynaptic stimuli for their activation. This observation has been well documented by several labs in immature (Glitsch et al., 1999; Carter et al., 2000; Clark et al., 2002) and adult SCs (Abrahasson et al., 2012; Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016). These studies also showed that EPSCs evoked by single and paired extracellular stimulation are insensitive to NMDAR antagonists. As a result, NMDAR would not alter the relative strength of distal inputs and could not contribute to synaptic integration on both somatic and dendritic EPSP. In summary, NMDAR activation is not relevant for our study of developmental determinants of changes in the strength of postsynaptic quantal responses or EPSCs following single or pairs of presynaptic stimuli. Understanding the contribution of NMDARs to synaptic strength during train stimuli is titillating but beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have added text to the Discussion justify our emphasis on AMPAR-mediated EPSCs:</p><p>“We did not examine NMDAR currents since they are located extrasynaptically and do not contribute to postsynaptic current under low intensity and low-frequency stimulation (Carter and Regehr, 2000; B.

It would be worth considering to break down the diameters per branch order, instead of collating all data in a global mean (see below P15, l. 429-430).
