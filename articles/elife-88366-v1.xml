suitable genomes. To examine how genomic and karyotype divergence between parental lineages affect the incidence of asexual gametogenesis, we experimentally hybridized fishes (Cobitidae) across a broad phylogenetic spectrum, assessed by whole exome data. Gametogenic pathways generally followed a continuum from sexual reproduction in hybrids between closely related evolutionary lineages to sterile or inviable crosses between distant lineages. However, most crosses resulted in a combination of sterile males and asexually reproducing females. Their gametes usually experienced problems in chromosome pairing, but females also produced a certain proportion of oocytes with premeiotically duplicated genomes, enabling their development into clonal eggs. Interspecific hybridization may thus commonly affect cell cycles in a specific way, allowing the formation of unreduced oocytes. The emergence of asexual gametogenesis appears tightly linked to hybrid sterility and constitutes an inherent part of the extended speciation continuum.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cobitis</kwd><kwd>spined loaches</kwd><kwd>hybridization</kwd><kwd>gametogenesis</kwd><kwd>speciation</kwd><kwd>asexual reproduction</kwd><kwd>hybrid sterility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-21552S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janko</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21-25185S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janko</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RVO 67985904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janko</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant No. 539 EXCELLENCE CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000460 OP RDE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marta</surname><given-names>Anatolie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerul Educației, Culturii și Cercetării</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DIVZOO 20.80009.7007.12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marta</surname><given-names>Anatolie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Crosses of loaches with various genetic and karyptype divergence cause different reproductive outcomes in hybrids, ranging from sexual reproduction to sterility, inviability, and clonality among females.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Speciation is a continuous process, often progressing with decreasing gene flow between diverging populations. According to the concept of the speciation continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaw and Mullen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stankowski and Ravinet, 2021</xref>), hybridization between relatively closely related lineages typically results in fertile and recombining progeny and may even lead to an evolutionary meltdown or homoploid hybrid speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comeault and Matute, 2018</xref>). Increasing genetic divergence between hybridizing taxa may further promote the emergence of transgressive phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stelkens and Seehausen, 2009</xref>) or hybrid vigour but typically lowers the mean fitness of hybrids, which consequently impacts the establishment of postzygotic reproductive isolating barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comeault and Matute, 2018</xref>). In species with well-differentiated sex chromosomes, incompatibilities particularly affect the heterogametic sex (Haldane’s rule) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haldane, 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Welch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stöck et al., 2021</xref>). Ultimately, speciation is completed when the accumulation of incompatible alleles in differentiating populations induces hybrid sterility or even inviability.</p><p>However, hybridization is also known to give rise to fertile, yet asexually reproducing hybrids in various animal and plant taxa. Asexual hybrids exhibit a broad spectrum of cytological mechanisms for the production of unreduced, often clonal, gametes, which range from entirely ameiotic processes (apomixis) to those involving more or less distorted meiosis (automixis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neaves and Baumann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dedukh et al., 2022b</xref>). A relatively common gametogenic alteration leading to asexuality is premeiotic genome endoreplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), found in a variety of hybrid fishes, amphibians, and reptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Macgregor and Uzzell, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itono et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lutes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dedukh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dedukh et al., 2022a</xref>). By auto-duplication, from each chromosome usually an identical copy is produced to pair with during the meiotic prophase. Premeiotic genome endoreplication thus not only ensures clonal reproduction, but also allows hybrids to overcome problems in chromosome pairing that would otherwise lead to their sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dedukh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janko et al., 2018</xref>).

Hybrid asexuality may thus emerge in a ‘favourable evolutionary window’ of genetic divergence between hybridizing species, which should be large enough to trigger particular gametogenic aberrations, but not too large to compromise the hybrid’s fertility or even viability. The recently proposed concept of the ‘extended speciation continuum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stöck et al., 2021</xref>) explicitly links the emergence of asexual reproduction to the speciation continuum. While forming species ultimately reach complete intrinsic reproductive isolation under increased divergence, fertile hybrids may be produced at earlier stages that exhibit aberrant gametogenesis, leading towards clonal reproduction. This not only facilitates the formation of allodiploid and allopolyploid asexual hybrid lineages, but asexuality per se also effectively restricts introgression between parental species due to non-recombinant production of gametes. Hybrid asexuality may thus be considered a particular type of Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM)-incompatibilities, representing a form of intrinsic reproductive isolation during the speciation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janko et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While the evolutionary link between hybridization and asexuality has been empirically documented, it remains unclear how widespread such a link is and how commonly might asexual gametogenesis occur in hybrids. On the one hand, naturally occurring asexual hybrids exist in many major animal and plant lineages, but appear rare, suggesting that the genomic pre-conditions required for asexual reproduction may be rarely met during hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stöck et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, most of the knowledge about the evolution and biology of asexual hybrids comes from studies of naturally occurring lineages, while laboratory crossing experiments have been rarely performed to directly address the rate of clonal gametogenesis in hybrids. The questions how easily asexual reproduction is induced and why it is so often linked with a hybrid constitution thus remains unclear.</p><p>To estimate the incidence of clonal gametogenesis in a radiation of freshwater fish, we performed extensive crossing experiments of sexual species and investigated the gametogenic pathways in their hybrids, using European spined loaches of the family Cobitidae as a model. Cobitidae presents a speciose group of freshwater fish of Southeast Asian origin that spread over most of the Palearctic region since late Eocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bohlen et al., 2019</xref>). They colonized Europe in four distinct lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perdices et al., 2016</xref>), which diverged from each other around 17–20 Mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perdices et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Majtánová et al., 2016</xref>). The so-called <italic>Adriatic</italic> and <italic>Bicanestrinia</italic> lineages colonized Southern Europe and Near East regions, while Central and Eastern Europe have been colonized by the <italic>Cobitis sensu stricto</italic> lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>). This lineage is composed of two sub-groups, the so-called <italic>C. taenia</italic> clade, involving several closely related species diverged during the last 1 Mya, and <italic>C. elongatoides</italic>, which diverged ~9 Mya from the <italic>C. taenia</italic> clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janko et al., 2018</xref>). Such independent colonization events and subsequent range shifts gave rise to natural hybrid zones particularly across Central and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Janko et al., 2012</xref>). Diploid and polyploid hybrids have been reported within the family, including gynogenetic ‘asexual’ lineages.

However, the most common outcome was asymmetric, with sterility affecting hybrid males, while F1 females produced unreduced oocytes. This pattern occurred in the majority of crosses, including species pairs, like SE, SP or EO, with divergences reaching ~17 or even &gt;20 Mya back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Majtánová et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and it has also been reported from several natural hybrid complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itono et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dedukh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dedukh et al., 2021</xref>). An intermediate situation was observed in TP-hybrids between a closely related species that diverged ~1 Mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janko et al., 2018</xref>), where males produced reduced gametes and females produced both, reduced and unreduced ones.</p><p>It is generally assumed that the emergence of asexuality is a rare phenomenon that may require complex changes in gametogenic pathways and reproductive modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stöck et al., 2010</xref>). This opinion has been corroborated by the ‘twiggy’ distribution of ‘asexual’ organisms on the tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwander and Crespi, 2009</xref>) and by many failures to re-generate naturally occurring asexual hybrids by experimental crosses of their parental species (e.g. in apomictic <italic>Poecilia</italic> fish and parthenogenetic <italic>Darevskia</italic> lizards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stöck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murphy et al., 2000</xref>). However, we observed the production of unreduced gametes in 7 out of 11 crossed species pairs of loaches and in 10 out of 18 species pairs when including literature reports and natural hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Such a widespread emergence of asexual gametogenesis therefore appears not to depend on the presence of a genome from any particular parental species, but to arise relatively commonly among independent species pairs across the entire group of spined loaches. Asexual gametogenesis has also been observed in experimental F1 progeny of several other vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iwai et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that the formation of unreduced gametes, that is the necessary prerequisite for asexual reproduction, may be a much more common outcome of interspecific hybridization than it would appear from the rarity of asexual hybrid taxa that are successfully established in nature.</p><p>Some studies also suggested that the emergence of asexuality requires the evolution of specific genes within hybrid lineages after their origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberici da Barbiano et al., 2013</xref>). However, our finding that asexual gametogenesis originates relatively commonly already in the F1 generation somewhat refines this hypothesis and suggests that it is a direct result of genome merging by interspecific hybridization. Importantly, all F1-females capable of clonal gametogenesis employed an identical cytogenetic mechanism, i.e. premeiotic genome endoreplication, as also observed in many natural asexual vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betto-Colliard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itono et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dedukh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dedukh et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dedukh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iwai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bi and Bogart, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stöck et al., 2012</xref>) suggesting that gametogenic perturbations induced by hybridization are often canalised into a similar developmental pathway. The reasons for such common patterns are not clear. The regulation of cell cycle is particularly sensitive to stress and perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rotelli et al., 2019</xref>) and interspecific hybridization may act as such stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moritz et al., 1989</xref>). While asexual reproduction may employ various pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neaves and Baumann, 2011</xref>), it is possible that aberrations of cell cycle leading to endoreplication are more common since they require less accumulated incompatibilities than other routes to the production of unreduced gametes. Alternatively, the occurrence of endoreplication may reflect some predispositions, like the spontaneous production of unreduced gametes in some sexual parental lineages, which would then ensure clonal reproduction in their hybrids. However, our data argue against this alternative, since we analysed hundreds of gonocytes of sexual females without a single incidence of genome endoreplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dedukh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dedukh et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, during years of crossing experiments and population sampling, we genotyped hundreds of <italic>C. elongatoides</italic> and <italic>C. taenia</italic> and their progenies and never found an autotriploid specimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Janko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tichopád et al., 2022</xref>), which would be expected if fertilisation of unreduced gametes existed in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flajšhans et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our in-depth analysis of hybrid gametogenesis in <italic>Cobitis</italic> loaches further provided compelling evidence for a tight link between hybrid incompatibility, asexuality and sterility. Namely, the majority of meiocytes produced by both the male and female hybrids failed to form a full set of bivalents between orthologous chromosomes and were arrested at meiotic checkpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, unlike their sterile brothers, hybrid F1 females also usually contained a minor proportion of oogonia that underwent premeiotic genome endoreplication. In most our F1 hybrid females, only these rare oogonia were able to complete meiosis and form diploid gametes. Interestingly, similar observations were reported from several natural and experimental hybrid vertebrates, like ET and EN hybrid loaches, geckos and whiptail lizards (<italic>Aspidoscelis</italic>) Medaka ricefish (<italic>Oryzias</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dedukh et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dedukh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iwai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Newton et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that even successfully established hybrid asexuals usually contain only a minor proportion of oogonia, which actually undergo clonal gametogenetic pathway.</p><p>Such congruent patterns across phylogenetically distant taxa thus conform to the concept of an ‘extended speciation continuum’. Similar to the classical concept of the ‘speciation continuum’, it assumes that speciation generally proceeds from early stages characterized by the production of sexual hybrid progeny to irreversibly diverged species, whose hybrids are either sterile or even inviable. At intermediate stages, however, hybrids between diverging evolutionary lineages may not only have a certain incidence of sterile gonocytes, but also tend to produce unreduced gametes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Genome endoreplication thus appears as an effective way to overcome sterility in hybrid females, even at high levels of divergence. Asexuality may thus often represent the only reproductive pathway of hybrids between a given pair of species and, together with hybrid sterility, it may simultaneously contribute to reproductive isolation of parental species due to clonal genome propagation.</p><p>We observed that the fertility of female hybrids remains conserved due to sex-specific emergence of clonality, while males of the same cross are usually sterile. This may potentially indicate some analogy to other classical sex-related asymmetries in hybrids, like incompatibilities between sex chromosomes (Haldane’s rule) or other uniparentally inherited factors (Darwin’s corollary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandvain et al., 2014</xref>). However, the sex determination systems are not yet known in most of the investigated species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stöck et al., 2021</xref>) and in any case, the reasons for such an asymmetry are likely more complex. For instance, meiocytes in hybrid males contained significantly lower numbers of properly-formed synaptonemal complexes than non-duplicated meiocytes in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and were more severely affected by decreasing similarity of parental karyotypes (see Results, 2.3.5.). This indicates some more fundamental differences in pairing mechanisms and affinity among orthologous chromosomes fundamentally between spermatogenesis and oogenesis, e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blokhina et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, we recently found that spermatogonial cells taken from a sterile ET hybrid male may resume the ability of endoreplication when transplanted into female gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tichopád et al., 2022</xref>). This suggests that initiation of premeiotic endoreplication may rely on female-specific gonadal environment rather than on genetic sex determination.</p><p>The genetic divergence among parents may affect early gametogenic stages in hybrids through various mechanisms causing for example depletion of primordial germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoshikawa et al., 2018</xref>), improper pairing of diverged chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferree and Prasad, 2012</xref>), asynapsis between sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</xref>), or deleterious epistatic interactions between orthologous genes and their binding motifs on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balcova et al., 2016</xref>). In loaches, we documented at least two such mechanisms underlying hybrid sterility. TB and PS hybrid males had almost no spermatocytes, suggesting their gonocytes probably failed the transition to meiosis. The other type of sterility conforms to a chromosomal speciation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Faria and Navarro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Potter et al., 2017</xref>), prevailing in most F1 hybrid males, in which spermatocytes developed but possessed aberrantly paired chromosomes, preventing further progression to spermatids. Analogous patterns were observed in non-duplicated oocytes of most hybrid females, suggesting that problems in bivalent-formation have a detrimental impact on the meiosis in both male and female loach hybrids.</p><p>Karyotype evolution among parental species indeed plays a crucial role in hybrids’ reproductive capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Potter et al., 2017</xref>). Our data suggest that it has a crucial, yet indirect, impact on asexual reproduction. Specifically, hybrids between species with diverged karyotypes had less bivalents in non-duplicated meiocytes than those combining similar karyotypes. Sometimes, even hybrids between phylogenetically distant, yet karyotypically similar species could produce full sets of bivalents (e.g. OB hybrids; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). On the other hand, the numbers of endoreplicated oocytes were low in any hybrid. Their proportion was relatively higher in natural clones than in experimental F1 <italic>Cobitis</italic>, suggesting that such a trait may recover during the evolutionary establishment of a natural asexual lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dedukh et al., 2021</xref>) and/or that selection among ‘freshly’ emerged clones would favour those with the highest proportion of endoreplicated oocytes. Nevertheless, even the most widespread clones possessed only ~6% of such oogonia, suggesting that karyotype similarity allows the completion of meiosis and hybrids would mostly reproduce sexually by reduced gametes, even if they had the capacity of producing unreduced gametes, too.</p><p>While hybridization is assumed to present an important trigger of asexuality in vertebrates and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neaves and Baumann, 2011</xref>), the origins of clonal lineages are thought to be rare, and often can be traced back to a single or few hybridization events in a given species pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stöck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choleva et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple independent origins of clonal gametogenesis in spined loaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Janko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choleva et al., 2012</xref>, this study) in part contradicts this view since interspecific hybridization has been found to result in clonal gametogenesis relatively commonly up to a substantial divergence, where fertile or viable hybrids are no longer appearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). However, we emphasize that successful establishment of hybrid clones under natural conditions is likely restricted by several additional levels of selective pressure and thus filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). On the one hand, the ‘balance hypothesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moritz et al., 1989</xref>) and its expansions and fine-tuned versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stöck et al., 2010</xref>), suggest that the production of unreduced gametes probably requires some level of genetic divergence among the parental species to alter the hybrid cell cycle towards genome endoreplication. On the other hand, it appears that most meiocytes of asexual hybrids anyway do not pass through endoreplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dedukh et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dedukh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iwai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Newton et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, if the parental karyotypes remain largely similar, then orthologous chromosomes may successfully pair even in such nonduplicated meiocytes, potentially, allowing them to accomplish normal meiosis and form reduced gametes. This would decrease the proportion of unreduced gametes produced by such hybrids and negatively impact on their likelihood to establish a stable asexual lineage.</p><p>We therefore propose, that for a cross to be successful in generating an asexual hybrid, it not only has to produce a sufficient number of unreduced gametes, but it also has to prevent the formation of reduced gametes from non-duplicated meiocytes. One way to achieve this may be if hybridization involves species with sufficiently diverged karyotypes, ensuring improper pairing of orthologous chromosomes in non-duplicated gametes. Increased divergence of parental karyotypes may therefore have a positive impact on the production of stable clonal hybrids and, for instance, the fixation of certain chromosomal rearrangements among diverging populations may be accelerated by certain geographical aspects of speciation, such as parapatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Faria and Navarro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Potter et al., 2017</xref>). It would thus be attractive to test if the incidence of asexual hybrids correlates with increased rates of karyotype evolution among parental species.</p><p>The rarity of naturally occurring clonal organisms probably results from the simultaneous impact of the abovementioned selective processes. However, our data indicate that the production of unreduced gametes, which is the very basic <italic>conditio sine qua non</italic> for the evolution of asexuality, may be surprisingly ‘easy’ to trigger, especially in hybrids of distantly related lineages. Of course, we may not rule out that the frequent emergence of premeiotic endoreplication in Cobitidae reflects some specific predispositions in their gametogenic machineries in comparison to other taxa, where asexuality appears rarer. Thus, our study demonstrates that conclusions about the evolution of asexuality should not only be drawn from natural asexuals, but should be based also on experimental crosses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Selection of parental specimens and genotyping</title><p>All <italic>Cobitis</italic> specimens were obtained from the rearing facility stocks of the Laboratory of Fish Genetics, IAPG CAS CZ that had been collected during recent projects across Central Europe in accordance with environmental protection legislation.

Subsequently slides were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 4 min. In the case of females, 20 μl of cell suspension was put on SuperFrost slides (Menzel Gläser) followed by addition of 40 μl of 0.2 M Sucrose and 40 μl of 0.2% Triron X100 for 7 min and subsequently fixed in 2% PFA for 16 min. After fixation, slides with male and female pachytene spreads were air dried, washed in 1×PBS and used for immunofluorescent staining.</p><p>During immunofluorescent staining we visualized synaptonemal complexes (SC) of pachytene chromosomes using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (ab15093, Abcam) against SYCP3 protein (the lateral component of SC) and chicken polyclonal antibodies (a gift from Sean M. Burgess) against SYCP1 (the central component of SC). Crossing-over foci were identified using mouse monoclonal antibodies (ab14206, Abcam) against MLH1 protein, a mismatch repair protein. Slides were incubating with 1% blocking reagent (Roche) in 1×PBS and 0.01% Tween‐20 for 20 min. Primary antibodies (dilutions as recommended by manufacturers) were added for 1 hr at RT followed by three times washing in 1×PBS. Afterwards, corresponding secondary antibodies were added for 1 hr at RT: Alexa‐594‐conjugated goat anti‐rabbit IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen), Alexa‐594‐conjugated goat anti‐chicken IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen) and Alexa‐488‐conjugated goat anti mouse IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen).

Individual oocytes were transferred to the isolation medium ‘5:1’ (83 mM KCl, 17 mM NaCl, 6.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 3.5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol); pH 7.0–7.2) for microsurgical isolation of nuclei. Nuclear envelopes were manually removed in one-fourth strength ‘5:1’ medium with the addition of 0.1% PFA and 0.01% 1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> in glass chambers attached to a slide. This procedure ensures the presence of a chromosomal set from an individual oocyte in each separate chamber. Slides with oocyte nuclei contents were centrifuged for 20 min at +4 °C, 4000 rpm, fixed for 30 min in 2% PFA in 1×PBS, and post-ﬁxed in 50% and 70% ethanol.

But, my main concern with this study is I was left wondering if the sample sizes are large enough to get a sense how variable endoreplication is in these loach species. Most of the hybrids between species are the result of crosses between 1-2 families. Within males and females, meiocyte observations are limited to a handful of pachytene and diplotene stages. I think it would be helpful to be more transparent about the sample sizes in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We have improved the Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 to clarify how many individuals we analyzed from each genetic family and added this information to the main text. In total we obtained 12 combinations with 19 F1 hybrid families. For the combination, C. elongatoides x C. taenia hybrids we obtained three families, for C. elongatoides x C. ohridana, C. elongatoides x C. tanaitica, C. elongatoides x C. bilineata and C. ohridana x C. bilineata, we obtained two families For the rest of the combinations of hybrids we obtained single family. From these families, 79 individuals were used for the analysis of the meiocites. Additionally, 24 parental individuals, males and females, were analysed. For the parental species, we analysed 852 cells, for hybrid males we investigated 244 cells, and 665 cells for hybrid females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along these lines, the authors argue against the possibility that endoreplication may be predisposed to occur at a higher rate in some species (line 291). Instead, they suggest that endoreplication is a result of perturbing the cell cycle by combining the genomes of two different species. Their main argument is based on gonocyte counts from parental females in a previous reference. It is essential to include counts from the parents used in this study to make a clear comparison with the F1s.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we agree with your comment and included the observations of meiocytes from several parental species, i.e. C. elongatoides, C. taenia, C. pontica, C. tanaitica, and C. ohridana. Among 852 cells analyzed, we did not observe cells with duplicated genomes and abnormalities in chromosomal pairing. By contrast, among 665 pachytene cells of F1 hybrid females, we revealed altogether ~1% of endoreplicated ones. We tested these data by binomial GLM and found these differences to be significant, suggesting that sexuals, even if they may have some unnoticed duplication events, clearly have a significantly lower incidence of abnormal pachytene cells. We have now included this information in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion (lines 320-333), the authors postulate the sex-specific clonality they observe could be a result of Haldane's rule. Given these fish do not have known sex chromosomes, I do not find this argument strong. Haldane's rule refers to the exposure of recessive incompatibilities with the sex chromosomes in the hybrid heterogametic sex. This effect would therefore be limited to degenerated sex chromosomes where much of the sequence content on the Y or W has been lost. These species may have homomorphic sex chromosomes, but if this is the case, they likely are not very degenerated. Instead, it seems more plausible that the sex-specific effect the authors observe is due to intrinsic differences of spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Is there any information about sex-specific differences in the fidelity of gametogenesis from other species that would support a higher likelihood of endoreplication?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important question, however, we think it was a misunderstanding. We do not postulate that our observation conforms to Haldanes’ rule as, by contrast to this rule based on sex chromosomes, our previous publication demonstrated that whatever the gonadal sex differentiation is in our taxa, the ability to overcome sterility by asexual gametogenesis is always confined to female gonadal environment (or oogenesis in general), even in the transplanted spermatogonial cells (Tichopad et al. 2022). What we meant by our text is that our results do not fully conform to Haldane’s rule. We therefore reworded our text to rule out such a misconception.</p><p>Nonetheless, we note that it has been demonstrated that Haldanes’ rule is also applicable to species with little differentiated sex chromosomes (e.g. Presgraves and Orr 1998) and that recessive incompatibilities are not the only explanation as faster male theory or faster X may also apply in such cases (Dufresnes et al. 2016). Therefore, we have kept our remarks about Haldane’s rule here. Moreover, for several parental species, we preliminary found the occurrence of an XY gonadal sex differentiation system, albeit these are unpublished and need further validation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The final thing I was left wondering about was this missing link between endoreplication and activating the embryonic development of the diploid egg. In these loach species, a sperm is required to activate egg development, but the sperm genome is discarded (line 100). What is the mechanism of this and how does it evolve concurrently during hybridization?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. There have been many speculations about why gynogens actually need sperm to activate their egg development, but to our knowledge, no explanation has been validated to date. Interestingly, a recent theoretical model by Fyon et al. BiorXiv 2023 suggested that the ability of sperm exclusion may evolve separately from the ability to produce clonal eggs. Hence, this topic is complex and remains unresolved, and we feel that it is out of the scope of the present MS. We have slightly modified the text and added 2 refs., to address your suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The paper is well prepared - though the resolution of Fig 1 on the pdf is rather poor.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you! We have now provided the high-resolution figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I have few suggestions for improvements:</p><p>Line 58. How does endoduplication itself &quot;overcome accumulated incompatibilities&quot; other than failure of synapsis? Perhaps by maintaining the F1 state, and so avoiding reduced fitness arising from recombination and disruption of coadapted gene combinations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence to the main text “Premeiotic genome endoreplication thus not only ensures clonal reproduction but also allows hybrids to overcome problems in chromosome pairing that would otherwise lead to their sterility 15,17.” that we hope sufficiently addresses this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 118 - please explain the AKD index here - as you have some in SI. Also please be clearer on how you measure genetic divergence as proportion of heterozygous SNPs - presumably this is via exon sequences from F1 females?</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that we have explained the AKD index in the relevant part of the Methods section already. However, we have now also added a brief explanation to the Results section, as suggested. We apologize for imprecise description of the genetic divergence measurements. As described in the Methods section, this is not measured by heterozygosity (as we wrongly stated here), but as p-distance among sequences of coding regions between parental species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 126 ff.

What about EP and EN - as shown to have unreduced gametes in Fig. 2?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. Based on analyses of the diplotene stage, we showed that EP and EN hybrids produced diploid eggs. However, in pachytene, we did not find duplicated oocytes due to the rarity of endoreplication. Similarly, the low incidence of duplicated pachytene cells was observed in natural as well as F1-hybrids in loaches and reptiles (Newton et al., 2016, Dedukh et al., 2021, 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 217-219. The observed correlation of chromosome divergence (AKD index) and numbers of bivalents in pachytene makes sense and is an important observation. Did this GLM simultaneously consider the effect of genetic divergence (as implied in methods)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We originally tested separately the fit of two models, one with AKD and the other with SNP divergence. Since the AKD model significantly outperformed the SNP-based one, we focused our interpretation on the former. However, as you suggested, we now re-calculated the model taking into account the joint effects of both predictors in a single model and indeed, this model outperformed both single predictors. In conclusion, while AKD is still the strongest single predictor for the observed amounts of bivalents, the additional effect of genetic distance still significantly improves the model fit. We have now included this result into the main text.</p><p>This finding does not alter our conclusions, it just suggests that the effect of chromosomal morphology is probably more complex, involving the role of more subtle sequence divergence or structural variants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 242. The Discussion is a great read - careful interpretation and a really interesting interpretation in context of the broader literature.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the appreciation. Your positive feedback and evaluation are highly motivating us to expand our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 396.

From this table, it is unclear if a majority of these meiocytes are from a single individual or from multiple males or females. Or, in the crosses where there are multiple families, are the meiocytes sampled from all families? I am trying to get a sense whether endoreplication and the fidelity of oogenesis could be influenced by genetic variants segregating within species. If the meiotcytes are only sampled from a single individual from a single cross, you may not see this variation. If this is the case, perhaps the correlation between genetic divergence and the formation of asexual clones may not be as strong. Additional replicates may not be feasible, but at a minimum I think it would be helpful to address whether endoreplication could or could not be variable and if the sample sizes are sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We have improved the Supplementary table to clarify how many individuals we analyzed from each family and added this information to the main text. Unfortunately, additional replicates are not feasible due to the long generation time of the fish. We otherwise agree with your comment and included this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gonocyte counts from parental females: The authors say they &quot;analysed hundreds of gonocytes of sexual females without a single incidence of genome endoreplication.&quot; I could not find a clear count in the references given.
