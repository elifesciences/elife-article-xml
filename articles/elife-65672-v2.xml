microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) are pivotal for the function of multiple cell types, but the processes initiating their formation are unknown. Here, we find that the transcription factor myogenin is required in murine myoblasts for the localization of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope. Moreover, myogenin is sufficient in fibroblasts for nuclear envelope MTOC (NE-MTOC) formation and centrosome attenuation. Bioinformatics combined with loss- and gain-of-function experiments identified induction of AKAP6 expression as one central mechanism for myogenin-mediated NE-MTOC formation. Promoter studies indicate that myogenin preferentially induces the transcription of muscle- and NE-MTOC-specific isoforms of <italic>Akap6</italic> and <italic>Syne1</italic>, which encodes nesprin-1α, the NE-MTOC anchor protein in muscle cells. Overexpression of AKAP6β and nesprin-1α was sufficient to recruit endogenous MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope of myoblasts in the absence of myogenin. Taken together, our results illuminate how mammals transcriptionally control the switch from a centrosomal MTOC to an NE-MTOC and identify AKAP6 as a novel NE-MTOC component in muscle cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>MTOC</kwd><kwd>myogenin</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>muscle differentiation</kwd><kwd>AKAP6</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IZKF), Uniklinikum Erlangen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J42</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrazzi</surname><given-names>Fulvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001652</institution-id><institution>Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ELAN-16-01-04-1-Vergarajauregui</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vergarajauregui</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001652</institution-id><institution>Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CYDER</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Felix B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 410/91-1 FUGG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Felix B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EN 453/12-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Felix B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Foundation Medicine at the University Clinic Erlangen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vergarajauregui</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Felix B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Myogenin promotes centrosome attenuation and establishes the nuclear envelope as the dominant microtubule organization center via the scaffold protein AKAP6, which is required for the recruitment of centrosomal proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Correct organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton is essential for many cellular processes such as the establishment of cell shape, organelle positioning, or intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>). In proliferating vertebrate cells, proteins that control microtubule nucleation and anchoring accumulate as pericentriolar material (PCM) at the centrosome, which in turn functions as the dominant microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Prosser and Pelletier, 2015</xref>). The centrosomal MTOC is pivotal for cell cycle progression and correct chromosome segregation during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinchcliffe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khodjakov and Rieder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sir et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, MTOC function is assigned to non-centrosomal sites (ncMTOCs) during differentiation of various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanchez and Feldman, 2017</xref>). In epithelial cells, apically localized ncMTOCs participate in organelle positioning and help to establish apical-basal cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brodu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meads and Schroer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Toya et al., 2016</xref>). In neurons, dendritic branch points, Golgi outposts, and preexisting microtubules have been suggested to act as ncMTOC sites and precise control of microtubule array polarity helps to define the axonal and dendritic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luders, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ori-McKenney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sanchez-Huertas et al., 2016</xref>). In striated (i.e., heart and skeletal) muscle cells, ncMTOCs form at the nuclear envelope and contribute to correct nuclei positioning in skeletal myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elhanany-Tamir et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Espigat-Georger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gimpel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kronebusch and Singer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tassin et al., 1985</xref>). Notably, human myopathies, such as centronuclear myopathy (CNM) or Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), often feature mislocalized nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jungbluth and Gautel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Madej-Pilarczyk and Kochański, 2016</xref>). While the nuclear envelope MTOC (NE-MTOC) has been implicated in early steps of myonuclear positioning in vitro, a direct link between NE-MTOC defects and human myopathies has not been established, possibly due to the fact that many aspects of NE-MTOC formation and function remain unclear. Similarly, while microtubules are important regulators of contractility and nuclear architecture in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heffler et al., 2020</xref>), the specific role of NE-MTOC-generated microtubules remains unclear.</p><p>Despite progress in illuminating identity, composition, and function of ncMTOCs, it remains elusive which mechanisms initiate the switch from centrosomal to non-centrosomal MTOCs during differentiation of vertebrate cells. The only mechanistic insight into ncMTOC induction has been gained by studying <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal cells. It was shown that the transcription factor trachealess, which specifies tracheal fate, is required for the spastin-mediated release of centrosomal components from the centrosome and their subsequent Piopio-mediated anchoring to the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brodu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we aimed to identify mechanisms that control NE-MTOC formation in mammals utilizing skeletal muscle differentiation as an experimental system. Mammalian skeletal muscle differentiation is controlled by a family of transcription factors termed myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun and Gautel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckingham and Rigby, 2014</xref>). Among those, myoblast determination protein (MyoD) regulates commitment to a myogenic fate and is thought to promote early differentiation of myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comai and Tajbakhsh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ishibashi et al., 2005</xref>). The MRF myogenin acts as a unique regulator of terminal differentiation during myogenesis. In the absence of myogenin in vivo, embryonic myofiber formation is disturbed and the second wave of fetal myogenesis is largely abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hasty et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nabeshima et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Venuti et al., 1995</xref>). Notably, MRFs are able to induce phenotypical markers of skeletal muscle in permissive non-muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comai and Tajbakhsh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edmondson and Olson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weintraub et al., 1989</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether MRFs regulate NE-MTOC formation during skeletal muscle differentiation and whether they are sufficient for NE-MTOC initiation in non-muscle cells.</p><p>NE-MTOC formation involves the localization of different MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope. These include the PCM components pericentrin (PCNT), CDK5RAP2, and AKAP9 (also known as AKAP450) as well as γ-tubulin, key component of γ-tubulin ring complexes (γTuRCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bugnard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Espigat-Georger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gimpel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Srsen et al., 2009</xref>). At the centrosomal MTOC, PCNT, CDK5RAP2, and AKAP9 can interact with and recruit γTuRCs that in turn promote microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teixido-Travesa et al., 2012</xref>). At the nuclear envelope of myotubes, microtubule nucleation appears to specifically depend on AKAP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gimpel et al., 2017</xref>) and γ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bugnard et al., 2005</xref>). Another protein localized to the nuclear envelope is PCM-1, an integral component of centriolar satellites, which contribute to recruiting proteins to the centrosome and proper organization of the centrosomal MTOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Prosser and Pelletier, 2020</xref>). In myotubes, PCM-1 is required to recruit microtubule-associated motors to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Espigat-Georger et al., 2016</xref>). The localization of MTOC proteins at thstate nuclear envelope depends on the muscle-specific α-isoform of the outer nuclear membrane protein nesprin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Espigat-Georger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gimpel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Randles et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, we recently discovered that – in cardiomyocytes – the large scaffold protein AKAP6 acts as an adapter between nesprin-1α and the MTOC proteins PCNT and AKAP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vergarajauregui et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Based on loss- and gain-of-function experiments, quantitative analysis utilizing different cell types, and promoter studies, we show here that myogenin is required and sufficient for the formation of an NE-MTOC by controlling the expression of muscle- and NE-MTOC-specific isoforms of <italic>Akap6</italic> and <italic>Syne1</italic> that encodes nesprin-1α.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Myogenin is required for MTOC protein localization to the nuclear envelope</title><p>To gain insight into the regulation of NE-MTOC establishment in skeletal muscle cells, we correlated the expression of MyoD and myogenin during mouse C2C12 myoblast differentiation with two key steps of NE-MTOC formation: (1) the expression of nesprin-1α, the nuclear envelope anchor for MTOC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Espigat-Georger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gimpel et al., 2017</xref>), and (2) the recruitment of PCM-1, the first MTOC protein localizing to the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Srsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zebrowski et al., 2015</xref>).

Note that intermediate stages of PCM-1 nuclear envelope recruitment can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that PCM-1 recruitment occurs in a gradual manner.

In addition, depletion of myogenin in NIH3T3 cells abrogated the MyoD-GFP-induced localization of PCM-1 to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To confirm that MyoD regulates the expression of myogenin but not vice versa, we analyzed samples of differentiated C2C12 cultures depleted of MyoD or myogenin via RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). While MyoD depletion also reduced <italic>Myog</italic> levels, <italic>Myod1</italic> levels were not detectably affected in myogenin-depleted cultures. Taken together, these results further argue that myogenin is required for the localization of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope.</p><p>In order to elucidate how myogenin – whose expression did not correlate with nesprin-1α in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) – induces nuclear envelope MTOC formation, we generated stable NIH3T3 cell lines that express either mScarlet or myogenin-2A-mScarlet (MYOG-mScarlet) under control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter (Tet-ON). To induce myogenin expression and, potentially, MTOC protein recruitment to the nuclear envelope, we treated MYOG-mScarlet cells with doxycycline (Dox) for 3 days. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Dox treatment induced nuclear envelope localization of PCM-1, PCNT, and AKAP9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, E and G</xref>). To better account for the dynamic of the recruitment process, we quantified the area of the nuclear envelope positive for each MTOC protein in mScarlet and MYOG-mScarlet cells after Dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, F and H</xref>). For this, we set an intensity threshold for the MTOC protein signal and quantified the percentage of pixels above this threshold inside a 1-µm-wide band around the nucleus (identified by DAPI signal). The signal at the centrosome, which localizes in close proximity to the nucleus in most cells, accounts for the nuclear envelope coverage in mScarlet cells. Quantification revealed that median PCM-1 nuclear envelope coverage increases from 12.5% in mScarlet cells to 30.3% in MYOG-mScarlet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). PCNT was recruited with an increase of the median coverage from 8.2% in mScarlet cells to 23.1% in MYOG-mScarlet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). AKAP9, which is essential for microtubule nucleation at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gimpel et al., 2017</xref>), coverage increased only moderately from 3.6% to 6.2%, suggesting that AKAP9 recruitment is less efficient in MYOG-mScarlet cells compared to PCM-1 and PCNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). However, ~13% of analyzed MYOG-mScarlet nuclei showed a higher coverage than the maximum observed in mScarlet cells. Together, these data indicate that myogenin is sufficient to induce nuclear envelope localization of MTOC proteins in non-muscle cells.</p><p>As nuclear envelope localization of MTOC proteins requires nesprin-1α in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Espigat-Georger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gimpel et al., 2017</xref>), we examined whether myogenin is able to induce nesprin-1α expression in Dox-treated MYOG-mScarlet cells. Dox treatment resulted in nesprin-1+ nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), and RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the α-isoform transcript of <italic>Syne1</italic> is upregulated upon myogenin induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These data indicate that myogenin can induce nesprin-1α expression. Notably, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing data available through the ENCODE consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Consortium et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yue et al., 2014</xref>) predict myogenin as well as MyoD to bind a candidate regulatory element in the <italic>Syne1</italic> gene near the transcription start site of the α-isoform. To examine whether myogenin directly induces transcription of the <italic>Syne1</italic> α-isoform in MYOG-mScarlet cells by binding to the α-isoform-specific promoter in <italic>Syne1</italic>, we performed ChIP using an anti-myogenin antibody and an isotype control, followed by PCR for the ENCODE-predicted site. PCR amplification was successful from myogenin-precipitated DNA but not from IgG1 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), indicating that myogenin binds the α-isoform promoter in <italic>Syne1</italic>. To further substantiate these results, we probed lysates of Dox-treated mScarlet cells and MYOG-mScarlet cells maintained in Dox-free medium. Under both conditions, myogenin expression is not detectable. Additionally, we included an intronic region of <italic>Syne1</italic> as negative control as well as a promoter region of the known myogenin target <italic>desmin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Londhe and Davie, 2011</xref>) as positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Analysis revealed that the <italic>Syne1</italic> α-isoform promoter as well as the <italic>desmin</italic> promoter were precipitated using the myogenin antibody only in Dox-treated MYOG-mScarlet cells.

Therefore, we examined if myogenin expression induces centrosome attenuation in MYOG-mScarlet fibroblasts. Dox stimulation resulted in a significant reduction of PCNT levels at centrioles in MYOG-mScarlet cells when compared to Dox-treated mScarlet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In contrast, levels of Cep135, a centriole-associated protein, which does not relocalize to the nuclear envelope in muscle cells, did not change significantly upon myogenin induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), indicating that myogenin affects centrosomal localization of PCM proteins but not of centriole-associated proteins. To test if myogenin attenuates MTOC activity at the centrosome, we analyzed centrosomal levels of the microtubule nucleating factor γ-tubulin. Induced MYOG-mScarlet cells displayed a significant reduction in centrosomal γ-tubulin levels compared to mScarlet control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Analyzing microtubule regrowth, we observed that centrosomes still nucleated microtubules in MYOG-mScarlet cells that exhibited microtubule nucleation at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, α-tubulin signal at centrioles was less intense in MYOG-mScarlet cells compared to mScarlet cells, indicating a reduced MTOC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Myogenin ChIP-seq data was obtained at four different time points (myoblasts, 24 hr differentiation, 60 hr differentiation, and 7 days differentiation; see Materials and methods for details), whereas the RNA-seq data set contained three time points (myoblasts as well as differentiating C2C12 cells at 3 days and 7 days of differentiation). PCM-1 nuclear envelope localization can already be observed 24 hr after induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but the number of cells that differentiate and form an NE-MTOC significantly increases over time. Additionally, we assumed that genes required for the maintenance of the NE-MTOC in differentiated cells have to be actively transcribed. Therefore, we considered only those myogenin-binding sites in our analysis that were detected in the ChIP-seq data set at 24 hr, 60 hr, and 7 days of differentiation. The promoters of 2462 genes were bound by myogenin at these three time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We then intersected these 2462 genes with a list of 3800 genes, which were upregulated in the RNA-seq data set at both 3 days and 7 days of differentiation when compared to proliferating myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This intersection yielded a list of 748 potential direct myogenin target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Considering that skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes (myogenin-negative) both express nesprin-1α and exhibit an NE-MTOC, we hypothesized that NE-MTOC formation in both cell types is controlled by similar mechanisms. Thus, we assessed whether any of the 748 target genes are upregulated during rat heart development from embryonic day 15 to postnatal day 3, the developmental window in which NE-MTOCs form in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zebrowski et al., 2015</xref>). For this purpose, we utilized a microarray-derived temporal expression data set spanning rat heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Patra et al., 2011</xref>). This strategy helped to further reduce the number of candidate genes to 107 myogenin targets that potentially mediate NE-MTOC formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As our previous data suggested that nesprin-1α alone does not allow efficient recruitment of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope, we first focused on candidates that potentially cooperate with nesprin-1α in anchoring MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope. To this end, we utilized Gene Ontology analysis to identify candidates that are annotated to localize at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

This conclusion is supported by our findings that (1) myogenin is required for the localization of the MTOC proteins PCM-1, PCNT, and AKAP9 to the nuclear envelope in differentiating muscle cells, (2) ectopic myogenin expression is sufficient to promote the formation of an NE-MTOC in fibroblasts, and (3) the myogenin-induced isoforms AKAP6β and nesprin-1α are required and sufficient for the recruitment of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the role of myogenin and AKAP6 in nuclear envelope microtubule-organizing center (NE-MTOC) formation.</title><p>Myogenin induces expression of AKAP6β that connects MTOC proteins like PCNT, AKAP9, and PCM-1 to the nuclear membrane protein nesprin-1α, whose expression can be induced by myogenin as well as MyoD.

Yet, other proteins might be involved and the here presented protein complex at the nuclear envelope is hypothetical. At the same time, myogenin is sufficient to attenuate centrosomal MTOC function. AKAP6-dependent anchoring of MTOC proteins as well as microtubule nucleation from the nuclear envelope are required for correct positioning of nuclei inside differentiating myotubes.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65672-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Formation of ncMTOCs has been associated with cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanchez and Feldman, 2017</xref>), but a direct regulation of ncMTOC formation by particular differentiation pathways in vertebrate cells has remained elusive. Our results demonstrate that myogenin, which is an essential regulator of terminal differentiation, drives NE-MTOC formation in mammalian cells. This shows that terminal differentiation factors can control in vertebrates the switch of dominant MTOC localization from the centrosome to non-centrosomal sites. Notably, MTOC formation at the nuclear envelope occurs also in cells that lack myogenin or cell-type-specific transcriptional master regulators of terminal differentiation, such as cardiomyocytes or osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kronebusch and Singer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mulari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zebrowski et al., 2015</xref>). A recent study from our lab demonstrated that AKAP6β orchestrates the assembly of the NE-MTOC in cardiomyocytes and osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vergarajauregui et al., 2020</xref>), validating our findings in skeletal muscle. Therefore, it would be important in future studies to identify transcription factors that bind to the <italic>Akap6</italic> β-isoform as well as <italic>Syne1</italic> α-isoform promoters and regulate the switch from centrosomal to NE-MTOC in these cell types. For this purpose, promising cardiomyocyte and osteoclast ‘transdifferentiation’ tools using multiple transcription factors are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ieda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klose et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamamoto et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, it appears important to determine in future experiments the mechanisms underlying the preferential binding of myogenin to the isoform-specific promoters, considering the abundance of myogenin binding sites (E-boxes) throughout the genome. Notably, isoform upregulation or switching might be a general mechanism that contributes to MTOC regulation during differentiation. This assumption is supported by the recent identification of a spermatid-specific isoform of centrosomin, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of CDK5RAP2, which can induce ncMTOC formation at mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, a non-centrosomal isoform of ninein contributes to neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) and a shorter isoform of PCNT is upregulated in differentiating cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zebrowski et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Both MyoD and myogenin induced expression of nesprin-1α and AKAP6 as well as the nuclear envelope localization of PCM-1. The depletion experiments in differentiating C2C12 cells and in MyoD-transfected fibroblasts indicate that myogenin is required for the localization of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope via AKAP6 expression. While myogenin can induce nesprin-1α expression in fibroblasts, it is dispensable for nesprin-1α upregulation during C2C12 differentiation. Together, these findings suggest a model of NE-MTOC formation during C2C12 differentiation in which MyoD induces nesprin-1α as well as myogenin, which is then required to induce AKAP6 expression allowing recruitment of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope.</p><p>The centrosomal MTOC is attenuated in differentiated muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, we found that ectopic myogenin expression in fibroblasts resulted in reduced MTOC protein levels at centrosomes as well as attenuated centrosomal microtubule regrowth. Depletion of nesprin-1α or AKAP6 in this system – abolishing the localization of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope – did not result in obvious reactivation of the centrosomal MTOC, indicating that centrosome attenuation is not due to competition with the NE-MTOC. Furthermore, differentiating C2C12 cells in which myogenin was depleted maintained PCM-1 in a centriolar satellite-like pattern, albeit this pattern was less focused. Taken together, these results suggest that myogenin attenuates the centrosome during muscle differentiation independently of inducing NE-MTOC formation.</p><p>While site-specific anchor proteins for ncMTOCs, such as nesprin-1α, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Espigat-Georger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gimpel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meng et al., 2008</xref>), it remained unclear how MTOC proteins are connected to these site-specific anchors. Previously, it has been reported that overexpression of nesprin-1α in undifferentiated myoblasts is sufficient to recruit an ectopically expressed centrosomal targeting domain of PCNT and AKAP9 (i.e., the PACT domain) as well as minor amounts of endogenous PCM-1 to the nuclear envelope in a subset of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Espigat-Georger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gimpel et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show that myogenin induced the expression of the large scaffold protein AKAP6, which we prove to be essential for NE-MTOC formation and maintenance, most likely by connecting MTOC proteins to nesprin-1α. Myogenin preferentially binds and activates the putative promoters of AKAP6β and nesprin-1α isoforms, which are known to be upregulated in differentiated muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kapiloff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Michel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Randles et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, ectopic co-expression of AKAP6β and nesprin-1α, but not nesprin-1α alone, was sufficient to recruit endogenous MTOC proteins in the absence of myogenin.</p><p>While co-expression of AKAP6β and nesprin-1α induced nuclear envelope recruitment of PCM-1 in undifferentiated myoblasts, microtubule regrowth in these cells was readily observed at the centrosome but not at the nuclear envelope. This indicates that AKAP6β and nesprin-1α alone are not sufficient to generate an active NE-MTOC. As described above, NE-MTOC formation and centrosome attenuation appear to be independently regulated by myogenin. Thus, one explanation for the absence of NE-MTOC activity in the co-expression experiment might be that recruitment of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope is not efficient enough to compete with the non-attenuated centrosomal MTOC for microtubule nucleation factors. However, it appears also possible that additional myogenin-downstream mechanisms (e.g., induction of specific microtubule nucleators) are needed to activate the NE-MTOC after MTOC proteins have been recruited.</p><p>Our results indicate an important role of AKAP6-dependent NE-MTOC function in nucleus positioning in skeletal myotubes in vitro. While nucleus positioning is a frequent feature of human myopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jungbluth and Gautel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Madej-Pilarczyk and Kochański, 2016</xref>), the specific role of the NE-MTOC in these pathologies remains largely elusive. Yet, mutations in the nesprin-1 gene <italic>SYNE1</italic> have been described in EDMD patients, pointing towards a potential role of NE-MTOC defects in this pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Fully elucidating the mechanisms of NE-MTOC formation in vivo and the specific contributions of nuclear envelope-originated microtubules to the different aspects of myonuclear positioning will clarify if and how NE-MTOC defects contribute to human myopathies. In addition to nucleus positioning, microtubules help to maintain nuclear architecture in myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heffler et al., 2020</xref>) and also regulate contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). While perinuclear microtubules have been identified to be specifically important for nuclear architecture, the significance of the NE-MTOC in this context remains unclear. Precise targeting of the NE-MTOC via AKAP6 appears a promising strategy to elucidate the role of nuclear envelope-generated microtubules in maintaining nuclear architecture as well as regulating contractility. Finally, amplified and/or hyperactive centrosomes act as oncogene-like factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnandis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Godinho and Pellman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Godinho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Levine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">LoMastro and Holland, 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is important to better understand mechanisms that control MTOC activity. Notably, ectopic expression of myogenin in fibroblasts did not only induce NE-MTOC formation but also attenuated the centrosomal MTOC. In addition, myogenin expression in fibroblast was only inducing in a subset of cells an NE-MTOC. Thus, our cellular systems combined with our bioinformatics approach provide new opportunities to tackle future key questions of MTOC formation such as: What factors increase or decrease efficiency of NE-MTOC induction? What post-transcriptional processes contribute to NE-MTOC establishment? How is centrosome attenuation achieved?</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that key differentiation factors can control the switch from centrosomal MTOC to ncMTOC and cell-type-specific adaptor proteins are required to connect MTOC proteins to anchor proteins at non-centrosomal sites. Conclusively, our study (1) contributes to a better understanding of the striated muscle NE-MTOC, (2) presents a mechanistic framework that may be applicable to ncMTOC formation in other cell types and tissues, and (3) provides a cellular system to elucidate further molecular mechanisms inducing the switch from centrosomal to ncMTOCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

However, although the study identifies AKAP6 as a novel ncMTOC factor, it does not provide sufficient mechanistic insight. Is AKAP6 merely a bridge between Nesprin and AKAP450? What does it interact with, what other centrosome proteins are involved? How is its localization regulated to allow for the timely activation of the nucleus as an MTOC? Is AKAP6 sufficient to induce MTOC function? Considering these and other issues raised by all three reviewers, we feel that the manuscript does not reach the level of insight and impact that we seek for <italic>eLife</italic> at this stage. However, if the authors are able to address all of the raised issues, we would happily reconsider a new manuscript and review it in relation to these reviewer comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Becker et al. provides novel insight into the regulation of the redistribution of microtubule organizing center (MTOC) function from centrioles to the nuclear envelope during muscle cell differentiation. Assembling the non-centrosomal MTOC on the surface of nuclei and inactivating the centrosome is linked to the different cytoplasmic organization of differentiated, multi-nucleated myotubes and is required for proper alignment of nuclei along the elongated myotubes. The demonstration that myogenin expression is sufficient to induce MTOC re-distribution and the identification of the crucial role of AKAP6 in assembling the nuclear envelope MTOC are important novel findings and advance our understanding of this process. In myotubes AKAP6 depleted nuclei do not align properly, as shown previously for myotubes lacking MTOC function at the nuclear envelope. Finally, while myogenin expression is not able to induce MTOC redistribution in cancer cells, this process can be observed upon fusion with myogenin-expressing fibroblasts. The authors claim that this may serve as strategy to attenuate centrosomal MTOC activity, which has been linked to cancer development and progression.</p><p>Overall, the study presents interesting novel findings, but lacks analytical depth regarding the underlying molecular mechanism. Also, several findings require more solid quantitative analysis. In particular, the part investigating attenuation of cancer centrosomes is quite weak in this regard.</p><p>1) I am surprised that the authors seem to observe only nuclei that are either positive or negative for MTOC markers. Is this process (redistribution of centrosome proteins) not gradual? I would suggest a different way of quantifying this process, to account for the temporal aspect and include intermediate stages.</p><p>2) Related to point 1: after myogenin expression, is the centrosomal MTOC inactivated first, after, or simultaneously with the appearance of the nuclear envelope MTOC? Are centrosomes in 2G active or inactive? Do 100% of cells look like the two examples in 2G?</p><p>3) The attenuation of the centrosomal MTOC should be quantified upon myogenin expression should be quantified. PCM1 is considered a centriolar satellite marker. The authors should use additionally centrosomal markers such as pericentrin and γ-tubulin to evaluate the state of the centrosomal MTOC.</p><p>4) 3D: the spatial distribution is not very clear from the image. A larger area of the nuclear envelope should be shown and some type of quantification (e.g. intensity profiles) that reveals the difference between nesprin and AKAP6. Are the locations of antibody epitopes (N-term. vs C-term.) consistent with the authors' interpretation?</p><p>5) 4C: a different centrosomal marker that is not affected by myogenin is needed, to identify the presence of centrosomes/centrioles in all cells. Also, PCM1 is a satellite marker. The disappearance of satellites may or may not indicate changes in centrosome staining. Moreover, as the assembly of the ncMTOC, the disassembly of the centrosomal MTOC needs to be quantified.</p><p>6) Figure 6: as before, other centrosome markers (including one that is unaffected) are needed to evaluate the state of the centrosomal MTOC. Higher magnifications are also required in particular of the centrosome region.</p><p>7) The experiments in figure 6 are not convincing for claiming that centrosome attenuation can be induced in cancer cells. First, the quality of the provided data is simply not enough. Is the amount of PCM reduced? Is the activity reduced? Second, after fusion they are technically not cancer cells anymore.</p><p>8) An important experiment would be to test whether nesprin-1alpha and AKAP6 ectopic expression can induce MTOC assembly at the nuclear envelope. If so, this may allow more detailed mechanistic studies (expression of mutants etc), to provide more depth to the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Microtubule organization varies by cell type and function. Dividing cells, cancer cells, and some specialized cell types such as fibroblasts use centrosomes as microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), but most differentiated cells employ non-centrosomal MTOCs (ncMTOCs) to obtain more complicated microtubule patterns during the process of differentiation. Despite decades worth of work on the centrosome, comparatively little is known about ncMTOC composition or how the cell regulates the switch in MTOC function from the centrosome to non-centrosomal sites during differentiation. Here Becker et al., use differentiated muscle cells as a model to understand how the well-defined nuclear ncMTOC, which is a hallmark of skeletal muscle, is established. Previous studies found that PCM proteins such as AKAP450, Pericentrin, and PCM1 localize to the nuclear envelope of muscle cells, that Nesprin1a recruits these proteins, and that Nesprin and AKA450 are required for microtubule nucleation at this site. Here Becker et al., appear to uncouple the expression of Nesprin and PCM; Nesprin and PCM1 are both expressed in cells positive for expression of the transcription factor MyoD, but Nesprin expression precedes expression of the transcription factor myogenin, and PCM1 but not Nesprin expression is controlled by myogenin. These results suggested that activation of MTOC function at the nucleus is downstream of Nesprin localizing there and requires expression of myogenin targets. Consistently, myogenin expression in naïve cells is sufficient to induce nuclear MTOC activation. By mining ChIP-seq, RNAseq and microarray data, the authors identify AKAP6 as this potential target, finding that AKAP6 localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the nucleus, fails to localize to the nucleus in SYNE1/Nesprin mutant patient derived myoblasts, and is required to localize PCM1, AKAP450, and Pericentrin to the nuclear envelope. AKAP6 also is required for microtubule regrowth from the nucleus of myotubes and for nuclear positioning in these cells, a MT controlled process. Finally, the authors find that fusion of a Myogenin induce muscle cell can convert a nive NIH3T# cells with a centrosome MTOC to a nuclear MTOC state. While I love a cell fusion experiment, this result is not surprising given that fusion of a myoblast to a U2OS cell can similar convert the non-muscle cell from a centrosome to a nuclear MTOC (Fant et al., 2009, not cited).</p><p>The experiments appear well preformed and presented. However, although these studies appear to identify a novel ncMTOC factor at the nucleus of muscle cells, they do little in the way of uncovering mechanistic aspects of how AKAP6 functions there or on assembly of the nuclear ncMTOC in these cells. Is AKAP6 merely a bridge between Nesprin and AKAP450? How is its localization regulated to allow for the timely activation of the nucleus as an MTOC? Is AKAP6 sufficient to induce MTOC function? In the absence of more mechanistic insight on the role of AKAP6, I am not sure that this paper will be of broad enough interest for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The findings here do little in the way of uncovering how AKAP6 functions at the nucleus in ncMTOC formation. This could be addressed in many ways including:</p><p>– Does AKAP6 bind to Nesprin and AKAP450 (or other MTOC components) to create a bridge? If so, how is this association regulated? Limited by expression of AKAP6?</p><p>– Is AKAP6 localization sufficient to promote MTOC activity? This could be addressed by artificially tethering AKAP6 to the plasma or mitochondrial membrane and seeing if MTOC proteins and microtubules are recruited. If this worked, the ability of such a structure to compete with the centrosome could also be directly addressed.</p><p>The authors repeatedly claim that 'Myogenin is required for centrosomal protein recruitment to the nuclear envelope', but they really only look at PCM1 localization in most cases. Why not look at AKAP450? This is especially important when arguing that Myogenein controls MTOC formation downstream of Nesprin localization to the nucleus.</p><p>If Nesprin expression is not controlled by myogenin, in naïve cells in which myogenin overexpressed, how does Nesprin become expressed and localized to the nucleus? The authors briefly comment on this, but I find their explanation unsatisfying especially given what they are arguing in Figure 1.</p><p>The fusion experiment is cool and suggests that the nuclear MTOC is dominant to a centrosomal MTOC in interphase cells. However, almost the exact experiment has been done but is not cited (Fant et al., 2009: &quot;Nuclei of non-muscle cells bind centrosome proteins upon fusion with differentiating myoblasts&quot;) Similarly, although less directly relevant, dominance was tested between a mitotic centrosome MTOC and a membrane ncMTOC (Yang and Feldman, 2015, also not cited).</p><p>– Line 49: PCM needs to be defined as material that is specific to the centrosome. PCM proteins might localize to other locations, but 'pericentriolar' refers to the material surrounding centrioles.</p><p>– The authors interchange usage of expression and localization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Becker et al. focusses on the regulation of non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs), specifically MTOC activity at the surface of the nucleus. The authors show that during muscle development, the MTOC activity transitions from the centrosome to the nucleus, and that this transition depends on the transcriptional activation of AKAP6 by myogenin, a TF that drives muscle differentiation. While it seems that several results can be found in the literature (such as the transition to nuclear ncMTOCs, Myogenin binding to AKAP6 promoter, AKAP6 binding to Nesprin), the authors assemble them together well in a single manuscript to better link muscle differentiation to ncMTOC formation. Overall I found the study very interesting and most of the conclusions/model supported by the data, although we seem to disagree on direct vs indirect links with APAP6. Here are my comments and suggestions.</p><p>A) Figure 1 is critical for setting up the order of events during differentiation. While the final conclusion of this section is correct, following the data in this section was extremely difficult. I had to read this section 4 times as I knew the data was in there somewhere, I just had to find it. I recommend replacing C and E with 4 graphs that show: 1) the % of the MyoD+ nuclei that are positive for PCM1, Myog, nesprin; 2) the % of PCM1+ nuclei that are positive for Myog, MoyD, nesprin; 3) the % of Myog+ nuclei that are positive for PCM1, MyoD, nesprin; 4) the % of nesprin+ nuclei that are positive for PCM1, MyoD, Myog. Then the description in the text should match these graphs.</p><p>B) Related to the use of PCM-1 as the main PCM marker and an indicator of MTOC activity. I always thought of PCM-1 as a centrosome satellite component, which has little direct function on centrosome MTOC activity. In fact, in the original paper describing PCM-1 (Balczon et al. 1994) it is shown to leave centrosomes in the lead up to, and throughout mitosis, when the centrosome is at its highest MTOC activity. PCM-1's role in ncMTOC activity might be better understood, but ultimately γ-tubulin (g-tub) must be recruited to the site of nucleation. Thus, it would be nice to see g-tub and MTs in several experiments such as 1D, 2A-F, 3E, 4F.</p><p>C) The model presented is that myognin binds AKAP6 promoter, increases expression, which drives AKAP6 binding to nesprin and triggers downstream PCM recruitment to the nuclear surface. While the order of events is nicely shown, a direct link upstream and downstream of AKAP6 is not. Many additional experiments must be performed to claim a direct role as shown in Figure 7. For example: mutating AKAP6 promoter, bypassing myog by overexpressing AKPA6, showing nuclear MTOCs when nesprin and AKAP6 are coexpressed in fibroblasts, bypassing nesprin by artificially tethering AKAP6 to nuclear envelope, mapping AKAP6 binding to PCM proteins and mutating that interaction site, and so on. If the reviewers and editor(s) feel this is beyond the scope of the manuscript, I suggest that the authors explicitly state, and show in the model, that indirect paths are possible/likely.</p><p>D) It is not clear, given the similarity in steady state MTs between control and si-AKAP6, why nuclear positioning is different. The manuscript would be strengthened if it ended with the role of ncMTOCs in nuclear spacing instead of the current figure 6, which I think is not necessary and should be removed. Can the authors follow MT nucleation and nuclear positioning during the development of myotubes in control and si-AKAP6? Are the MTs more dynamic or more stable with or without nuclear MTOCs? What are the difference between myotubes with aligned nuclei and overlapping nuclei in the si-AKAP6 populations? Are the ones that end up overlapping start out too close to one another and therefore require ncMTOC activity to push the nuclei apart? Can the authors provide any further insight here?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Myogenin controls via AKAP6 non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center formation at the nuclear envelope&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Assembly of the non-centrosomal MTOC is still poorly understood, but is important for the distribution of nuclei in multi-nucleated myotubes, which in turn is linked to muscle function and disease. The authors show that the transcription factor myogenin drives this process and that AKAP6beta and nesprin-1alpha are crucial transcriptional targets.

What is the role of the nuclear envelope MTOC? How does it affect nuclei positioning, why is this important?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Here, Becker et al. set out to identify the factors that control MTOC formation at the nuclear envelope of skeletal muscle cells. The nuclear envelope has long been appreciate for its ability to grow and localize microtubules, however the mechanisms that induce this state and simultaneously inactivate the centrosome as an MTOC have remained elusive. The authors identify the transcription factor myogenin as both necessary and sufficient to induce MTOC formation at the nuclear envelope. By mining the literature and ChipSeq and RNAseq data, they identify Nespin and AKAP6 as downstream targets of myogenin, that together are sufficient to induce a nuclear envelope MTOC in fibroblasts, a cell type that normally maintains microtubules at the centrosome and Golgi. Furthermore, myogenin is required to specifically induce cell-type specific isoforms, of these proteins. Loss of AKAP6 and results perturbs the recruitment of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope and leads to nuclear positioning defects in myotubes. Together, these data establish a module within the differentiation program of muscle cells for establishing the nuclear envelope as an MTOC. This is a resubmission of a former manuscript and in general, the authors have greatly expanded the work and added significant mechanistic insight.</p><p>1) I am left a bit confused about what the authors think are the relative contributions of myoD versus myogenin. It seems that the authors are setting up a linear pathway where MyoD induces expression of myogenin which in turn induces ncMTOC formation, especially since it is known that myoD activates myogenin transcription (Berkes et al., 2005). If this is indeed the pathway the authors are testing, they should explicitly state that at the beginning of this section rather than at the end. Additionally, appropriate experiments should be conducted, i.e. is myoD expression affected in the absence of myogenin?; does myoD expression also induce nesprin and AKAP6 expression?</p><p>2) The switch in MTOC function from the centrosome to non-centrosomal sites in differentiated cell is a general and interesting phenomenon. The authors propose that centrosome inactivation must be due to the expression of factors that remove microtubule organizing capacity from the centrosome. Alternatively, the nuclear envelope MTOC activity could outcompete the centrosome, stealing their shared components. Given that the authors have numerous cases where the nuclear envelope MTOC is perturbed, can they comment on whether the centrosome remains active? For example, what appears to be the centrosomal pool of PCM-1 remains prominent upon myogenin KD. Is this the case? Similarly, in the SYNE1 or AKAP6 knock down, what is the state of the centrosome?</p><p>3) Regrowth experiments need a zero timepoint to be able to assess how well microtubules were removed upon depolymerization treatments. As presented, these experiments are hard to interpret. While it is unquestionable that microtubules are associated with the nuclear envelope in these cases, it is important to distinguish whether these are new microtubules or persistent anchored, stabilized ones.</p><p>4) Does nesprin directly bind to AKAP6? The authors indicate that the interaction is direct.</p><p>5) Figure 7G is very nice, but it would be much nicer to see that microtubules also grow from the nuclear envelope in this case in addition to the fact that PCM-1 is recruited.</p><p>6) I do not think the problem and players are set up well enough for the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. The introduction and/or discussion could be more extensive. For example, there is no discussion of why recruitment of these particular centrosomal proteins to the nuclear envelope would be important to generate microtubules. I also think it is important to explain what &quot;centrosomal proteins&quot; are as they clearly do not stay at the centrosome and instead shuttle to the nuclear envelope. Perhaps the authors could use &quot;MTOC proteins&quot; or something similar.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Becker et al. is a new submission of previously <italic>eLife</italic> submission that focusses on the transition from centrosomal MTOCs to non-centrosomal MTOCs, specifically the surface of the nucleus. This submission more clearly focuses on triggering ncMTOC transition in developing skeletal muscles via the function of MyoD and Myogenin, members of the transcription factors family termed myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). The final model shown in Figure 8 is well supported by the presented data, which I believe is much improved over the previous manuscript. Reading the recently published work from the same group (Vergarajauregui 2020), which appears to have been in review at the same time as the original submission of this manuscript, helped clarify some of the interaction and functional claims downstream of AKAP6. The authors have done a great job addressing all my previous concerns, they should be commended for this and my comments below are mostly small changes that do not move the goal line for the authors.</p><p>1) In several cases in the beginning of the manuscript (ex. First paragraph pf the results) it was not clear that ncMTOC specifically referred to nuclear envelope MTOCs. I would recommend explicitly stating in this first result section that throughout the manuscript, ncMTOCs refers to the nuclear envelope in this study. Alternatively, maybe the authors can use NE-MTOC to distinguish it from other ncMTOCs.</p><p>2) On line ~181 the authors state that &quot;both MRFs are sufficient individually to induce a switch from centrosomal MTOC to a nuclear envelope MTOC.&quot; At this point in the manuscript the authors had not yet shown the elimination of centrosomes, that comes in figure 3. I suggest removing a reference to a switch at this point.</p><p>3) In several location in the manuscript the author state that myogenin is required to recruit centrosomal proteins. This can be found in lines 193 and 570 and other places. It is more accurate to say that myogenin is require for the localization of centrosome proteins to the nuclear envelope. Recruitment implies myogenin is the recruiting protein, which it is not, it is simply upstream in the ncMTOC formation pathway.</p><p>4) The figures overall are much improved and the quantification is suitable. However, It is important to report the Ns in each of the experiments. For example in figure 3, how many nuclei were measured? How many experimental repeats were performed.</p><p>5) Presentation of the analysis leading up to AKAP6 was great</p><p>6) How reliable is the specificity of the E-Box PCR amplification? Have the authors confirmed specificity of the ChIP experiment by PCR amplifying other regions of the AKAP and nesprin promotors? Although, it does appear to be specific enough to distinguish the different isoforms.</p><p>7) Direct protein interaction cannot be determined by IPs. The authors should change the conclusion that &quot;AKAP6 localizes to the nuclear envelope in differentiated skeletal muscle cells via interaction with nesprin-1α&quot; to AKAP6 localization depends on nesprin-1a. An interaction can only be determine using purified proteins or Y2H as the authors did with AKAP6 and PACT in the (Vergarajauregui 2020). If there is direct protein interaction data, the authors should present it, otherwise the current results should be presented in terms of being upstream or downstream.</p><p>Another example of this is &quot;AKAP6 is required for the localization of centrosomal proteins to the nuclear envelope, in part by interacting with PCM-1.&quot; If there is no direct protein interaction data available (here or in the literature), then the word interacting should be replaced by recruiting.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Myogenin controls via AKAP6 non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center formation at the nuclear envelope&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

What does it interact with, what other centrosome proteins are involved? How is its localization regulated to allow for the timely activation of the nucleus as an MTOC? Is AKAP6 sufficient to induce MTOC function? Considering these and other issues raised by all three reviewers, we feel that the manuscript does not reach the level of insight and impact that we seek for eLife at this stage.

We illuminate the upstream regulation of ncMTOC formation, showing that a single transcription factor can induce the attenuation of the centrosomal MTOC and formation of the ncMTOC at the nuclear envelope. We further give mechanistic insight into how AKAP6 functions as a critical adaptor between nesprin-1 and centrosomal proteins to create a ncMTOC and to localize the Golgi in close vicinity to the nuclear envelope. Furthermore, both manuscripts show the functional significance of AKAP6 for microtubule- or Golgi-dependent processes in skeletal muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, and osteoclasts.

For pericentrin and AKAP9 in C2C12 we have manually distinguished between partially and fully positive nuclei, as an automated analysis was not possible due to high cell density required for C2C12 differentiation. However, an automated analysis was performed for ectopic myogenin expression experiments in NIH3T3 cells, which could be grown at lower density. In this case nuclear envelope coverage by centrosomal proteins was quantified to account for the temporal aspect of recruitment (Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to point 1: after myogenin expression, is the centrosomal MTOC inactivated first, after, or simultaneously with the appearance of the nuclear envelope MTOC?</p></disp-quote><p>Our new data provided in Figure 2 and 3 indicate that attenuation of the centrosomal MTOC and activation of the ncMTOC occur simultaneously. In order to clarify this issue, we created a cell line with tetracyclineinducible myogenin, which yields a high number of cells that form an ncMTOC and therefore allows reliable quantification. We quantified ncMTOC formation (Figure 2) and centrosome attenuation (Figure 3) upon myogenin expression. Furthermore, microtubule regrowth experiments showed that, while centrosomes are attenuated, microtubules still regrow from centrioles alongside growth from the nuclear envelope (Figure 3 F).

However, this recruitment was inefficient.</p><p>To address the raised issue, we ectopically expressed nesprin-1 and AKAP6 in undifferentiated C2C12 myoblast and observed that nesprin-1 and AKAP6 are sufficient to recruit endogenous PCM-1 to the nuclear envelope. A more detailed study of AKAP6 domains and mutants is part of our recently accepted manuscript. The focus of the present manuscript was the upstream regulation of ncMTOC induction, where we show that myogenin preferentially activates the promoters of nesprin-1 and AKAP6 which in turn recruit centrosomal proteins and enable microtubule nucleation from the nuclear envelope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Microtubule organization varies by cell type and function. Dividing cells, cancer cells, and some specialized cell types such as fibroblasts use centrosomes as microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), but most differentiated cells employ non-centrosomal MTOCs (ncMTOCs) to obtain more complicated microtubule patterns during the process of differentiation. Despite decades worth of work on the centrosome, comparatively little is known about ncMTOC composition or how the cell regulates the switch in MTOC function from the centrosome to non-centrosomal sites during differentiation. Here Becker et al., use differentiated muscle cells as a model to understand how the well-defined nuclear ncMTOC, which is a hallmark of skeletal muscle, is established. Previous studies found that PCM proteins such as AKAP450, Pericentrin, and PCM1 localize to the nuclear envelope of muscle cells, that Nesprin1a recruits these proteins, and that Nesprin and AKA450 are required for microtubule nucleation at this site. Here Becker et al., appear to uncouple the expression of Nesprin and PCM; Nesprin and PCM1 are both expressed in cells positive for expression of the transcription factor MyoD, but Nesprin expression precedes expression of the transcription factor myogenin, and PCM1 but not Nesprin expression is controlled by myogenin. These results suggested that activation of MTOC function at the nucleus is downstream of Nesprin localizing there and requires expression of myogenin targets. Consistently, myogenin expression in naïve cells is sufficient to induce nuclear MTOC activation. By mining ChIP-seq, RNAseq and microarray data, the authors identify AKAP6 as this potential target, finding that AKAP6 localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the nucleus, fails to localize to the nucleus in SYNE1/Nesprin mutant patient derived myoblasts, and is required to localize PCM1, AKAP450, and Pericentrin to the nuclear envelope. AKAP6 also is required for microtubule regrowth from the nucleus of myotubes and for nuclear positioning in these cells, a MT controlled process. Finally, the authors find that fusion of a Myogenin induce muscle cell can convert a nive NIH3T# cells with a centrosome MTOC to a nuclear MTOC state. While I love a cell fusion experiment, this result is not surprising given that fusion of a myoblast to a U2OS cell can similar convert the non-muscle cell from a centrosome to a nuclear MTOC (Fant et al., 2009, not cited).</p><p>The experiments appear well preformed and presented. However, although these studies appear to identify a novel ncMTOC factor at the nucleus of muscle cells, they do little in the way of uncovering mechanistic aspects of how AKAP6 functions there or on assembly of the nuclear ncMTOC in these cells. Is AKAP6 merely a bridge between Nesprin and AKAP450? How is its localization regulated to allow for the timely activation of the nucleus as an MTOC? Is AKAP6 sufficient to induce MTOC function? In the absence of more mechanistic insight on the role of AKAP6, I am not sure that this paper will be of broad enough interest for the readership of eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback. Please note, that mechanistic details on the role of AKAP6 at the ncMTOC has been elucidated in the companion paper, which has just been published.

The authors show that during muscle development, the MTOC activity transitions from the centrosome to the nucleus, and that this transition depends on the transcriptional activation of AKAP6 by myogenin, a TF that drives muscle differentiation. While it seems that several results can be found in the literature (such as the transition to nuclear ncMTOCs, Myogenin binding to AKAP6 promoter, AKAP6 binding to Nesprin), the authors assemble them together well in a single manuscript to better link muscle differentiation to ncMTOC formation. Overall I found the study very interesting and most of the conclusions/model supported by the data, although we seem to disagree on direct vs indirect links with APAP6. Here are my comments and suggestions.</p><p>A) Figure 1 is critical for setting up the order of events during differentiation. While the final conclusion of this section is correct, following the data in this section was extremely difficult. I had to read this section 4 times as I knew the data was in there somewhere, I just had to find it. I recommend replacing C and E with 4 graphs that show: 1) the % of the MyoD+ nuclei that are positive for PCM1, Myog, nesprin; 2) the % of PCM1+ nuclei that are positive for Myog, MoyD, nesprin; 3) the % of Myog+ nuclei that are positive for PCM1, MyoD, nesprin; 4) the % of nesprin+ nuclei that are positive for PCM1, MyoD, Myog. Then the description in the text should match these graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed Figure 1 and the corresponding section in the manuscript to clarify this issue. While we did not include all four suggested graphs, the new Figure 1 shows the percentage of C2C12 nuclei positive for MyoD, myogenin, nesprin-1, and PCM-1. In addition, the percentage of nesprin1-positive nuclei that are positive for MyoD and myogenin is shown and the text has been changed to clarify that always 100% of PCM-1-positive nuclei were postivie for MyoD, myogenin, and nesprin-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Related to the use of PCM-1 as the main PCM marker and an indicator of MTOC activity. I always thought of PCM-1 as a centrosome satellite component, which has little direct function on centrosome MTOC activity. In fact, in the original paper describing PCM-1 (Balczon et al. 1994) it is shown to leave centrosomes in the lead up to, and throughout mitosis, when the centrosome is at its highest MTOC activity. PCM-1's role in ncMTOC activity might be better understood, but ultimately γ-tubulin (g-tub) must be recruited to the site of nucleation. Thus, it would be nice to see g-tub and MTs in several experiments such as 1D, 2A-F, 3E, 4F.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in the point that the amount of PCM-1 at the centrosome also changes during the normal cell cycle. The analysis of PCM-1 was chosen, as it is an integral part of centriolar satellites that play an important role in the transport of centrosomal proteins and centrosome assembly (Prosser and Pelletier, 2020 J Cell Sci). For example, it has been shown that PCM-1 depletion impairs recruitment of ninein and Pcnt to the centrosome and disturbs microtubule organization (Dammermann and Merdes, 2002 J Cell Biol).</p><p>To address this issue, we included the information regarding PCM-1 in the text and expanded our analysis by analyzing microtubule regrowth as well as the centrosomal proteins pericentrin and AKAP9, the latter of which has been shown to be essential for microtubule nucleation in muscle cells (Espigat-Georger et al., 2016 J Cell Sci; Gimpel et al. 2017 Curr Biol).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) The model presented is that myognin binds AKAP6 promoter, increases expression, which drives AKAP6 binding to nesprin and triggers downstream PCM recruitment to the nuclear surface. While the order of events is nicely shown, a direct link upstream and downstream of AKAP6 is not. Many additional experiments must be performed to claim a direct role as shown in Figure 7. For example: mutating AKAP6 promoter/</p></disp-quote><p>Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays we added data to show that myogenin preferentially binds and activates the promoter of the muscle-specific -isoform of AKAP6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Bypassing myog by overexpressing AKPA6, showing nuclear MTOCs when nesprin and AKAP6 are coexpressed in fibroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the raised issue, we ectopically expressed nesprin-1 and AKAP6 in undifferentiated C2C12 myoblast and observed that nesprin-1 and AKAP6 are sufficient to recruit endogenous PCM-1 to the nuclear envelope. Additionally, we show that PCM-1 co-immunoprecipiates with AKAP6. Together with the finding that depletion of AKAP6 results in a loss of centrosomal proteins from the nuclear envelope while nesprin-1 remains unaffected, this indicates that AKAP6 acts as an adapter between the nuclear envelope anchor nesprin-1 and centrosomal proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Bypassing nesprin by artificially tethering AKAP6 to nuclear envelope, mapping AKAP6 binding to PCM proteins and mutating that interaction site, and so on.</p></disp-quote><p>This issues are beyond the scope of this manuscript and have been addressed in the published companion manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the reviewers and editor(s) feel this is beyond the scope of the manuscript, I suggest that the authors explicitly state, and show in the model, that indirect paths are possible/likely.</p></disp-quote><p>We adjusted Figure 8 (former Figure 7) to fit our new findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) It is not clear, given the similarity in steady state MTs between control and si-AKAP6, why nuclear positioning is different. The manuscript would be strengthened if it ended with the role of ncMTOCs in nuclear spacing instead of the current figure 6, which I think is not necessary and should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we removed the former Figure 6.</p><p>The focus of the manuscript is the initiation of ncMTOC. Therefore, the manuscript end now on demonstrating that myogenin binds and activates the promoters of AKAP6 and nesprin-1a and that overexpresiion of AKAP6 and nesprin-1a is sufficient to induce the recruitment of endogenous centrosomal proteins to the nuclear envelope. Nuclear positioning was mainly utilized to validate the importance of AKAP6 for ncMTOC function. In order to address the raised questions regarding nuclear positioning, live cell imaging needs to be established which is beyond the scope of this study. Yet, we have added several data to provide further insides into the role of AKAP6 in nuclear positioning (see answers below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors follow MT nucleation and nuclear positioning during the development of myotubes in control and si-AKAP6?</p></disp-quote><p>To understand the role of AKAP6 in nuclear positioning, we have depleted AKAP6 in myotubes and performed microtubule regrowth assay. Our data show, that AKAP6 depletion abolished microtubule growth from the nuclear envelope and resulted consequently in defects in nuclear positioning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the MTs more dynamic or more stable with or without nuclear MTOCs?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue we have assessed the intensity of detyronisated microtubules a marker for stable microtubules. Our data reveal that AKAP depletion resulted in a reduction of detyronisated microtubules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the difference between myotubes with aligned nuclei and overlapping nuclei in the si-AKAP6 populations? Are the ones that end up overlapping start out too close to one another and therefore require ncMTOC activity to push the nuclei apart? Can the authors provide any further insight here?</p></disp-quote><p>Early nucleus positioning in myotubes after fusion can be divided in two sub-processes. First, nuclei that cluster in the center of the newly formed myotube are pushed apart to spread along the length of the myotube.</p><p>This process is dependent on AKAP9-mediated microtubule nucleation (Gimpel et al., 2017 Curr Biol). Second, nuclei are aligned on the long axis of the cell. This process is mediated by microtubule-associated motors that are at least in part recruited to the nuclear envelope via PCM1 (Espigat-Georger et al., 2016 J Cell Sci). AKAP6 is potentially required for both processes by recruiting AKAP9 as well as PCM1 to the nuclear envelope. We quantified defects in nuclei spreading (i.e. overlapping nuclei) and nuclei alignment separately to assess the effect of AKAP6 depletion on each process.</p><p>To clarify this issue, we included a more detailed description in the text and a model of how AKAP6 depletion affects nuclear positioning in Figure 6. In addition, we confirmed that AKAP6 depletion impaired nuclear envelope localization of the dynein activator p150glued to the nuclear envelope in myotubes.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should clarify the relative regulation of MTOC activities. Centrosome inactivation may be due to factors that remove microtubule organizing capacity. Alternatively, the nuclear envelope MTOC could outcompete the centrosome by recruiting MTOC components. In cases where the nuclear envelope MTOC is perturbed, does the centrosome remain active?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for raising this important point. As detailed below, we have performed the suggested experiments to clarify the regulation of MTOC activity at the nuclear envelope and the centrosome and added a paragraph to the discussion (starting at line 553).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does the centrosomal pool of PCM-1 remain prominent upon myogenin knockdown?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we have analyzed PCM-1 staining patterns in myogenin-depleted differentiating C2C12. The results are now described in lines 146-155 and representative images are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Importantly, in myogenin-depleted cultures, PCM-1 remains localized in a centrosomal pattern in cells with highly nesprin-1-positive nuclei. This suggests that endogenous myogenin contributes to the attenuation of the centrosome during NE-MTOC formation, which is in agreement with the observation that ectopic myogenin expression in fibroblast is sufficient to attenuate the centrosome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After SYNE1 or AKAP6 knockdown, what is the state of the centrosome?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to clarify whether myogenin induces loss of MTOC proteins from the centrosome by establishing an NE-MTOC that outcompetes the centrosome or induces separate factors to attenuate the centrosome, we have depleted nesprin-1 or Akap6 in MYOG-mScarlet cells and analyzed pericentrin as well as γ-tubulin intensities at the centrosome. The analysis is now described in lines 393-399 and shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2, revealing that levels of MTOC proteins at the centrosome are still reduced upon MYOG expression in nesprin-1- or AKAP6-depleted cells, meaning disturbing of the NE-MTOC does not prevent centrosome attenuation. These results indicate that competition between centrosome and NE-MTOC is not the mechanism underlying the attenuation of the centrosome during NE-MTOC formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since they are at the core of the regulation mechanism, the IP/CHIP experiments need extra controls. The authors should probe for a protein that is not specifically retained by the precipitating antibody.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what experiment the reviewer suggests. We assume that the reviewer would like additional controls regarding the specificity of the anti-myogenin antibody or other data that substantiate our conclusion that myogenin binds to the promoter regions of <italic>Syne1</italic> or <italic>Akap6</italic>. To address this issue, we have included an intronic region of <italic>Syne1</italic> or <italic>Akap6</italic> as negative control as well as a promoter region of <italic>Desmin</italic> as positive control for the specificity of the myogenin antibody in the ChIP experiments. Additionally, we have probed lysates of Tet-ON mScarlet cells as well as non-induced Tet-ON MYOG-mScarlet cells. The results of these new experiments, presented in Figure 2 – supplemental figure 2 and Figure 4 – supplemental figure 1 and described in lines 242-251 and lines 345-349, further show that myogenin binds the promoter regions of <italic>Syne1</italic> and <italic>Akap6</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What are the relative contributions of myoD versus myogenin in the regulation of MTOC assembly at the nuclear envelope? Experiments should be conducted to address: is myoD expression affected in the absence of myogenin?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this point, we have analyzed MyoD expression in myogenin-depleted C2C12 cells using RT-PCR and found that myogenin depletion does not affect <italic>Myod</italic> RNA levels. As positive control, we show that depletion of MyoD also reduces myogenin levels, which is consistent with literature as well as our findings that MyoD induces myogenin expression in fibroblasts. These results have been added as panel C to Figure 2 – supplemental figure 1 and described in lines 196-202.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does myoD expression also induce nesprin and AKAP6?</p></disp-quote><p>Analysis of MyoD-GFP-transfected NIH3T3 fibroblasts by immunostaining revealed that nesprin-1α and AKAP6 expression is induced (Figure 5 – supplemental figure 3). This is in accordance with our previous finding that overexpression of MyoD in this cell line induces myogenin expression as well as PCM-1 recruitment to the nuclear envelope (Figure 2 – supplemental figure 1). In order to address the relevance of myogenin in this system, we have repeated the experiments in the presence of siRNA targeting myogenin. Our results show that MyoD can induce AKAP6 expression via myogenin (see lines 409-422).</p><p>In addition to adding new data to the manuscript, we have included a paragraph in the Discussion regarding the relative contributions of MyoD versus myogenin in the regulation of MTOC assembly at the nuclear envelope (lines 544-552). Furthermore, we adapted the model in Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please provide a zero time point in regrowth experiments and check nucleation activity in the experiment in Figure 7G. This is needed to argue that an MTOC is present.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note, we did not claim that an MTOC is present in Figure 7G but that nesprin-1α and AKAP6β are sufficient to recruit endogenous PCM-1 in the absence of myogenin. However, based on this question, we have now performed regrowth assays in myogenin-negative C2C12 cells after nesprin-1α and AKAP6β co-expression. Our results indicate that there is no significant NE-MTOC activity induced in this setting, whereas MTOC activity was observed at centrosomes. This is in agreement with the fact that myogenin appears to induce centrosome attenuation independent of the presence of nesprin-1α and AKAP6β at the nuclear envelope (see Point 1). The new data are shown in Figure 7 – supplement 1 and described in the text starting at line 497. For regrowth experiments, we have added “zero time points” in Figure 2 – supplemental figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The introduction and discussion should be improved by discussing:</p><p>– The relevance of the presented findings for muscle function and disease.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added information in regards to the relevance of the NE-MTOC and our data in muscle function and disease to the Introduction (lines 68-77) and Discussion (lines 580-596).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The roles of the particular centrosomal proteins that are recruited to the nuclear envelope in generating and organizing microtubules.</p></disp-quote><p>Information regarding the roles of the different MTOC proteins has been added to the Introduction (lines 104-117).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The term &quot;centrosomal proteins&quot;.

This submission more clearly focuses on triggering ncMTOC transition in developing skeletal muscles via the function of MyoD and Myogenin, members of the transcription factors family termed myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). The final model shown in Figure 8 is well supported by the presented data, which I believe is much improved over the previous manuscript. Reading the recently published work from the same group (Vergarajauregui 2020), which appears to have been in review at the same time as the original submission of this manuscript, helped clarify some of the interaction and functional claims downstream of AKAP6. The authors have done a great job addressing all my previous concerns, they should be commended for this and my comments below are mostly small changes that do not move the goal line for the authors.</p><p>1) In several cases in the beginning of the manuscript (ex. First paragraph pf the results) it was not clear that ncMTOC specifically referred to nuclear envelope MTOCs. I would recommend explicitly stating in this first result section that throughout the manuscript, ncMTOCs refers to the nuclear envelope in this study. Alternatively, maybe the authors can use NE-MTOC to distinguish it from other ncMTOCs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this recommendation. We have replaced as suggested “ncMTOC” with “NE-MTOC” in the manuscript where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) On line ~181 the authors state that &quot;both MRFs are sufficient individually to induce a switch from centrosomal MTOC to a nuclear envelope MTOC.&quot; At this point in the manuscript the authors had not yet shown the elimination of centrosomes, that comes in figure 3. I suggest removing a reference to a switch at this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The text has been changed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In several location in the manuscript the author state that myogenin is required to recruit centrosomal proteins. This can be found in lines 193 and 570 and other places. It is more accurate to say that myogenin is require for the localization of centrosome proteins to the nuclear envelope. Recruitment implies myogenin is the recruiting protein, which it is not, it is simply upstream in the ncMTOC formation pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. The text has been changed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The figures overall are much improved and the quantification is suitable.

How many experimental repeats were performed.</p></disp-quote><p>The requested information has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Presentation of the analysis leading up to AKAP6 was great</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How reliable is the specificity of the E-Box PCR amplification? Have the authors confirmed specificity of the ChIP experiment by PCR amplifying other regions of the AKAP and nesprin promotors? Although, it does appear to be specific enough to distinguish the different isoforms.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess the specificity of the ChIP experiments, we have performed additional experiments. For details, see response to essential revisions, point 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Direct protein interaction cannot be determined by IPs. The authors should change the conclusion that &quot;AKAP6 localizes to the nuclear envelope in differentiated skeletal muscle cells via interaction with nesprin-1α&quot; to AKAP6 localization depends on nesprin-1a. An interaction can only be determine using purified proteins or Y2H as the authors did with AKAP6 and PACT in the (Vergarajauregui 2020). If there is direct protein interaction data, the authors should present it, otherwise the current results should be presented in terms of being upstream or downstream.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have changed the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another example of this is &quot;AKAP6 is required for the localization of centrosomal proteins to the nuclear envelope, in part by interacting with PCM-1.&quot; If there is no direct protein interaction data available (here or in the literature), then the word interacting should be replaced by recruiting.</p></disp-quote><p>The text has been modified accordingly.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>The paper is very much improved and you have addressed all the remaining points raised by the reviewers.

In my opinion this finding is very important and deserves a discussion. It suggests that myogenin induces another factor that is crucial for MTOC activity. While you correctly state &quot;recruitment of MTOC proteins&quot; rather than &quot;MTOC formation&quot; in the paper, non-expert readers may assume that this is synonymous. Without clarification/discussion this could be misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a paragraph to the Discussion to clarify the results of the AKAP6β/nesprin‑1α co-expression experiment (lines 586-597).</p></body></sub-article></article>
