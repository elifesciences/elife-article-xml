Although they are important especially, in pathological conditions (e.g. cancers, neurodegenerative diseases), their precise composition and their regulation were still poorly described. Here, using a biochemical approach allowing to separate TNTs from cell bodies and from extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs), we obtained the full composition of TNTs compared to EVPs. We then focused on two major components of our proteomic data, the CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins, and further investigated their specific roles in TNT formation and function. We show that these two tetraspanins have distinct non-redundant functions: CD9 participates in stabilizing TNTs, whereas CD81 expression is required to allow the functional transfer of vesicles in the newly formed TNTs, possibly by regulating docking to or fusion with the opposing cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tunneling nanotubes</kwd><kwd>tetraspanins</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PLBIO18-103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zurzolo</surname><given-names>Chiara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM EQU202103012692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zurzolo</surname><given-names>Chiara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE13-0032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zurzolo</surname><given-names>Chiara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-21-CE35-0007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matondo</surname><given-names>Mariette</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003750</institution-id><institution>Association France Alzheimer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AAP PFA 2021 #6156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zurzolo</surname><given-names>Chiara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteomic analysis of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) identifies CD9 and CD81 as major positive regulators of TNT formation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are thin membranous conduits, supported by F-actin that form continuous cytoplasmic bridges between cells over distances ranging from several hundred nm up to 100 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sartori-Rupp et al., 2019</xref>).

In addition to cell cultures and tumor explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>), TNT-like connections have been shown to exist in the retina and facilitate cellular material transfer between photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kalargyrou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ortin-Martinez et al., 2021</xref>) or pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alarcon-Martinez et al., 2020</xref>), highlighting the importance of understanding the biology of these protrusions in order to unravel their possible role(s) in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Victoria and Zurzolo, 2017</xref>). TNT formation is highly dynamic and appears to be regulated by cellular stresses and actin regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ljubojevic et al., 2021</xref>). Two models have been proposed for TNT formation. In the first, TNTs would be produced by membrane deformation and elongation of the protrusion supported by actin polymerization followed by adhesion and fusion of this protrusion with the opposing cell. Alternatively, TNTs could be formed by cell dislodgement where adhesion and membrane fusion would be the first steps before cell body separation and elongation of the protrusion by actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ljubojevic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abounit and Zurzolo, 2012</xref>). However, TNTs have been shown to be structurally more complex, being made up of bundles of fine open connections (called iTNTs) held together by partially identified proteins, including N-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sartori-Rupp et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanism(s) and specific pathways governing iTNT/TNT formation as well as the molecular components of TNTs are still not known.</p><p>In addition to TNTs, one of the major pathways used by cells to transfer materials over long distances is through membrane-surrounded vesicles, collectively known as extracellular vesicles (EVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mathieu et al., 2021</xref>). EVs are released by all cells, and up taken by distant recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charreau, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van Niel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wolfers et al., 2001</xref>). They can be formed either by direct budding from the plasma membrane, or by secretion of intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular compartments (in which case they are called exosomes). Because of their common functions, their similar diameters, and because TNTs are fragile and easily broken and therefore can be released in cell culture supernatants (where EVs are also found), it has been challenging to distinguish TNTs from EVs in terms of composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gousset et al., 2019</xref>). In this regard, two members of the tetraspanin family, CD9 and CD81, which are well-known and widely used markers for EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Théry et al., 2018</xref>), have been detected in TNTs in T cells when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lachambre et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Tetraspanin forms a family (with 33 members in mammals) of small four membrane-spanning domain proteins with two extracellular domains, including a large one harboring a tetraspanin-specific folding and two short cytoplasmic tails. Tetraspanins are involved in various cellular processes like migration, adhesion, signaling, pathogen infection, membrane damage reparation, membrane protrusive activity, and cell-cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Charrin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hemler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Their function is linked at least in part to their ability to interact with other transmembrane proteins, forming a dynamic network or molecular interactions referred to as the tetraspanin web or Tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yáñez-Mó et al., 2009</xref>). Inside this ‘web,’ the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 directly interact with the Ig domain proteins CD9P1 (aka EWI-F, encoded by the PTGFRN gene) and EWI-2 (encoded by the IGSF8 gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stipp et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stipp et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charrin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charrin et al., 2003</xref>), which have an impact on several fusion processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charrin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Whitaker et al., 2019</xref>). Whether CD9 and CD81 are also endogenously present in TNTs from non-T lymphoid cells, and whether they play a role in the formation or function of TNTs has not been investigated.</p><p>With the goal of identifying structural components of TNTs, and possibly specific markers and regulators of these structures, we established a protocol of TNT isolation from U2OS cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pontén and Saksela, 1967</xref>), allowing to separate TNTs from extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) and from cell bodies. We obtained the full protein composition of TNTs, compared to EVPs. As CD9 and CD81 were major components of TNTs, we further studied their specific roles in TNT formation and ability to transfer cellular material using human neuronal SH-SY5Y, a well-known cell model to study functional TNTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sartori-Rupp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2023</xref>). Our data indicate that CD9 and CD81 have different and complementary functions by possibly regulating two different steps of the formation of TNTs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purification of TNTs and EVPs</title><p>In order to isolate nanotubes and similar structures (generically referred to hereafter as TNTs), we took advantage of the fact that TNTs are very sensitive to mechanical stress as they are not attached to the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pontes et al., 2008</xref>).

Cells were first plated and cultured in serum-free medium to facilitate the purification steps; next after removal of the cell medium and replacement by a small volume of PBS, the flasks were vigorously shaken to break the TNTs that were then isolated from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation after elimination of floating cells by low-speed centrifugations and filtration (see workflow on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When necessary, EVPs were directly collected from the first cell culture supernatant and enriched following a standardized procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Théry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cocozza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Théry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alvarez et al., 2012</xref> and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Observation of the obtained particles using transmission electronic microscopy revealed that they were morphologically different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). EVPs appeared mostly circular with a mean diameter of 60 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), whereas TNTs (or TNT fragments) were mostly cylindrical, with a mean diameter of 69 nm and length varying from 140 to 900 nm (mean length 372 nm). These results were in accordance with the expected sizes of EVPs, and with the different nature of the materials of each fraction. To further validate that our protocol for preparing TNTs vs. EVPs was accurate, we sought to engineer cells with fluorescent TNT markers.

We confirmed that the crude preparations (before ultracentrifugation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) contained particles and measured their size and their fluorescence using Nano flow-cytometry. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>, both EVPs and TNTs contained particles of similar mean diameter (around 60 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), ranging from 40 to more than 100 nm, in perfect accordance with TEM results. The sizes and concentrations of EVPs and TNTs were the same in parental and transfected cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Both fractions contained particles bearing GFP-CD9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), confirming the presence of membrane-enclosed particles. A major difference between the two fractions was the large proportion of particles in the TNT preparation (38%) that bore the actin chromobody-GFP which was barely detected in EVPs (0.2%). Finally, H2B-GFP was present in a very minor part of the particles, and the Golgi marker GM130 was detected neither in EVPs nor in TNTs by western-blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), showing that contaminations with cell debris or nuclei were limited, thus validating our protocol. CD9 and CD63 were detected in both TNT and EVP preparations, whereas tubulin (shown to label a fraction of TNTs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) was only detected in TNT fraction. The classical marker of EVPs Alix was mainly detected in the EVP fraction, and the ER protein calnexin was detected in neither fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We checked that shaking the cells did not affect their shape and plate attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>, 2 left pictures). In contrast, it decreased the percentage of connections between cells, identified after mild trypsinization and phase image analysis of fixed cells (right pictures and graph of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) cultured in serum-free medium. To verify that culture of the cells in the serum-free medium had no consequence on the nature of the TNTs, we compared the number of connection-forming cells in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), as well as the ability of cells to transfer DiD-labeled vesicles to acceptor cells in a cell contact-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We observed that connections were formed in both culture conditions, and that cell-to-cell transfer was happening in a similar ratio in serum-rich and reduced conditions. Together with the expression of several markers in both conditions on these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), these results confirmed that serum deprivation did not affect the nature of the TNTs.

These fractions are enriched in the TNT-microsomal-type/membrane proteome, although we cannot exclude that they also contain small portions of cell bodies or ER. For simplicity, we shortly call them TNTome hereafter. 1177 proteins were identified in at least nine preparations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We first observed that proteins previously described in TNTs, like actin, Myosin10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gousset et al., 2013</xref>), ERp29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pergu et al., 2019</xref>), or N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sartori-Rupp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2022</xref>) were indeed present in the TNTome. Less than 100 nuclear proteins (according to GO Cellular component analysis), i.e., less than 8%, were found, which could result from partial contamination with cellular debris or dead cells. This is in accordance with NanoFCM results, where H2B-GFP positive particles were 4% of actin-chromobody-GFP positive ones. The 1177 proteins have been ranked in four quartiles depending on their relative abundancy (average iBAQ), highlighting the enrichment of specific factors when considering gene ontology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These factors could be structural components of TNTs, but also material that was circulating in them or in the process of being transferred at the time when TNTs were broken and purified. It could be why mitochondrial (8% of the total), lysosomal/endosomal or other vesicle proteins are listed. The Proteomap analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) also revealed that TNTome is rich in RNA-associated proteins (ribosomes, translation factors, ribonucleoproteins), in accordance with TNTs being able to transfer micro and mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haimovich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kolba et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the TNTome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proteomap of the 1177 proteins of the TNTome, sorted in four quartiles depending on their mean iBAQ.

Actin was the fourth most abundant protein of TNTome, whereas tubulin beta and alpha chains were ranked in positions 6 and 7. This was in accordance with the nature of TNTs, mainly supported by actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>). However, recent work has shown that TNTs, in addition to actin, could contain microtubules as in some cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lou, 2020</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and cytokeratins like in the case of urothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Resnik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Resnik et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>When looking at membrane proteins, analysis of the GO terms (cellular components) of the TNTome classified around 500 proteins as membrane-related, 64 of which being strictly integral plasma membranes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Among the latter, N-cadherin and other cadherin-related proteins (green nodes), as well as known N-cadherin interactors like alpha-catenin, were found. We also noticed the presence of various integrin subunits (orange nodes), including the Integrin β1. However, the TNTome had only a partial overlap with integrin adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horton et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and tab1 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) and with the consensus adhesome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, tab2 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In addition, very important proteins of the focal adhesions, like Paxillin, GIT2, Parvins, and PINCH1 were not in the TNTome, making unlikely focal adhesion being isolated in TNT preparations. We also analyzed whether TNT preparations could be contaminated by filopodia, another type of protrusion grown by the cells. Despite common proteins described as core filopodia proteins in U2OS cells (like Myosin10, Integrin α5, TLN1, FERMT2, MSN, LIMA1), the TNTome was devoid of others (Myo15A, TLN2, PARVA, ITGB1BP1, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jacquemet et al., 2019</xref>), ruling out an important contamination of TNTs with filopodia during the preparation. Together, these results suggested that the proteins identified in TNTome represent a specific composition of these protrusions, and not a pool of other types of protrusions which could have contaminated the preparation. We confirmed these results by immunofluorescence both for proteins found (Integrin β1, CD151, Vinculin) or not (Paxillin, GM130) in the TNTome in U2OS cells cultured in the presence and absence of serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>We also looked at whether the TM proteins of the TNTome were the most abundant TM proteins of U2OS cells. We compared the rank in TNTome to the protein concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beck et al., 2011</xref>) or to the level of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lundberg et al., 2010</xref>). Whether some factors are indeed highly expressed in U2OS cells (for instance Integrin β1, SLC3A2, basigin, CLIC channels) and ranked in the first quartile of TNTome, others are weakly expressed in U2OS cells, but still enriched in TNTome (N-cadherin for instance). In addition, some cell surface proteins are highly expressed in U2OS cells (according to their corresponding RNA level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lundberg et al., 2010</xref>), but not detected in the TNTome, like SLC2A11 (Glucose transporter), APP, ITM2C, TNFR. As shown by WB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>, we could detect membrane or membrane-associated proteins in U2OS cell extracts that were not listed in TNTome, like Integrin β4, α4, EGFR, Cx43, and APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jouannet et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, some proteins of very low abundancy in cells were found in TNTome (CALML5 for example), maybe reflecting a specific role in TNT formation. We also observed that the relative abundance of some proteins in TNT fractions compared to WCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>) was variable. For example, CD9 and especially ADAM10 seemed to be relatively abundant in TNTs compared to WCE, whereas Integrin β1 or ANXA2 TNT/WCE ratios were much lower. Altogether, these data suggested that TNT membrane composition was not just a fraction of cell surface membrane proteins, but rather that some proteins were excluded, other more present. This first consolidated our TNT purification procedure, and second highlighted that specific mechanisms and factors should be at stake to grow and maintain TNTs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparison of the content of TNTs and EVPs</title><p>Because both EVs and TNTs have similar characteristics (membrane-formed, diameter, ability to transfer material to remote cells), we analyzed their respective composition when prepared from the same cell cultures, following the full protocol schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, from four independent experiments. 961 proteins in total were identified at least in 3 of the 4 TNT and EVP preparations. When keeping TNT proteins that were also present in the 1177 list of TNTome (in nine TNT preparations over the total of 12), a total of 801 proteins were finally differentially analyzed. Our results showed a different composition of TNTs and EVPs, although common factors represent 75% of them (see volcano plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, 174 proteins were specific for TNTs when compared to EVPs (see tab1 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

While CD9 and CD63 were more abundant in EVs than in TNT, CD81 was present at a similar level in both preparations. Their direct interacting partners CD9P1 and EWI2 (respectively PTGFRN and IGSF8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) were present in TNTome, but more enriched in EVPs than TNTs.

TNT functionality is understood as the intrinsic capacity to allow the transfer of different types of cellular material through the open channel formed between the cytoplasm of different cells. This was monitored by quantifying by flow cytometry the transfer of labeled vesicles between two different cell populations (‘donors’ for the cells where vesicles were first labeled and ‘acceptors’ for the cells that received the vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abounit et al., 2015</xref>). A similar gating strategy was applied to all experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), and the vesicle transfer through any mechanism other than cell contact-dependent was ruled out in all experiments by analyzing secretion controls, where the two cell populations were cultured separately (see total and secretion transfers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, the vesicle transfer occurring mainly through cell-contact-dependent mechanisms is an indirect way of monitoring TNT functionality that must be analyzed with regard to TNT apparent number.</p><p>First, we co-cultured WT, CD9 KO, CD81 KO, or CD9 and CD81 KO donor cells versus WT acceptor cells expressing GFP (as schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Consistently with the decrease of the % of cells connected by TNTs, CD9 KO cells showed a significantly decreased percentage of acceptor cells containing donor’s vesicles compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). On the other hand, despite having no effect on the number of TNTs, CD81 KO resulted in a significant reduction in vesicle transfer to acceptor cells. CD9 and CD81 KO cells showed a further decrease in vesicle transfer, consistent with the high decrease in the percentage of TNT-connected cells. We obtained very similar results when analyzing the experiment using fluorescence microscopy as a complementary approach to FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed a co-culture using tetraspanin OE cells as donor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

However, given that the modest OE of CD81 was associated with a decrease in CD9 expression (albeit not statistically significant), an antagonist effect of CD81 on TNTs number would not be detectable using this model.</p><p>These data showed that both CD9 and CD81 in donor cells positively regulate the transfer of vesicles through TNTs, which could be in the case of CD9, but not CD81, a direct consequence of an increased number of TNT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Pathway of CD9 and CD81 in the regulation of TNTs</title><p>To further understand whether CD9 and CD81 have redundant roles or are complementary in the pathway of TNT formation, we knocked-out CD81 in cells over-expressing CD9 (quantification of the total amount of CD9/CD81 in these cells by WB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This did not prevent the increase in the percentage of TNT-connected cells observed upon CD9 OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), suggesting that CD81 does not play a role in TNT formation when CD9 is present. In contrast to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), the transfer of DiD-labeled vesicles from CD9 OE cells was no longer sensitive to CD81 KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that CD9 OE can compensate for the absence of CD81 on vesicle transfer. To determine whether CD81 can compensate for CD9 function in TNT, we knocked-out CD9 in CD81 OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, CD9 KO reduced TNT number and vesicle transfer to the same extent in these CD81 OE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>) as in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Consequently, we addressed whether promoting CD9 clustering could affect TNT number and function. Incubation for 2–3 hr of living WT SH-SY5Y cells with an anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody (CD9 AB), but not an antibody targeting another cell surface protein (CD46 AB) or a non-specific control antibody (CTR AB), caused the relocalization of CD9 and CD81 in patches on the plasma membrane, suggesting that these molecules were incorporated in multimolecular complexes that were clustered together by the anti-CD9 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, CD9 AB treatment led to an increase of more than 30% in the percentage of TNT-connected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The result was similar to whether the antibodies used on living cells were directly coupled to a fluorophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), thus eliminating any post-fixation artifact. Addition of CD9 AB after 24 hr coculture of WT donor and acceptor cells for an additional 2 hr resulted in an increase of the vesicle transfer of 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This increase is highly significant considering that it results only from the additional 2 hour treatment over a 24 hour culture compared to control conditions. These data suggested that CD9-enriched sites could serve as initiation platforms for TNTs or participate in the stability of these structures, resulting in increased functionality. The lack of CD81 (using CD81 KO cells) did not impact CD9 clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or the increase of TNT number induced by the CD9 AB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, it prevented the increase in vesicle transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) stimulated by the CD9 AB.

One possibility is that vesicles cannot enter these connections in the absence of CD81. Timelapse microscopy was used to monitor the impact of CD81 KO on the behavior of DiD-positive vesicles in TNTs. <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref> shows an example of a vesicle entering TNTs from WT cells and reaching the neighboring cell with constant speed and direction. <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2 fig7video3">Figure 7—videos 2 and 3</xref> show examples of vesicles from CD81 KO cells getting stuck inside TNTs or at the basis of TNTs. We quantified the content of TNTs in DiD-positive vesicles by fixing the cells 8 or 24 hr after cell labeling with DiD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows that the proportion of TNTs containing DiD-labelled vesicles (examples in the left-hand panels) was significantly increased in CD81 KO cells compared to WT cells. Thus, the decrease in transfer observed in the absence of CD81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) is not due to a decrease in vesicle entry into TNTs, but rather to the fact that vesicles enter TNTs but are unable to move the full length and, consequently, accumulate to some extent in the TNTs. Two hypotheses could explain this result: (i) a decreased fusion of TNT with acceptor cells or (ii) an incomplete formation of individual iTNTs in the TNT bundle (iTNTs that would not reach the opposite cell). The latter hypothesis takes into account the fact that the TNTs of SH-SY5Y cells are formed by closely apposed bundles of iTNTs which could originate from opposite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sartori-Rupp et al., 2019</xref>) and are detected as one single TNT by confocal microscopy. Thus, CD81 KO would have an impact on TNT functionality, but not on its detection as a whole structure by confocal microscopy if TNT is formed by iTNTs originating from the two cells. To address this hypothesis, we performed cocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) of cells expressing Actin chromobody-GFP (considered as donor cells) with WT cells (acceptor cells). After fixation, actin and cell membranes were stained with phalloidin and WGA respectively. TNTs were identified as phalloidin (which labels all TNTs and iTNTs, no matter the cell of origin) and WGA-positive structures, whereas green fluorescence only labeled actin of iTNTs growing from donor cells, as schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. After max projection of the z slices encompassing the TNTs of interest, we classified the TNTs into three categories based on their actin chromobody-GFP content: 1. overlapping with phalloidin throughout the structure (fully green exemplified in the first row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> pictures); 2. partially overlapping with phalloidin or 3. not present at all in the TNTs (exemplified in second and third rows, respectively). These different possibilities (summarized in the diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) could respectively correspond to TNTs whose iTNTs from donor cells reached the opposite cells (1), did not reach acceptor cells, or were non-open (2), and to TNTs growing only from acceptor cells (which were WT, (3)). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> graph, the percent of fully green TNT dropped from 69% in experiments with WT donor cells to 34% using CD81 KO donor cells, at the profit of partially green TNT, ‘not green TNT’ being minor in both cultures. These results suggested that in CD81KO cells, iTNT growth could be induced, but less iTNTs grow all the way to the acceptor cells, resulting in less transfer to acceptor cells. These results are consistent with CD81 favoring the full achievement of TNT formation, possibly playing a role in iTNT membrane docking to or fusion with opposing membrane whereas CD9 would stabilize TNT (see the working model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Completion of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) by CD81.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DiD vesicles in TNTs from wild-type (WT) or CD81 KO cells.

When cells are treated with CD9AB, the active complexes are further enriched/stabilized, and more TNTs are stabilized. In CD9 KO cells, growing iTNTs are not stabilized, resulting in the decrease of TNT number.

The physical characteristics as well as the proteome analysis of this fraction, which is the TNT-microsomal-type/membrane proteome (called TNTome for simplicity) suggested that it could be enriched in TNTs with minor contaminations with other cell protrusions material. Therefore, its qualitative analysis could give valuable information on core components, traveling material or regulatory factors of TNTs, although we cannot rule out that some are specific to U2OS cells. Our results regarding the unique composition of TNTs were in accordance with those obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gousset et al., 2019</xref>, who used a laser-captured microdissection approach combined with mass spectrometry to reveal the composition of various types of cellular protrusions in mouse CAD cells, including growth cones, filopodia, and TNTs. Interestingly, among the 190 proteins identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gousset et al., 2019</xref> in 2 samples from hCAD samples (enriched in TNTs), 101 were also found in TNTome (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>), mostly corresponding to the most abundant cellular proteins. It is possible that compared to our approach, laser microdissection allowed a limited amount of material to be purified, and therefore few membrane proteins were identified.</p><p>TNTome is rich in membrane-associated proteins, as well as in proteins linked to the cytoskeleton, in particular to actin, as it was expected for these structures. TNTome is also abundant in ribonucleoproteins and translation-related factors (220 proteins, 19%). Some of them (as well as the proteins identified as nuclear in the databases) could be contaminants coming from cellular debris, however, this fraction should not be more than 10% of the total, based on nanoFCM results. Together with the fact that TNTs transfer mitochondria and lysosomes, it is possible that TNTs are used as a route to transfer RNAs alone or tethered to organelles by Annexins (several members in TNTome, including A11), G3BP1, or CAPRIN1 (both in the first quartile of TNTome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lesnik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cioni et al., 2019</xref>) or that local translation happens along the TNT to fuel it with the required material. Transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs through TNTs has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haimovich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kolba et al., 2019</xref>) and could be one of the major functions of this kind of communication.</p><p>Regarding membranes, besides tetraspanins, cadherins, and integrins, some other plasma membrane TM proteins are of interest. Several amino acids and monocarboxylate transporters (respectively, SLC3A2, SLC1A5 in the first quartile, SLC1A4 and SLC7A1 in the fourth; and SLC16A1 in the second quartile) were found, suggesting together with the presence of mitochondria and of many metabolic enzymes that active metabolism takes place in TNTs. This may be necessary to generate local ATP to power TNT growth as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garde et al., 2022</xref>). Also, of great interest are SLC1A4 (neutral amino acid transporter) and STX7, which are the only TM proteins uniquely found in TNT and not EVP fraction. Overall, our results suggest that TNTs are different from EVPs, although they share numerous factors. Further studying TNT proteins not present in EVPs will possibly allow us to identify TNT-specific markers.</p><p>To further validate our proteomic approach, we focused our attention on tetraspanins CD9 and CD81. Among the structures described to comprise at least one of these factors and that could potentially be contaminants of our TNT preparations, are midbodies. Midbodies have been shown to contain CD9 and its partners CD9-P1 and EWI-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Addi et al., 2020</xref>), and these structures could be copurified with TNTs, although in lower amounts possibly because cells were maintained in a serum-free medium for 24 hr before harvesting TNTs. Of note, only 13 TM proteins are common between TNTome and flemingsome (which has 29), including CD9, CD9P1, and EWI2, but also CADHF1 and 4, CD44, and Integrin α3. Some of these proteins could have a specific role in both TNTs and midbodies, like CD9 and its associated factors. Alternatively, some of these proteins, relatively abundant on plasma membranes, could be randomly present, independently of the specific structure that is analyzed. Importantly, no other specific markers of midbodies were detected in our MS data, including CRIK, CEP55, PLK1, PRC1, MKLP1, and 2, although they are expressed in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lundberg et al., 2010</xref>) confirming that TNTs and midbodies have a different composition.</p><p>Among the cellular structures that depend on tetraspanin-enriched microdomains are also the recently described migrasomes, which are substrate-attached membrane elongated organelles formed on the branch points or the tips of retraction fibers of migrating cells which allow the release and transfer of cellular material in other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2015</xref>).

Indeed, CD9 senses membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dharan et al., 2022</xref>), and several studies have reported a strong impact of these tetraspanins on membrane extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bari et al., 2011</xref>), the most striking example being a profound modification of microvilli shape and distribution at the surface of CD9 KO oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Runge et al., 2007</xref>). This may be due to their inverted cone-like structure which can induce membrane deformation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Umeda et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, both CD9 and CD81 have been shown to be involved in fusion, an important step in TNT formation following membrane extension; as positive regulators of sperm-egg fusion, but negative regulators of macrophage and muscle cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charrin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rubinstein et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rubinstein et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaji et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mascarau et al., 2023</xref>). We show here that CD9 and CD81 are positive regulators of TNT function, since cell contact-dependent vesicle transfer in coculture experiments is decreased when CD9 or CD81 is lacking. Interestingly and despite their abundancy in EVPs, CD9 and/or CD81 absence did not affect transfer through secretion. These results confirmed recent data from the literature showing that CD9 and CD81 have minimal impact on the production or composition of EVs in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fan et al., 2023</xref>) and that the lack of CD9 does not impair the delivery of the content of EVs into recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tognoli et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, EVs have been shown to regulate TNT formation in mesothelioma, breast cancer, or brain endothelial cell models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mahadik and Patwardhan, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thayanithy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mentor and Fisher, 2022</xref>). Although we cannot completely rule out a crosstalk between EVP and TNT formation or stability, our results together with the current data in the literature indicate that CD9 and CD81 deficiencies have a stronger impact on TNT function than on EVP production or function, suggesting that EVPs and TNTs are regulated independently of each other, as far as tetraspanins are concerned.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Although CD9 and CD81 can partially compensate for each other, they act at different steps of TNT formation</title><p>Overall, our results indicate that CD9 and CD81 regulate cell-contact-mediated transfer, through different mechanisms. CD9 positively regulates the % of cells connected by TNTs, likely by stabilizing the TNTs. Indeed, short-term CD9 antibody treatment significantly increased TNT-connected cells and vesicle transfer, and this was associated with an increased TNT duration. CD9 antibody treatment also relocated CD9 and CD81 to TNT extremities, supporting the role of CD9-containing complexes in stabilizing TNTs maybe by favoring cis and/or trans interactions.</p><p>In contrast to CD9, CD81 regulates vesicle transfer without any effect on the number of TNT-connected cells, suggesting that these TNTs are less functional. Compared to WT cells, live cell imaging of CD81 KO cells showed that vesicles can still enter TNTs but do not efficiently transfer to the opposite cells, therefore, accumulating to some extent inside TNTs, as confirmed by the increased number of TNTs that contain vesicles after fixation. One possible explanation could be a reduced ability of CD81 KO TNTs to fuse with the opposing cell. However, we have shown that a GFP-labeled actin chromobody reached the opposing cell twice less frequently when expressed in CD81 KO cells than when expressed in WT cells, pointing again to an abnormal structure of these TNTs in the absence of CD81. The TNTs of SH-SY5Y cells are formed by a bundle of closely apposed individual tubes, iTNTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sartori-Rupp et al., 2019</xref>), originating from the two connected cells, which by confocal microscopy are detected as one single TNT, due to low resolution. The diminished percentage of TNTs fully labeled by the actin chromobody could, therefore, be explained by a decrease in the fraction of iTNTs originating from CD81 KO cells that reach or are stabilized at the opposing cell. Therefore, CD81 could act to facilitate anchoring of the growing iTNT membrane to the opposite membrane, ultimately enabling fusion and completion of fully open/functional TNTs.</p><p>Although CD81 does not seem to regulate the number of TNTs, several lines of evidence indicate that these two tetraspanins can compensate for one another in the formation/maintenance of TNTs and their function. First, the double KO of CD9 and CD81 reduced TNT-connected cells to levels lower than the CD9 single KO, indicating partially redundant roles for CD9 and CD81 in TNT biogenesis or stability. CD9 can also compensate for the lack of CD81 as its OE bypasses the requirement for CD81 for full vesicle transfer. This is reminiscent of the partial compensation by CD81 of the absence of CD9 on eggs during sperm-egg fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rubinstein et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rubinstein et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaji et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, KO of CD9 on CD81 OE cells resulted in a significant decrease in the % of TNT-connected cells and vesicle transfer compared to CD81 OE alone. Furthermore, anti-CD9 antibody treatment of CD81 KO cells increased TNT number and duration to levels seen in WT cells, indicating that CD9 TNT-formation/stabilization capacity was independent of CD81. However, the same antibody incubation stimulates vesicle transfer in WT but not CD81 KO cells, suggesting that CD81 controls a different step. Based on these results, we propose the working model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, in which CD9 would act by stabilizing the interactions between iTNTs and bringing CD81 to the docking site between iTNT tip and opposite cell, allowing CD81 to participate in the anchoring of opposite membranes and finally in the opening of the channel. Recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2022</xref>) proposed a role for TEM in forming a rigid ring impairing membrane damage to spread. Similarly, the specific CD9/CD81 TEM could somehow protect the membrane around the TNT site where fusion with the opposite cell occurs. More work in identifying specific TEM composition in TNTs would be needed to address this hypothesis.</p><p>In summary, in this study, we have shown that TNTs and EVPs are two cellular structures with partially overlapping composition, and that despite being part of both TNTs and EVPs, the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 are fundamental regulators of TNT formation with complementary roles in the whole process of biogenesis of these structures. TNTome further analysis will be of great help to identify additional proteins, as part of the TEM or not, that could participate in TNT formation and regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, lentiviral preparations, plasmids, and transfection procedures</title><p>U2OS cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM + Glutamax, +4.5 g/l Glucose, +Pyruvate, Gibco), plus 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S).

After 3 washes of 10 min each with PBS, cells were incubated with each corresponding Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:1000 in 2% BSA in PBS for 1 hr. Specifically, the secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse with epitope IgG1 Alexa Fluor 488 for CD9 (Invitrogen ref: A21121) and goat anti-mouse with epitope IgG2a Alexa Fluor 633 for CD81 (Invitrogen ref: A21136). For the experiments showing the actin cytoskeleton, cells were labeled with Phalloidin- Rhodamine (Invitrogen) in the same mix and conditions as the secondary antibodies. Then, cells were washed three times for 10 min each with PBS, stained with DAPI, and mounted on glass slides with Aqua PolyMount (Polysciences, Inc). Images were acquired with a confocal microscope LSM700 or 900 (Zeiss) and processed with the ImageJ or Icy software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Western blot</title><p>For Western blot SH-SY5Y cells were lysed with lysis buffer composed of 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X100 with Roche <italic>cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail</italic>.

The use of KO and OE models provides strong evidence. The differential proteomic analysis between TNTs and EVPs and the functional assays justify the conclusion that these tetraspanins are critical for TNT biogenesis and functionality. Overall, the manuscript presents a nice study that advances our understanding of TNTs and their regulation by CD9 and CD81. Despite some limitations, the strengths of the experimental design and the robustness of the data justify the authors' conclusions. Future studies addressing the identified weaknesses would further solidify these findings and their implications in pathological contexts.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Novelty and Significance - this study addresses the composition and regulation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). By identifying the roles of CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins, the researchers offer insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TNT formation. This could have implications for understanding cellular communication in pathological conditions such as cancer.</p><p>Methodological Accuracy - the authors employed a well-designed biochemical approach to isolate TNTs from U2OS cells, distinguishing them from extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs). The use of multiple independent preparations and the application of LC-MS/MS for proteomic analysis ensure robustness and reproducibility of the data.</p><p>Complete Analysis - the study provides a detailed proteomic profile of TNTs, identifying 1177 proteins and highlighting key components. The comparative analysis between TNTs and EVPs further strengthens the findings by demonstrating distinct proteomic landscapes.</p><p>Functional Insights - using knockout (KO) and overexpression (OE) models, the authors convincingly demonstrate the distinct roles of CD9 and CD81 in TNT formation and function. CD9 is shown to stabilize TNTs, while CD81 facilitates vesicle transfer, likely by aiding membrane docking or fusion.</p><p>Experimental Design - the use of actin chromobody-GFP and various fluorescent markers enabled the authors to visualize TNTs and validate their isolation protocol. Additionally, the combination of electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and live-cell imaging provided convincing evidence for their claims.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Potential Contaminations - while the authors took steps to minimize contamination with other cellular structures, the presence of some nuclear proteins and the possible inclusion of small portions of cell bodies or ER in the TNT preparations cannot be entirely ruled out. This may affect the interpretation of some proteomic data.</p><p>Limited Cell Models - the experiments were conducted in U2OS and SH-SY5Y cells. While these are relevant models, in vivo validation of the findings would significantly enhance the impact and translational potential of the research.</p><p>Functional Mechanisms - although the study provides strong evidence for the roles of CD9 and CD81, the exact molecular mechanisms by which these tetraspanins regulate TNT formation and vesicle transfer remain partially speculative. Further biochemical and biophysical analyses would be necessary to elucidate these mechanisms in detail.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99172.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Tunneling nanotubes (TNT) are common cellular protrusions that allow the transfer of multiple types of cargo between mammalian cells. TNTs are fragile, and lack any known unique marker, making it challenging to isolate and study them. Therefore, the content of TNTs is mostly unknown, and there are only a handful of proteins known to play a role in TNT formation or function.</p><p>In this paper, the authors developed a new protocol to isolate TNT fragments from a culture of adherent mammalian cells in a way that is distinctive of extracellular vesicle and identify the proteins within the TNT (referred to as TNTome) by mass spectrometry. The authors provide an analysis of the results in comparison to the extracellular vesicle (EV) proteome, and validate a few examples, thus providing valuable data for the TNT field. However, there is a big overlap between TNTome and EV proteome.</p><p>The authors further focus on two proteins, CD9 and CD81, that are enriched in TNTs. Using cells that are knocked out (KO) or over-expressing (OE) these proteins, the authors study their role in TNT formation and function. The authors focus on two major parameters, which are the percent of cells connected by TNT, and the percent of acceptor cells containing fluorescently labeled transferred vesicles. The authors use various assays, which are properly controlled, to measure these parameters. Their analysis provides convincing evidence that CD9 plays a partial role in TNT formation or stabilization and CD81 plays a partial role in forming fully elongated/connected TNT.</p><p>However, the authors overstate the importance of these proteins, since their absence only partially affects TNT formation and function, similar to what is seen when knocking out most any other protein implicated in TNT formation. Even their best results show just a 50% reduction for TNT formation and 70% vesicle transfer (in the double KO). Thus, these are not &quot;key&quot; regulators as the title suggests - no more than many other factors, some of them identified by the authors in previous publications. The model presented in Figure 7D is thus misleading, as it states that CD9 KO has &quot;No TNT&quot; which is incorrect (only a slight decrease according to Figure 3C), and states that CD81 KO has &quot;Non-functional TNT&quot; whereas there is still 50% vesicle transfer in this mutant.</p><p>In addition, the authors use vesicle transfer as a measure of function, but this is just one type of cargo amongst many others: ions, proteins, RNA, various organelles, and pathogens like viruses and bacteria. Since the authors clearly cannot test every type of cargo, the authors should at least be more accurate in their statements regarding functionality and mention the possibility that other types of cargo transfer could be less or more affected by the KO or OE of these proteins.</p><p>It is not completely clear from the text why the authors decided to focus on CD9 and CD81, which are also found in EV, instead of focusing on TNT-unique proteins, and in particular the cytoskeleton-related ones.</p><p>In summary, it is a good paper, that provides valuable data on the composition of TNT, and the role of additional players, bringing us closer to understanding the mechanism of TNT formation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99172.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Initially, the authors isolated TNTs from EVPs and cell bodies of cultured U2OS cells. Using transmission electronic microscopy and nanoflow cytometry, they demonstrated that these two structures are morphologically different. In engineered cells, they observed the presence of actin and CD9 in TNTs by immunofluorescence. Then they employed mass spectrometry techniques to analyze the EVPs and TNT fractions, discovering that their compositions significantly differ and that CD9 and CD81 are abundant in both structures.</p><p>Subsequently, they studied the role of CD9 and CD81 in the formation of TNTs by using SH-SY5Y cells, first confirming their presence in TNTs via immunofluorescence. CD9 knockout (KO) cells, but not CD81 KO, exhibited a reduced percentage of cells connected via TNTs. The percentage of TNT-connected double KO cells was even lower compared to CD9 KO cells. Additionally, CD9 overexpression (OE), but not CD81 OE increased the percentage of TNT-connected cells.</p><p>The authors then investigated the influence of CD9 and CD81 on the capacity of cells to transport material through TNTs by quantifying vesicle delivery between cells. The percentage of acceptor cells containing vesicles (I call it here the efficiency of vesicle transfer) was reduced in CD9 KO cells and CD81 KO cells, and even lower in double KO cells. CD9 OE or CD81 OE increased vesicle transfer efficiency.</p><p>Then, they studied possible redundant or complementary roles in the formation of TNTs through a combination of KO and OE of CD9 and CD81 and observed that CD81 does not play any role in TNT formation when CD9 is present, and vesicle transfer of CD81 KO cells can be efficient in CD9 OE conditions.</p><p>Incubation of WT cells and CD81 KO cells with an anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody caused CD9 and CD81 clustering, significantly increasing the percentage of TNT-connected cells and duration of TNTs. While the antibody enhanced vesicle transfer efficiency in WT cells, it did not affect vesicle transfer in CD81 KO cells.</p><p>The article is well-written and addresses an important biological question, providing some insightful results. However, I have concerns regarding the connection between the experimental data and some of the conclusions drawn by the authors. Below I summarize my points:</p><p>- The protocol used to separate TNTs from EVPs and the cell body to determine their protein composition appears problematic. The authors apply mechanical stress by vigorously shaking the samples to achieve this separation. I am skeptical that this method robustly isolates TNTs from other cellular structures/components. I am concerned that their proteomic analysis might not be analyzing the composition of TNTs exclusively, but rather a mixture that includes other structures. For example, the second and eighth most abundant proteins identified are histones (Table S1), and about 20% of the total TNT proteins identified are either mitochondrial or nuclear proteins. The authors should attempt to improve the proteomics section of their study. To differentiate structural TNT proteins from debris, the authors could use statistical analysis to compare multiple independent preparations. Structural TNT proteins will likely be consistently present across all preparations, while non-structural TNT proteins may not. If this approach proves ineffective, the authors might need to refine their TNT isolation procedure.</p><p>- Throughout the whole manuscript, the authors quantify the percentage of cells connected by TNTs but do not provide data on the total number of TNTs, which would offer additional valuable information not captured by the percentage of TNT-connected cells alone.</p><p>- To study TNT functionality, the authors quantified the efficiency of vesicle transfer by calculating the percentage of acceptor cells containing donor vesicles. How was this percentage computed? The actual number of vesicles delivered to acceptor cells would provide a more accurate metric of vesicle transfer efficiency.</p><p>- In Figure 7D, the authors provide a working model. They claim that CD9 KO cells are incapable of forming TNTs. However, this is not supported by their data. The percentage of TNT-connected cells in CD9 KO cells is only slightly lower than in WT cells (Figure 3C).</p><p>- In the abstract and discussion of Figure 7D, the authors also claim that CD81 is necessary for the functional transfer of vesicles through TNTs by regulating membrane docking/fusion with the opposing cell. Furthermore, they propose in the discussion section that CD81 is involved in the opening of the TNT. However, all these claims are purely speculative and not supported by their data. If CD81 played such a role, vesicles would accumulate at the tip of the TNTs, which does not appear to be the case. Vesicle transfer occurs in CD81 KO cells. Additionally, TNT formation and efficient vesicle transfer are observed in CD81 KO cells and CD9 OE conditions, suggesting that docking/fusion is not dependent on CD81. Can the authors justify their claims? It is possible that CD81 KO cells might form TNTs with smaller diameters, potentially hindering vesicle transfer.

Generally, we agree with the reviewers on the strengths and weaknesses of our manuscript. It is true that this work is a first step towards understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TNT formation, and that further biochemical and biophysical analyses will be necessary to elucidate CD9 and CD81 roles. It also provides a toolbox for the future identification of important TNT factors, and perhaps biological markers.</p><p>However, we would like to better explain our choice of focusing on CD9 and CD81 in TNTs, given the fact that they are also expressed in EVPs. First, both were among the most abundant integral membrane proteins in TNTs, and overexpression of CD9 was previously shown to increase TNT number. However, a recent work directed by our coauthor E. Rubinstein clearly showed that the absence of CD9, CD81 or even both has minimal impact on the production or composition of EVs in MCF7 (Fan et al, Differential proteomics argues against a general role for CD9, CD81 or CD63 in the sorting of proteins into extracellular vesicles, J. Extracell Vesicles, 2023;12:12352. https://doi.org/10.1002/jev2.12352). This is in line with another recent publication (Tognoli, Commun biol 2023) and with our results showing that the concentration of EVPs was the same when CD9 was overexpressed, i.e. in conditions where TNT number and vesicle transfer were increased. Therefore, it is highly probable that the role of CD9 and CD81 in TNT vs. EVP formation is different, even if we cannot completely exclude a crosstalk between the two pathways.</p><p>Regarding the importance of CD9 and CD81 in TNT formation, our results are consistent with a non-exclusive regulation of the TNTs by these tetraspanins, and/or with partial compensatory mechanisms occurring in the absence of them by yet unknown factors. Interestingly, to our knowledge, none of the TNT regulators describedin the literature has a complete inhibitory effect when KO. These results confirm that several pathways can converge to regulate TNTs and are consistent with cellularplasticity. So it is hard to say whether factors like CD9 and CD81, which regulate TNTs and have other functions in cells, are “key” or simply “important”.</p><p>Finally, the model we present in Figure 7 is a schematic working model of possible CD9/CD81 roles, which is obviously simplified for ease of understanding. It is important to note that when we write “no TNT” above an empty space between 2 cells, this describes what is drawn, and corresponds to real conditions where fewer TNTs are detected. It was never our intention to over-interpret our data, but rather to make it clearer with this diagram, and we hope that reading the article will make this clear.</p></body></sub-article></article>
