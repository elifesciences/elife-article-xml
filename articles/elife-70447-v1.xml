Newly discovered lumbar vertebrae contribute to a near-complete lower back of Malapa Hominin 2 (MH2), offering additional insights into posture and locomotion in <italic>Australopithecus sediba</italic>. We show that MH2 possessed a lower back consistent with lumbar lordosis and other adaptations to bipedalism, including an increase in the width of intervertebral articular facets from the upper to lower lumbar column (‘pyramidal configuration’). These results contrast with some recent work on lordosis in fossil hominins, where MH2 was argued to demonstrate no appreciable lordosis (‘hypolordosis’) similar to Neandertals. Our three-dimensional geometric morphometric (3D GM) analyses show that MH2’s nearly complete middle lumbar vertebra is human-like in overall shape but its vertebral body is somewhat intermediate in shape between modern humans and great apes. Additionally, it bears long, cranially and ventrally oriented costal (transverse) processes, implying powerful trunk musculature. We interpret this combination of features to indicate that <italic>A. sediba</italic> used its lower back in both bipedal and arboreal positional behaviors, as previously suggested based on multiple lines of evidence from other parts of the skeleton and reconstructed paleobiology of <italic>A. sediba</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the defining features of humans is our ability to walk comfortably on two legs. To achieve this, our skeletons have evolved certain physical characteristics. For example, the lower part of the human spine has a forward curve that supports an upright posture; whereas the lower backs of chimpanzees and other apes – which walk around on four limbs and spend much of their time in trees – lack this curvature<bold>.</bold> Studying the fossilized back bones of ancient human remains can help us to understand how we evolved these features, and whether our ancestors moved in a similar way.</p><p><italic>Australopithecus sediba</italic> was a close-relative of modern humans that lived about two million years ago. In 2008, fossils from an adult female were discovered at a cave site in South Africa called Malapa. However, the fossils of the lower back region were incomplete, so it was unclear whether the female – referred to as Malapa Hominin 2 (MH2) – had a forward-curving spine and other adaptations needed to walk on two legs.</p><p>Here, Williams et al. report the discovery of new <italic>A. sediba</italic> fossils from Malapa. The new fossils are mainly bones from the lower back, and they fit together with the previously discovered MH2 fossils, providing a nearly complete lower spine. Analysis of the fossils suggested that MH2 would have had an upright posture and comfortably walked on two legs, and the curvature of their lower back was similar to modern females. However, other aspects of the bones’ shape suggest that as well as walking, <italic>A. sediba</italic> probably spent a significant amount of time climbing in trees.</p><p>The findings of Williams et al. provide new insights in to our evolutionary history, and ultimately, our place in the natural world around us. Our lower back is prone to injury and pain associated with posture, pregnancy and exercise (or lack thereof). Therefore, understanding how the lower back evolved may help us to learn how to prevent injuries and maintain a healthy back.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>paleoanthropology</kwd><kwd>human evolution</kwd><kwd>bipedalism</kwd><kwd>vertebral column</kwd><kwd>lordosis</kwd><kwd>upright posture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005966</institution-id><institution>Leakey Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Scott A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales CSIC PID2020-115854GB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bastir</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Newly recovered lumbar vertebrae belonging to Malapa Hominin 2, an adult female of the fossil hominin species <italic>Australopithecus sediba</italic>, demonstrate that this individual was adapted to upright posture and bipedal locomotion but also had adaptations for climbing in trees.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bipedal locomotion is thought to be one of the earliest and most extensive adaptations in the hominin lineage, potentially evolving initially 6–7 million years (Ma) ago. Human-like bipedalism evolved gradually, however, and early hominins appear to have been facultative bipeds on the ground and competent climbers in the trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Senut et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">White et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prang et al., 2021</xref>). How long climbing adaptations persisted in hominins and when adaptations to obligate terrestrial bipedalism evolved are major outstanding questions in paleoanthropology. <italic>Australopithecus sediba</italic> – an early Pleistocene (~2 Ma) hominin from the site of Malapa, Gauteng province, South Africa – has featured prominently in these discussions, as well as those concerning the origins of the genus <italic>Homo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irish et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dembo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimbel and Rak, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Ruiter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Du and Alemseged, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies support the hypothesis that <italic>A. sediba</italic> possessed adaptations to arboreal locomotion and lacked traits reflecting a form of obligate terrestriality observed in later hominins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prang, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prang, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holliday et al., 2018</xref>). Malapa Hominin 2 (MH2) metacarpals are characterized by trabecular density most similar to orangutans, which suggests power grasping capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunmore et al., 2020</xref>), and the MH2 ulna was estimated to reflect a high proportion of forelimb suspension in the locomotor repertoire of <italic>A. sediba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rein et al., 2017</xref>). Evidence from the lower limb also suggests that <italic>A. sediba</italic> lacked a robust calcaneal tuber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prang, 2015a</xref>) and a longitudinal arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prang, 2015b</xref>), both thought to be adaptations to obligate, human-like bipedalism, and demonstrates evidence for a mobile subtalar joint proposed to be adaptively significant for vertical climbing and other arboreal locomotor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeSilva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zipfel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeSilva et al., 2018</xref>). The upper thorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>), scapula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchill et al., 2018</xref>), and cervical vertebrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyer et al., 2017</xref>) of <italic>A. sediba</italic> suggest shoulder and arm elevation indicative of arboreal positional behaviors requiring overhead arm positions, and the limb joint size proportions are ape-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prabhat et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of dental calculus from Malapa Hominin 1 (MH1) indicates that this individual’s diet was high in C<sub>3</sub> plants like fruit and leaves, similar to savannah chimpanzees and <italic>Ardipithecus ramidus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henry et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite the presence of climbing adaptations, <italic>A. sediba</italic> also demonstrates clear evidence for bipedal locomotion. The knee and ankle possess human-like adaptations to bipedalism, demonstrating a valgus angle of the femur and a human-like ankle joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zipfel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeSilva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeSilva et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence for strong dorsal (lordotic) wedging of the two lower lumbar vertebrae suggests the presence of a lordotic (ventrally convex) lower back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2018b</xref>). However, the initial recovery of just the last two lumbar vertebrae of MH2 limited interpretations of spinal curvature, and a study of the MH2 pelvis reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kibii et al., 2011</xref>) suggests that <italic>A. sediba</italic> was characterized by a small lordosis angle estimated from calculated pelvic incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Been et al., 2014</xref>). A separate pelvis reconstruction of MH2 produces a pelvic incidence angle more in line with other hominins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tardieu et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of a long, mobile lower back and a <italic>Homo</italic>-like lower thorax morphology indicating the presence of a waist further suggest bipedal adaptations in <italic>A. sediba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). However, missing and incomplete lumbar vertebrae prevented comparative analysis of overall lower back morphology and allowed only limited interpretations of <italic>A. sediba</italic> back posture and implications for positional behavior.</p><p>Here, we report the discovery of portions of four lumbar vertebrae from two ex situ breccia blocks that were excavated from an early 20th century mining road and dump at Malapa. The former mining road is represented by a trackway located in the northern section of the site approximately 2 m north of the main pit that yielded the original <italic>A. sediba</italic> finds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dirks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The trackway traverses the site in an east-west direction and was constructed using breccia and soil removed from the main pit by the historic limestone miners. Specimens U.W.88–232, −233,–234, and –281 were recovered in 2015 from the upper section of layer 2 (at a depth of 10 cm) and formed part of the foundation layer of the mining road. The trackway can be distinguished from the surrounding deposits by a section of compacted soil (comprising quartz, cherts, and flowstone) and breccia that extends between layers 1 and 2. Breccia recovered from the trackway, including the block containing U.W.88–232, −233,–234, and –281 similarly presented with quantities of embedded quartz fragments and grains. The breccia block containing specimen U.W.88–280, along with U.W.88–43, –44, and –114 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2018b</xref>), were recovered from the miner’s dump comprised of excess material (soil and breccia) used for the construction of the miner’s road. The composition of the road matrix and associated breccia, as well as the breccia initially recovered from the mine dump, corresponds to the facies D and E identified in the main pit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dirks et al., 2010</xref>). Facies D includes a fossil-rich breccia deposit that contained the fossil material associated with MH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dirks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Val et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the geological evidence suggests that the material used for the construction of the miner’s road was sourced on-site, and most probably originated from the northern section of the main pit.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Malapa site map showing the location of the new discoveries.</title><p>The new fossils were discovered during excavations of an early 20th century mining road north of the main pit at Malapa.

The presence of a nearly complete lower back of MH2 allows us to more comprehensively evaluate the functional morphology and evolution of purported adaptations to bipedalism in <italic>A. sediba</italic> and test the hypotheses that the following fundamental features are similar to modern humans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) and distinct from extant great apes: (1) lumbar lordosis, (2) progressive widening of the articular facets and laminae (pyramidal configuration) of the lower back, and (3) overall middle lumbar vertebra shape. Specifically, for these hypotheses, we predict that measurements of combined lumbar wedging (representing degree of lordosis ascertained from available lumbar vertebrae) will fall within the human range (H1), that the configuration of the articular facets and laminae will progressively widen caudally (rather than remaining constant or becoming increasingly narrow) as seen in modern humans (H2), and that the most complete lumbar vertebra of MH2 (U.W.88–233) will fall within the human range of variation in shape analyses (H3).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>New lumbar vertebrae of Malapa Hominin 2 (MH2).</title><p>Vertebrae in (<bold>A</bold>) superior, (<bold>B</bold>) inferior, (<bold>C</bold>) ventral, (<bold>D</bold>) dorsal, (<bold>E</bold>) left lateral, and (<bold>F</bold>) right lateral views.

Most of the sacrum (U.W.88–137) is preserved in articulation with the neural arch of the last lumbar vertebra (U.W.88–138), which articulates in turn with the inferior portion of the neural arch of the penultimate lumbar vertebra (U.W.88–154). Corresponding vertebral bodies (U.W.88–126 and U.W.88–127, respectively) are preserved together and can be refitted with the neural arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). The new lumbar vertebrae are preserved in partial articulation, including an upper neural arch that refits in two places with U.W.88–154. Therefore, portions of five vertebrae are preserved, followed by a sacrum and preceded by at least three lower thoracic vertebrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>U.W.88–280: This is a partial, superior portion of a vertebral body concealed in the matrix of a previously known block containing lower thoracic vertebrae (U.W.88–114, U.W.88–43, and U.W.88–44, antepenultimate, penultimate, and ultimate thoracic vertebrae, respectively, of MH2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2018b</xref>). U.W.88–280 was revealed in the segmentation of micro-CT (hereafter, µCT) data. U.W.88–280 represents the right side of an upper vertebral body with preservation approaching the sagittal midline. The preserved portions measure 16.5 mm dorsoventrally and 14.0 mm mediolaterally at their maximum lengths. The lateral portion of the vertebral body is only preserved ~5.0 mm inferiorly from the superior surface, but there is no indication of a costal facet on the preserved portion. We identify this as part (along with U.W.88–281) of the first lumbar vertebra of MH2 based on its position below the vertebral body of what is almost certainly the last thoracic vertebra (U.W.88–44) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>U.W.88–281: This is the partial neural arch of a post-transitional, upper lumbar vertebra concealed in matrix above the subjacent lumbar vertebra (U.W.88–232). It was revealed through the segmentation of µCT data. It consists of the base and caudal portion of the spinous process and parts of the inferior articular processes. The remainder of the vertebra is sheared off and unaccounted for in the block containing the new lumbar vertebrae. U.W.88–281 is fixed in partial articulation with the subjacent second lumbar vertebra (L2), U.W.88–232. Therefore, we identify U.W.88–281 as part of the first lumbar vertebra based on its morphology and position within the block. The left inferior articular facet (IAF) is more complete than the right, with approximately 6.0 mm of its superior-inferior (SI) height preserved, and is complete mediolaterally, measuring ~8.0 mm in width. The minimum distance between the IAF is 12.5 mm, and the maximum preserved distance between them is 21.75 mm. The preserved portion of the spinous process is 12.75 mm in dorsoventral length.</p><p>U.W.88–232: This vertebra is the L2 and remains in articulation with the third lumbar vertebra (L3), U.W.88–233, held together with matrix. Some portions of U.W.88–232 are covered by adhering matrix or other fossil elements (U.W.88–281 and U.W.88–282, the latter being the sternal end of a clavicle), so µCT data were used to visualize the whole vertebra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). U.W.88–232 is mostly complete, missing the cranial portions of its superior articular processes and distal portions of its costal (transverse) processes. It is distorted due to crushing dorsally from the right side and related breakage and slight displacements of the left superior articular process at the <italic>pars interarticularis</italic> and the right costal process at its base. Although broken at its base and displaced slightly ventrally, the right costal process is more complete than the left side, which is broken and missing ~10.0 mm from its base. Because of crushing, the neural arch is displaced toward the left side, and the vertebral foramen is significantly distorted. A partial mammillary process is present on the left superior articular process, sheared off along with the remainder of the right superior articular process ~8.0 mm from its base. The left side is similar but much of the mammillary process is sheared off in the same plane as the right side, leaving only its base on the lateral aspect of the right superior articular process. The vertebral body is complete and undistorted, and the spinous process and inferior articular processes are likewise complete but affected by distortion. Standard measurements of undistorted morphologies are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>U.W.88–233: This is the L3 and the most complete vertebra in the lumbar series, although some aspects of the neural arch are distorted, broken, and displaced. It is held in matrix and partial articulation with U.W.88–234, the subjacent partial fourth lumbar vertebra (L4). Due to its position between articulated elements U.W.88–232 and –234 and some adhering matrix, U.W.88–233 was visualized using µCT data. U.W.88–233 is essentially complete; however, like U.W.88–232, the neural arch is crushed from the dorsal direction, with breaks and displacement across the right <italic>pars interarticularis</italic> and the right costal process at its base, with additional buckling around the latter near the base of the of the right superior articular process, resulting in a crushing of the vertebral foramen. The vertebral body, pedicles, spinous process, and superior and inferior articular processes are complete, as are the lamina and costal processes aside from the aforementioned breakage. The left costal process is unaffected by taphonomic distortion. Standard measurements of undistorted morphologies are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>U.W.88–234: This is a partial neural arch of the previously known penultimate lumbar vertebra (L4) (U.W.88-127/153).

As we outline below, <italic>A. sediba</italic> demonstrates evidence for lumbar lordosis in the combined pattern of bony wedging of lumbar vertebral bodies, as well as progressive widening of neural arch structures moving caudally (‘pyramidal configuration’) of lumbar vertebrae and the sacrum, which does not allow us to reject the hypotheses that <italic>A. sediba</italic> has human-like adaptations to bipedalism. However, the hypothesis that <italic>A. sediba</italic>’s middle lumbar vertebra (L3) is human-like is not fully supported: although U.W.88–233 is somewhat human-like in overall shape, its costal processes are long and cranially oriented, unlike modern humans, and its vertebral body is intermediate in shape between those of modern humans (and Neandertals) and great apes.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2013</xref>, predicted strong lumbar lordosis (‘hyperlordosis’) in MH2 based on the combined wedging values of the penultimate and ultimate lumbar vertebrae. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Been et al., 2014</xref>, estimated lumbar lordosis angle using pelvic incidence from a pelvis reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kibii et al., 2011</xref>) and found MH2 to produce the least lordotic lumbar column of the sampled members of the genus <italic>Australopithecus</italic> in their sample, falling well below modern human values and within the distribution of Neandertals. Neandertals are thought to be ‘hypolordotic’, or characterized by a relatively straight, non-lordotic lumbar column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Been et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Been et al., 2017</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haeusler et al., 2019</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tardieu et al., 2017</xref>, report a human-like degree of pelvic incidence (and therefore lumbar lordosis) in a new reconstruction of the MH2 pelvis. Therefore, current interpretations of lumbar curvature of <italic>A. sediba</italic> range from hyperlordotic to hypolordotic. Here, we report that the pattern of vertebral wedging of MH2 and most other fossil hominins are similar to both modern humans and extant great apes except at the last lumbar level, where MH2 is markedly more dorsally wedged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Like the Neandertal Kebara 2, the strong dorsal (lordotic) wedging of MH2’s last lumbar vertebra is likely countering a strong ventral (kyphotic) wedging in the upper lumbar column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, MH2 demonstrates much less ventral wedging than Neandertals and produces a human-like combined wedging angles value, falling outside the 95% prediction intervals of great apes. Therefore, it seems likely that MH2 and possibly the juvenile <italic>H. erectus</italic> individual KNM-WT 15000 demonstrate strong dorsal wedging at the last lumbar level for different reasons than Kebara 2. It was suggested previously that the morphology of the MH2 last lumbar is part of a kinematic chain linked to hyperpronation of the foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeSilva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). With the absence of soft tissue contributions to the kinematic chain (i.e., intervertebral discs), formal biomechanical testing is beyond the scope of the current paper; however, our results suggest that MH2 was probably neither hypolordotic nor hyperlordotic and produces a combined wedging angles value more similar to modern humans than great apes.</p><p>Modern humans are characterized by a pyramidal configuration of the lumbar inter-articular facet joints such that the upper lumbar articular facet joints (and associated laminae) are transversely more narrowly spaced than those of the lower lumbar vertebrae and especially compared to the lumbosacral inter-articular facet joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Latimer and Ward, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanders, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ward and Latimer, 2005</xref>). Together with vertebral body and intervertebral disc wedging, this progressive widening facilitates the adoption of lordotic posture during ontogeny and allows for the imbrication of the IAF of a superjacent vertebra onto the laminae of the subjacent vertebra during hyperextension of the lower back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Latimer and Ward, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). Like modern humans, known fossil hominin lumbar vertebrae bear ‘imbrication pockets’, mechanically induced fossae positioned just caudal to the SAF on the lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Latimer and Ward, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2013</xref>), providing direct evidence for lumbar hyperextension and lordosis. Inadequate spacing of lower lumbar inter-articular facets in modern humans can result in spondylolysis, fracture of the <italic>pars interarticularis</italic>, and potential separation of the affected vertebra’s spinous process and inferior articular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ward and Latimer, 2005</xref>). Lack of the progressive widening of inter-articular facets of lower lumbar vertebrae in our closest living relatives, the African apes, begs the question of when the pyramidal configuration evolved and to what extent various fossil hominins demonstrated this trait. Although a human-like pattern of interfacet distance was once claimed for the European late Miocene ape <italic>Oreopithecus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Köhler and Moya-Sola, 1997</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Russo and Shapiro, 2013</xref>, demonstrated that measures for changes in both interfacet distance and laminar width in this extinct ape fall within ranges of extant apes (and other suspensory mammals) and outside those of humans. Among hominins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Latimer and Ward, 1993</xref>, documented the presence of a pyramidal configuration in <italic>H. erectus</italic>.

Here, we show that MH2 and other <italic>Australopithecus</italic> specimens fall at the low end of modern human variation and differ from great apes in having significantly wider inter-articular facets at the lumbosacral junction than higher in the lumbar column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The overall morphologies of lumbar vertebrae are informative with regard to locomotion and posture in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Slijper, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shapiro, 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanders and Bodenbender, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Granatosky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Williams and Russo, 2015</xref>).

Our 3D GM results show that the middle lumbar vertebra of <italic>A. sediba</italic> (U.W.88–233; L3) falls with modern humans (L3) to the exclusion of great apes (L2) in overall shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>).

Since body mass scales as the cube of linear dimensions and the physiological cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle – a major determinant of isometric force production – scales as the square of linear dimensions, larger-bodied individuals should be relatively weaker with all else held equal. Thus to compensate, we would expect to see changes in bony morphology based on differences in body size. We find that the spinous and costal processes are longer in specimens with larger centroid sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). These changes would increase the moment arms of the <italic>erector spinae</italic> and <italic>quadratus lumborum</italic> muscles, respectively, resulting in greater moments that contribute to lumbar extension, ventral flexion, and lateral flexion to cope with increases in body mass. Our results suggest that, while we detect a statistically significant effect of centroid size on middle lumbar vertebral shape within each group, the differences in costal process size and orientation observed between <italic>A. sediba</italic> and modern humans appear not to be explained by size alone.</p><p>Long costal processes give the <italic>psoas major</italic> and <italic>quadratus lumborum</italic> muscles an effective leverage in acting on the vertebral column, increasing their moment arms and torque generation capabilities to assist the <italic>erector spinae</italic> in lateral flexion of the spine, back extension, and stabilizing the trunk during upright posture and bipedalism and ape-like vertical climbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waters and Morris, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmid, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanders, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). <italic>Psoas major</italic> acts with <italic>iliacus</italic> as a powerful flexor of the thigh and trunk, while <italic>quadratus lumborum</italic> is a trunk extensor and a lateral flexor of the vertebral column and pelvis unilaterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drake et al., 2019</xref>).

For both great apes and male and female humans, 95% prediction intervals of the mean (1.96 * standard deviation) were calculated for each vertebral level and for the combined wedging values.</p><p>Inter-articular facet spacing was measured across the lateral borders of the IAF of lumbar vertebrae three levels apart: on the last lumbar vertebra and on L1 in great apes with four lumbar vertebrae and on L2 in hominins. This is done to estimate the difference in inter-articular facet width at upper and lower lumbar levels and thus quantify neural arch configuration. Due to preservation, this measurement was estimated from the SAF of the L3 vertebra and/or the sacrum in a selection of fossils (A.L. 288–1, Sts 14). In instances of partial preservation, the relevant adjacent elements were articulated to estimate the measurement (MH2, StW 431; KNM-WT 15000). An index was created by dividing the last lumbar-sacrum interarticular facet mediolateral width by that of the upper lumbar vertebrae.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>3D reconstruction and geometric morphometric analysis</title><p>For 3D GM analyses, we used subsets of middle lumbar vertebrae that were scanned at the aforementioned institutions using an Artec Space Spider 3D scanner (Source Graphics, Anaheim, CA). The middle lumbar vertebra of hominins with five lumbar vertebrae is the third lumbar vertebra, and that of chimpanzees and gorillas with three lumbar vertebrae is L2. Many chimpanzees and bonobos, western gorillas, and orangutans have four lumbar vertebrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Williams et al., 2019</xref>), and we use L2 in these individuals as well for consistency. Thirty-six modern humans, 28 chimpanzees, 26 western gorillas, and 8 orangutans were included. For this analysis, we also utilized a sample of 23 bonobos (<italic>Pan paniscus</italic>) and 7 eastern gorillas (<italic>G. beringei</italic>).</p><p>U.W.88–233 is a complete third lumbar vertebra, but it is partially encased in breccia, which obscures some morphologies. The lumbar new vertebrae (U.W.88-232-234) were µCT scanned in partial articulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) at the University of the Witwatersrand using a Nikon Metrology XTH 225/320 LC system. Scan settings were 70 kV, 120 μA, 1 s exposure time, and 3000 projections. Voxel size was 0.049 mm and scans included 2000 voxels. The high-resolution µCT scans were processed to yield virtual 3D models. Each vertebra was segmented using Amira 6.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). After importing µCT scan slices (TIFF files) and creating a volume stack file (.am), an <italic>Edit New Label Field</italic> module was attached to the stack file. Voxels were selected and assigned to each model separately using the <italic>magic wand</italic> and <italic>brush</italic> tools after verification in all three orthogonal views. A <italic>Generate Surface</italic> module was used to produce a <italic>labels</italic> file (.labels.am) once an individual element was completely selected. A 3D surface model was created from the <italic>labels</italic> file using an unconstrained smoothing setting of 5. Models of each element were then saved as polygon (.ply) files. Using GeoMagic Studio software (3D Systems, Rock Hill, SC), broken portions of U.W.88–233 were refitted and the specimen was reconstructed accordingly. The affected portions of the neural arch were pulled dorsally to refit the fractured portion of the left lamina; additionally, the broken and deflected costal process was refitted. The result is a reconstructed 3D model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Due to crushing of the right SAF, we collected landmarks on the left side of U.W.88–233 and our comparative sample of middle lumbar vertebrae (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Our 3D landmark set consisted of 48 landmarks distributed across the vertebra to reflect the gross morphology (Appendix 1). Landmarks were collected using the <italic>Landmarks</italic> tool in Amira on the surface model of U.W.88–233 and on 3D models of middle lumbar vertebrae produced using Artec Studio 14 software (Source Graphics, Anaheim, CA).</p><p>We used ‘geomorph’ package version 4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2021</xref>) in R version 4.0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Core Team, 2020</xref>) to carry out 3D GM analyses. The geomorph package was then used to subject the raw landmark data to GPA to correct for position, rotation, and size adjustment. The GPA shape scores were then subjected to PCA using the covariance matrix. We evaluated the effects of centroid size on shape using Procrustes distance-based ANOVA on GPA shape scores as implemented in the geomorph package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodall, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, we evaluated the effect of centroid size as a predictor of middle lumbar shape coordinates within each genus by including a genus interaction term (shape~centroid size * genus). Finally, we analyzed two datasets: one on the full set of 48 landmarks in which only complete (reconstructed) fossils (U.W.88–233, Sts 14c, Shanidar 3) were included, and one on a 37 landmark subset with 11 landmarks on the costal and spinous processes removed so that additional, less well-preserved fossils could be included (A.L. 288-1aa/ak/al, StW 431, Kebara 2).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70447-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Hauesler (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Considering that your conclusions regarding human-like bipedalism are not completely supported by your results, we ask that you state your interpretations related to the locomotor behavior of this specimen in a more cautious manner.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study aims to present new fossil remains from the lower back of one of the specimens of A. sediba (MH2). The authors identified portions of four lumbar vertebrae (L1-L4). The L3 is near complete, and they focussed most of the analyses on this vertebra.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting and valuable contribution to paleoanthropology. However, I have some major concerns that should be addressed before acceptance. In general, the methods need to be explained in more detail, and some of the analyses need to be revised. Also, another concern is that in some parts of the paper, the authors try to demonstrate that the lower back of MH2 is human-like instead of describing more neutrally these very valuable fossils. In this sense, I think this is where the authors try to do more than it is directly set up to do. If the authors want to test if the lower back of MH2 shows more or less human-like traits that might suggest a kind of bipedal locomotion, the inclusion of hypotheses to test are necessary. I will be happy to review any other versions.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Line 47: I agree based on the morphology of the fossils, that A. sediba used its lower back in a kind of bipedalism. However, the mosaic of features shown in the lower back tells us that we should be cautious to affirm that was a “human-like bipedalism”. The authors should find another way to define it, human-like bipedalism (which is an obligated or complete bipedalism) is not demonstrated here.</p><p>Lines 84-103: A figure representing the site, road, the site, etc, indicating where the fossils were found, would be very helpful to understand the context. This is necessary when new fossils are presented.</p><p>Line 110: Please, specify here the hypotheses you test in this work.</p><p>Line 116: As I comment (see below), these measurements could have been used to test/compare MH2 with other hominin fossils and extant hominids as a complementary analysis to GMM. However, I appreciate you included the measurements and the 3D digital models.</p><p>Line 141: Please clarify why do identify these vertebrae as L2 and L3. Some arguments are needed to assign anatomical identification to new fossils. If is just because they refit with the previously known vertebrae, say it, if you have other anatomical arguments, describe them.</p><p>Line 189: You have used the 95 % of confidence for other analyses (see Line 244), but here you have included the 100 % of the modern human variability. Also, morphological differences between hominins and great apes are very large and therefore, differences between modern humans and fossils can be diluted. I would suggest repeating this PCA including only modern humans and the three fossil remains with a 95% confidence ellipse. I am not saying to remove these plots from the manuscript, but an extra analysis to zoom on what is the most interesting comparative. We do not doubt that MH2 is going to plot closer to modern humans than to orangutans.</p><p>Lines 205-206: I don't agree with the statement referring to the vertebral body shape. I think the second analysis, that excluding the spinous process and transverse process, is a better proxy for analyzing differences or similarities of the vertebral shape. The results from that analysis (Lines 213-215) contradict this affirmation and suggest that the vertebral shape of U.W.88-233 (and that of Sts 14) is not within the modern human's variability. Said that I appreciate the effort of including more fossil remains in the sample.</p><p>Line 219: There exist specific functions inside geomorph package to test for allometry. This ANOVA is not enough to affirm that all the groups present the same (parallel) allometric vector. If the authors want to affirm this, please, test it properly.</p><p>Line 275: I would like to know which hypotheses are you testing here, and discuss the results of these tests in this section.</p><p>Line 276: These three characteristics are a demonstration of modern human-like morphology rather than bipedal primary adaptations. For example, Neandertals were also bipeds and did not show that degree of lumbar lordosis. I understand that a human-like lumbar morphology might suggest a similar locomotor behavior, but state that “demonstrates” is going too far.</p><p>Line 352: Analyses based on linear or angular variables, are not 2D analyses. Indeed, are univariate variables and therefore unidimensional analyses.</p><p>Line 354: High-quality what? If is a scanned 3D model, please specify the technical characteristics of it (resolution, etc.).</p><p>Lines 354-357: Please, this is the “Materials” section, be specific with the fossil remains used in this study as you do with the comparative sample. Also, indicate whether the fossil remains are a second, third, fourth, or fifth lumbar vertebra.</p><p>Line 357: Why varied among analyses?</p><p>Line 370: What do you mean by &quot;we only include well sampled chimpanzees and western gorillas from the comparative sample”? What about the other analyses, aren't they well sampled?</p><p>Line 373: Specify how (software, function) did you perform this resampling.</p><p>Line 375: Clarify why you used different vertebral elements to measure this distance.</p><p>Line 383: I guess I know why, but please, explain why you use L2 as a middle lumbar vertebra in great apes and not L3.</p><p>Lines 384-386: For the 3D analyses, did you also select exclusively those individuals with four lumbar vertebrae? Eastern gorillas have a vertebral formula of 7:13:3:6, that is, they usually have three lumbar vertebrae. Also, in Line 386, add graueri to Gorilla beringei, otherwise, that could also refer to mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei).</p><p>Line 387: Be specific with the anatomical determination of the vertebra, “U.W.88-233 is a complete third lumbar vertebra”.</p><p>Line 388: Lumbar block is not appropriated. It could be the block including the fossil lumbar vertebrae or something similar.</p><p>409: I don't think a PCA is a good method to detect outliers. Your sample includes very diverse species, and an outlier may not be detected in such a huge variability. There are other, more specific, and appropriate methods to detect outliers. Please, modify this, and apply other functions such as plotOutliers from geomorph, or find.outliers from Morpho (or any other similar to these). The latter also includes a visual interface to detect possible mistakes in landmarking that are difficult to detect simply by plotting the sample looking for outliers.</p><p>412: Do you also use geomorph to perform the PCA? I am a bit confused with the plots you obtained. Also, I never saw those wireframes to visualize shape changes. Clarify where did you get them from. In addition, why don't you use those 3D models you have to obtain a more clear and visual representation of the shape's extreme morphologies? In the list of co-authors, some researchers usually represent shape variation showing modified 3D models.</p><p>Line 412: Here I miss the goal of the regression analysis. This goes together with the lack of hypotheses to test, which could justify the methodological procedure of this work. Also, there is a very important lack of information about how this analysis was carried out. In the Results section, there is more information about the procedure than in the section “Methods” itself. Please, explain here step by step how did you perform this analysis. Also, in the Results section you mention that you grouped the species into genera pooling hominins together, but to perform a regression analysis including different species pooled into genera, previously you should remove the within-group variation.</p><p>Line 415: In the same vein, you mention you carried out two analyses. But these are not analyses themselves. You used a different number of landmark coordinates to perform different analyses, which in addition you do not mention here. Please rewrite this paragraph and explain what you did.</p><p>Line 595: Please describe the first “block” either from caudal to cranial or vice versa, but following an anatomical order. You start by the sacrum, then L5, then L4, L5 again, and finally S1.</p><p>In the second block you follow the cranial-caudal direction for describing it, please, be consistent (same for the first block).</p><p>Line 628: This is my concern about MH2 human-like vertebral body morphology. Once you remove the spinous process and the transverse processes, basically what we have is the vertebral body and the articular facets. The results indicate that australopiths are outside the modern humans' range of variation.</p><p>Lines 637-642: All this information should be in a table. It is difficult to compare and follow all the information you show here.</p><p>Line 645: Regarding the column with the values of gorillas and chimpanzees, clarify what Table are you referring to (Excel Table with the raw data for Figure 6 I guess).</p><p>Line 655: Thanks for providing all this information. This is just my point of view, and I will leave it in the hands of the AE, but I think a simple non-parametric analysis (e.g. Mann-Whitney u test) comparing these traits between extinct and extant species would have been very useful to assess specific significant differences (or similarities) between MH2 lumbar vertebrae and those of other australopiths, Neanderthals, modern humans, and great apes. The results could have (or not) demonstrate in specific traits (e.g. vertebral body) the similarities between modern humans and MH2 you propose as demonstrated by other methods (and I have my doubts after your results).</p><p>Line 856: Describe the views as in the other A, B, and C figures. Also, provide the number of the landmarks, if not all because of the lack of space, at least most of them.</p><p>Line 859: These analyses are not explained in the Methods section. Neither the obtained results. Include or remove them.</p><p>Line 860: “between U.W. 88-233 and extant and fossil middle lumbar vertebrae” Here only some of the extant species included in the sample are analyzed. Why? Specify which species you included.</p><p>Line 863: Could you please explain what is this within (Homo, Pan) (mean Procrustes distance?), or better said, the purpose of comparing that mean? Also, in this Figure 3 (B), why there is not lateral view as in Figure 3 (C)?</p><p>Line 868: Here it would be interesting to comment that both australopiths plot within the chimpanzees' range of variation, and the Neandertal within (or in the limit) of modern humans.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Please always use the correct anatomical terms according to the current version of the Terminologia anatomica. The &quot;lumbar transverse process&quot; is an erroneous, antiquated and obsolete term that needs to be replaced by &quot;costal process&quot; throughout the paper. See also Strzelec, B., Chmielewski, P.P., Gworys, B., 2017. The Terminologia Anatomica matters: examples from didactic, scientific, and clinical practice. Folia Morphologica 76, 340-347.</p><p>Likewise, the term &quot;spinal canal&quot; designates the canal that is formed by the vertebral foramina of several subsequent vertebrae for the spinal cord, but in the individual vertebra it would be termed &quot;vertebral foramen&quot;.</p><p>A more stylistic issue is the use of the colloquial term &quot;australopith&quot;. This word represents a sloppy mutilation of &quot;pithekos&quot;, the Greek word for &quot;ape&quot;. The syllable &quot;pith&quot; in australopith is nonsensical. Some people say they prefer this slang because they claim that the &quot;australopithecine&quot; would imply monophyly of the genera Australopithecus and Paranthropus. This is, however, not correct. Australopithecines is not only the English term for the former subfamily &quot;Australopithecinae&quot;, but also for the subtribe &quot;Australopithecina&quot; of modern systematics. Therefore, I strongly urge the authors to replace &quot;australopiths&quot; with &quot;australopithecines&quot;</p><p>The authors compare the morphology of the newly described, complete third lumbar vertebra U.W. 88-233 of A. sediba to the &quot;middle lumbar vertebrae&quot; of modern humans, chimpanzees and gorillas. It is for me, however, unclear, what they exactly mean with &quot;middle lumbar vertebra&quot; because australopithecines and modern humans possess on average 5 lumbar vertebrae and chimpanzees and gorillas generally have (3-) 4. Could the authors therefore shortly discuss the issue of homology and how the outcome would be affected if U.W. 88-233 and the human L3 would be compared to L2 vs. L3 in the great apes.</p><p>L213 &quot;Humans and great apes separate along PC1, which is largely explained by vertebral body height&quot;: isn't it rather vertebral wedging?</p><p>L214 &quot;U.W.88-233 and Sts 14 fall intermediately between modern humans and great apes along PC1&quot;: This should be changed to say that this applies to all australopithecines.</p><p>L237 &quot;a ventral curvature of the lumbar spine&quot;: a lordotic curve cannot be described as a ventral curvature-it is a ventrally convex curvature.</p><p>L241 &quot;sum L2-L5 wedging&quot; is awkward. Consider something like &quot;total L2-L5 wedging angle&quot;</p><p>L248 &quot;see Figure 6 caption&quot;: Unfortunately, I don't see the data for chimpanzees in in Figure 6., and also the caption to Figure 6 does not provide more relevant information. On the other hand, I don't think it is a good option to use figure captions to present additional information that is otherwise not contained within the manuscript.</p><p>L249 &quot;Patterns of change across lumbar levels demonstrate that MH2's vertebrae transition from ventral (kyphotic) wedging at the L2 (most similar to male modern humans) and L3 (most similar to female modern humans) levels to dorsal (lordotic) wedging at L4. At the L4 level MH2 is most similar to female modern humans and female…&quot;: In my opinion, inferences for a greater similarity of the vertebral wedging patterns of fossil hominins to a specific modern humans sex is overinterpreting the data. Thus, the considerable variability of these wedging patterns within modern humans needs to be taken into account. In fact, the data presented in Figure 6 suggest that both males and females transition from ventral to dorsal wedging between L3 and L4. This also relates to the quite misleading use of the 95% confidence intervals of the means in Figure 6 rather than the 95% confidence intervals of the sample data (see my comment to Figure 6).</p><p>L270 Maybe the authors can briefly discuss the functional significance of the pyramidal configuration for lumbar lordosis and cite the corresponding literature. It would also be good to discuss Oreopithecus in this context, for which a similar pyramidal configuration has been reported (Köhler, M., Moyà-Solà, S., 1997. Ape-like or hominid-like – the positional behavior of Oreopithecus bambolii reconsidered. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 94, 11747-11750.)</p><p>L288 &quot;ample surface area&quot;: isn't the length of the lever arm of the costal processes more relevant than the relatively moderate increase in surface area (if at all) compared to that of modern humans? And why do australopithecines need more powerful trunk musculature than modern humans? I also don't understand, why a cranial orientation of the costal processes should increase the &quot;moment arms and torque generation capabilities of psoas major and quadratus lumborum&quot;. Isn't the lever arm only related to its length perpendicular to the force vector? I therefore think that the cranial orientation of the costal process must have another explanation.</p><p>L290 There is no &quot;middle lumbar fascia&quot;, but the anterior and middle layers of the thoracolumbar fascia insert on the costal processes. On the other hand, the m. obliquus externus abdominis has generally no contact to the thoracolumbar fascia in modern humans as far as I know.</p><p>L295 Please rephrase. Muscles cannot &quot;support&quot; the pelvis. Support means &quot;bear all or part of the weight of something&quot;, but as muscles cannot counteract compressive forces they cannot bear weight.

Your revised article has been evaluated by 2 reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are few remaining issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>One of the issues concerns the wedging angles. The authors compare the wedging angles of the MH2 lumbar vertebrae with the 95% confidence intervals of the mean female and the mean male modern human wedging angles. Generally, these 95% confidence intervals about the means are useful if the purpose is to compare two samples and to explore whether their means are different. However, the mean values are unknown for A. sediba as a species (or any other fossil hominin species). Only those of a single A. sediba individual, MH2, are known, and a comparison of the means of A. sediba with those of modern humans is therefore unwarranted. We can only compare the MH2 specimen with the modern human sample by hypothesizing that there is no difference between A. sediba and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> for this trait in terms of the distribution of the data points of the entire species (=H1a). This means that individual data points will of course differ from the mean and form a Gaussian distribution about the hypothetical mean value. Under this assumption, the data point for A. sediba would therefore fall with a 95% probability within a certain range. This is represented by the 95% confidence interval of the sample (also known as the 95% prediction interval). Thus, the 95% prediction interval represents the range of values that likely contains the value of a new observation given the distribution of the comparative sample. This 95% prediction interval can be approximated by 2 standard deviations (more precisely, it would be 1.96×standard deviations), and the authors now also show this range in their Figure 5, but unfortunately, they do not use this interval further and do not discuss it in the text, but inappropriately base their discussion and conclusion on the 95% confidence intervals about the mean.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am satisfied that the authors have addressed most of my concerns, especially those regarding the interpretation of their results. I am also glad about the inclusion of the hypotheses, which I think help to better understand and follow the purpose of this work. The authors have explained in greater detail some methodological aspects that needed some clarification. All in this, the discussion is much more solid and coherent with the results than the previous version. In general, the authors have done a great good job. As I assessed in my first revision, these fossils are a great contribution to paleoanthropology, especially to the study of the evolution of the vertebral column in hominins. Thus, I recommend the publication of this manuscript after correcting a few details.</p><p>First, I have some doubts about one aspect of the rebuttal document:</p><p>The only point I think was not clarified in my previous revision referred to Supplementary Figure 3 (from the first version). I wrote: &quot;Line 859: These analyses are not explained in the Methods section. Neither the obtained results. Include or remove them.&quot;.</p><p>The authors have clarified that: &quot;It was in fact referenced in both the Methods (penultimate paragraph) and in the Discussion (p. 10):. In the main text, we wrote, &quot;We plotted standardized shape scores derived from a multivariate regression of shape on centroid size against centroid size to visualize shape changes (Drake and Klingenberg, 2008) (Supplementary Figure 4).&quot;</p><p>But this refers to Supplementary figure 4 (Line 868), and not to Supplementary figure 3, which corresponds with Line 859. I appreciate they clarified this part, but the analyses and results from this Supplementary Figure 3 are still not explained in the manuscript. This figure reads &quot;Procrustes distances and mean differences…&quot; but neither a reference to Procrustes distances nor to mean differences appear in the entire manuscript apart from this footnote. In the rebuttal to my concern about Line 863, which also refers to this figure, they explain in detail what this figure means, and I appreciate it, but this should also be in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript has improved in many aspects. Particularly, it is now more than a simple exploratory study, having a greater focus on hypothesis testing. However, the wrong use of statistics in the analysis and hypothesis testing of the wedging angles still represents a major issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p>Thus, the first hypothesis (H1a) of the current study is that there is no difference between the wedging angles of MH2 and modern humans, and another hypothesis, which I call H1b, is that they are distinct from extant great apes. To test hypothesis H1a, the authors compare the wedging angles of the MH2 lumbar vertebrae with the 95% confidence intervals of the mean female and the mean male modern human wedging angles. Generally, the 95% confidence intervals about the means are useful if the purpose is to compare two samples and to explore whether their means are different. However, the distribution of the wedging angles and thus their mean values are unknown for A. sediba (or any other fossil hominin species). Only those of a single A. sediba individual, MH2, are known, and a comparison of the means of A. sediba with those of modern humans is therefore not possible. We can only compare the MH2 specimen with the modern human sample by hypothesizing that there is no difference between A. sediba and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> for this trait (=H1a). Under this assumption, the data point for A.sediba would therefore fall with a 95% probability within a certain range. This is represented by the 95% confidence interval of the sample (also known as the 95% prediction interval). Thus, the 95% prediction interval represents the range of values that likely contains the value of a new observation given the distribution of the comparative sample. This 95% prediction interval can be approximated by 2 standard deviations (more precisely, it would be 1.96×standard deviations), and the authors now also show this range in their Figure 5, but unfortunately they don't use this interval further and don't discuss it within the text.</p><p>In fact, Figure 5 shows that the wedging angles of all lumbar vertebrae of MH2 fall within the 95% prediction intervals of both modern human males and females. The same is true for all other analysed fossil hominins, except for Shanidar 3 and Kebara 2, whose wedging angles of L2 fall only within the male range of the current sample. Because we don't know the 95% confidence intervals about the means of the A. sediba wedging angles (or those of A. africanus, etc.), it is irrelevant whether MH2 (or Sts 14 or StW 431) lies closer to the female or the male means of modern humans for some vertebrae, as they are only some individuals. The corresponding sections in the text (L316-319 and L350-366) should therefore be rephrased accordingly. Likewise, the right side of Figure 5 needs to be adapted to show the 95% prediction intervals rather the 95% confidence intervals of the means.</p><p>Hypothesis H1b (that the wedging angles of MH2 are distinct from extant great apes) is only marginally addressed as far as I can see. Thus, wedging angles are only reported in Table 2 for chimpanzees (and thus only for one of three great ape genera). Nevertheless, it seems that the wedging angles of vertebrae L2-L4 of MH2 are well within the 95% prediction intervals for chimpanzees (as approximated by the means {plus minus} 2 SD). Does this therefore mean that lumbar lordosis of MH2 or other fossil hominins cannot statistically be differentiated from that of chimpanzees? Can the authors expand on this? It also would be helpful if the means and the 95% prediction intervals for chimpanzees (and if possible gorillas and orangutans) are included in figure 5 (or in an additional figure).</p><p>Regarding my suggestion to include KNM-WT 15000 into the study, I agree with the authors that this is not so easy for the 3D GM analyses due to its subadult age. However, I still maintain that the addition of KNM-WT 15000 would be fundamental to the interpretation of the wedging angles as it shows that the strong lordotic wedging of L5 is not exceptional in MH2 and Kebara 2 (see Schiess et al. 2014). The subadult age of KNM-WT 15000 explains of course the missing vertebral ring apophyses, but this does not affect the wedging angles of the vertebral bodies since the ring apophyses are flat.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70447.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study aims to present new fossil remains from the lower back of one of the specimens of A. sediba (MH2). The authors identified portions of four lumbar vertebrae (L1-L4). The L3 is near complete, and they focussed most of the analyses on this vertebra.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting and valuable contribution to paleoanthropology. However, I have some major concerns that should be addressed before acceptance. In general, the methods need to be explained in more detail, and some of the analyses need to be revised. Also, another concern is that in some parts of the paper, the authors try to demonstrate that the lower back of MH2 is human-like instead of describing more neutrally these very valuable fossils. In this sense, I think this is where the authors try to do more than it is directly set up to do. If the authors want to test if the lower back of MH2 shows more or less human-like traits that might suggest a kind of bipedal locomotion, the inclusion of hypotheses to test are necessary. I will be happy to review any other versions.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s time in providing detailed comments and lending their time to help improve our manuscript. We think their requests are reasonable (although we think poor word choice on our part is to blame rather than our desire to “try” to make MH2 look more human-like, and we have made changes where appropriate), and we have explained the methods in more detail and revised the analyses and presentation of results as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Line 47: I agree based on the morphology of the fossils, that A. sediba used its lower back in a kind of bipedalism. However, the mosaic of features shown in the lower back tells us that we should be cautious to affirm that was a “human-like bipedalism”. The authors should find another way to define it, human-like bipedalism (which is an obligated or complete bipedalism) is not demonstrated here.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point the reviewer makes here and think our use of “human-like” was misunderstood. We clarify that we do not think MH2 or any early hominin engaged in modern human-like bipedalism. Instead, we were mainly referring to “human-like” bipedalism to contrast with ape-like bipedalism. Our comparisons of MH2 to modern humans are done because we are the only extant hominins for which we can gather large samples to compare to fossil hominins. We fully agree that MH2 and other early hominins were not fully modern human-like in bipedalism; in fact, we suspect that many modern human adaptations have to do with endurance walking and even running, which would be absent in tree-climbing early hominins like <italic>A. sediba</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 84-103: A figure representing the site, road, the site, etc, indicating where the fossils were found, would be very helpful to understand the context.

Some arguments are needed to assign anatomical identification to new fossils. If is just because they refit with the previously known vertebrae, say it, if you have other anatomical arguments, describe them.</p></disp-quote><p>It is based in part of their morphology, but largely on the fact that they refit with known elements, the penultimate lumbar vertebra of MH2, which is preserved in articulation with the ultimate lumbar vertebra and the sacrum. In other words, the morphology of the new vertebrae does not contradict their apparent numeration and association with previously known lower lumbar vertebrae. We have made this more clear in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 189: You have used the 95 % of confidence for other analyses (see Line 244), but here you have included the 100 % of the modern human variability. Also, morphological differences between hominins and great apes are very large and therefore, differences between modern humans and fossils can be diluted. I would suggest repeating this PCA including only modern humans and the three fossil remains with a 95% confidence ellipse. I am not saying to remove these plots from the manuscript, but an extra analysis to zoom on what is the most interesting comparative. We do not doubt that MH2 is going to plot closer to modern humans than to orangutans.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We repeated the 3D GM analysis using only humans with the ‘geomorph’ package version 4.0 in R version 4.0.2. The patterns observed along the first two principal components are very similar to the patterns we detected along PC1 and PC4 in our original analysis (Figure 7c; Figure 7—figure supplement 2).

I think the second analysis, that excluding the spinous process and transverse process, is a better proxy for analyzing differences or similarities of the vertebral shape.

Said that I appreciate the effort of including more fossil remains in the sample.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the spinous and costal processes are driving a lot of the variation in the first PCA and we should focus on the second PCA (without those processes) for vertebral body differences. We have modified the text to reflect the points the reviewer has made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 219: There exist specific functions inside geomorph package to test for allometry. This ANOVA is not enough to affirm that all the groups present the same (parallel) allometric vector. If the authors want to affirm this, please, test it properly.</p></disp-quote><p>In general, analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression, but it enables one to examine and partition variance in a response variable in a more intuitive way given that we can examine the extent to which predictor variables (e.g., centroid size) “soak up” variance in a response variable (i.e., lumbar vertebra shape) by examining the <italic>F</italic> statistic, mean square, sum of squares, and residual sum of squares. Both ANOVA and OLS fall under the umbrella of linear modeling.</p><p>The only way to test for the effects of centroid size on shape (i.e., “allometry”) in the geomorph package is through the use of the procD.lm function (which can be expanded to include a phylogenetic tree as a variance-covariance matrix in the error term of the linear model in a large comparative study using the function ‘procD.pgls’). According to the geomorph package.PDF: “Prior to geomorph 3.0.0, the function, plotAllometry, was used to perform linear regression of shape variables and size, and produce plots to visualize shape allometries. […] This function coalesces a few plotting options found in other functions, as a wrapper, for the purpose of retaining the plot.procD.allometry options in one place.”</p><p>We used the function ‘procD.lm’ in geomorph to evaluate the effect of centroid size on lumbar shape with a genus interaction (i.e., testing whether the estimated effect of centroid size on lumbar shape differed by genus). This function uses an approach that is known as a Procrustes ANOVA (Goodall, 1991), which is equivalent to distance-based ANOVA designs (Anderson, 2001). Another way to interpret the inclusion of the interaction term into the model is that in a simpler univariate model (i.e., response variable ~ predictor variable), the slope and intercept would be estimated separately for each genus. As reported in the manuscript, “The results show significant effects of centroid size (F = 9.83; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), genus (with hominins pooled; F = 27.7; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and an interaction between genus and centroid size (F = 1.48; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), implying unique shape allometries within genera (Table 4).” In other words, we found that centroid size predicts shape changes in lumbar vertebrae across each genus, and that the way in which shape changes according to changes in centroid size differs across each group. We did not find support for the hypothesis that the “allometric” changes are the same (which <italic>could</italic> be, but do not necessarily have to be, represented by parallel “allometric vectors”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 275: I would like to know which hypotheses are you testing here, and discuss the results of these tests in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added hypotheses throughout the manuscript.

First, wireframes display shape changes in <italic>landmarks</italic> directly, whereas the use of a 3D model involves interpolating the parts of the 3D model that were not explicitly quantified using landmarks. Second, the use of wireframes is also somewhat more practical since we would have to mirror the landmarks and the 3D template mesh to produce warped models.

This is just my point of view, and I will leave it in the hands of the AE, but I think a simple non-parametric analysis (e.g. Mann-Whitney u test) comparing these traits between extinct and extant species would have been very useful to assess specific significant differences (or similarities) between MH2 lumbar vertebrae and those of other australopiths, Neanderthals, modern humans, and great apes. The results could have (or not) demonstrate in specific traits (e.g. vertebral body) the similarities between modern humans and MH2 you propose as demonstrated by other methods (and I have my doubts after your results).</p></disp-quote><p>I understand why the reviewer would request such analyses, but they would be extraordinarily numerous – each of the 31 measurements would need to be compared in pairwise group comparisons (Mann-Whitney U test is a two sample test to my knowledge; Kruskall-Wallis would be the appropriate non-parametric test for multiple groups, but even still, 31 test would need to be run to include all measurements) – and more significantly, they would either need to be corrected for body mass (i.e., using estimated body mass or a geometric mean of some measurements, both of which are somewhat problematic) or would be largely arbitrary comparisons since of course MH2 and other female <italic>Australopithecus</italic> are smaller than gorillas, humans, and even chimpanzees in most measurements. Multivariate analyses that adjust data for size (i.e., Procrustes analysis in 3D GM, which we employ in our paper) are one way of circumventing the problematic nature of numerous univariate comparisons among groups characterized by size differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 856: Describe the views as in the other A, B, and C figures.

Some people say they prefer this slang because they claim that the &quot;australopithecine&quot; would imply monophyly of the genera Australopithecus and Paranthropus. This is, however, not correct. Australopithecines is not only the English term for the former subfamily &quot;Australopithecinae&quot;, but also for the subtribe &quot;Australopithecina&quot; of modern systematics.

Given this reviewer’s requests and those of the other reviewer, we have converted these statistics to table form. Table 2 now shows all of the summary statistics so that the reader can appreciate the high variation in wedging angles within groups (human males and females and chimpanzees). Regarding Figure 6 itself, we only include chimpanzees in the combined wedging angle column. There are two reasons for this: (1) the figure shows L2-L5, whereas the elements represented by chimpanzees are necessarily L1-L4 (they do not have L5, and we excluded chimpanzees with just three lumbar vertebrae); and (2) if we include chimpanzee 95% confidence intervals and/or other elements (full range of variation for extant taxa), the figure becomes very busy and not easily readable. We prefer it this way and make it very clear that what are presented in the figure are confidence intervals, not the full range of variation. Additionally, Table 3 (formerly the figure caption) includes the standard deviation and range of the data – for both humans and chimpanzees at individual and combined levels – and our Source Data files contain all of the wedging angle data for individual specimens, so the reader can examine these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L249 &quot;Patterns of change across lumbar levels demonstrate that MH2's vertebrae transition from ventral (kyphotic) wedging at the L2 (most similar to male modern humans) and L3 (most similar to female modern humans) levels to dorsal (lordotic) wedging at L4. At the L4 level MH2 is most similar to female modern humans and female…&quot;: In my opinion, inferences for a greater similarity of the vertebral wedging patterns of fossil hominins to a specific modern humans sex is overinterpreting the data. Thus, the considerable variability of these wedging patterns within modern humans needs to be taken into account. In fact, the data presented in Figure 6 suggest that both males and females transition from ventral to dorsal wedging between L3 and L4. This also relates to the quite misleading use of the 95% confidence intervals of the means in Figure 6 rather than the 95% confidence intervals of the sample data (see my comment to Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s point is well taken. In fact, males and females are not significantly different at the L3-5 levels, which can be appreciated by the overlap of 95% confidence intervals of the mean. We have left the 95% CIs so readers can appreciate this, but we have also added in 2 standard deviations of the mean. At L2 and in combined wedging, human males and females are significantly different, apparent from non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. We strongly prefer to show 95% CIs of the mean along with 2 standard deviations of the mean for that reason. We also report the standard deviation and range of all the data in Table 2 so that readers understand that the data are characterized by a high degree of variation. NOTE: we caught a mistake in the original figure and corrected it in the revision. Although our data in Source Data were correct, we used incorrect data for the combined wedging values for Neandertals. Although their positions do not change much, they are different now.

Generally, the 95% confidence intervals about the means are useful if the purpose is to compare two samples and to explore whether their means are different. However, the distribution of the wedging angles and thus their mean values are unknown for A. sediba (or any other fossil hominin species). Only those of a single A. sediba individual, MH2, are known, and a comparison of the means of A. sediba with those of modern humans is therefore not possible. We can only compare the MH2 specimen with the modern human sample by hypothesizing that there is no difference between A. sediba and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> for this trait (=H1a). Under this assumption, the data point for A.sediba would therefore fall with a 95% probability within a certain range. This is represented by the 95% confidence interval of the sample (also known as the 95% prediction interval). Thus, the 95% prediction interval represents the range of values that likely contains the value of a new observation given the distribution of the comparative sample. This 95% prediction interval can be approximated by 2 standard deviations (more precisely, it would be 1.96×standard deviations), and the authors now also show this range in their Figure 5, but unfortunately they don't use this interval further and don't discuss it within the text.</p><p>In fact, Figure 5 shows that the wedging angles of all lumbar vertebrae of MH2 fall within the 95% prediction intervals of both modern human males and females. The same is true for all other analysed fossil hominins, except for Shanidar 3 and Kebara 2, whose wedging angles of L2 fall only within the male range of the current sample. Because we don't know the 95% confidence intervals about the means of the A. sediba wedging angles (or those of A. africanus, etc.), it is irrelevant whether MH2 (or Sts 14 or StW 431) lies closer to the female or the male means of modern humans for some vertebrae, as they are only some individuals. The corresponding sections in the text (L316-319 and L350-366) should therefore be rephrased accordingly. Likewise, the right side of Figure 5 needs to be adapted to show the 95% prediction intervals rather the 95% confidence intervals of the means.</p><p>Hypothesis H1b (that the wedging angles of MH2 are distinct from extant great apes) is only marginally addressed as far as I can see. Thus, wedging angles are only reported in Table 2 for chimpanzees (and thus only for one of three great ape genera). Nevertheless, it seems that the wedging angles of vertebrae L2-L4 of MH2 are well within the 95% prediction intervals for chimpanzees (as approximated by the means {plus minus} 2 SD). Does this therefore mean that lumbar lordosis of MH2 or other fossil hominins cannot statistically be differentiated from that of chimpanzees? Can the authors expand on this? It also would be helpful if the means and the 95% prediction intervals for chimpanzees (and if possible gorillas and orangutans) are included in figure 5 (or in an additional figure).</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively revised this figure and removed the 95% CIs. To accommodate great apes and 95% PIs for all extant groups, we split Figure 5 into a main figure and two supplementary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding my suggestion to include KNM-WT 15000 into the study, I agree with the authors that this is not so easy for the 3D GM analyses due to its subadult age. However, I still maintain that the addition of KNM-WT 15000 would be fundamental to the interpretation of the wedging angles as it shows that the strong lordotic wedging of L5 is not exceptional in MH2 and Kebara 2 (see Schiess et al. 2014). The subadult age of KNM-WT 15000 explains of course the missing vertebral ring apophyses, but this does not affect the wedging angles of the vertebral bodies since the ring apophyses are flat.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added KNM-WT 15000 (the “Nariokotome Boy”) to the wedging angle figures. Please note that we have also corrected data points in the figures and in Table 3 that previously represented errors, the most major of which was our source data on combined <italic>Pan</italic> and <italic>Gorilla</italic> wedging values. We had previously inadvertently used only the last three lumbar vertebrae, whereas now we present – in the Figure 5 and its supplements and in Table 2 and its source data file – the combined value for all four lumbar vertebrae.</p></body></sub-article></article>
