The tick-borne pathogen <italic>Rickettsia parkeri</italic> elicits skin lesions (eschars) and disseminated disease in humans; however, inbred mice are generally resistant to infection. We report that intradermal infection of mice lacking both interferon receptors (<italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>;Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) with as few as 10 <italic>R</italic>. <italic>parkeri</italic> elicits eschar formation and disseminated, lethal disease. Similar to human infection, eschars exhibited necrosis and inflammation, with bacteria primarily found in leukocytes. Using this model, we find that the actin-based motility factor Sca2 is required for dissemination from the skin to internal organs, and the outer membrane protein OmpB contributes to eschar formation. Immunizing <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>;Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with <italic>sca2</italic> and <italic>ompB</italic> mutant <italic>R. parkeri</italic> protects against rechallenge, revealing live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Thus, <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>;Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are a tractable model to investigate rickettsiosis, virulence factors, and immunity. Our results further suggest that discrepancies between mouse and human susceptibility may be due to differences in interferon signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tick bites allow disease-causing microbes, including multiple species of <italic>Rickettsia</italic> bacteria, to pass from arthropods to humans.

Human disease caused by the tick-borne spotted fever group (SFG) pathogen <italic>Rickettsia parkeri</italic> is characterized by a necrotic, dry skin lesion (eschar) at the infection site, as well as generalized rash, headache, fatigue, and fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paddock et al., 2008</xref>). There is no approved vaccine for <italic>R. parkeri</italic> or for the more virulent rickettsial pathogens that can cause fatal or latent disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osterloh, 2017</xref>). Moreover, many critical aspects of disease caused by obligate cytosolic bacterial pathogens, including the mechanisms of virulence and immunity, remain unknown. <italic>R. parkeri</italic> can be handled under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions, and characterizing mouse models to recapitulate major features of human disease would enhance research efforts into understanding rickettsial pathogens and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osterloh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grasperge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sunyakumthorn et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>R. parkeri</italic> is genetically similar to the more virulent human pathogens <italic>R. rickettsii</italic> and <italic>R. conorii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roux and Raoult, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goddard, 2009</xref>), and it can be handled under BSL2 conditions. Moreover, mutants can be generated using transposon mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamason et al., 2018</xref>), and small rodents including mice have been found as seropositive for <italic>R. parkeri</italic> in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moraru et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moraru et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krawczak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbieri et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, a mouse model for <italic>R. parkeri</italic> that recapitulates key features of human infection would greatly enhance investigations into understanding rickettsial disease. However, inbred mice including C57BL/6 and BALB/c develop no or minor skin lesions upon intradermal (i.d.) infection with <italic>R. parkeri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grasperge et al., 2012</xref>). Strategies to develop a mouse model<italic>,</italic> including infecting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grasperge et al., 2012</xref>), delivering high doses of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Londoño et al., 2019</xref>), and delivering <italic>R. parkeri</italic> via a tick vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saito et al., 2019</xref>), have been examined. However, a model that recapitulates eschar formation and dissemination via needle inoculation with low doses of <italic>R. parkeri</italic> has remained elusive. A mouse model for <italic>R. parkeri</italic> that mimics eschar formation and disseminated disease in C57BL/6 mice, the most widely used genetic background with a large variety of available mutants, would aid investigations into rickettsial virulence mechanisms, the host response to infection, and spotted fever disease.</p><p>Toward better understanding the host response to <italic>R. parkeri</italic> infection, we recently investigated the relationship between <italic>R. parkeri</italic> and interferons (IFNs), which are ubiquitous signaling molecules of the innate immune system that mobilize the cytosol to an antimicrobial state. Type I IFN (IFN-I) generally restricts viral replication, whereas IFN-γ generally restricts intracellular bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raniga and Liang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billiau and Matthys, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meunier and Broz, 2016</xref>). We observed that mice lacking either gene encoding the receptors for IFN-I (<italic>Ifnar1</italic>) or IFN-γ (<italic>Ifngr1</italic>) are resistant to i.v. infection with <italic>R. parkeri</italic>, whereas double knockout (DKO) <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>;Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice succumb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2020</xref>). This demonstrates that IFNs redundantly protect against systemic <italic>R. parkeri</italic>. However, the i.v. infection route does not recapitulate eschar formation and i.d. infection may more closely mimic infection by tick bite. Further investigations into whether IFNs redundantly protect against <italic>R. parkeri</italic> in the skin may improve the mouse model for SFG <italic>Rickettsia</italic>.</p><p>A robust mouse model would facilitate investigations into conserved rickettsial virulence factors, whose role in pathogenesis in vivo remain poorly understood. One virulence mechanism shared by divergent cytosolic bacterial pathogens including <italic>Rickettsia, Listeria, Burkholderia, Mycobacterium,</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> species is the ability to undergo actin-based motility, which facilitates cell to cell spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choe and Welch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lamason and Welch, 2017</xref>). However, the pathogenic role for many actin-based motility factors in vivo remains unknown. <italic>R. parkeri</italic> actin-based motility differs from that of other pathogens in that it occurs in two phases. The first phase requires the RickA protein, which elicits actin-based motility by activating the host Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gouin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeng et al., 2004</xref>); however, RickA is dispensable for cell to cell spread in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reed et al., 2014</xref>). The second phase requires the Sca2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kleba et al., 2010</xref>), which mimics eukaryotic formins to directly nucleate and elongate actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haglund et al., 2010</xref>). Sca2 is required for efficient cell to cell spread<italic>,</italic> although it is not required for replication in epithelial cells or for avoiding antimicrobial autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kleba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haglund et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engström et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>sca2</italic> mutant <italic>R. rickettsii</italic> elicit reduced fever in guinea pigs when compared with wild-type (WT) <italic>R. rickettsii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kleba et al., 2010</xref>), yet the explanation for reduced fever and the pathogenic role for Sca2 in vivo remains unclear. Additionally, Sca2 is not essential for dissemination of <italic>R. parkeri</italic> within ticks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A second virulence strategy employed by intracellular pathogens is the ability to avoid autophagy, which for <italic>R. parkeri</italic> requires the abundant, conserved outer membrane protein B (OmpB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engström et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engström et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>ompB</italic> mutant <italic>R. parkeri</italic> are ubiquitylated and restricted by antimicrobial autophagy in mouse macrophages, and OmpB is important for <italic>R. parkeri</italic> infection of internal organs in WT mice and for causing lethal disease in IFN receptor-deficient mice after i.v. infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engström et al., 2019</xref>). However, the role for <italic>R. parkeri</italic> OmpB upon i.d. infection remains unknown. An improved mouse model may improve our understanding of how conserved virulence factors including Sca2 and OmpB enhance rickettsial pathogenesis.</p><p>Here, we use IFN receptor-deficient mice to examine the effects of i.d. inoculation of <italic>R. parkeri</italic>, mimicking the natural route of infection. We observe skin lesions that appear similar to human eschars, as well as disseminated lethal disease with as few as 10 bacteria. Using this model, we find that Sca2 promotes dissemination and is required for causing lethality and that OmpB contributes to eschar formation and to lethal disease. We demonstrate that immunization with <italic>sca2</italic> or <italic>ompB</italic> mutant <italic>R. parkeri</italic> protects IFN receptor-deficient mice against subsequent challenge with WT bacteria, revealing live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Our study establishes a mouse model to investigate numerous aspects of <italic>Rickettsia</italic> pathogenesis, including eschar formation, virulence factors, and immunity. More broadly, this work also reveals that a potent, redundant IFN response protects mice from eschar-associated rickettsiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>;<italic>Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are susceptible to eschar-associated rickettsiosis</title><p>We sought to develop an i.d. murine infection model to better recapitulate the natural route of tick-borne <italic>R. parkeri</italic> infection.

However, the contribution made by IFN-I in restricting <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species besides <italic>R. parkeri</italic> in mice remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osterloh, 2017</xref>). Importantly, the gross similarities we observe between human eschars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paddock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herrick et al., 2016</xref>) and skin lesions in <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>;Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may indicate that the IFN response in humans is less well adapted to control <italic>R. parkeri</italic> than that in mice.

Future investigations into the ISGs that restrict <italic>R. parkeri</italic> in mouse versus human cells may improve our understanding of human susceptibility to SFG <italic>Rickettsia</italic>.</p><p>Human eschars resulting from <italic>R. parkeri</italic> infection are characterized by necrosis of the epidermis, vasculitis of small- to medium-sized dermal vessels, fibrin thrombi, infiltration by macrophages and neutrophils, and infection of macrophage/mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paddock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herrick et al., 2016</xref>). Eschars elicited by <italic>R. parkeri</italic> in non-human primates revealed similar histological findings and also bacteria within macrophages and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banajee et al., 2015</xref>). Similar histological findings were noted in guinea pigs after intraperitoneal infection with <italic>R. parkeri,</italic> as well as infection of mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Paddock et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>;Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we observed necrosis, vasculitis, fibrin thrombi, and rickettsial staining that coincided primarily with infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils.

One contrasting finding in eschars of <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>;Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice as compared to humans is the number of bacteria observed - we find that the pathogen is numerous throughout the skin of <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>;Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, but their numbers are fewer in reported human eschar biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paddock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herrick et al., 2016</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to differences in infection kinetics or in interferon-mediated restriction of bacteria. Nevertheless, our pathological findings of infected interferon-receptor deficient mice are similar in many ways to the previous findings in humans, primates, and mice. Our results suggest that interferon receptor-deficient mice may be useful tools for modeling eschar-associated rickettsiosis at the cellular level.</p><p>Investigating the IFN response in the skin may also lead to a better understanding of other arthropod-borne diseases. One example may be scrub typhus, caused by <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rajapakse et al., 2017</xref>), a prevalent but poorly understood tropical disease endemic to Southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richards and Jiang, 2020</xref>). <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> elicits eschar formation in humans, but inbred mice do not recapitulate eschar formation during <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sunyakumthorn et al., 2013</xref>), similar to <italic>R. parkeri</italic>. A second example may be <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, a tick-borne pathogen that causes a skin rash at the site of tick bite as a hallmark feature of Lyme disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bratton et al., 2008</xref>), the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bratton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwartz et al., 2008</xref>).

Lastly, other rickettsial pathogens including <italic>R. conorii, R. typhi,</italic> and <italic>R. akari</italic> cause no or limited disease in WT C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osterloh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Osterman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eisemann et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Osterloh et al., 2016</xref>) and it remains unclear if interferons redundantly protect mice from these pathogens. Further investigations into how IFNs protect the skin from arthropod-borne pathogens may reveal critical aspects of the innate immune response to zoonotic disease.</p><p>Our study further highlights the utility of mouse models that mimic natural routes of infection. Our observation that i.d. infection can cause lethal disease with as few as 10 bacteria, ~ 10,000 fewer bacteria than i.v. infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2020</xref>), suggests that <italic>R. parkeri</italic> may be highly adapted to reside in the skin. However, this model could be further improved by investigating the role for tick vector components in pathogenesis. Saliva from ticks, mosquitos, and sand flies enhances pathogenesis of arthropod-borne bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pingen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lestinova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Šimo et al., 2017</xref>), and non-human primates inoculated with <italic>R. parkeri</italic> exhibit altered inflammatory responses when administered after tick-bite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banajee et al., 2015</xref>). This may suggest a potential role for tick vector components such as tick saliva in <italic>R. parkeri</italic> pathogenesis. Developing improved murine infection models that mimic the natural route of infection, including with tick saliva or the tick vector, is critical to better understand the virulence and transmission of tick-borne pathogens.</p><p>Many <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species, as well as many facultative cytosolic pathogens including <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, undergo actin-based motility to spread from cell to cell. For <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, the actin-based motility factor ActA enables the pathogen to survive in vivo, as <italic>actA</italic> mutant bacteria are over 1,000-fold attenuated by measuring lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goossens et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brundage et al., 1993</xref>) and by enumerating bacteria in spleens and livers of mice after i.v. infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auerbuch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Le Monnier et al., 2007</xref>). However, the pathogenic role for actin-based motility in the Rickettsiae has remained unclear. We find that Sca2 is not required for intracellular survival in organs upon i.v. infection of <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>;Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, but rather, is required for dissemination from skin to internal organs and lethality upon i.d. infection. Consistent with an important role for Sca2 in pathogenesis, a previous study reported that i.v. infection of guinea pigs with <italic>sca2</italic> mutant <italic>R. rickettsii</italic> did not elicit fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kleba et al., 2010</xref>). Our results suggest that Sca2-mediated actin-based motility by <italic>Rickettsia</italic> may facilitate dissemination in host reservoirs, although we cannot rule out other roles for Sca2 that do not involve actin assembly. <italic>R. prowazekii</italic> and <italic>R. typhi</italic>, which cause severe human disease, encode a fragmented <italic>sca2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ngwamidiba et al., 2005</xref>), and undergo no or dramatically reduced frequency of actin-based motility, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teysseire et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinzen et al., 1993</xref>). Although it remains unclear why some <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species lost the ability to undergo actin-based motility, Sca2 is dispensable for <italic>R. parkeri</italic> dissemination in the tick vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that actin-based motility may play a specific role in dissemination within mammalian hosts.</p><p>We find that <italic>sca2</italic> or <italic>ompB</italic> mutant <italic>R. parkeri</italic> elicit a robust protective immune response in <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup>;Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. These findings complement previous observations that <italic>sca2</italic> mutant <italic>R. rickettsii</italic> elicits antibody responses in guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kleba et al., 2010</xref>), and expands upon these findings by demonstrating protection from rechallenge and revealing additional vaccine candidates. There are currently limited vaccine candidates that protect against rickettsial disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osterloh, 2017</xref>). Identifying new vaccine candidates may reveal avenues to protect against tick-borne infections and aerosolized <italic>Rickettsia</italic>, which are extremely virulent and potential bioterrorism agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walker, 2009</xref>), as well as against Brill-Zinsser disease, caused by latent <italic>R. prowazekii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osterloh, 2017</xref>). Future studies exploring whether attenuated <italic>R. parkeri</italic> mutants provide immunity against other <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species are warranted to better define the mechanisms of protection. These findings on immunity may also help develop <italic>R. parkeri</italic> as an antigen delivery platform. <italic>R. parkeri</italic> resides directly in the host cytosol for days and could potentially be engineered to secrete foreign antigens for presentation by major histocompatibility complex I. In summary, the mouse model described here will facilitate future investigations into numerous aspects of <italic>R. parkeri</italic> infection, including actin-based motility and immunity, and may serve as model for other arthropod-borne pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT C57Bl/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson labs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #: 000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DKO <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>Ifngr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson labs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #: 029098</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.129S2-<italic>Ifnar1<sup>tm1Agt</sup></italic>/Mmjax; aka <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson labs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #: 32045-JAX</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MMRRC_032045-JAX">MMRRC_032045-JAX</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.129S7-<italic>Ifngr1<sup>tm1Agt</sup></italic>/J; aka<italic>Ifngr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson labs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #: 003288</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">I7205 anti-<italic>Rickettsia</italic> (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. Ted Hackstadt</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:1000);IF (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Rickettsia parkeri</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT <italic>R. parkeri</italic> strain Portsmouth</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Originally from Dr. Chris Paddock (CDC)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Rickettsia parkeri</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Sca2</italic>::Tn <italic>R. parkeri</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Welch lab (UC Berkeley)PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24361066/">24361066</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Rickettsia parkeri</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>OmpB</italic>::Tn<sup>STOP</sup><italic>R. parkeri</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Welch lab (UC Berkeley)PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31611642/">31611642</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial preparations</title><p><italic>R. parkeri</italic> strain Portsmouth was originally obtained from Dr. Christopher Paddock (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

Bacterial suspensions were kept on ice during injections. For i.d. infections, mice were anaesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane via inhalation. The right flank of each mouse was shaved with a hair trimmer (Braintree CLP-41590), wiped with 70% ethanol, and 50 µl of bacterial suspension in PBS was injected intradermally using a 30.5-gauge needle. Mice were monitored for ~3 min until they were fully awake. No adverse effects were recorded from anesthesia. For i.v. infections, mice were exposed to a heat lamp while in their cages for approximately 5 min and then each mouse was moved to a mouse restrainer (Braintree, TB-150 STD). The tail was sterilized with 70% ethanol, and 200 µl of bacterial suspension in sterile PBS was injected using 30.5-gauge needles into the lateral tail vein. Body temperatures were monitored using a rodent rectal thermometer (BrainTree Scientific, RET-3).</p><p>For fluorescent dextran experiments, mice were intravenously injected with 150 µl of 10 kDa dextran conjugated with Alexa Fluor 680 (D34680; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in sterile PBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glasner et al., 2017</xref>). As a negative control, mice with no <italic>R. parkeri</italic> infection were injected with fluorescent dextran. As an additional negative control, uninfected mice were injected intravenously with PBS instead of fluorescent dextran. At 2 hr post-injection, mice were euthanized with CO<sub>2</sub> and cervical dislocation, doused with 70% ethanol, and skin surrounding the injection site (approximately 2 cm in each direction) was removed. Connective tissue between the skin and peritoneum was removed, and skin was placed hair-side-up on a 15 cm Petri dish. Skin was imaged with an LI-COR Odyssey CLx (LI-COR Biosciences), and fluorescence was quantified using ImageStudioLite v5.2.5. The skin from mice with no injected fluorescent dextran was used as the background measurement. Skin from mice injected with fluorescent dextran but no <italic>R. parkeri</italic> was normalized to an arbitrary number (100), and <italic>R. parkeri-</italic>infected samples were normalized to this value (<italic>R. parkeri-</italic>infected/uninfected × 100). The number of pixels at the injection site area was maintained across experiments (7,800 for small area and 80,000 for the large area).</p><p>All mice in this study were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease throughout the course of infection, such as hunched posture, lethargy, scruffed fur, paralysis, facial edema, and lesions on the skin of the flank and tail. If any such manifestations were observed, mice were monitored for changes in body weight and temperature. If a mouse displayed severe signs of infection, as defined by a reduction in body temperature below 90°F or an inability to move normally, the animal was immediately and humanely euthanized using CO<sub>2</sub> followed by cervical dislocation, according to IACUC-approved procedures. Pictures of skin and tail lesions were obtained with permission from the Animal Care and Use Committee Chair and the Office of Laboratory and Animal Care. Pictures were captured with an Apple iPhone 8, software v13.3.1.</p><p>For harvesting spleens and livers, mice were euthanized at the indicated pre-determined times and doused with ethanol. Mouse organs were extracted and deposited into 50 ml conical tubes containing 4 ml sterile cold PBS for the spleen and 8 ml PBS for the liver. Organs were kept on ice and were homogenized for ~10 s using an immersion homogenizer (Fisher, Polytron PT 2500E) at ~22,000 r.p.m. Organ homogenates were spun at 290 g for 5 min to pellet the cell debris (Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge). Twenty microliters of organ homogenates was then serial diluted into 12-well plates containing confluent Vero cells. The plates were then spun at 260 g for 5 min at room temperature (Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge) and incubated at 33°C. To reduce the possibility of contamination, organ homogenates were plated in duplicate and the second replicate was treated with 50 µg/ml carbenicillin (Sigma) and 200 µg/ml amphotericin B (Gibco). The next day, at approximately 16 h.p.i., the cells were gently washed by replacing the existing media with 1 ml DMEM containing 2% FBS (GemCell). The media were then aspirated and replaced with 2 ml/well of DMEM containing 0.7% agarose, 5% FBS, and 200 µg/ml amphotericin B. When plaques were visible at 6 d.p.i., 1 ml of DMEM containing 0.7% agarose, 1% FBS, and 2.5% neutral red (Sigma) was added to each well, and plaques were counted at 24 h.p.i.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology</title><p>For histology, spleens and livers were harvested from infected mice and immediately stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma HT501128). Histology was performed by HistoWiz Inc (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://histowiz.com">http://histowiz.com</ext-link>) using a standard operating procedure and fully automated workflow. Samples were processed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4 μm thickness. BOND Polymer Refine Detection (Leica Biosystems) was used according to manufacturer’s protocol. After staining with hematoxylin and eosin, sections were dehydrated and film coverslipped using a TissueTek-Prisma and Coverslipper (Sakura). Whole slide scanning (40×) was performed on an Aperio AT2 (Leica Biosystems). Histological consultation was blindly performed by a pathologist. Immunohistochemistry was performed with a rabbit anti-<italic>Rickettsia</italic> I7205 antibody (1:500 dilution; gift from Ted Hackstadt).

For comparing two sets of data, a two-tailed Student’s T test was performed. For comparing two sets of in vivo p.f.u. data, Mann–Whitney U tests were used. For comparing two survival curves, log-rank (Mantel–Cox) tests were used. For comparing curves of two samples (mouse health, weight, and temperature), two-way ANOVAs were used. For two-way ANOVAs, if a mouse was euthanized prior to the statistical end point, the final value that was recorded for the mouse was repeated until the statistical endpoint. For two-way ANOVAs, if a measurement was not recorded for a timepoint, the difference between values at adjacent time points was used. Data were determined to be statistically significant when p&lt;0.05. Asterisks denote statistical significance as: *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001; ****p&lt;0.0001, compared to indicated controls. Error bars indicate standard deviation (SD) for in vitro experiments and standard error of the mean (SEM) for in vivo experiments. All other graphical representations are described in the figure legends. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad PRISM v7.0.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>None</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>none</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal research was conducted under a protocol approved by the University of California, Berkeley Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes relating to animals and experiments using animals (Welch lab animal use protocol AUP-2016-02-8426).

We also thank the reviewers for describing the study as “highly significant,” “rigorous and reliable as described and can be reproduced by others,” and as “relevant to investigators working in the field of rickettsial diseases and to a broader audience studying mechanisms of intracellular parasitism and host responses.”</p><p>As proposed in our revision plan and suggested by all three reviewers, we have now performed histology in infected wild type and in interferon receptor-deficient mice at multiple time points of multiple organs. We also performed immunohistochemistry to identify the infected cell types in the skin, brain, lung, spleen and liver. Importantly, our findings are consistent with the histological findings observed in human eschars and with the observed infection of neutrophils and macrophages in <italic>R. parkeri</italic>-infected non-human primates and in mice. We feel these experiments have improved the manuscript and added to the strong significance of our findings to the field. We have also addressed all of the additional minor points raised by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>“Rickettsial eschars are hallmarks of less severe spotted fever diseases. The underlying mechanisms involved in the formation of the eschar caused by pathogenic rickettsiae remains unknown. The authors of this manuscript studied this interesting research question by using Ifnar-/-Ifngr-/- mice and Sca2 or OmpB mutant of R. parkeri. R. parkeri probably is the best rickettsial species to study rickettsial eschar due to the clinical features of R. parkeri rickettsioses and the biosafety level required to work with it. The data presented in the manuscript are very promising. The conclusions are supported by the presented results. For the first time, this study recapitulated human eschar-like skin lesion observed in patients with R. parkeri rickettsioses in the mouse models. More interestingly, mice inoculated with Sca2 mutant of R. parkeri i.d. had less disseminated rickettsiae in tissues, which helps us to understand the mechanisms by which pathogenic rickettsiae cause systemic infection after the arthropod bite.”</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>“(1) Figure 2D, it looks likely the lethality of mice i.d. infection with R. parkeri is not dose dependent. For example, mice inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup> showed greater lethality compared to 10<sup>7</sup>. The authors might want to explain it in the Discussion.”</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in observing that the lethality between different doses of <italic>R. parkeri</italic> in <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/</sup>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice after intradermal infection is not dose dependent with the current number of mice used per group. We do not understand the reason for this, and more broadly we do not understand the mechanism of lethality. We speculate that there could be a bottleneck that limits bacterial burdens; however, answering this question will require future investigations into the mechanisms of lethality that we feel are beyond the scope of this study. To address the reviewer’s point, we now include this statement: “Degrees of lethality between different doses in <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were not significantly different from one another, and the cause of lethality in this model remains unclear.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“(2) Line 202, innate immunity in vitro might need to be revised.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the previous description was vague. We changed the description to be more specific and it now reads: “…Sca2 does not significantly enhance the ability of <italic>R. parkeri</italic> to evade interferon-stimulated genes or inflammasomes in vitro<italic>.</italic>”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“(3) It is unclear what is the unit of the inoculum in animal experiments, PFU?”</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is PFU. We have now indicated this in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“(4) Line 36, in the study of &quot;Reference 16&quot;, C3H/HeN mice, not B6 mice, were used.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this error and we have changed the text to C3H/HeN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“(5) The conclusion on eschar will be greatly strengthened if histological analysis is included, particularly whether dermis necrosis is present or not.”</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we include the results of histology on the skin of wild type and <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/</sup>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at 4, 7, and 12 d post infection (d.p.i.). We also used immunohistochemistry to identify the infected cell types. Images were blindly analyzed by Dr. Inge Langohr, a pathologist with expertise in characterizing rickettsial lesions. These experiments revealed significant epidermal and dermal necrosis, especially at 12 d.p.i., similar to what has been described in <italic>R. parkeri-</italic>infected humans and non-human primates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“(6) Line 357, it is not clear what &quot;spinfection&quot; means.”</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this to “infection” for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Several approaches employed in the study are new to the field of animal models of the rickettsioses. For example, fluorescent dextran was used to investigating the vascular damage in skin at the inoculation site; body temperature for mice infected with R. parkeri. Overall, the study is highly significant since it has answered the important questions in the research area of spotted fever rickettsioses and employed appropriate approaches. No major concerns were noticed.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating the significance of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referees cross commenting</p><p>I agree with other reviewers' comments. Thanks for the invite.”</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>“The manuscript utilizes a new model of spotted fever rickettsiosis. Using this model, the authors have determined that knockout of the sca2 or ompB gene attenuates Rickettsia parkeri, and vaccination with the attenuated rickettsiae provides protection against virulent challenge. However, the model is far less than ideal as it has eliminated important effectors of immunity.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments, and we hope to have thoroughly addressed their concerns. In regard to the effects of interferons on long-lasting immunity to <italic>R. parkeri,</italic> we note to the reviewer that we observed that immunized <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were completely and robustly protected from rechallenge. No lethality and no loss of body weight or temperature was observed after a rechallenge dose of 10x the LD-50. These data reveal that interferons are dispensable for long-lasting immunity to <italic>R. parkeri</italic> in inbred mice and are not important effectors of adaptive immunity to <italic>R. parkeri</italic>. This is thus the first model that can be used to investigate the factors required for adaptive immunity to <italic>R. parkeri</italic> in mice.</p><p>If the reviewer’s comment is not referring to long-lasting adaptive immunity to <italic>R. parkeri</italic> but is instead referring to the general concept of using immunocompromised mice as animal models, we note that immunocompromised mice are used as models for a variety of pathogens, including many <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species (reviewed in Osterloh, <italic>Med Microbiol Immunol</italic> 2017), and <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice specifically are used as models for Zika and Dengue virus infections. Unlike many other immunocompromised mice, <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice do not require maintenance on antibiotics and they have no noticeable differences to wild type mice in regard to breeding or growth, thus they are well-suited as an inbred model for <italic>R. parkeri</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Manuscript also fails to recognize that there is a Amblyomma maculatum tick transmitted model of Rickettsia parkeri infection that causes an eschar and disseminated pathology”.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer is referring to Saito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019, and we thank the reviewer for bringing this work to our attention. We had previously not acknowledged this work because we were unaware of it, as the paper did not initially appear in our PubMed searches. We now cite and discuss this work and compare our findings in light of the previous findings.</p><p>If the reviewer is instead referring to Banajee <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015, in the previous version of the manuscript in lines 266-269 we cited and acknowledged this reported tick transmission model in non-human primates.</p><p>As noted by Reviewer 3, our model with needle inoculation is significantly less time consuming and expensive than a tick transmission model. The eschars we observe in <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice appear more similar to human eschars than those reported in non-human primates (Banajee et al) or any other mouse model<italic>.</italic> Moreover, needle inoculation makes it feasible to precisely measure the number of bacteria that are administered, which is not true with ticks. Lastly, our model reveals eschars in the C57BL/6 mouse strain, which have many genetic mutants available. Thus, our model provides many significant advantages over the tick model in C3H/HeN mice or non-human primates, including cost, time, reproducibility, availability of genetic mutants, and recapitulating lesions similar to human eschars.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The model that they have used is inadequately characterized. The cutaneous lesion was not evaluated histologically to determine if it features the actual characteristics of an eschar.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. As mentioned above in the response to reviewer #1, we have now performed histology and immunohistochemistry on the skin as well as on lungs and brain of WT and <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at 4, 7, and 12 dpi following i.d. infection with different doses of <italic>R. parkeri</italic>. We also performed a similar analysis of the spleens and livers after i.v. infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Although bacteria were found in the liver and spleen, in which macrophages are significant target, there was no evaluation of the vital organs including lung and brain nor demonstration of the target cells or pathologic lesions.”</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have now performed histology and immunohistochemistry of the skin, brain, and lung to identify the infected cell types after i.d. infection. We also performed these analyses with spleens and lungs after i.v. infection. Regardless of the administrative route or the organ, neutrophils and macrophages are the primary cell types with rickettsial immunostaining. In one tissue section in the lung, bacteria appeared to be in endothelial cells.</p><p>In previous work from our lab (Engström <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019), we found that lungs of wild type mice contained similar number of infectious <italic>R. parkeri</italic> as the spleen and liver after intravenous infection. Thus, in order to be able to process more samples quickly, we did not include lungs in the experiments in which plaque forming units were quantified. In unreported data, we also found that organs including the brain, kidneys, and heart had few recoverable PFUs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Unfortunately, the assay of vascular permeability was applied only to the inoculation site and not to the disseminated visceral organs such as lung and brain.”</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the vascular permeability assay using internal organs alongside the skin; however, little/no fluorescence was observed in any sample. We were unable to distinguish differences between control groups or between control and experimental groups in organs from mice that were treated and untreated with the fluorescent dextran. Thus, we were unfortunately not able to apply the described vascular damage assay to organs other than the skin. We now indicate this in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>“The authors all have misrepresented the eschar as a critically important lesion whereas the patients usually do not even know i's presence until they began to develop systemic symptoms and it is a detected by a physician examining the patient.”</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to suggest that the eschar is either more or less critically important than other features of rickettsial disease. We simply described the eschar as a “hallmark feature” of eschar-associated rickettsiosis. Additionally, as the reviewer notes, patients report systemic symptoms, and our model elicits systemic disease by <italic>R. parkeri</italic> in mice. Thus, the model we describe recapitulates both of the disease manifestations mentioned by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“On line 30 the authors state that mice are the natural reservoir of Rickettsia parkeri. The references cited describe the failure of acquisition by feeding ticks, meaning that it is not a true reservoir. The reference describing animals with antibodies merely indicates exposure to a spotted fever group</p><p>Rickettsia not sufficient evidence of a role as a reservoir.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this important distinction and we have altered the text to read:</p><p>“…small rodents including mice have been found as seropositive for <italic>R. parkeri</italic> in the wild.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“In response to the request for my expertise, I have contributed a large amount of data to understanding mechanisms of immunity to rickettsiae and have developed several useful animal models of Rickettsial diseases. I also have expertise on clinical aspects of spotted fever group rickettsioses, including the eschar.”</p><p>Referees cross commenting</p><p>“This is not the first Mouse model of rickettsiosis to contain an eschar. There is a model of Rickettsia parkeri transmitted by Amblyomma maculatum ticks in which eschars occur.”</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above by us and also by Reviewer 3, we cited and discussed the tick transmission model in non-human primates (Banajee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015) in the Discussion. We also now cite and discuss Saito <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019. We note that the lesions we observe in <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> appear more necrotic and of similar size as the human eschars than those in reported in macaques in previous reports. Lastly, we note to the reviewer the many advantages of our i.d. infection model, including how it will make these experiments more widely accessible, more reproducible, less expensive, faster, will enable the infection of mice with various genetic modifications, and results in a skin lesion most similar to the human lesion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>“This manuscript reports novel observations pertinent to development in inbred mice of an eschar lesion and generalized lethal infection following intradermal infection with Rickettsia parkeri, the mice are deficient in two types of interferon receptors. This is a new observation for the murine system and expands the existing repertoire of model infections for tick-borne rickettsiae. This study also reports that Sca2-mediated actin-based motility is required for R. parkeri dissemination and provides indirect evidence that OmpB protein is involved in eschar formation, thus corroborating previous knowledge about these major surface exposed antigens of rickettsiae and host cell interactions and host responses to these organisms.”</p><p>“The study is rigorous and reliable as described and can be reproduced by others given availability of adequate funding, access to similar facilities, strains of mice and rickettsial mutants, and technical personnel with similar skills and training. There are no ethical or technical concerns.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comments and for appreciating the advantages of this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The main limitation of the manuscript is due to the fact that histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the eschar was not performed; therefore, it is not clear if pathological processes and features of this lesion formation are the same or related to the human pathology.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. As mentioned above in the responses to Reviewers #1 and #2, we have now performed histological and immunohistochemical analyses of the skin and internal organs and had the images blindly analyzed by Dr. Inge Langohr, a pathologist who is an expert in lesions elicited by rickettsial pathogens. The features of the lesions, including necrosis, inflammation, and infected cell types, are similar to those observed in <italic>R. parkeri-</italic>infected humans and non-human primates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Similarly, in an attempt to generalize (as the authors try very hard), it is not clear how these observations will be relevant to rickettsial pathogens which are responsible for more severe forms of rickettsioses (such as R. rickettsii and R. prowazekii) but are not known to cause eschar formation as a part of their clinical manifestations.”</p></disp-quote><p>Our findings with Sca2 are in agreement with findings in <italic>R. rickettsii</italic> Sca2 in guinea pigs (Kleba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010), which showed that Sca2 was required for eliciting fever and an antibody response. Our work also expands on these findings by showing that <italic>sca2</italic> mutants immunize against rechallenge and by finding reduced bacterial burdens in internal organs after intradermal infection with <italic>sca2</italic> mutant bacteria. Thus, we believe that studying <italic>R. parkeri</italic> genes in <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice can serve as a model to better understand conserved virulence genes in diverse rickettsial pathogens.</p><p>Beyond virulence genes, we note that our model also recapitulates systemic disease including dissemination to internal organs. Thus, it provides a platform to study disease manifestations beyond the eschar that may be relevant to other rickettsial pathogens including <italic>R. rickettsii</italic> and <italic>R. prowazekii</italic>.</p><p>Some other virulent rickettsial pathogens cause limited/no disease in WT C57BL/6 mice, including <italic>R. akari, R. conorii, R. typhi,</italic> and <italic>O. tsutsugamushi</italic> (reviewed in Osterloh, <italic>Med Microbiol Immunol</italic> 2017). Thus, <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may potentially serve as models for these pathogens. We now include this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The other deficiency is due to a limited description of the Sca2 and OmpB mutants used in this study. It was necessary to locate and review previous publications by this group in order to understand the experiments conducted here and their interpretation. It would be useful to the readers if this information (a better more complete description of the mutants and their properties) is summarized in this manuscript.”</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided a more complete description of the mutants in the Introduction and Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>“The study is relevant to investigators working in the field of rickettsial diseases and to a broader audience studying mechanisms of intracellular parasitism and host responses.</p><p>The study argues that difference(s) in dermal IFN signaling mechanism(s) distinguish human and murine susceptibility to R. parkeri infection. This is a very useful speculation; however, a better and deeper discussion would be helpful to demonstrate the relevance of these observations and their connection(s) to events occurring during the course of human infections. Regrettably, there are almost no citations of classic or current literature addressing these aspects of rickettsial pathogenesis and the role of IFN-dependent mechanisms beyond self-citations. Overall, the discussion includes four relatively short paragraphs, each addressing different directions of possible research, which indicates ample possible utility of this murine model; however, a more coherent and convincing discussion is desirable.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, and we have now expanded the Discussion to address the role for IFN-dependent mechanisms in humans and mice during rickettsial infections, including classic and current literature citations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referees cross commenting</p><p>“I agree with the Reviewer #2 that per se this is not the first murine model reproducing eschar upon A. maculatum transmission; however, this is the first model that allows to monitor eschar formation using needle inoculation.

The authors acknowledged existing of the tick transmission model and discuss inclusion of this option in their future experiments.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the many advantages of this model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
