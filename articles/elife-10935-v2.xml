The excess protein chains normally exist in the body as individual molecules called “monomers” or in pairs called “dimers,” and they can readily switch between these two forms. However, the monomers are also prone to forming amyloid fibrils, which are difficult to break down. Amyloid fibrils are often deposited in the heart and kidneys and can lead to organ failure and death.</p> <p>Finding molecules that prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils could help to develop treatments for amyloidosis. Now, Brumshtein, Esswein <italic>et al</italic>. have screened 27 compounds to identify those that stabilize the dimer form of the protein. This would reduce the number of monomers in the body, and so reduce the number of immune proteins that can form amyloid fibrils.</p> <p>The experiments identified four compounds that could stabilize the dimers, including one called methylene blue. Comparing the chemical structures of these compounds with the structures of drugs approved for medical use identified thirteen drugs. However, follow-up tests showed that only one, called sulfasalazine, reduced the formation of amyloid fibrils. Neither methylene blue nor sulfasalazine is likely to have a strong enough effect to treat amyloidosis, but they may serve as templates for future drug designs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10935.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10935.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>amyloid</kwd><kwd>light-chain variable domains</kwd><kwd>Bnece-Jones proteins</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>multiple myeloma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG048120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brumshtein</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name><name><surname>Esswein</surname><given-names>Shannon R</given-names></name><name><surname>Salwinski</surname><given-names>Lukasz</given-names></name><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>Martin L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ly</surname><given-names>Alan T</given-names></name><name><surname>Cascio</surname><given-names>Duilio</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawaya</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisenberg</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25GM055052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ly</surname><given-names>Alan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ligands that bind dimers of light chain variable domains inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyloid fibrils are protein deposits often associated with disease. These deposits show common structural and biochemical characteristics, including non-covalent self-complementary fibrils, resistance to proteolysis, insolubility in aqueous solution, binding of thioflavin dye, and generation of a cross-β X-ray diffraction pattern. The spine of amyloid fibrils, termed a 'steric zipper,' is built by paired β-sheets with interdigitating side chains and serves as the scaffold for fibril extension. The inter-strand and inter-sheet distances give rise to a characteristic cross-β X-ray diffraction pattern of two perpendicular reflections at ~4.8 and ~10 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geddes et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hobbs, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sipe and Cohen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>). Formation of a steric zipper requires the presence of a discrete peptide segment with an amino acid sequence capable of forming a self-complimentary propagating structure. Such segments are commonly found as integral parts of globular proteins and trigger aggregation into amyloid fibrils only upon exposure to solvent through full or partial denaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Cases of systemic light chain amyloidosis (AL), associated with multiple myeloma, were first described in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century; however, the etiology of the disease was not clear. In 1848, Dr. Bence-Jones discovered the disease-associated substance in urine, though it was only later identified as immunoglobulin light chains (LC) associated with amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahlin and Dockerty, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glenner et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glenner, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sipe et al., 2014</xref>). Systemic AL amyloidosis is characterized by overexpression of monoclonal LCs, which are able to form homo-dimers. Despite renal clearance of excess protein, the full-length LCs or their fragments still form amyloid fibril deposits in patients’ tissues, most frequently in the heart and kidneys, which result in organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buxbaum, 1986</xref>). Although it is clear this deposition causes organ dysfunction, much remains to be discovered about the molecular process by which immunoglobulins assemble into amyloid fibrils. It is unknown which peptide segments form steric zippers and how to block their assembly into the amyloid spine.</p><p>LCs are produced by plasma cells and their final amino acid sequence is determined by somatic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sakano et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marchalonis and Schluter, 1989</xref>). LCs are classified by their amino acid sequence as either κ or λ. They consist of two domains, the variable (V<sub>L</sub>) and constant (C<sub>L</sub>), which are connected by a joining segment (J). In patients, amyloid fibrils are found to include either V<sub>L</sub>s or full-length LCs (V<sub>L</sub>-J-C<sub>L</sub>), yet the ubiquitous presence of V<sub>L</sub>s indicates that this domain may be the minimal and essential unit for fibril assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buxbaum, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olsen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lavatelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vrana et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodi et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structures of full-length LCs and structures of just their V<sub>L</sub>s both reveal homo-dimers, which resemble the light chain and heavy chain hetero-dimer of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of a full antibody. Fab is a hetero-dimer composed of both light and heavy chains, each with constant (C<sub>L</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>) and variable (V<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>H</sub>) immunoglobulin domains. LC homo-dimers, in which the V<sub>L</sub> domain is covalently linked to the C<sub>L</sub> domain, resemble the quaternary structure of the Fab hetero-dimer, and non-covalently linked dimers of only V<sub>L</sub>s structurally resemble the variable region of the Fab (V<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>H</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edmundson et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colman et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Firca et al., 1978</xref>). The interfaces between the variable domains of physiological hetero-dimers and pathological homo-dimers are lined with apolar residues encompassing a hydrophobic cavity capable of accommodating small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edmundson et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">1993</xref>).</p><p>Our work focuses on a λ patient-derived V<sub>L</sub> homo-dimer named Mcg whose structure and properties were detailed in pioneering studies by Edmundson and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edmundson et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Firca et al., 1978</xref>). The cavity between the two V<sub>L</sub> domains in Mcg is capable of binding a wide array of ligands, including synthetic organic molecules and peptides, which form contacts with the side chains of the dimer cavity. The cavity spans most of the 24 Å-long dimer interface; it is cylindrically shaped and can be considered to constitute three sites: A, B and C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edmundson et al., 1984</xref>). Based on the geometry of the dimer with some deviation from the original nomenclature by Edmundson <italic>et al.,</italic> we designate side chains of residues Y34, Y93, D97 and F99 on one side of the cylindrical cavity as the 'A-site,' S36, Y51, E52, S91 and F101 as the 'B-site,' and Y38, Q40, V48 and Y89 as the 'C-site' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Some ligands bind the cavity in a sequential manner without a distinct preference for one of the sites. For example, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid binds in either the A or C-sites and can migrate between them, whereas fluorescein binds to both sites with partial occupancy. Other molecules, such as menadione, preferentially bind to only one of the sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edmundson et al., 1984</xref>). Regardless of binding location, this demonstrates the dimer cavity is capable of accommodating various hydrophobic and aromatic ligands.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10935.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Stereo image of the ligand-binding sites of the V<sub>L</sub> dimer.</title><p>We designate the A-site in red (residues Y34, Y93, D97 and F99), B-site in yellow (residues S36, Y51, E52, S91 and F101), and C-site in green (residues Y38, Q40, V48 and Y89).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10935.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10935.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-10935-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>V<sub>L</sub>s exist in equilibrium between homo-dimers and amyloid-prone monomers. Experiments conducted in denaturing conditions indicate that reducing the stability of the monomeric state promotes amyloid fibril formation, and mutations that induce dimer disassociation or promote monomer unfolding increase the propensity to form amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernier and Putnam, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishida et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wetzel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hurle et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brumshtein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baden et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, mutations that stabilize the structure of V<sub>L</sub>s or covalently fix V<sub>L</sub> dimers inhibit formation of amyloid fibrils. These results indicate that formation of amyloid fibrils involves two steps: V<sub>L</sub> dimer disassociation into monomers followed by partial or full unfolding. The mechanism of amyloid formation also suggests that shifting the equilibrium away from the amyloid-prone monomer by stabilizing the dimer would hinder formation of amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellotti et al., 2000</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10935.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism for using ligands to hinder the aggregation of immunoglobulin V<sub>L</sub> s into amyloid fibrils.</title><p>V<sub>L</sub> s are in equilibrium between dimers and monomers in solution.

This approach proved effective for transthyretin-related amyloidosis, another type of systemic amyloidosis for which stabilizing the quaternary state led to the development of therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miroy et al., 1996</xref>). Upon transthyretin tetramer disassociation into amyloid-prone monomers, it forms amyloid fibrils in an acidic environment. The binding of thyroxine inhibits disassociation and subsequent amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baures et al., 1998</xref>). Following the same principle, a modified ligand with a disassociation constant in the nano-molar range prevents transthyretin from forming amyloid fibrils and is effective in vivo.</p><p>Here we apply structural and biochemical methods to investigate ligands that hinder amyloid formation by stabilizing the V<sub>L</sub> homo-dimer. We identify ligands that may serve as prototypes for therapies for treating LC amyloidosis and our results are consistent with a mechanism for amyloidosis that proceeds via dimer disassociation to amyloid-prone monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brumshtein et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p> <italic>Identification of ligands that inhibit formation of amyloid fibrils.</italic> Based on the previous work of Edmundson <italic>et al.</italic>, we screened a panel of 27 hydrophobic and aromatic ligands for an inhibitory effect on the formation of amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edmundson et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">1993</xref>).

By utilizing the known ability of ligands to bind the hydrophobic cavity of V<sub>L</sub> dimers, we prevent dimer disassociation into monomers and thus hinder amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edmundson et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">1993</xref>). A similar approach was used to design therapies for transthyretin-related amyloidosis by stabilizing the tetrameric state of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miroy et al., 1996</xref>). Initial screening for ligands that hinder V<sub>L</sub> amyloid formation revealed four ligands showing this effect, with methylene blue as the strongest binding ligand. A subsequent search in the DrugBank aimed to identify similarly effective ligands that are already approved for medical use.</p><p>Since the emission spectra of ThT partly overlaps with the absorption spectra of the ligands, both ThT assays and EM analysis were necessary to confirm the ability of the ligands to inhibit amyloid formation. Analysis of electron micrographs and ThT assays indicates that increasing the concentration of methylene blue or sulfasalazine hinders the formation of amyloid fibrils. One of the molecules from our screen, epigallocatechin gallate, was recently suggested to hinder the formation of amyloid fibrils, yet in our experiments it did not show any effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pelaez-Aguilar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Though both of the ligands bind Mcg and induce amyloid hindering effects, the mechanism of binding slightly differs. Methylene blue binds through positive cooperativity. This result indicates the presence of two binding sites, one strong and one weak, where binding to the second site begins only after the first site is fully occupied. Scatchard plots for sulfasalazine show that the two specific binding sites on Mcg are identical with the same disassociation constant and that this specific ligand binding is followed by non-specific binding.</p><p>We addressed the difference in the binding mechanisms of methylene blue and sulfasalazine to Mcg in solution by crystal structures and analytical ultracentrifugation. The crystal structure of Mcg with methylene blue shows binding at the A-site of the V<sub>L</sub> dimer cavity and coordination by the side chains of residues Y34, Y93, D97 and F99. The crystal belongs to space group P2<sub>1</sub> with one dimer per asymmetric unit, and the symmetry between the two V<sub>L</sub> domains of Mcg is broken by the presence of a sulfate ion bound to only one of the V<sub>L</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis of the soluble quaternary state indicates the dimer as the most prevalent form of the complex versus monomer without a bound ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brumshtein et al., 2014</xref>). We also observed a small fraction of oligomers with molecular weights larger than dimers, as confirmed by the meniscus depletion experiment. The meniscus depletion distributes quaternary states along the path length of the sample cell during analytical centrifugation, thus verifying which state accounts for the deviation in apparent molecular weight. The most significant outcome is the complete absence of soluble monomer in complex with the ligand, which verifies our conjecture that the ligands bind and stabilize dimers. In the case of sulfasalazine, to confirm binding specifically to soluble dimers, the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments identified dimers as the only quaternary state of the ligand-bound complex.</p><p>The reconciliation of our three experiments on the binding of methylene blue to Mcg V<sub>L</sub>s suggests blocking of the secondary binding site in the crystals. The three experimental findings are: cooperative binding of methylene blue as measured by equilibrium dialysis, binding of the ligand to the A-site in the crystal structure, and the absence of monomeric V<sub>L</sub> in complex with ligand. Taken together, these observations indicate that the secondary binding site of methylene blue may not be available in the crystalline state, but available in solution. Secondary binding to either the B or C-sites may require conformational changes that are less favorable in crystals or induce the higher-order assembly of complexes larger than dimers.</p><p>The crystal structure of Mcg with sulfasalazine explains why only one disassociation constant for specific binding was measured. Crystals of the complex belong to space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 with two symmetry-related ligands bound per Mcg dimer, and thus one ligand bound per V<sub>L</sub> in the asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Therefore, the equivalence of the two sulfasalazine ligands in the crystal explains why only one disassociation constant was measured by means of equilibrium dialysis. The crystal structure shows that each of the sulfasalazine ligands occupy all three A-B-C-sites simultaneously; each ligand binds to the A and B-sites on one of the V<sub>L</sub>s composing the dimer, while C-site binding is on the symmetry-related V<sub>L</sub>. This contrasts with methylene blue, which is bound only to the A-site. Despite differences in the exact orientation of the side chains where the ligands bind, both ligands bind in the cavity of the Mcg dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Although our experiments were performed using only V<sub>L</sub>s rather than full-length LCs, the ligand-binding site between V<sub>L</sub>s is maintained in full-length LCs. While full-length LCs are disulfide linked at their C<sub>L</sub> C-termini, crystal structures indicate that the conformation of V<sub>L</sub>s is independent of connected constant domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ely et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Terzyan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Makino et al., 2007</xref>). In full-length LCs, the joining (J) segment between V<sub>L</sub>s and C<sub>L</sub>s provides the flexibility for V<sub>L</sub>s to maintain the same hydrophobic cavity as that seen in the V<sub>L</sub> homo-dimer alone. This indicates the strategy of using ligands to stabilize the V<sub>L</sub> dimer and hinder amyloid fibril formation may also be effective for full-length homo-dimers.</p><p>The ability of ligands to hinder the aggregation of V<sub>L</sub>s into amyloid fibrils by stabilizing V<sub>L</sub> dimers indicates a promising approach for treatment of systemic light chain amyloidosis disease. While the light chain amino acid sequence differs between patients, the characteristic hydrophobic cavity of the homo-dimer formed by overexpressed LCs is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bork et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edmundson et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solomon and Weiss, 1995</xref>). Although our experiments were performed using a single V<sub>L</sub> variant, LCs of both λ and κ maintain a similar tertiary structure and hydrophobic cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wetzel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brumshtein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fink, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khurana et al., 2001</xref>). This conserved hydrophobic pocket indicates a possible target for designing medications that inhibit LC amyloidosis. Although methylene blue and sulfasalazine may not bind tightly enough to be directly repurposed as treatments for the disease, these ligands may serve as prototypes for development of effective medications. As indicated by the ability of these molecules to inhibit amyloid fibril formation, this approach may result in alleviated symptoms for systemic light chain amyloidosis patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of recombinant proteins</title><p>Protein samples were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brumshtein et al., 2014</xref>).

Equilibrium runs were performed at 20<sup>°</sup>C in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using absorption optics at 500 nm for methylene blue and 420 nm for sulfasalazine. Samples were at concentrations of 1 mg/ml of Mcg with 100 and 150 μM of methylene blue, and 1 and 2.5 mg/ml of Mcg with 300 and 500 μM sulfasalazine. The concentrations of the protein and ligands were chosen to obtain optical density readings in the linear range of the spectrophotometer yet with measurable quaternary state densities of the complexes.</p><p>Sedimentation equilibrium profiles were measured at speeds of 10,000, 14,000 and 22,000 rpm in a An-60 Ti rotor. To validate the deviation of the apparent molecular weight of Mcg with methylene blue, a set of experiments analyzing the meniscus depletion of the Mcg dimer were performed at 35,000 rpm. The data were fit with a non-linear least squares double exponential fit using the Beckman Origin-based software (Version 3.01) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohn and Edsall, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laue et al., 1992</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mike Collazo for crystallization screens at the UCLA-DOE crystallization facility, M Capel, K Rajashankar, N Sukumar, J Schuermann, I Kourinov, and F Murphy for facilitating X-ray data collection experiments at the NE-CAT beamline 24-ID-C of APS, and Dr. Julian Whitelegge and Dr. Meytal Landau for discussions.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom (Jeffery W. Kelly) is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p> <p>The Reviewing editor has drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Both the reviewer and the Reviewing editor agree that the authors have demonstrated an important proof-of-principle regarding the potential utility of a dimer stabilizing therapeutic approach for light chain amyloidosis, which has long being theorized for systemic AL amyloidosis (see Bellotti et al., J Struct Biol 2000).</p> <p>We seek a minor revision from the authors: addressing all the questions/suggestions posed in the two reviews and two minor comments below.</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p> <p>The manuscript by Brumshtein et al. entitled &quot;Inhibition by small-molecule ligands of formation of amyloid fibrils of variable domains of Ig light chains&quot; is an excellent paper that merits serious consideration for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors have accomplished a feat that many groups have tried to accomplish previously – i.e. to stabilize the light chain variable domain dimer which is non-amyloidogenic, inhibiting dimer dissociation to an amyloidogenic monomer.</p> <p>While the light chain dimer sequence varies between patients, the hydrophobic cavity at the variable domain dimer-dimer interface is conserved in sequence. The light chain variable domain dimer dissociates, misfolds and aggregates driving degenerative disease phenotypes. Thus, the authors screened a library of small molecules previously implicated to bind at the variable domain dimer interface. Analysis of electron micrographs and thioflavin T assays reveals that increasing the concentration of methylene blue or sulfasalazine hinders the formation of light chain aggregation. Two ligands bind to each dimer, methylene blue binding with positive cooperativity, whereas sulfasalazine binds non-cooperatively. Analytical ultracentrifugation is consistent with ligand binding to and stabilization of the dimer. In the crystal structure only one molecule of methylene blue binds / dimer vs. two molecules of sulfasalazine / dimer. While these two ligands do not bind tightly enough to become drug candidates, they convincingly demonstrate proof-of-principle that molecules that bind to the non-amyloidogenic variable domain light chain dimer prevent light chain aggregation driving light chain amyloidosis. This data provides the incentive for a commercial organization to make a non-amyloidogenic light chain dimer stabilizer.</p> <p>Can the authors please comment on whether this strategy could be useful for inhibition of the amyloidogenesis from the disulfide-linked full-length light chain dimer, wherein each chain comprises 1 constant and 1 variable domain, i.e., is the same binding site conserved?</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</italic></p> <p>1) The first sentence of the Introduction is a run-on sentence that should be rewritten as two sentences: &quot;Amyloid fibrils are protein deposits, which are often associated with disease and show common structural and biochemical characteristics, including the aggregation into proteins into non-covalent self-complementary fibrils, resistance to proteolysis, insolubility in aqueous solution, binding of thioflavin dye, and generation of a cross-beta X-ray diffraction pattern.&quot;</p> <p>2) That dimer dissociation and partial monomer denaturation drives variable domain aggregation was shown by Wetzel et al. (early 80's) and this literature should be referenced.</p> <p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> it would be best to depict the dissociated amyloidogenic monomers as having a shape other than that in the non-amyloidogenic dimer.</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p> <p>Brumshtein and colleagues report the identification of ligands (including approved biomedical compounds) that bind and stabilize dimers of a human amyloidogenic immunoglobulin λ light chain (Mcg), thereby inhibiting amyloid formation in vitro.</p> <p>This is an important proof-of-principle study about the potential utility of such a therapeutic approach, which is currently being pursued for ATTR amyloidosis and which has long being theorized also for systemic AL amyloidosis (see Bellotti et al., J Struct Biol 2000).</p> <p>As discussed by the authors, each patient with systemic AL amyloidosis has a unique immunoglobulin light chain sequence. However, the study is focused on an individual amyloidogenic immunoglobulin λ light chain (Mcg). Whereas this is acceptable for a proof-of-principle study (even though analysis of other amyloidogenic light chains, including also κ light chains, would represent a significant improvement) this fact should be better discussed in the manuscript, and should also be reflected in the title and in the Abstract.</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Minor Comments):</italic></p> <p>1) Title: &quot;Inhibition by small-molecule ligands of formation of amyloid fibrils of variable domains of IgG light chains&quot;. The abbreviation IgG (immunoglobulin of G type) is inappropriate in this case and should be replaced with immunoglobulin. To take into account the above mentioned issue of having investigated only Mcg, a new suggested title could be: &quot;Inhibition by small-molecule ligands of formation of amyloid fibrils of variable domains of Mcg immunoglobulin light chains&quot;. This would also be in line with the work done by the group of Edmundson on Mcg, where the focus on Mcg is reflected in the titles of the different papers.</p> <p>2) Introduction: &quot;[…] including the aggregation into proteins into non covalent self complementary fibrils […]&quot;.

The modified text is: “Although our experiments were performed using only VLs rather than full-length LCs, the ligand-binding site between VLs is maintained in full-length LCs.

However, the study is focused on an individual amyloidogenic immunoglobulin λ light chain (Mcg). Whereas this is acceptable for a proof-of-principle study (even though analysis of other amyloidogenic light chains, including also κ light chains, would represent a significant improvement) this fact should be better discussed in the manuscript, and should also be reflected in the title and in the Abstract.</italic> </p> <p>We modified the title to: “Inhibition by small-molecule ligands of formation of amyloid fibrils of an immunoglobulin light chain variable domains”</p> <p>We modified the last sentence of the Abstract to: “Here we identify ligands that inhibit amyloid formation by stabilizing the Mcg light chain variable domain dimer and shifting the equilibrium away from the amyloid-prone monomer.”</p> <p>We added an explanation to the last paragraph of the Discussion. The new text is: “The ability of ligands to hinder the aggregation of VLs into amyloid fibrils by stabilizing VL dimers indicates a promising approach for treatment of systemic light chain amyloidosis disease.

The abbreviation IgG (immunoglobulin of G type) is inappropriate in this case and should be replaced with immunoglobulin. To take into account the above mentioned issue of having investigated only Mcg, a new suggested title could be: &quot;Inhibition by small-molecule ligands of formation of amyloid fibrils of variable domains of Mcg immunoglobulin light chains&quot;. This would also be in line with all the work done by the group of Edmundson on Mcg, where the focus on Mcg is reflected in the titles of the different papers.</italic> </p> <p>See above.</p> <p><italic>2) Introduction: &quot;[...] including the aggregation into proteins into non covalent self complementary fibrils [...]&quot;.

The new text is: “Cases of systemic light chain amyloidosis (AL), associated with multiple myeloma, were first described during the Renaissance though the etiology of the disease was not clear. In 1848, Dr. Bence-Jones discovered a disease-associated substance in urine, later identified as immunoglobulin light chains (LC) (Kyle, 2001; Kyle, 2011; Dahlin and Dockerty, 1950; Glenner et al., 1970; Glenner et al., 1971; Glenner, 1973; Sipe et al., 2014).”</p> <p>We added the reference to Kyle as a historical overview and kept the reference to Bence-Jones as he identified the substance in urine as protein.</p> <p>To clarify that light-chain amyloidosis is only occasionally associated with multiple myeloma, we removed the word “frequently.” Also, we polished the paragraph due to the changes and the modified sentences are: “Cases of systemic light chain amyloidosis (AL), associated with multiple myeloma, were first described in the mid-19th century; however, the etiology of the disease was not clear. In 1848, Dr. Bence-Jones discovered the disease-associated substance in urine, though it was only later identified as immunoglobulin light chains (LC) associated with amyloidosis (Kyle, 2001; Kyle, 2011; Dahlin and Dockerty, 1950; Glenner et al., 1970; Glenner et al., 1971; Glenner, 1973; Sipe et al., 2014).”</p> <p><italic>4) Introduction: &quot;This disease is characterized by overexpression of monoclonal LCs, which are able to form homo dimers termed Bence Jones proteins [...]&quot;.

Since we did not want to apply too many filters on potential results, we only used a single search parameter. The new text is: “Amyloid formation was monitored with Thioflavin T assays and electron microscopy analysis, and we used molecules that inhibited amyloid fibril formation at concentrations below 1 mM to search DrugBank to identify biomedical compounds with a similar structure that would potentially inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils (Edmundson et al., 1976). We selected structures in DrugBank with a similarity threshold of 0.3. Search filters were not applied to any other parameters.
