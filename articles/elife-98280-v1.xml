and number in the neocortex. However, this is only part of the synaptic sleep loss response. We report an increased AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio in frontal-cortical pyramidal neurons of layers 2–3. Silent synapses are absent, decreasing the plastic potential to convert silent NMDA to active AMPA synapses. These sleep loss changes are recovered by sleep. Sleep genes are enriched for synaptic shaping cellular components controlling glutamate synapse phenotype, overlap with autism risk genes, and are primarily observed in excitatory pyramidal neurons projecting intra-telencephalically. These genes are enriched with genes controlled by the transcription factor, MEF2c, and its repressor, HDAC4. Sleep genes can thus provide a framework within which motor learning and training occur mediated by the sleep-dependent oscillation of glutamate-synaptic phenotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>AMPA/NMDA ratio</kwd><kwd>sleep homeostasis</kwd><kwd>MEF2c</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>NINDS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS103422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greene</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIDOCM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC014702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Konopka</surname><given-names>Genevieve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

Reduction of arousal to unconsciousness can gate sleep, however, the function served by this sleep, in contrast to wake function, remains enigmatic. A reasonable teleologically oriented goal is more effective future foraging, danger avoidance, and reproductive behaviors, based on procedural and episodic learning from past waking experiences. Effective learning involves memory of waking experience and underlying long-term plasticity (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stickgold, 2005</xref>). At the cellular level, extensive activity-dependent LTP of cortical glutamate synapses can lead to a well-documented increase in synaptic strength of cortical glutamatergic synapses during waking. It is reflected by the increased frequency and amplitude of glutamatergic miniature synaptic currents (mEPSC) that are restored by subsequent sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Torrado Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>), consistent with the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis of sleep (SHY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our recent findings indicate that during waking, not only are individual synapses strengthened (overall glutamate mEPSC amplitude in layer 2–3 pyramidal cells is increased by SD) but, also, the number of electro-physiologically active synapses is increased (increased frequency in correlation with unaltered or decreased probability of release) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorness et al., 2020</xref>). The molecular underpinnings of these changes in glutamate synaptic strength and number were examined to determine the changes in the glutamate synaptic phenotype and what the implication(s) of these changes, if any, might be with regard to a propensity for synaptic plasticity (meta-plasticity).</p><p>We investigated sleep/wake mediated electrophysiological changes in glutamatergic synapses in the motor cortex, layer 2–3, pyramidal neurons since our previous work demonstrates wake/sleep up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively, in these cells’ glutamate synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorness et al., 2020</xref>). We observed a wake/sleep oscillation of AMPA/NMDA synaptic response ratio in pyramidal neurons of the motor neocortex coupled with an oscillating fraction of silent synapses (NMDAR-mediated synaptic response but no AMPAR-mediated response) in response to sleep need. We then, extended these physiological findings to include the characterization of sleep-need-related differential expression of glutamatergic synaptic shaping genes that can control the observed oscillating glutamate synapse phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sleep need driven, glutamate, synaptic phenotype</title><p>Three cohorts of C57 BL/6 male mice were allowed either to (1) sleep ad lib (control sleep, CS); (2) prevented from sleeping from ZT = 0–6 hr (sleep deprived, SD); or, (3) after 4 hr SD allowed recovery sleep, ad lib for 2 hr (RS). Ex-Vivo acute brain slices from the motor cortex were then prepared from these animals at ZT = 6 hr and whole cell recordings were obtained from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (see methods for details). Locally evoked glutamatergic EPSCs recorded at V<sub>hold</sub> = –90 mV had little NMDAR contribution due to Mg<sup>++</sup> block.

For each recorded neuron (one neuron/slice/animal) an average response to repeated stimuli (&gt;10 stimuli, 100 pA, applied every 10 s) to elicit an EPSC was determined at each holding potential.

We employed a similar analysis to examine the effects of SD and sleep on functional synaptic AMPAR and NMDAR composition. As with the EPSC amplitude analysis, there was a significant interaction for failure rates at V<sub>hold</sub> = –90 mv and V<sub>hold</sub> = +50 mV, and the three sleep conditions (p&lt;0.031; F (1.742, 8.708)=5.550; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, Tabs 4&amp;5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

However, both CS and RS restored the number of Ss. FR<sub>-90</sub> is significantly smaller than FR<sub>+50</sub> for both CS and RS (p&lt;0.030 and &lt;0.0035, respectively).</p><p>The condition-specific ratio of FR<sub>+50 mV</sub> to FR<sub>-90 mV</sub> (FRR) is a ratio of power functions of the probability of failure for each of the stimulated synapses (1-p<sub>release</sub>)<sup>stimulated-synapse</sup> and thus, inversely proportional (since (1-p<sub>release</sub>)&lt;1) to the number of silent synapses (Ss). A binomial probability distribution model is employed with the assumptions that: (1) each stimulus activates the same set of pre-synaptic terminals for a given neuron; (2) each terminal has a constant p<sub>release</sub>; (3) P(failure) for a given set of stimulus-activated terminals = (1-p<sub>release</sub>)<sup>#activated terminals</sup>.

Class II histone deacetylases 4/5 (referred hereafter as HD4, HD5) are MEF2c binding partners and repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKinsey et al., 2000</xref>), that can shuttle in and out of the nucleus and are trapped in the cytoplasm when phosphorylated by SIKinases (salt-induced kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>), known to become active in conditions of high sleep need. As the mouse sleep phase progresses HD4/5 is progressively de-phosphorylated in association with decreased sleep need and conversely, as the mouse active phase progresses, HD4/5 is progressively phosphorylated in association with increased sleep need (see Figure 4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>).

The resulting high-sleep-need DEGs as noted above, can mediate the observed recovery of glutamate synapse phenotype from a high AMPA/NMDA ratio with sparse silent synapses, to lowered AMPA/NMDA ratio and increased silent synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The major claims of this study are: (1) SD increases the AMPA/NMDA receptor ratio and RS restores it; (2) SD decreases silent synapses compared to CS and RS restores their number after SD; (3) the majority of SD-induced DEGs are found in ExIT cells (glutamate pyramidal neurons projecting within the telencephalon); (4) ExIT SD-induced DEGs are enriched for genes encoding synaptic shaping components and for autism spectrum disorder risk and; (5) these DEGs are also enriched for DEGs induced by <italic>Mef2c</italic> loss of function restricted to forebrain glutamate neurons (ExIT cells comprise a subset of these) and by over-expression of constitutively nuclear HDAC4 that represses MEF2c transcriptional function.

Both effects are reversed by recovery sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorness et al., 2020</xref>). The evidence presented here suggests this wake/sleep homeostasis also reflects a waking-induced increase in functional AMPA/NMDA ratio of glutamate synapses of the frontal cortex together with loss of silent glutamatergic synapses. The latter suggests a reduced availability of glutamate synapses for conversion from silent to active, reflecting saturation of LTP. Accordingly, it is reasonable to summarize the implications of sleep-related glutamate synaptic phenotype oscillation as: (1) prolonged waking induces a generalized synaptic strengthening coupled with a negative bias against potentiating plasticity as available slots for AMPARs saturate, and (2) a functional recovery by sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>There is evidence that learning of a motor task or experiencing of forced altered motor activity can result in localized increases in NREM (slow wave sleep)-slow wave activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huber et al., 2006</xref>) in the motor cortex. Since SWS-SWA is considered a marker for sleep homeostasis, the altered motor activity-induced increase of SWS-SWA was considered evidence for sleep-related function. Our earlier work has clearly shown that the treadmill method of SD increases frontal cortical SWS-SWA rebound, indicating a sleep-homeostatic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorness et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, we have also shown that this means of experimental SD causes similar glutamate synaptic changes as those observed using other means of SD like gentle handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Learning of motor tasks that can be robustly and quantitatively monitored, like bird song in juvenile zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derégnaucourt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kollmorgen et al., 2020</xref>), may reflect the sleep/wake oscillation of bias for LTP and synaptic strengthening. At the start of the active phase, facilitated motor learning improves song performance to a level that appears to saturate by the end of the day. After a night’s sleep, performance is degraded but shows enhanced learning, facilitated by decreased AMPA/NMDA ratio and increased availability of synapses that can be readily potentiated. Since there are inevitable, day-to-day, unrelated variances in the environment that should not be learned, mitigation of over-fitting a learned task may require an oscillatory, stairstep-like, learning process. In rats, performance during learning of a novel motor task can display these similar characteristics, especially at the start of learning a novel task when exploration of a multi-dimensional learning space is at a premium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2023</xref>), consistent with an underlying sleep/wake oscillation of glutamate synaptic phenotype.</p><p>Our unbiased examination of the ontology of ExIT DEGs indicates a response to sleep loss to modify ExIT glutamate synapses involving SSC DEGs. Our electrophysiological observations, now show more particularly, that the gene-expression modifications of ExIT neurons are coupled to SD-responses of, (1) increased AMPA/NMDA ratio; (2) decreased functional silent synapses and; (3) the previously described, increase in synaptic strength and functional number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>The ontology of the ExIT SD-response transcriptome is also notable for enrichment by autism-related risk genes, many of which overlap with our curated category of SSCs. A similar overlap has been noted for social affiliative behaviors, synaptic adhesion molecules, other synaptic shaping molecules with autism/autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes in the mammalian CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>). The association of sleep disruption with autism is generally appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mazurek et al., 2019</xref>) but the focus was on loss of time spent asleep or disrupted sleep, rather than loss of sleep function. The overlapped SSC and ASD DEGs provide a molecular association between sleep’s functional role in the motor cortex and ASD risk that captures ASD’s association with motor deficits observed in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chukoskie et al., 2013</xref>) and in mouse autism models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cording and Bateup, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms responsible for sleep/wake DEGs observed in ExIT neurons include two critical transcription factors, MEF2c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorness et al., 2020</xref>) and HD4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). All neuronal and non-neuronal frontal cortical transcriptomic changes are abolished by loss of function of <italic>Mef2c</italic>.

Importantly, MEF2c was necessary for both the SD-transcriptomic response and for the SD-induced increase of glutamatergic synaptic strength and functional synaptic number as well as for ensuring sleep-mediated recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorness et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, MEF2c has an essential role in facilitating the expression of sleep genes needed for functional recovery from loss of sleep.</p><p>The activity of either of these factors to alter the sleep transcriptome, is controlled by their phosphorylation state. When sleep need is high, MEF2c is de-phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorness et al., 2020</xref>) (from pMEF2c to MEF2c) and Salt Induced Kinases (SIKs) phosphorylate HD4 and HD5 (pHD4/5), sequestering them to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Both the phosphorylation of HD4/5 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miska et al., 1999</xref>) and de-phosphorylation of MEF2c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu and Gulick, 2004</xref>), de-represses MEF2c transcriptional activity. The de-repression of MEF2c and its dephosphorylation are essential for SD-induced differential expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorness et al., 2020</xref>). The target genes of MEF2c activation can be inferred from the cortical, differential transcriptome induced by MEF2c loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harrington et al., 2016</xref>). These same genes overlap with the differentially expressed genes observed in response to overexpression of constitutively nuclear HD4 (HD4<sup>cn</sup>). This is predictable as HD4<sup>cn</sup> will constitutively bind and repress MEF2c in the nucleus, thus mimicking a MEF2c loss of function. Furthermore, in association with low sleep need, nuclear, and thus transcriptionally active (as a repressor), HD4, is more abundant in a de-phosphorylated state, relative to transcriptionally inactive, phosphorylated cytoplasmic pHD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). NMDAR activation negatively controls HD4 transcriptional activity and nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sando et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, as NMDAR activity accumulates during the active period, an expected accumulation of pHD4 in the cytoplasm occurs to derepress MEF2c activity. Thus, HD4 may act to repress MEF2c transcriptional facilitation of sleep genes, during low sleep need and derepress MEF2c as sleep need builds during the active period. We observed DEGs from both MEF2c loss of function and HD4cn also sleep DEGs consistent with their interaction driven by sleep need (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Both the role of MEF2c to mediate sleep gene expression and nuclear HD4 to repress MEF2c activity, lead to an apparent paradox. When HD4 repression of MEF2c is chronically reduced or lost, sleep need, as indicated by slow wave activity during slow wave sleep (SWS-SWA), is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). If MEF2c promotes sleep gene expression, then sleep needs should be reduced not increased by its de-repression. Conversely, when constitutively, nuclear HD4<sup>cn</sup> is overexpressed, to chronically repress MEF2c, sleep need, as indicated by SWS-SWA, is unexpectedly, reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). But what is actually being indicated by SWS-SWA?</p><p>SWS-SWA has long been employed as a marker for sleep need or intensity, primarily because of its strong correlation with previous time spent awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franken et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borbély et al., 2016</xref>). Despite this marker’s long history, the mechanisms responsible for its correlation to sleep needs are not well understood.</p><p>SWS-SWA correlates with either MEF2c and/or to ADORA1 activation. Either of these activations correlates with a reduction of glutamate synaptic strength (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Ado activation of Ado A1 receptors (ADORA1) inhibits AMPAR synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brambilla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greene et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Adk</italic>, which encodes adenosine kinase in glial cells is the high-affinity metabolizing enzyme of Ado. Glial knockout of <italic>Adk</italic> increases extracellular Ado and SWA in both wake and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>). Rebound SWS-SWA in response to experimental SD increases Ado (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Porkka-Heiskanen et al., 1997</xref>) and the rebound is blocked by a <italic>CamK2a:Cre</italic>-driven conditional knockout of <italic>Adora1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>). Thus Ado tone, whether increased by prolonged waking activity or by glial knockdown of <italic>Adk</italic>, through its activation of ADORA1, inhibits glutamate synaptic activity, including in arousal centers, to promote SWS-SWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greene et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Sleep, itself, induces a down-regulation of glutamate synaptic strength, synaptic numbers, and AMPA/NMDA ratio. Chronic facilitation of MEF2c-dependent sleep genes due to de-repression of MEF2c by <italic>Hdac4/5</italic>’s loss of function should induce a chronic down-regulation of glutamatergic synaptic strength and number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorness et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). The sleep-gene-induced, chronic glutamate synaptic down-regulation can mimic the effect of a tonic increase of extracellular Ado to increase SWA as occurred following glial loss of function of <italic>Adk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, synaptic glutamate activity in cholinergic arousal centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rainnie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brambilla et al., 2005</xref>) can be reduced, decreasing cholinergic-mediated thalamo-cortical activation to additionally increase SWS-SWA.</p><p>Conversely, repression of MEF2c by de-phosphorylated HD4/5 (or by expression of phospho-dead HD4cn) reduces SWS-SWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). In this case, glutamate synaptic activity can be chronically increased by the direct effect of loss of sleep function to down-scale glutamate synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorness et al., 2020</xref>). This can mimic the effect of a loss of <italic>Adora1</italic> function that reduces SWS-SWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bjorness et al., 2009</xref>). It also predicts HD4cn’s effect to alter sleep gene expression in response to SD, consistent with the enrichment of SD genes by both HD4cn and <italic>Mef2c</italic>-cKO DEGs, that we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Generally, facilitation or depression of SWA correlates with up or down-scaling effects on cortical glutamate neurotransmission, respectively, even in the absence of a direct effect on sleep need (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Many reagents that reduce the excitability of glutamate pyramidal cells by various mechanisms, including anesthetics like isoflurane, barbiturates or benzodiazepines in addition to those activating ADORA1, increase SWA. Those agents that increase excitability of cortical glutamate pyramidal neurons, correlate with decreased SWA. Accordingly, SWA can be a marker for glutamate synaptic strength and number, modulated under normal conditions, by sleep function.</p><p>In summary, at the end of a long episode of waking, when sleep needs is high, glutamate synapses of ExIT cells in the frontal cortex are electro-physiologically strengthened, increased in functional number, and show increased AMPA/NMDA receptor ratio, together with decreased availability of silent synapses. The silent synapse conversion by LTP to active synapses is thus limited, creating a bias for increased strength at the expense of potentiating plasticity. In ExIT neuronal nuclei, the transcription factor, MEF2c is de-repressed by de-phosphorylation and sequestration of its co-repressors, the classII HDACs, pHDAC4/5, to the cytoplasm. This facilitates the transcription of sleep genes, including those encoding SSCs controlling glutamatergic synaptic phenotype and ASD risk genes. Recovery sleep recovers the functional phenotype. These observations suggest a daily oscillation from lowered glutamatergic synaptic strength and increased bias for potentiating plasticity at the start of the active phase when sleep need is low, to increased synaptic strength and saturated plasticity at the end of the active phase, when sleep need is high. In conclusion, we have provided electrophysiological evidence for a wake/sleep oscillation of glutamate synapse phenotype that can mediate a glutamatergic strength/meta-plasticity oscillating bias. We also show that this wake/sleep oscillation is likely to occur in glutamate synapses of ExIT pyramidal neurons and be mediated by a select set of synaptic shaping component genes, a significant number of which are also autism risk genes, whose expression is controlled by MEF2c and HD4 transcription factors. Finally, this study implicates a framework within which optimal cortical-dependent motor training can occur in a recursive incremental manner, facilitated by wake/sleep glutamate synapse phenotypical oscillation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>All electrophysiological animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experimental Committee at the University of Tsukuba.

The –90 mV holding potential was chosen according to precedent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Myme et al., 2003</xref>). The hyperpolarized holding potential increases driving force and permits lower stimulus strength for the same response size – reducing the likelihood of polysynaptic responses. Experiments with multiple response peaks at –90 mV were not included in the analysis. The –90 mV holding potential also increases NMDA receptor Mg block - resulting in a minimally contaminated AMPA response.</p><p>The AMPA/NMDA ratio was determined according to an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Myme et al., 2003</xref>); briefly, at least 10 traces were averaged at –90 mV and +50 mV, the AMPA response was calculated as the peak inward current at –90 mV and the NMDA current was calculated at +50 mV in a 5 ms window 40 ms after the AMPA peak.</p><p>Failure rates for AMPA and AMPA +NMDA EPSCs: Minimal stimulation was achieved by lowering the stimulation strength until clear successes and failures could be observed at –90 mV holding potential and stimulation strength was then kept constant for 5–10 min to allow the system to stabilize before failure ratios were determined. Relative numbers of silent and total (silent +active) synapses in an L2-3 pyramidal neuron evoked in a slice by minimal presynaptic stimulation is correlated with failure rates (FR=failures/number of stimuli). <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>90</mml:mn><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mtext>As</mml:mtext></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where As = number active synapses (at –90 mV) and Ss = number of silent synapses (only active at +50 mV).

Nuclei were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed with 4 ml ice-cold lysis buffer, and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the nuclei were resuspended in 500 μl of nucleus suspension buffer (NSB) containing 1x PBS, 1% BSA (no. AM2618, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.2 U μl−1 RNAse inhibitor (no. AM2694, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The nucleus suspension was filtered through a 70 μm Flowmi cell strainer (no. H13680-0070, Bel-Art). Debris was removed with density gradient centrifugation using Nuclei PURE 2 M sucrose cushion solution and Nuclei PURE sucrose cushion buffer from the Nuclei PURE prep isolation kit (no.

BCL files were demultiplexed using cell ranger mkfastq (10 X Genomics CellRanger suite v3.1.0). Resulting FASTQ files were then accessed for quality using FASTQC (v0.11.5). A reference mouse genome-annotation index was built for mouse genome (GRCm38p6) and Gencode annotation (vM17) using cell ranger mkref (10 X Genomics CellRanger suite v3.1.0). Quality passed FASTQ files were further aligned to reference mouse genome-annotation index and raw count matrices were generated using cellranger count (10 X Genomics CellRanger suite v3.1.0).

The authors expand on their previously published work (Bjorness et al., 2020) and draw from recent advances in the field to propose a neuron-centric molecular model for the accumulation and resolution of sleep need and basis of restorative sleep function. While speculative, the proposed model successfully links important observations in the field and provides a framework to stimulate further research and advances on the molecular basis of sleep function. In my review, I highlight the important advances of this current work, the clear merits of the proposed model, and indicate areas of the model that can serve to stimulate further investigation.</p><p>Strengths: Reviewer comment on new data in Vogt et al., 2024</p><p>Using classic slice electrophysiology, the authors conclude that wakefulness (sleep deprivation (SD)) drives a potentiation of excitatory glutamate synapses, mediated in large part by &quot;un-silencing&quot; of NMDAR-active synapses to AMPAR-active synapses. Using a modern single nuclear RNAseq approach the authors conclude that SD drives changes in gene expression primarily occurring in glutamatergic neurons. The two experiments combined highlight the accumulation and resolution of sleep need centered on the strength of excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons. This view is entirely consistent with a large body of extant and emerging literature and provides important direction for future research.</p><p>Consistent with prior work, wakefulness/SD drives an LTP-type potentiation of excitatory synaptic strength on principle cortical neurons. It has been proposed that LTP associated with wake, leads to the accumulation of sleep need by increasing neuronal excitability, and by the &quot;saturation&quot; of LTP capacity. This saturation subsequently impairs the capacity for further ongoing learning. This new data provides a satisfying mechanism of this saturation phenomenon by introducing the concept of silent synapses. The new data show that in mice well rested, a substantial number of synapses are &quot;silent&quot;, containing an NMDAR component but not AMPARs. Silent synapses provide a type of reservoir for learning in that activity can drive the un-silencing, increasing the number of functional synapses. SD depletes this reservoir of silent synapses to essentially zero, explaining how SD can exhaust learning capacity. Recovery sleep led to restoration of silent synapses, explaining how recovery sleep can renew learning capacity. In their prior work (Bjorness et al., 2020) this group showed that SD drives an increase in mEPSC frequency onto these same cortical neurons, but without a clear change in pre-synaptic release probability, implying a change in the number of functional synapses. This prediction is now born out in this new dataset.</p><p>The new snRNAseq dataset indicates the sleep need is primarily seen (at the transcriptional level) in excitatory neurons, consistent with a number of other studies. First, this conclusion is corroborated by two independent, contemporary snRNAseq analysis recently published in iScience 2024 doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2024.110752 and Neuroscience Research 2024 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neures.2024.03.004">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neures.2024.03.004</ext-link>. A recently published analysis on the effects of SD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaged synapses in every brain region in a cell-type dependent manner (Weiss et al., PNAS 2024), concluding that SD drives brain wide increases in synaptic strength almost exclusively in excitatory neurons. Further, Kim et al., Nature 2022, heavily cited in this work, show that the newly described SIK3-HDAC4/5 pathway promotes sleep depth via excitatory neurons and not inhibitory neurons.</p><p>The new experiments provided in Fig1-3 are expertly conducted and presented. This reviewer has no comments of concern regarding the execution and conclusions of these experiments.</p><p>Reviewer comment on model in Vogt et al., 2024</p><p>To the view of this reviewer the new model proposed by Vogt et al., is an important contribution. The model is not definitively supported by new data, and in this regard should be viewed as a perspective, providing mechanistic links between recent molecular advances, while still leaving areas that need to be addressed in future work. New snRNAseq analysis indicates SD drives expression of synaptic shaping components (SSCs) consistent with the excitatory synapse as a major target for the restorative basis of sleep function. SD induced gene expression is also enriched for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes. As pointed out by the authors, sleep problems are commonly reported in ASD, but the emphasis has been on sleep amount. This new analysis highlights the need to understand the impact on sleep's functional output (synapses) to fully understand the role of sleep problems in ASD.</p><p>Importantly, SD induced gene expression in excitatory neurons overlap with genes regulated by the transcription factor MEF2C and HDAC4/5 (Fig. 4). In their prior work, the authors show loss of MEF2C in excitatory neurons abolished the SD transcriptional response and the functional recovery of synapses from SD by recovery sleep. Recent advances identified HDAC4/5 as major regulators of sleep depth and duration (in excitatory neurons) downstream of the recently identified sleep promoting kinase SIK3. In Zhou et al., and Kim et al., Nature 2022, both groups propose a model whereby &quot;sleep-need&quot; signals from the synapse activate SIK3, which phosphorylates HDAC4/5, driving cytoplasmic targeting, allowing for the de-repression and transcriptional activation of &quot;sleep genes&quot;. Prior work shows that HDAC4/5 are repressors of MEF2C. Therefore, the &quot;sleep genes&quot; derepressed by HDAC4/5 may be the same genes activated in response to SD by MEF2C. The new model thereby extends the signaling of sleep need at synapses (through SIK3-HDAC4/5) to the functional output of synaptic recovery by expression of synaptic/sleep genes by MEF2C. The model thereby links aspects of expression of sleep need with the resolution of sleep need by mediating sleep function: synapse renormalization.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Areas for further investigation.</p><p>In the discussion section Vogt et al., explore the links between excitatory synapse strength, arguably the major target of &quot;sleep function&quot;, and NREM slow-wave activity (SWA), the most established marker of sleep need. SIK3-HDAC4/5 have major effects on the &quot;depth&quot; of sleep by regulation NREM-SWA. The effects of MEF2C loss of function on NREM SWA activity are less obvious, but clearly impact the recovery of glutamatergic synapses from SD. The authors point out how adenosine signaling is well established as a mediator of SWA, but the links with adenosine and glutamatergic strength are far from clear. The mechanistic links between SIK3/HDAC4/5, adenosine signaling, and MEF2C, are far from understood. Therefore, the molecular/mechanistic links between a synaptic basis of sleep need and resolution with NREM-SWA activity requires further investigation.</p><p>Additional work is also needed to understand the mechanistic links between SIK3-HDAC4/5 signaling and MEF2C activity. The authors point out that constitutively nuclear (cn) HDAC4/5 (acting as a repressor) will mimic MEF2C loss of function. This is reasonable, however, there are notable differences in the reported phenotypes of each. Notably, cnHDAC4/5 suppresses NREM amount and NREM SWA but had no effect on the NREM-SWA increase following SD (Zhou et al., Nature 2022). Loss of MEF2C in CaMKII neurons had no effect on NREM amount and suppressed the increase in NREM-SWA following SD (Bjorness et al., 2020). These instances indicate that cnHDAC4/5 and loss of MEF2C do not exactly match suggesting additional factors are relevant in these phenotypes. Likely HDAC4/5 have functionally important interactions with other transcription factors, and likewise for MEF2C, suggesting areas for future analysis.</p><p>One emerging theme may be that the SIK3-HDAC4/5 axis are major regulators of the sleep state, perhaps stabilizing the NREM state once the transition from wakefulness occurs. MEF2C is less involved in regulating sleep per se, and more involved in executing sleep function, by promoting the restorative synaptic modifications to resolve sleep need.</p><p>Finally, advances in the roles of the respective SIK3-HDAC4/5 and MEF2C pathways point towards transcription of &quot;sleep genes&quot;, as clearly indicated in the model of Fig.4. Clearly more work is needed to understand how the expression of such genes ultimately lead to resolution of sleep need by functional changes at synapses. What are these sleep genes and how do they mechanistically resolve sleep need? Thus, the current work provides a mechanistic framework to stimulate further advances in understanding the molecular basis for sleep need and the restorative basis of sleep function.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>No further comments or concerns.

This manuscript focuses in particular on AMPA/NMDA ratios. An interesting, although speculative, aspect of the manuscript is the inclusion of a model for the accumulation of sleep need that is based upon the MEF2C transcription factor but also links to the sleep-regulating SIK3-HDAC4/5 pathway. The authors have clarified some questions raised in the previous review, but the evidence for major claims was still found to be incomplete, requiring additional experimentation.</p></disp-quote><p>The major claims of this study are: (1) SD increases the AMPA/NMDA receptor ratio and RS restores it; (2) SD decreases silent synapses compared to CS and RS restores their number after SD; (3) the majority of SD-induced DEGs are found in ExIT cells (glutamate pyramidal neurons projecting within the telencephalon); (4) ExIT SD-induced DEGs are enriched for genes encoding synaptic shaping components and for autism spectrum disorder risk and; (5) these DEGs are also enriched for DEGs induced by <italic>Mef2c</italic> loss of function restricted to forebrain glutamate neurons (ExIT cells comprise a subset of these) and by over-expression of constitutively nuclear HDAC4 that represses MEF2c transcriptional function. The last claim is consistent with an intracellular signaling model (presented as a hypothesis to be tested, in figure 4B).</p><p>[The above is added to the start of the discussion section.]</p><p>The specific claims are supported by solid evidence provided in this manuscript. The statistical support is now more clearly presented, with several changes in response to queries by reviewer 1.</p><p>The technical issues raised by reviewer 1 do not detract from the claims, thus supported. The rationale for this assessment is expanded below in response to reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Vogt et al examines how the synaptic composition of AMPA and NMDA receptors changes over sleep and wake states. The authors perform whole-cell patch clamp recordings to quantify changes in silent synapse number across conditions of spontaneous sleep, sleep deprivation, and recovery sleep after deprivation. They also perform single nucleus RNAseq to identify transcriptional changes related to AMPA/NMDA receptor composition following spontaneous sleep and sleep deprivation. The findings of this study are consistent with a decrease in silent synapse number during wakefulness and an increase during sleep. However, these changes cannot be conclusively linked to sleep/wake states. Measurements were performed in motor cortex, and sleep deprivation was achieved by forced locomotion, raising the possibility that recent patterns of neuronal activity, rather than sleep/wake states, are responsible for the observed results.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study examines an important question. Glutamatergic synaptic transmission has been a focus of studies in the sleep field, but AMPA receptor function has been the primary target of these studies. Silent synapses, which contain NMDA receptors but lack AMPA receptors, have important functional consequences for the brain. Exploring the role of sleep in regulating silent synapse number is important to understanding the role of sleep in brain function. The electrophysiological approach of measuring the failure rate ratio, supported by AMPA/NMDA ratio measurements, is a rigorous tool to evaluate silent synapse number.</p><p>The authors also perform snRNAseq to identify genes differentially expressed in the spontaneous sleep and sleep deprivation groups. This analysis reveals an intriguing pattern of upregulated genes controlled by HDAC4 and Mef2c, along with synaptic shaping component genes and genes associated with autism spectrum disorder, across cell types in the sleep deprivation group. This unbiased approach identifies candidate genes for follow-up studies. The finding that ASD-risk genes are differentially expressed during SD also raises the intriguing possibility that normal sleep function is disrupted in ASD.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A major consideration to the interpretation of this study is the use of forced locomotion for sleep deprivation. Measurements are made from motor cortex, and therefore the effects observed could be due to differences in motor activity patterns across groups, rather than lack of sleep per se.</p></disp-quote><p>Experimentally induced lack of sleep always involves differences in motor activity. As previously noted in revision 1, motor learning is unlikely to occur in this paradigm and inspection of the video (in supplementary materials) shows no repetitive motor behavioral sequences during the sleep deprivation, nor can this be considered exercise due to the very slow speed of treadmill movement employed. The obvious major difference between groups is a lack of sleep per se. (See below in the “Recommendations for authors”, reviewer 1 for comments on localized wake activity inducing localized sleep-need responses)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Considering that other groups have failed to find a difference in AMPA/NMDA ratio in mice with different spontaneous sleep/wake histories (Bridi et al., Neuron 2020), confirmation of these findings in a different brain region would greatly strengthen the study.</p></disp-quote><p>The study of Bridi et al., Neuron 2020, is not comparable to our study for several important reasons. First, their compared groups were from different circadian phases (180 degrees out of phase), whereas in our study, the circadian times for each group were matched (ZT=6hours). Second, experimentally induced sleep loss did not occur whereas it was a focus of our study. Third, spontaneous sleep/wake cannot be accurately matched amongst subjects whereas in our study, sleep loss was matched exactly between groups.</p><p>We agree that assessment of AMPA/NMDA ratio and silent synapse number in sleep deprived compared to ad libitum sleep in other areas of the neocortex is of great interest and something we hope to pursue. It would not be surprising to find differences as preliminarily reported by Bahl, et al., Nat Commun. 2024 Jan 26;15(1):779. However, such data would not further strengthen our already well supported evidence for the differences we report in the motor cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The electrophysiological measurements and statistical analyses raise several questions. Input resistance (cutoffs and actual values) are not provided, making it difficult to assess recording quality.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in our first reply, these data were omitted (an admitted oversight on our part) but are now supplied in the methods section as, “Series resistance values for the recording pipette ranged between 8 and 15 MOhm and experiments with changes larger than 25% were not used for further analyses”. We have now also added the Rs/Rm (as a separate column) for each recorded neuron in table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Parametric one-way ANOVAs were used, although the data do not appear to be normally distributed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed all the One-way ANOVA tests for clarity (non-parametric tests were previously supplied in addition to the one-way ANOVA tests). Determination of significance with Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test has not altered statistical support for our conclusions.</p><p>Reviewer 1 correctly points out that we had not tested for normality of our distributions- the distributions are likely to be normal but the sample size is too small to confidently make this call for the ratio data which is why we removed the one-way ANOVA’s entirely from table 1.</p><p>Two-way ANOVA’s are used to assess AMPA and EPSC amplitudes and failure rates (table 1 tab 2&amp;5) across sleep conditions. As now indicated (table 1, tab 2&amp;5), the distributions of AMPA and NMDA amplitudes and FRs passed the D'Agostino &amp; Pearson test for normality and QQ plots provide illustration supporting this claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, for the AMPA/NMDA and FRR measurements (Figures 1E, F), the SD group (rather than the control sleep group) was used as the control group for post-hoc comparisons, but it is unclear why.</p></disp-quote><p>The label of “control group” is arbitrary. CS and RS groups are similar (sleep density for RS&gt;CS as expected). Since this appears to be confusing, we now compare all groups to one another in table 1 with the same statistical outcome (additional comparison of CS to RS).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the data appear in line with the authors' conclusions, the number of mice (3/group) and cells recorded is low, and adding more would better account for inter-animal variability and increase the robustness of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Of course, the larger the sample, the better the approximation to the population. Our sample sizes yielded significant differences at the usual p&lt;=0.05 threshold with non-parametric testing. A larger sample size could allow for normality testing of the distributions of the data, but fortunately, this was not necessary to support our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The snRNAseq data are intriguing. However, several genes relevant to the AMPA/NMDA ratio are mentioned, but the encoded proteins would be expected to have variable effects on AMPA/NMDA receptor trafficking and function, making the model presented in Figure 4C oversimplified. A more thorough discussion of the candidate genes and pathways that are upregulated during sleep deprivation, the spatiotemporal/posttranslational control of protein expression, and their effects on AMPA/NMDA trafficking vs function is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not studied the candidate genes at this point and do not yet understand their potential role(s) in sleep-related AMPA/NMDA functional ratio, only that their expression levels are altered with sleep condition. We agree with the reviewer that the data are intriguing and in need of further investigation. An important first step that can help direct such studies is the identification and preliminary characterization of good candidate genes with respect their cell type specificity, significance and fold change as we have done. Their potential roles likely depend on “the spatiotemporal/posttranslational control” and other factors as reviewer 1 notes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Here Vogt et al., provide new insights into the need for sleep and the molecular and physiological response to sleep loss. The authors expand on their previously published work (Bjorness et al., 2020) and draw from recent advances in the field to propose a neuron-centric molecular model for the accumulation and resolution of sleep need and basis of restorative sleep function. While speculative, the proposed model successfully links important observations in the field and provides a framework to stimulate further research and advances on the molecular basis of sleep function. In my review, I highlight the important advances of this current work, the clear merits of the proposed model, and indicate areas of the model that can serve to stimulate further investigation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Reviewer comment on new data in Vogt et al., 2024</p><p>Using classic slice electrophysiology, the authors conclude that wakefulness (sleep deprivation (SD)) drives a potentiation of excitatory glutamate synapses, mediated in large part by &quot;un-silencing&quot; of NMDAR-active synapses to AMPAR-active synapses. Using a modern single nuclear RNAseq approach the authors conclude that SD drives changes in gene expression primarily occurring in glutamatergic neurons. The two experiments combined highlight the accumulation and resolution of sleep need centered on the strength of excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons. This view is entirely consistent with a large body of extant and emerging literature and provides important direction for future research.</p><p>Consistent with prior work, wakefulness/SD drives an LTP-type potentiation of excitatory synaptic strength on principle cortical neurons. It has been proposed that LTP associated with wake, leads to the accumulation of sleep need by increasing neuronal excitability, and by the &quot;saturation&quot; of LTP capacity. This saturation subsequently impairs the capacity for further ongoing learning. This new data provides a satisfying mechanism of this saturation phenomenon by introducing the concept of silent synapses. The new data show that in mice well rested, a substantial number of synapses are &quot;silent&quot;, containing an NMDAR component but not AMPARs. Silent synapses provide a type of reservoir for learning in that activity can drive the un-silencing, increasing the number of functional synapses. SD depletes this reservoir of silent synapses to essentially zero, explaining how SD can exhaust learning capacity. Recovery sleep led to restoration of silent synapses, explaining how recovery sleep can renew learning capacity.

These factors can include their phosphorylation state, genomic accessibility, and interaction with other transcription factors. All these other factors are known to be both cell type specific and determined by intracellular conditions, that in turn, are affected by extracellular conditions and ligands.

The term, sleep, is typically used to describe the behavioral state of sleep that acts as a permissive gate to sleep function (that resolves sleep need). The sleep state should not be conflated with sleep function.

However, given that previous studies have failed to find a difference in AMPA/NMDA ratio following spontaneous sleep vs wake, confirmation of the findings in a non-motor brain region with the same SD technique (or confirmation within motor cortex with a different technique, although the authors correctly point out that other techniques also increase locomotor activity) would greatly strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed above</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Notably, differences in motor activity patterns, not necessarily overall amount of locomotion, may induce differential synaptic changes between groups.

Local sleep and learning. Nature. 2004;430(6995):78-81); Huber et al., 2006 in the motor cortex. Since SWS-SWA is considered a marker for sleep homeostasis, the altered motor activity induced increase of SWS-SWA was considered evidence for sleep-related function. Our earlier work has clearly shown that the treadmill method of SD increases frontal cortical SWS-SWA rebound, indicating a sleep-homeostatic process (Bjorness et al., 2016; Bjorness et al., 2020).

This provided (as stated in the results section) rationale to examine, and to only draw conclusions from the AMPA/NMDA amplitude and FR ratios.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I appreciate clarification on the statistics and the authors' response has answered some of my questions. However, this also raises additional questions. What test was used to determine normality (and therefore whether to perform a parametric vs nonparametrictest)?</p></disp-quote><p>Described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why was the FRR data analysis changed to a parametric test, when it does not appear that the data are normally distributed?</p></disp-quote><p>Showing the parametric test was a mistake on our part- there are not enough samples to conclusively conclude the distributions are normal as reviewer 1 correctly suspects. However, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests that we also show in table 1 indicate significant differences between conditions and the non-parametric, two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli, indicates significant differences between CS-SD and RS-SD but not for CS-RS, supporting our conclusions. The (unsupported) parametric tests are now removed in Table 1 leaving behind the non-parametric test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why were post-hoc tests chosen to compare to a control group rather than all pairwise comparisons,</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide post-hoc all-pairwise comparisons to give the same results using the BKY analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>and why was the SD rather than CS group used as the control in Figures 1E and F?</p><p>Why were different post-hoc tests chosen for the data in Figures 1E, F?</p></disp-quote><p>There was no need for this and we now, only show statistics that are used to draw our conclusions for the AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratios data shown in Figure 1E and Failure Rate Ratios data shown in Figure 1F (the conclusions are supported by the non-parametric post-hoc test and remain unchanged).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Genes in the SSC, ASD, Mef2cKO, and HD4cn categories are almost exclusively upregulated in the SD group compared to the CS group (Figure 4A). As the authors point out in their response, &quot;No claim of mechanism linking the changed expression to altered AMPAR or NMDAR activity can be made at this point,&quot; largely due to the fact that we do not know the spatiotemporal or posttranslational modification patterns of the translated proteins, and how they affect receptor trafficking vs function. This is in agreement with my original point: as written (and as illustrated in Figure 4C), the manuscript implies that upregulation during SD increases the AMPA/NMDA ratio via receptor trafficking,</p></disp-quote><p>The model indicates a likely (but not necessarily exclusive) role for AMPA/NMDA trafficking to explain the functional electrophysiological data that we do report and which is not in dispute. The SSC-DEGs in ExIT cells are consistent with sleep-altered AMPA/NMDA trafficking but remain only a correlation. However, the point is taken and Figure 4c has been revised to only reflect what we have observed electrophysiologically and the speculated mechanism(s) mediated by observed SSC-DEGs are illustrated with “?’s”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>while in reality the picture is likely much more complicated, and therefore a more thorough discussion is warranted. Some discussion was provided in the authors' response but does not appear to have been incorporated into the text or Figure 4C.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above the proposed model is changed in Figure 4c to more explicitly indicate which aspects reflect our electrophysiological data and which aspects reflect only an association of observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Please justify only using male mice</p></disp-quote><p>We had to start somewhere with our limited resources. Our intentions are to follow up with similar experiments using female mice, should funding be realized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The model in Figure 4C is oversimplified and remains problematic, for the reasons stated in comment #6, above.</p></disp-quote><p>See responses above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 4D remains confusing</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. The unnecessary addition of adenosine effects on cholinergic arousal centers (experimentally well supported), have been removed from the figure to provide a more focused indication of how SWS-SWA can be related to either MEF2c and/or to ADORA1 activation through reduction of glutamate synaptic strength. ADORA1 activation elicits reduced glutamate synaptic activity through pre- and postsynaptic inhibition whereas MEF2c activation is essential to reduce sleep elicited, glutamate EPSC reduction. Reduced glutamate synaptic strength, whatever the cause, is associated with increased SWS-SWA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
