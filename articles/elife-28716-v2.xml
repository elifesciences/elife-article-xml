assembly of natively unfolded polypeptides, which contain phenylalanine-glycine (FG) binding sites for nuclear transport receptors. The architecture and dynamics of the FG-network have been refractory to characterization due to the paucity of experimental methods able to probe the mobility and density of the FG-polypeptides and embedded macromolecules within intact NPCs. Combining fluorescence polarization, super-resolution microscopy, and mathematical analyses, we examined the rotational mobility of fluorescent probes at various locations within the FG-network under different conditions. We demonstrate that polarization PALM (p-PALM) provides a rich source of information about low rotational mobilities that are inaccessible with bulk fluorescence anisotropy approaches, and anticipate that p-PALM is well-suited to explore numerous crowded cellular environments. In total, our findings indicate that the NPC’s internal organization consists of multiple dynamic environments with different local properties.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28716.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most of the genetic material inside an animal cell is enclosed within a compartment called the nucleus. This compartment is separated from the rest of the cell by the nuclear envelope, a double-membrane structure containing thousands of pores that selectively allow certain molecules (collectively referred to as cargo) to enter and exit the nucleus.</p><p>The movement of cargo through the pores is controlled by large groups of proteins called nuclear pore complexes. The pore is at the center of the complex and is filled by a selective barrier made of an extensive network of flexible proteins known as the FG-network. Other proteins known as nuclear transport receptors bind to the proteins in the FG-network and carry cargos through the barrier.</p><p>The properties of the nuclear pore barrier and how it rapidly selects the right cargos have been difficult to study, in part, because the barrier network is constantly changing and is crowded with hundreds of transport receptors. New techniques are needed to investigate such highly crowded environments inside cells. Now, Fu et al. use a technique called polarization photoactivated localization microscopy (p-PALM) to explore the molecular crowding within the nuclear pore barrier in human cells. This technique measures the freedom with which a single molecule embedded in the network can rotate, providing information about the local environment. In a crowded environment, it is harder for the probe molecule to rotate as it is more likely to bump into other molecules.</p><p>Fu et al. found that there are different levels of crowding within the barrier. This is consistent with previous ideas of how the pore barrier could work, which propose that the nuclear transport receptors are less tightly packed in the center of the FG-network. This enables transport receptor and cargo complexes to move more rapidly through the center of the pore. The molecular crowding in the barrier of nuclear pores parallels that observed in other cellular compartments that also rely on assemblies of proteins with flexible structures. Thus, future work using p-PALM is expected to reveal more details about the biophysical properties of nuclear pores as well as those of other structures inside cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nuclear pores</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>PALM</kwd><kwd>polarization PALM</kwd><kwd>rotational diffusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM084062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musser</surname><given-names>Siegfried M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BE-1541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musser</surname><given-names>Siegfried M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian National Science and Engineering Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2016-06591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zilman</surname><given-names>Anton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The super-resolution fluorescence microscopy approach polarization PALM (p-PALM) reveals that macromolecular crowding and inhomogeneity within nuclear pores generate a structurally and dynamically complex permeability barrier.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracellular environments are highly crowded, with typical local macromolecular concentrations of ~80–400 mg/mL, and some cellular environments contain only ~50% water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuznetsova et al., 2014</xref>). Under crowded conditions, excluded volume effects and local interactions can change protein activities by over an order of magnitude compared with the 'dilute' solutions typically used for most in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aumiller et al., 2014</xref>). Crowded conditions can affect protein folding, structure, shape, conformational stability and dynamics, binding interactions, and enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuznetsova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Biological polymers play central roles in generating a variety of crowded environments. For example, the polymers in mucus, the extracellular matrix, the cytoskeleton, the vitreous humor of the eye, and the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) produce complex environments that restrict diffusion and trap molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Leterrier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lieleg and Ribbeck, 2011</xref>). In addition, the numerous distinct bodies/granules within the nucleus and the cytoplasm have been interpreted to form via a phase separation-like mechanism due to high local concentrations of self-cohesive nucleic acid and/or intrinsically disordered protein polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aumiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</xref>). Characterization of the physical, structural, dynamical, and functional properties of these crowded environments remains challenging due to the dearth of appropriate tools that are needed to investigate the complexity and heterogeneity of these environments on the nanoscale.</p><p>One example of a crowded environment is the pore of the NPC, which mediates bidirectional traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The translocation passageway of the NPC is occupied by hundreds of intrinsically disordered polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Peleg and Lim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Suntharalingam and Wente, 2003</xref>), 50–100 nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Tokunaga et al., 2008</xref>), and protein and nucleic acid cargo complexes moving in opposite directions. NTRs are classified as importins or exportins, reflecting their ability to carry cargos into or out of the nucleus, respectively (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chook and Süel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Güttler and Görlich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jamali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Stewart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Wente and Rout, 2010</xref>]). On the nuclear side, RanGTP promotes disassembly of NTR/cargo import complexes, freeing the cargo and allowing NTRs to diffuse back to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chook and Blobel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Izaurralde et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Rexach and Blobel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Siomi et al., 1997</xref>). NTR/cargo/RanGTP export complexes are disassembled on the cytoplasmic side after GTP hydrolysis, which results from interactions with RanGAP and a Ran-binding protein (RanBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bischoff and Görlich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bischoff et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Güttler and Görlich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kutay et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Okamura et al., 2015</xref>). Many of these assembly and disassembly reactions are coordinated to occur at the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic exits of the NPC’s central pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Sun et al., 2008</xref>).

They are comprised of ~30 different nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins, or Nups), each of which are thought to be present in an integer multiple of eight copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cronshaw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Rout and Aitchison, 2001</xref>). The vertebrate NPC has an outer diameter of ~120 nm, and extends ~200 nm along the transport axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Stoffler et al., 1999</xref>). Eight flexible filaments extend ~50 nm into the cytoplasm, and an additional eight filaments extend ~75 nm into the nucleoplasm and terminate in a ring to form the nuclear basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Stoffler et al., 2003</xref>). In humans, the hourglass-shaped central pore has a minimum diameter of ~50 nm and a length of ~85 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Maimon et al., 2012</xref>). Within this large pore and decorating its openings is a network of ~200–250 intrinsically disordered polypeptides, which generates a permeability barrier impeding macromolecular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Peleg and Lim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Suntharalingam and Wente, 2003</xref>) and which is particularly selective against larger cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Popken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Timney et al., 2016</xref>). These disordered polypeptides contain, in total, 3000–4000 phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats to which NTRs transiently bind as they carry cargos through NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cronshaw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Denning et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Rout et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Strawn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Tran and Wente, 2006</xref>). We term this assembly of intrinsically disordered FG-containing polypeptides the FG-network.</p><p>Each FG-containing nucleoporin (FG-Nup) has a globular anchor domain that is embedded in or attached to the NPC scaffold, and thus, it acts as an anchor point for the flexible and mobile FG-domain. The FG-repeat motifs are separated by short (~10–20 amino acid residues), largely hydrophilic segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Denning and Rexach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>). The FG-domains do not form readily recognizable secondary structures, but rather are more appropriately described as flexible polymers with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>). The FG-network is sufficiently fluid and mobile that it is rapidly displaced by transporting cargos, which can be up to ~40 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frey and Görlich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hough et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Milles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Panté and Kann, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The ‘polymer brush’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Peleg and Lim, 2010</xref>) and ‘hydrogel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frey et al., 2006</xref>) models are the most widely cited descriptions of the biophysical nature of FG-polypeptide assemblies. These models are two extremes in the model space describing the potential morphologies and properties of the FG-Nup assemblies within the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eisele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Vovk et al., 2016</xref>). The polymer brush model postulates that the FG-polypeptides are largely non-interacting (beyond steric repulsion), relatively extended and minimally entangled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Peleg and Lim, 2010</xref>), and their spatial assemblies are stabilized mostly by entropic forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Vovk et al., 2016</xref>). The hydrogel model posits that the FG-polypeptides exhibit significant inter- and intra-strand cohesiveness via FG-FG interactions, which results in a connected dense network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frey and Görlich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>). A hybrid, two-gate model postulates brush-like structures on both cytoplasmic and nuclear sides of the NPC, suitable for binding and (dis)assembly reactions, and a central cohesive structure in the center of the pore that provides the permeability barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Patel et al., 2007</xref>). The spatial distribution of functional activities in this two-gate model is supported by single molecule transport results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Tu et al., 2013</xref>). Quantitative modeling of FG-polypeptide behavior predicts a smooth transition between brush-like and gel-like behaviors in response to relatively small changes in physical properties and favors a picture intermediate between a brush and a gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Vovk et al., 2016</xref>). The magnitude of the inter- and intra-chain cohesiveness that differentiates these two descriptions could be different for different FG-polypeptides, or different segments of the same FG-polypeptides, in distinct spatial locations within the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Vovk et al., 2016</xref>). Avidity calculations indicate that the multivalent affinities of NTRs depend critically upon the local free FG-repeat concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Tu et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with these predictions, experimental results indicate that some sub-populations of NTRs have very long dissociation times, and therefore, they potentially can form an integral part of the permeability barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kapinos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Schleicher et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the FG-polypeptides and NTRs act together to form different local environments with different properties within the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coalson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ghavami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eskandari Nasrabad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Osmanović et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Tagliazucchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Considering the uncertainty in the structural arrangement of and interactions between FG-polypeptides, and knowing that many tens to over a hundred macromolecules (including NTRs, Ran, and cargos) interact with the FG-network during steady-state transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Arish et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Tokunaga et al., 2008</xref>), developing a general picture of FG-polypeptide distributions and local crowding conditions, and discerning their functional effects on cargo transport, is a challenging problem, but nevertheless essential for establishing the mechanism of nucleocytoplasmic transport and its implications. Here, we used the super-resolution approach photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>) to probe the locations of a number of FG-polypeptides and transport-related proteins within the NPC. Our main focus, however, was on using polarization PALM (p-PALM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gould et al., 2008</xref>) to measure rotational mobility, which is sensitive to local crowding conditions, and which enables probing of the local properties of crowded macromolecular assemblies that are currently inaccessible by other means. Crucially, we developed a theoretical model that enables detailed analysis of the experimental p-PALM data in terms of rotational diffusion constants. While numerous previous super-resolution approaches on NPCs utilized fixed samples, and most concentrated on scaffold structural questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Löschberger et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Otsuka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Pleiner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Szymborska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Winterflood and Ewers, 2014</xref>), the NPCs in our samples were fully functional since our goal was to probe the properties of the FG-network, which is intrinsically dynamic. The results of our analysis of protein localization and local mobility within the NPC demonstrate that the FG-network is heterogeneous with regard to molecular crowding and that this can be influenced by the presence of embedded proteins, which argues for a remarkable complexity in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathways and their regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The polarization PALM (p-PALM) method</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Motivation for the p-PALM method</title><p>The mobility of many molecules varies widely and often during their lifetime within cells, dependent on viscosity, crowding and local interactions. Most often measured is translational mobility, and numerous super-resolution light microscopy approaches have been developed over the past decade suitable for this purpose (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Huang et al., 2009</xref>] for reviews). Highly localized effects, such as those produced by multiple binding interactions or increases in crowding, often produce small changes in translational mobility (nanometer-scale step sizes in milliseconds) that are very difficult, if not impossible, to detect by these methods. However, these environmental changes can produce significant and detectable changes in <italic>rotational</italic> mobility. We surmised that the rotational mobility of a probe within the FG-network of NPCs would be strongly influenced by the densities of the FG-polypeptides and other macromolecules, such as NTRs, that increase crowding and decrease mobility of the FG-polypeptides, and therefore, we developed a method that could detect differences in rotational mobility.</p><p>Our basic approach was to genetically attach a photoactivatable fluorescent protein to different FG-polypeptides, and at different locations within an FG-polypeptide, in order to determine the rotational mobility of this fluorescent probe in different environments within the FG-network. Fluorescence polarization measurements are often used for probing rotational motion and are readily applied at the single molecule level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Forkey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Forkey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ha et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Harms et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Loman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Testa et al., 2008</xref>). However, single molecule polarization measurements within the NPC pose a special challenge: since the NPC has eight-fold rotational symmetry, any Nup genetically tagged with a fluorescent protein (or chemically tagged with a dye) will be present in numerous copies, and therefore, due to their proximity, the diffraction-limited emission from individual fluorescent tags will overlap significantly, thereby complicating analysis. Consequently, we combined single molecule polarization measurements with PALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>), in which probe molecules are stochastically and individually photoactivated. In this approach, termed polarization PALM (p-PALM), single fluorescent protein molecules were activated as in PALM, but the emission was split by a polarizer onto separate halves of an EMCCD camera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), enabling polarization measurements to be made on individual molecules. As we show, there are significant advantages of this single molecule approach over ensemble fluorescence polarization methods.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28716.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>p-PALM imaging.</title><p>The fluorescent protein mEos3 was photoactivated by UV illumination (405 nm), and excited by linearly or circularly polarized 561 nm light.

However, a quantitative relationship between rotational diffusion constants and p-PALM measurements has not been reported. In our analysis, we explored the different rotational time regimes and now more fully describe the parameter space, which is essential to interpret the results and provides numerous additional insights into the power of the approach.

These simulations revealed that p-PALM can detect changes occurring on timescales that are largely inaccessible by other means. The details of the experimental approach and simulations are described in the <bold>Materials and methods</bold> section. An overview of the approach and the general results of our analysis are summarized in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Outline of the p-PALM method</title><p>The main principle of p-PALM experiments is that rotational mobility information is extracted not from the average bulk polarization, but from polarization measurements obtained from thousands of individual molecules that are pooled to generate polarization frequency histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The primary experimental readouts from these data are the average polarization, &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;, and the variance of the polarization distribution, Var(<italic>p</italic>). In addition, the overall shape of polarization histograms and photon scatterplots can provide additional clues as to the underlying physical constraints on the probe’s rotational mobility. Polarization was defined as <italic>p</italic> = (<italic>gI<sub>p</sub> – I<sub>s</sub></italic>)/(<italic>gI<sub>p</sub></italic> + <italic>I<sub>s</sub></italic>), where <italic>I<sub>p</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>s</sub></italic> are the fluorescence intensities measured for each single molecule spot in the two polarization channels, and <italic>g</italic> corrects for the different photon collection efficiencies of these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Harms et al., 1999</xref>). We used a measurement timescale (10 ms) comparable to the timescale of protein import by the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Grünwald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Tu and Musser, 2011</xref>). For circularly polarized excitation, the average polarization (&lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>cir</sub>) as well as the peak of the distribution are theoretically always 0 (for uniformly distributed dipole orientations), providing a convenient check on instrument alignment and calibration (see below and <bold>Materials and methods</bold>), but providing no information on rotational mobility. Instead, the histogram width, quantified as Var(<italic>p</italic>), provides an estimate of the rotational mobility, with increasing width corresponding to decreasing rotational mobility (lower <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values). Since slowly rotating molecules emit from distinct orientations during the data collection period, a wider range of polarization values are obtained for lower <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values, whereas rapidly rotating probes yield time-averaged polarizations near zero.

The contributions of each of these experimentally determined conditions on &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt; and Var(<italic>p</italic>) are more explicitly illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>. The five rotational diffusion regimes (identified in (<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>)) are characterized as follows. (<italic>Regime I – very fast rotation</italic>) During the excited state of the fluorophore, the transition dipole orientation is virtually completely randomized. All measurements of <italic>p</italic> from collecting hundreds of photons are therefore close to 0 for each molecule, and hence, the polarization histograms are narrowly centered around 0 for both excitation modes. (<italic>Regime II – fast rotation</italic>) The fluorescent particle rotates significantly during its fluorescence lifetime, but the dipole orientation when excited influences the direction (polarization) of the observed emission. Thus, emission is preferentially observed toward the direction of linearly polarized excitation. However, the transition dipole is completely randomized <italic>between excitation events</italic>. Therefore, polarizations measured using circularly polarized excitation remain closely centered around 0. (<italic>Regime III – moderate rotation</italic>) The fluorescent particle does not rotate significantly during its fluorescence lifetime, and thus, linear excitation leads to strongly biased emission, with &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> ≈ 0.4. However, the transition dipole is essentially completely randomized between excitation events, and therefore, measured polarizations using circular excitation are closely centered around 0. (<italic>Regime IV – slow rotation</italic>) The transition dipole rotates between excitation events, but does not get completely randomized. Thus, individual polarization measurements are broadly distributed, with a width determined by the relationship between τ (is this the correct greek letter &quot;tau&quot;?) and <italic>D<sub>r</sub>.</italic> (<italic>Regime V – very slow rotation</italic>) The transition dipole does not rotate significantly between excitation events. This time regime corresponds to particles that are essentially ‘stuck’, and returns all polarizations for a particle randomly oriented in three-dimensions. The threshold significantly affects &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt; and Var(<italic>p</italic>) under conditions where the molecules are essentially immobile (regime V). Under circularly polarized excitation, dipoles having a large axial component are largely invisible when there is a 100 photon threshold due to the low excitation probability by the beam propagating in the <italic>z</italic>-direction. This causes a central dip in the histogram for <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> = 0.1 rad<sup>2</sup>/s with circular excitation (observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <italic>black</italic>, but not here in (<bold>D</bold>), due to the absence of a threshold), which increases Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> (compare (<bold>C</bold>) with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). With linearly <italic>x</italic>-polarized excitation under low <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> conditions, molecules with negative polarizations are largely undetectable when there is a 100 photon threshold due to inefficient excitation (compare (<bold>B</bold>), <italic>black</italic>, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

This approach largely eliminated depolarization effects that normally result from focusing an excitation beam toward the <italic>z</italic>-axis (optical axis) by a high numerical aperture (NA = 1.46) objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ha et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Olivini et al., 2001</xref>). The p-PALM approach does not require the high spatial precision typically obtained from super-resolution methods, which minimizes the need for high precision image alignment. Rather, polarization measurements are based on <italic>intensities</italic>, and spatial localizations are only necessary for spot correlation between the <italic>p</italic>- and <italic>s</italic>-channels. Thus, relatively low photon counts are acceptable. The excitation intensity was adjusted for all of our experiments so that the average total emission intensity was typically ~300–400 photons (<italic>N<sub>photons</sub></italic>). While the number of photons collected from an individual molecule in the two imaging channels depends on the 3D orientation trajectory of the probe dipole during image acquisition, we emphasize that our method does not require knowledge of the individual 3D rotational trajectories of each probe. Instead, the average rotational mobility is inferred from the statistical properties of experimental polarization frequency histograms by comparison with the theoretically predicted values calculated from simulated rotational random walk trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <bold>Materials and methods</bold>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>Five rotational mobility regimes</title><p>Generally, for a given single molecule, the photons collected in a single image correspond to hundreds of excitation/emission cycles, during and between each of which the probe might rotate. Throughout this paper, we have assumed that the excitation and emission dipoles of the fluorescent particle are parallel (hereafter simply referred to as the transition dipole), which is the case for GFP and many fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ha et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Inoué et al., 2002</xref>). Our theoretical model of rotational diffusion (based on rotational random walk simulations – see <bold>Materials and methods</bold>) revealed five important rotational diffusion regimes in p-PALM experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; more fully described and illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These rotational diffusion regimes are defined by two time parameters, the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore (τ<sub>F</sub>) and the image integration time (<italic>t</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The τ<sub>F</sub> determines the time for the molecule to rotate between excitation and fluorescence emission. In combination with the number of photons collected, <italic>t</italic> determines the average time allotted for the molecule to rotate between potential excitation events (τ). In rotational random walk simulations, τ was calculated from <italic>t</italic> and the number of rotational walk steps (<italic>N<sub>S</sub></italic>) as τ = <italic>t</italic>/<italic>N<sub>S</sub></italic>, and was typically ~3-7 µs. Photon collection after each rotational walk step was dependent on excitation and emission probabilities of the dipole and the collection efficiency of the microscope channels. <italic>N<sub>S</sub></italic> was set to approximately yield the experimentally collected number of photons (see <bold>Materials and methods</bold>). In general, the relationship between <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> and &lt;<italic>p&gt;</italic> or Var(<italic>p</italic>) cannot be obtained analytically. However, our simulations of rotational diffusion were verified with an analytical solution for a special case (see <bold>Materials and methods</bold> and <bold>Appendix 2</bold>).</p><p>Considering the five rotational diffusion regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), Regimes I and II correspond to the rotational mobility probed in most bulk fluorescence anisotropy experiments, where the increase in anisotropy at lower <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values is described by the Perrin equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>). However, as demonstrated in the following sections, experimental polarization measurements from probes within the crowded FG-network of NPCs correspond to the slower rotational mobilities in Regimes III and IV. Linear excitation is primarily useful for molecules with high rotational mobility (Regimes I and II), where &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> varies from 0 to ~0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In single molecule experiments at lower <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values (Regimes IV and V), the fluctuations in &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> strongly depend on thresholding and noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Circular excitation is preferred over linear excitation for Regime IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) due to the larger dynamic range in Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> and because this parameter is less sensitive to acquisition parameters than &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Consequently, we primarily used circular excitation for the results that follow.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>Differences between bulk and single molecule polarization measurements</title><p>Importantly, the single molecule average polarization (&lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub>) as defined in this paper and the average bulk fluorescence polarization (<italic>p</italic><sub>bulk</sub>) obtained using linear excitation differ significantly, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. There are two reasons for this. First, the intensities collected by a microscope objective are mixtures of parallel and perpendicular intensities. Correcting for these mixed intensities (see <bold>Materials and methods</bold>) yields &lt;<italic>p&gt;</italic><sub>lin,c</sub>, which agrees with <italic>p</italic><sub>bulk</sub>, except at low <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). And second, the remaining difference between &lt;<italic>p&gt;</italic><sub>lin,c</sub> and <italic>p</italic><sub>bulk</sub> that occurs at low rotational mobilities results from different weightings for each molecule’s fluorescence emission. That is, &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin,c</sub> is calculated by weighting each molecule identically (i.e., the polarization of each molecule counts the same no matter how many photons are emitted), whereas <italic>p</italic><sub>bulk</sub> weights the contribution of each molecule to the measured polarization depending on the number of photons emitted. Consequently, since most polarizations are recovered in p-PALM experiments under low rotational mobility conditions, &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> (and &lt;<italic>p&gt;</italic><sub>lin,c</sub>) tends toward 0 at low <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values, although this decrease is limited by the sensitivity threshold. In contrast, dipoles oriented at large angles relative to the excitation polarization emit few photons, and therefore provide only a small contribution to <italic>p</italic><sub>bulk</sub>. A mathematical description of the differences between p-PALM and bulk polarization measurements is given in <bold>Materials and methods</bold>. Notably, Var(<italic>p</italic>) cannot be obtained from bulk measurements because it requires polarization measurements from individual molecules, and hence, the quantification of slow rotational mobility made possible with p-PALM experiments cannot be obtained in a corresponding bulk experiment. Whereas anisotropy is favored as the measurement parameter for bulk fluorescence measurements, which typically have a parallel and two perpendicular channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>), polarization is a natural parameter for p-PALM measurements since there are only the two detection channels (<italic>p</italic> and <italic>s</italic>), neither of which can be used to directly account for the photons that escape detection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-5"><title><italic>Effect of anisotropic rotation of the probe on</italic> &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt; and Var(<italic>p</italic>)</title><p>The approach taken in many of the experiments reported herein was to explore various local environments of the FG-network by covalently attaching an mEos3 probe to different FG-polypeptides and measuring its rotational mobility by p-PALM. Under such conditions, the principal rotational diffusion constants of the probe could be differentially affected relative to a freely diffusing spherical particle due to constraints generated by the local environment and/or by the FG-polypeptide to which it was tethered. We therefore used rotational random walk simulations to determine the effect of varying the relationship between the three principal rotational diffusion constants <italic>D<sub>x</sub></italic>, <italic>D<sub>y</sub></italic>, and <italic>D<sub>z</sub></italic>. Somewhat surprisingly, our results and simulations suggested that the probe’s rotation mobility behavior was at most only slightly anisotropic or the angle between the dominant rotational axis and the transition dipole was near the magic angle of 54.7° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Axelrod, 1989</xref>). Consequently, the probe’s behavior largely resembled that of an untethered spherical particle.

More importantly, the effective NA (NA<sub>eff</sub>) under the acquisition conditions can be significantly different than the nominal NA of the objective.

In the presence of WGA (1 mg/mL; ~26 μM), the difference between linear and circular excitation was clearly observed, with circular excitation producing a substantially wider polarization histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>). WGA binds to O-GlcNAc-modified Nups, of which there are at least five in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Finlay and Forbes, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>). Since the WGA dimer has eight GlcNAc-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Schwefel et al., 2010</xref>), WGA molecules can potentially non-covalently ‘crosslink’ the FG-network, and thus severely inhibit the rotational mobility of proteins embedded within it.

Most studies describe Pom121 as having a single transmembrane domain (TMD) near its N-terminus, based primarily on a single long sequence of hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Funakoshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hallberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Söderqvist and Hallberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Söderqvist et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Talamas and Hetzer, 2011</xref>). This topology would place the N-terminus of Pom121 in the perinuclear space (between the inner and outer NE membranes), and thus, inaccessible to exogenous reagents such as WGA.

These ‘middle’ labeled Nup98 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were all localized to NPCs. In as-isolated permeabilized cells, rotational mobility was reduced when the mEos3 probe was attached near the Nup98 C-terminal folded domain. These data suggest more crowded conditions near the NPC scaffold than at the tip of Nup98 (which is likely found most of the time toward the center of the pore or on the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic sides, i.e., near the ‘surface’ of the FG-network). Imp β1 did not further affect rotational mobility relative to the as-isolated cells, yet WGA had a significant effect on the probe at all positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Notably, WGA had the strongest effect on the rotational mobility of the probe on mEos3-<sup>400mid</sup>Nup98, indicating that larger WGA-induced effects occurred near the middle of the Nup98 disordered region rather than near its FG-polypeptide tip (N-terminus) or the anchor domain (APD domain). These data indicate that different segments of an FG-polypeptide domain experience different environments within the FG-network.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-5"><title>Mixed populations</title><p>In all our p-PALM experiments, the mEos3 probe was attached to a single location on the protein of interest. Nonetheless, different probe molecules could potentially be in different environments of the FG-network due to the length and flexibility of the FG-polypeptide to which they were attached and/or variable environments within the same or different NPCs. The presence of a mixed population is not obviously apparent in values of &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt; and Var(<italic>p</italic>), since these are obtained by averaging over the population. However, polarization frequency histograms and scatterplots of the photons recovered in the <italic>p-</italic> and <italic>s</italic>-channels (photon scatterplots) both can provide evidence for populations of probes with distinct rotational mobilities. In both cases, the distributions obtained from simulations of molecules with different rotational mobilities can be combined and compared with the experimental data to test/verify the mixed population hypothesis.</p><p>There were multiple indications that the mEos3 probes in some of our p-PALM experiments sampled multiple environments distinguishable by different rotational mobilities. One example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The broad wings of the polarization histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> were not expected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, a photon scatterplot for Pom121-mEos3 reveals a substantially wider distribution of points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) than simulated scatterplots that assume a homogeneous population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). In contrast, a model that assumes a mixture of two sub-populations of molecules having distinct <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values yields good agreement with the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). This example demonstrates that evidence for a mixed population can be obtained from both the polarization histogram and the photon scatterplot of a given dataset. Therefore, for more accurate interpretation, the underlying data should be more carefully examined rather than relying on the summary values &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt; and Var(<italic>p</italic>). <bold>Appendix 1</bold> contains further discussion and additional evidence for mixed populations within our p-PALM datasets.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28716.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Analysis of rotational mobility within mixed populations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatterplot of the numbers of photons collected in the <italic>p</italic>- and <italic>s</italic>-polarization channels for Pom121-mEos3 (data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <italic>N</italic> = 3463).

These maps were generated by determining the position of the NE, and aligning clusters of spots based on their centroids. This procedure positioned the centroids of all clusters on the central axis of the NPC. This approach was necessary since there were at most a few tens of spots per NPC, and we had no independent marker for the NPC scaffold. Thus, while the axial dimension was calibrated based on the NE position, the lateral dimension was artificially squeezed. Consequently, probes on the periphery of the pore may appear to be centrally distributed in these PALM density maps. In particular, while the probes on the N-terminus of Pom121 appear to be in the center of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), we consider this to be a consequence of the alignment procedure.</p><p>The observed locations vis-à-vis the transport axis for the mEos3 probe attached to the FG-polypeptides generally agreed with previous published results. The mEos3 probe on the N-terminus of Pom121 yielded a distribution pattern along the transport axis that peaked within the central pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), consistent with a short polypeptide segment anchoring it to the NPC scaffold. In contrast, the mEos3 probe on the C-terminus of Pom121 was more widely distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), consistent with access to a large region of the FG-network due to the length of the FG-polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hallberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Söderqvist and Hallberg, 1994</xref>). The mEos3 probe on the N-terminus of Nup98 was widely distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), consistent with previous studies that found Nup98 within the central pore and on both the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chatel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Frosst et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Griffis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Krull et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Radu et al., 1995</xref>). The N-terminus of Nup153 was predominantly localized to the nuclear basket, whereas its C-terminal end was predominantly localized closer to the central pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>).

However, there were a surprising number of localizations within the central pore and nuclear basket regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that the cytoplasmic filaments penetrate into the central pore, and/or that RanGAP can bind to other parts of the FG-network.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Combining PALM and p-PALM to probe for spatially distinct regions of varying rotational mobility</title><p>The relatively wide particle distribution maps observed in PALM experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) suggested that regions of different rotational mobilities could potentially be resolved by combining the 2D localization maps generated via PALM with p-PALM rotational mobility information. This combined approach is challenging for the following reasons, which significantly reduced the size of current datasets. First, all p-PALM experiments reported thus far were performed by imaging the bottom of the nucleus, yielding spots from an approximately planar (2D) distribution of NPCs. In contrast, in order to obtain the position of the NE, PALM experiments were performed at the nuclear equator, yielding spots from a pseudo-linear (1D) distribution of NPCs. Thus, in combined PALM/p-PALM experiments, the NE was imaged at the nuclear equator, limiting the number of NPCs that could be simultaneously examined. Second, whereas entire trajectories were used for PALM, a single image per molecule was used for p-PALM to avoid biasing the data (see <bold>Materials and methods</bold>). This p-PALM constraint was retained in combined PALM/p-PALM experiments. And third, while <italic>xy</italic> spatial information was readily obtained from p-PALM fluorescent spots, localization precision was reduced in combined PALM/p-PALM experiments compared with typical PALM data since the emission intensity was distributed over two images (partially compensated by increasing the excitation intensity). Nonetheless, we demonstrate here that PALM localizations can be combined with p-PALM measurements.</p><p>In order to explore the distribution of WGA-binding sites, we focused on the following question: did WGA reduce rotational mobility throughout the FG-network? We examined mEos3-Nup98 and RanGAP-mEos3, both of which yielded probe localizations widely distributed throughout the FG-network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The data were divided into those with |<italic>p</italic><sub>cir</sub>| &gt; 0.3, which is only expected for molecules with <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> &lt; ~10<sup>3</sup> rad<sup>2</sup>/s, and those with |<italic>p</italic><sub>cir</sub>| &lt; 0.3, which could be observed for molecules with any <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Thus, if WGA reduced rotational mobility in a specific region of the FG-network, the two datasets should yield spatially distinguishable distributions. This was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

The p-PALM method was used to examine the macromolecular crowding in the vicinity of mEos3 probes positioned at different locations within the FG-network of NPCs, and PALM was used to determine the spatial distributions of these probes. Our major findings are: (1) different FG-polypeptides and different domains within the same FG-polypeptide experience different environments that are distinguishable by a probe’s rotational mobility; (2) in some cases, the binding of NTRs can increase crowding, thus producing significant differences in the properties of the local environments; and (3) WGA strongly influences rotational mobility throughout the FG-network, demonstrating that the local properties of the FG network can be modulated by embedded macromolecules. The implications of these findings provide a substantially improved understanding of the complexities of the FG-network, which we now discuss.</p><p>The average positions vis-à-vis the transport axis for the mEos3 probe attached to FG-polypeptides are largely consistent with previous results, as indicted in the <bold>Results</bold> section. Thus, the PALM data support the hypothesis that these mEos3-tagged proteins behave similar to their wild-type counterparts, and therefore, they enable probing of the FG-network. The mEos3 probe on the N-terminus of Nup98 was widely distributed along the transport axis with localizations within the central pore region as well as relatively far from the NPC center on both the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This broad distribution pattern is consistent with Nup98 anchoring sites on the inner and outer ring structures of the NPC scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kosinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lin et al., 2016</xref>) and on the cytoplasmic filaments and nuclear basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Frosst et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Stuwe et al., 2012</xref>), which together agree with the high copy number (48) for Nup98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ori et al., 2013</xref>). While the probe on the C-terminus of Pom121 also yielded a broad spatial distribution pattern, consistent with the long C-terminal FG-domain, labeling of the Pom121 N-terminus yielded a narrower distribution, consistent with anchoring of this part of the protein at the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Two anchoring sites for Pom121 via its N-terminal domain to Nup155 and/or Nup160 on both the inner and outer ring complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kosinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lin et al., 2016</xref>) is consistent with a stoichiometry of 16 copies/NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ori et al., 2013</xref>), although such dual anchoring is unresolvable at our current resolution.</p><p>For RanGAP, there were a surprising number of localizations within the central pore and basket regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), seemingly inconsistent with the cytoplasmic distribution expected considering the known binding site for SUMOlyated RanGAP on the cytoplasmic filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hutten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mahajan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Matunis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Reverter and Lima, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Wälde et al., 2012</xref>). RanGAP has a role in heterochromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Nishijima et al., 2006</xref>), it has both nuclear localization and nuclear export signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feng et al., 1999</xref>), and, although found predominantly at the NE, it is also found in both the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mahajan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Matunis et al., 1998</xref>). These data suggest that RanGAP trafficks through the NPC, which could result in trapping within the FG-network during cell permeabilization. Alternatively, RanGAP could have additional roles within the FG-network other than export complex disassembly on the cytoplasmic filaments. Notably, RanGAP is not expected to catalyze disassembly of RanGTP-containing export complexes without a RanBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bischoff and Görlich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bischoff et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Güttler and Görlich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kutay et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Okamura et al., 2015</xref>), thus suggesting that only the portion of RanGAP attached to the cytoplasmic filaments (RanBP2) may be active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mahajan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Matunis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Wu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Reverter and Lima, 2005</xref> #688; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Yokoyama et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The goal of our p-PALM approach was to identify regions of increased crowding within the FG-network and thus map the protein density distribution within the pore. While attaching the mEos3 probe to the end or to the middle of an FG-polypeptide could potentially introduce severe anisotropy in the rotational diffusion constants, the entirety of our results and simulations suggest that the probe’s rotation mobility behavior is at most only slightly anisotropic or the angle between the dominant rotational axis and the transition dipole is near the magic angle. In either case, the probe’s behavior largely resembled that of an untethered spherical particle. This was a somewhat surprising finding. However, this conclusion greatly simplifies the interpretation of p-PALM data since it substantially limits the parameter space that needs to be considered.</p><p>Since the mEos3 probe’s rotational mobility behavior resembled that of an isotropic particle, comparison of the experimental &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> and Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> values with the simulation results for a spherical particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) enables the rotational mobility of the mEos3 probe under different conditions to be interpreted in terms of the approximate values of the average rotational diffusion coefficient (<italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic>). Assuming an mEos3 fluorescence lifetime &gt; ~3 ns, which is true for most fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bajar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Moeyaert et al., 2014</xref>), the &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> values for all the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) indicate that <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> ≤ ~10<sup>6</sup> rad<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and Supplements). Since <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> for mEos3 free in solution is ~10<sup>7</sup> rad<sup>2</sup>/s (calculated for a sphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Loman et al., 2010</xref>]), the experimental &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> values suggest that rotational mobility was reduced by at least an order of magnitude by crowding within the FG-network. Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> values of ~0.2–0.3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) for the mEos3 probe under some conditions, in particular in the presence of WGA, indicate that the <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> was reduced to &lt;~100 rad<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and Supplements), that is, at least a 5 orders of magnitude change in rotational mobility from the free particle (for at least a fraction of the particles in the population, considering that most populations likely consisted of particle distributions with multiple <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values – see <bold>Appendix 1</bold>). The p-PALM method therefore enables detection of large changes in rotational mobility. Moreover, since the p-PALM technique measures the polarization of individual molecules, which allows calculation of the variance of the polarization, it permits discrimination between rotational diffusion behaviors at much lower <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values than traditional anisotropy approaches, in which fluorescence depolarization is governed by the fluorescence lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>). Notably, using a bulk fluorescence anisotropy approach on yeast NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mattheyses et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kampmann et al., 2011</xref>), it was reported that some GFP probes were oriented when attached to some FG-polypeptides, particularly when they were near to the NPC scaffold. As the anisotropy signals were weak relative to homogeneous models, it appears that either the percentage of oriented molecules was low, or the orientation bias was weak. For either explanation, the assumption that probes were initially isotropically oriented in our random walk simulations is valid in most cases and leads to only minor errors in other cases. The fact that WGA had substantial effects on rotational mobility, as we observed here, and yet had very little, if any, effect on probe orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2013</xref>) emphasizes the different physical parameters measured by the p-PALM and bulk fluorescence anisotropy approaches.</p><p>Under wild-type conditions, &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> and Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> values suggest that the <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> was 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> rad<sup>2</sup>/s for the large majority of probe molecules, consistent with the high mobility expected for the FG-polypeptides and a dynamically flexible FG-network. Conditions that decreased the rotational mobility of the mEos3 probe have been interpreted to result from an increase in macromolecular crowding. A high density of macromolecules reduces molecular motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dix and Verkman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">McGuffee and Elcock, 2010</xref>), presumably through an increased number of contacts with surrounding macromolecules. An mEos3 probe molecule within the FG-network can interact with FG-polypeptides, embedded macromolecules, or both. While the parameter Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> provided an initial indication of the reduction of rotational mobility due to crowding, it is still a population average, and a more refined picture was obtained by examining the full distribution of polarization values via polarization histograms and photon scatterplots. In multiple instances, two distinct rotational mobilities were necessary to explain the data, indicating heterogeneity in the environment around the different probe molecules. We consider it likely that most, if not all, of the high Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> values arose from mixed populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and discussion in <bold>Appendix 1</bold>), one sub-population of which had a relatively low rotational mobility (&lt;10<sup>3</sup> rad<sup>2</sup>/s). Therefore, despite being fused to a single location in a given protein, mEos3 probes often resided in multiple distinct environments, and variations in Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> values likely arose from both differences in local protein densities as well as differential partitioning between environments.</p><p>In all cases that we examined, WGA had a significant effect on the probe’s rotational mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). WGA binds to O-GlcNAc-modified Nups, of which there are at least five in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Finlay and Forbes, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>). The eight GlcNAc binding sites on the WGA dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Schwefel et al., 2010</xref>) suggest that it likely inhibited rotational mobility by non-covalently ‘crosslinking’ the FG-network. Considering that WGA affected the rotational mobility of mEos3 probes that were located both in the central pore and on the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), the most parsimonious conclusion is that WGA binding sites are found throughout the FG-network. This conclusion is also supported by the combined PALM and p-PALM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, this conclusion that WGA binding sites are located throughout the FG-network is inconsistent with previous dSTORM microscopy studies that localized WGA to an ~40 nm diameter ring near the scaffold of the central pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Löschberger et al., 2012</xref>). Electron microscopy using WGA-gold revealed a similar picture to the dSTORM study, although more central localizations were also revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akey and Goldfarb, 1989</xref>). It is possible that freezing or fixation influences the distribution of WGA-binding sites in these previous studies, which could explain the apparent conflict with the p-PALM data collected here on functional pores. However, there is an alternate interpretation. WGA could significantly increase Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> by binding to a distinct region of the FG-network, and strongly influencing the rotational mobility of the sub-population of probes in the neighborhood of these binding sites. In a highly interconnected network, such as a hydrogel or NTR/FG-polypeptide mixed network, WGA binding in one localized spatial region could influence more distant regions of the FG network via long-range allosteric-type effects. In this way, binding of WGA to one or more discrete spatial locations could influence the rotational motion of a probe throughout the FG-network. This interpretation is consistent with the WGA localization data obtained via dSTORM and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akey and Goldfarb, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Löschberger et al., 2012</xref>). In the case of the mEos3 probe on the N-terminus of Pom121, whose rotational mobility was also significantly reduced by the WGA, it seems unlikely that WGA-binding interactions within the central pore could be transmitted across the NE membrane and influence the rotational mobility of a probe within the perinuclear space. For this reason, we have concluded that the N-terminus of Pom121 is likely to reside within the central pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Our results also shed light on the NTR distribution within the NPC. Nearly a hundred molecules of Imp β1 are bound within each NPC during steady-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Paradise et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Tokunaga et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with the finding that NTRs have high affinities for FG-polypeptides (summarized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Tetenbaum-Novatt et al., 2012</xref>]). A high number of NTRs within the FG-network increases macromolecular crowding, which is expected to influence the structural and functional properties of the FG-network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kapinos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Schleicher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Vovk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Wagner et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, the NTR-centric model postulates that NTR/FG-polypeptide effective affinities are higher nearest the NPC scaffold, and significantly weaker in the center of the pore, thus enabling rapid transport only through a narrow channel (~10–20 nm diameter) in the center of the ~50 diameter pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kapinos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Schleicher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Wagner et al., 2015</xref>). This model therefore predicts significantly higher macromolecular crowding near the scaffold anchor domain of FG-polypeptides. This hypothesis was directly tested via the p-PALM measurements on the mEos3 probe placed at different locations within the Nup98 FG-polypeptide, which support the hypothesis that crowding is indeed higher near the Nup98 anchor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Considering mixed populations, the average weighted rotational diffusion constant (<italic>D<sub>r,ave</sub></italic>) for the probes on mEos3-Nup98 and mEos3-<sup>700mid</sup>Nup98 were ~2800 and ~910 rad<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A C</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>D<sub>r,ave</sub></italic> for the probes on Pom121-mEos3 and mEos3-Pom121 were ~2500 and ~850 rad<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, the rotational mobility data for both Pom121 and Nup98 suggest higher macromolecular crowding near the NPC scaffold than at the tips of the FG-polypeptides, consistent with the NTR-centric model. For comparison, in the absence of molecular crowding effects, <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> ≈ 1000 rad<sup>2</sup>/s for the mEos3 probe would correspond to a viscosity of ~10<sup>4</sup> cP. Notably, the probes on both mEos3-<sup>700mid</sup>Nup98 and mEos3-Pom121 experience multiple environments distinguished by at least two distinct rotational mobilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). Since the mEos3 probes in both of these constructs are attached near their respective anchor domains, and thus cannot migrate to spatially distinct sites within the FG-network, the local environment must be heterogeneous within an individual NPC, or with respect to different NPCs. Consequently, crowding near the NPC scaffold is somewhat heterogeneous.</p><p>High time-resolution super-resolution methods on functional NPCs in unfixed cells will continue to be instrumental in deciphering the complex, amorphous biomaterial that is the FG-network. We demonstrated here that the p-PALM method allows examination of rotational mobility over a range of at least 6 orders of magnitude. This range can be tuned by both acquisition conditions and experimental design, offering significant advantages over bulk measurements of fluorescence anisotropy. The results have allowed us to infer the local binding interactions and molecular crowding within NPCs, and have elucidated multiple aspects of the structural and dynamic complexity of the FG-network. While dynamics are an essential feature of the FG-network, enabling both rapid transport and dynamic maintenance of the permeability barrier, the extent to which newly identified heterogeneities play a role in functional properties of the NPC remains to be explored. While we expect that p-PALM will enable further dissection of the intricacies of the FG-network, it is also well-suited for probing the nanoscale structure of other dense molecular aggregates, such as the poorly understood organization of numerous nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic membrane-less compartments (‘bodies’), for example, nucleoli, stress granules, and RNA and protein processing bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aumiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016</xref>). These bodies typically contain high concentrations of proteins, and often nucleic acids, and their high densities promote phase separation. These highly crowded environments are difficult to probe because of their rapid dynamics, and often, their small size (&lt;1 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aumiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016</xref>), and thus, the high time- and super-resolution capability of PALM and the molecular crowding sensitivity of p-PALM provide an important novel tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental methods</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Human cell lines</title><p>HeLa cells (authenticated via STR profiling by ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose, 862 mg/L Gluta-MAX-I, 15 mg/mL phenol red, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Polarization values were only calculated for the second frame of each trajectory. This approach was designed to only include intensities that reflected photon emission over the entire frame (i.e., ensuring that photoactivation or photobleaching did not occur during data collection) and to weight each trajectory/molecule equally. Both of these constraints are essential to accurately estimate rotational mobility. Note that pooling p-PALM images would increase the integration time and the number of photons collected, both of which influence the measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>).

Such a particle reasonably approximates most globular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Loman et al., 2010</xref>). However, for an mEos3 molecule tethered to an FG-polypeptide, restrictions on rotational mobility due to the tether point can be expected. mEos3 has a β-barrel structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). It was tethered to FG-polypeptides via its N- or C-terminus (or both), each of which are at the bottom of this β-barrel. For simplicity, we assumed that the tether point was on the rotational <italic>z</italic>-axis, and that this was coincident with the β-barrel axis.

The approach is briefly summarized here – details follow in subsequent sections. The dipole's initial orientation was chosen randomly. For each time step, the dipole was rotated around its three principle rotational axes via an angular step randomly chosen from a normal distribution defined by its rotational diffusion constant. Three decisions were then used to determine if a photon was collected, and if so, to which detection channel it went: (1) the excitation of the probe was stochastically determined based on its excitation probability, given the illumination ellipticity and the orientation of the dipole; (2) the probability of photon collection was determined based on the dipole’s orientation and the solid angle subtended by the objective NA; and (3) if a photon was collected, it was partitioned into either the <italic>p</italic>- or <italic>s</italic>-channel depending on probabilities determined by the dipole's orientation. Most rotational random walk steps did not result in the collection of a photon. For circular excitation, the number of steps (<italic>N<sub>s</sub></italic>) for most simulations was 1400, leading to an average of ~352 photons collected under high <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), which matches well with the average of ~300–400 total photons collected in the two polarization channels in p-PALM experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Under these simulation conditions, an average of 341 total photons are expected based on the average excitation efficiency (2/3) and the photon collection efficiency of the objective (~36.5%). For linear excitation, <italic>N<sub>s</sub></italic> = 2800 was used to compensate for the lower average excitation efficiency (1/3). Thresholding (see later) is responsible for the higher than expected average total photons collected, particularly under low <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Coordinate systems and rotation transformations</title><p>For the laboratory frame, we assumed a spherical coordinate system where φ describes the angle from the <italic>z</italic>-axis (optical axis), and θ describes rotation around the <italic>z</italic>-axis from the <italic>x</italic>-axis.

Identical results were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Broadening intensity distributions and addition of background noise</title><p>In order that the simulation results more accurately reflected experimental intensity distributions and noisy single molecule data, emission intensities based on photon counts were broadened and background noise was added. Whereas histograms of total photon intensities from the simulations were Gaussian under high rotational mobility conditions, experimental intensity histograms were approximately three-fold wider and were better described by log-normal distributions (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Mutch et al., 2007</xref>). The broader experimental intensity distributions likely arise from a variety of factors, including the amplification noise of the EMCCD camera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chao et al., 2013</xref>), differential focusing, irregularities within different light paths (permeabilized cells provide complex scattering and refractive index changes), as well as dirt and aberrations/variations in the optics and pixel quantum efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Mutch et al., 2007</xref>). Conformational differences of the probe that affect photon output are also possible. The simulated intensity distributions were therefore broadened by random selection of intensities from log-normal distributions with scale parameter μ* = the total photons collected at each time step and shape parameter σ* = 0.24. The value of the shape parameter was guided by fits to experimental intensity distributions and agreement of the final simulation results to experiment. The value of σ* has essentially no effect on &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt; and Var(<italic>p</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Log-normal distributions have an advantage over normal distributions for the purpose described here, particularly for lower intensities, since negative values cannot occur. Background noise was added to the <italic>p</italic>- and <italic>s</italic>-intensities recalculated from the new total intensities, partitioned according to the original photon numbers. Background noise (in photons) was normally distributed with σ<sub>p</sub> = 15 and σ<sub>s</sub> = 15 for circular excitation, and σ<sub>p</sub> = 22 and σ<sub>s</sub> = 15 for linear excitation, which are the average noise levels in p-PALM experiments over the 5 × 5 pixel regions of interest used to obtain fluorescence intensities. This approach yielded intensity distributions, <italic>ps</italic>-photon scatterplots, and polarization histograms that resembled the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Thresholding</title><p>A threshold was implemented to distinguish single molecule signals from background noise in experimental measurements. For rapidly rotating particles, distinguishing single molecule signals from background was fairly straightforward. However, slowly rotating particles have strongly preferred transition dipole orientations, and therefore, intensity histograms were broader for such molecules, as expected, since excitation probabilities and emission intensities depend on dipole orientation. In particular, dipoles with a strong <italic>z</italic>-component yielded fewer emission photons primarily due to poor excitation efficiency, and therefore, molecules with such preferred orientations were not reliably detected in our experiments. Our criteria for spot selection was ≥100 photons in either the <italic>p</italic>- or <italic>s</italic>-detection channel.</p><p>To ensure more accurate modeling of the experimental data, a 100 photon threshold was also implemented for the simulation results. When using linear excitation, this threshold eliminates ~50% of the <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 0 when <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> is low (Regime V; compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consequently, under these conditions, a 100 photon threshold increases &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> from ~0 to ~0.24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This is a major change, and indicates an extreme sensitivity to imaging and analysis parameters. In contrast, Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>lin</sub> and Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> values are less sensitive to this threshold for all values of <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B C</xref>). Notably, however, Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> has a wider dynamic range than Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>lin</sub> at low <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values, indicating greater sensitivity to changes in rotational mobility. For circular excitation and small <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values, the threshold eliminates ~20% of the simulation values, which predominantly increases the low <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> asymptote in Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> plots. Under these conditions, the thresholding selects against particles oriented with a strong <italic>z</italic>-component, for which <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-intensities are similar and low, leading to the selective elimination of <italic>p</italic> values near zero (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and an increase in Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub>. Background noise also contributes to increasing this asymptotic value, although noise predominantly influences the high <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> asymptote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). In contrast, the 100 photon threshold does not affect the high <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> asymptote since at high <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values all measurements are above the threshold. Notably, thresholding has little influence in most of the region where Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> is most sensitive to <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). These simulations indicate that measuring &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>lin</sub> is best for rotational diffusion regimes I-III and measuring Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> is best for regimes III-V.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Single molecule vs. bulk results</title><p>Single molecule and bulk fluorescence data yield fundamentally different information under conditions of low rotational mobility.

The bulk and p-PALM results differ for two reasons (discussed more fully in the text): (1) the microscope objective mixes polarizations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ16 equ17">Equations 15 and 16</xref>); and (2) the values calculated from single molecule data weights each molecule identically (i.e. the polarization/anisotropy of each molecule counts the same no matter how many photons are emitted), whereas the values corresponding to bulk conditions weights the contribution of each molecule to the measured polarization/anisotropy (a single measurement) depending on the number of photons emitted. The bulk polarization and anisotropy under circular excitation are always 0.</p><p>Under single molecule conditions, the variance in the measured polarization values, Var(<italic>p</italic>), provides a measure of the width of polarization histograms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The variance was calculated as Var(<italic>p</italic>) = &lt;<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt; – (&lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;)<sup>2</sup>, where &lt;<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt; is the average square of the measured polarization values. Theoretically, using circular excitation, Var(<italic>p</italic>) = &lt;<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt; since &lt;p&gt; = 0 for all <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values. Consequently, since in most cases we obtained &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;<sub>cir</sub> ≈ 0 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we assumed that Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> was equivalent to the experimentally determined &lt;<italic>p</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;<sub>cir</sub>. As defined here, Var(<italic>p</italic>) does not exist under bulk conditions since the information from all individual molecules is integrated by the measurement into a single value. This fundamentally explains why circular polarized excitation provides rotational mobility information under slow rotation conditions in a single molecule p-PALM experiment, whereas no information is obtained in a corresponding bulk experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>Inferring <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> from Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub></title><p>A general analytical solution for the Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> dependence on the rotational diffusion constants is a complex problem.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Edward A Lemke (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Fu and colleagues describes a polarizing-PALM (p-PALM) approach to analyze the organization of the FG-repeat network within the nuclear pore complex. In the last few years, excellent progress has been made in our understanding of the structural arrangement of the nuclear pore core structure. However, the organization of the FG repeats has been difficult to elucidate as the natively unfolded FG-repeats cannot be studied with traditional structural approaches due to their inherent flexibility. Hence, innovative methods such as the p-Palm approach developed here are needed.</p><p>While there were some concerns about the impact of the biological findings within the nuclear pore field all three reviewers agreed that the work is of very high quality, technically profound and felt that the method was extensively validated. Furthermore, the experimental and theoretical pipeline described in this paper could be of broader use to examine also other disordered/dynamic structures in cells. Based on this, the consensus opinion was that the results are appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> and the reviewers in principle supported publication. However, the manuscript in its present form is very difficult to read and hence it was unclear whether the current paper can be digested by a broader readership, and extensive edits will be needed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The writing has to be substantially revised in order to make the manuscript accessible to a broader readership. Furthermore, the style of the paper is very heterogeneous and some parts of the paper are almost disconnected from the rest. This is especially obvious for the results presented in the last three subsections of the Results. The conclusions of these considerations should be stated in the paper, but the detailed arguments could be transferred to the supplemental material. The same occurs again in the Discussion, when the pros and cons of the new method are evaluated. The following reorganization and consolidation of topics is suggested:</p><p>a) Concept of method;b) Key Readout (note, the result from rotational analysis are mainly negative, still the reader has to go through lots of stuff in the main text). What about:</p><p>Key observable: center of distribution from pPalm; width of distribution form pPALM and actual position from PALM;c) A separate pitfall analysis (supplement)?</p><p>2) The method that is developed here could be of broader use to examine also other disordered/dynamic structures and, for example, could be applied to analyze the poorly understood organization of membrane-less compartments such as nucleoli, processing bodies, stress granules, splicing bodies etc. This is an obvious strength of the paper yet the authors fail to discuss this and neglect to point this out. They should comment on the broader applicability of their approach in the &quot;Digest&quot; and the &quot;Discussion&quot;.</p><p>3) The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> for the N- and C-terminally tagged version of POM121 is used to argue in favor of POM121 having 2 transmembrane helices placing the N-terminus into the FG-network. The difference in the effect of WGA on both mutants, however, is quite substantial and is not really commented on by the authors. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> suggest a localization of the N-terminus in the very center of the transport channel (thus supporting the above result).

As suggested, most of the material from the Results was moved to a new supplement (Appendix 1), and briefly discussed in the manuscript (subsections “Effect of Anisotropic Rotation of the Probe on &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt; and Var(<italic>p</italic>)” and “Effect of Numerical Aperture (NA) on &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt; and Var(<italic>p</italic>)”). To present a more logical flow, we have also reordered the Results and subdivided it into four sub-sections: 1) the p-PALM method; 2) the application of p-PALM to NPCs; 3) PALM on NPCs; and 4) combined PALM and p-PALM measurements. Some of the figures and figure supplements were reordered to accommodate these changes and they have been reduced in number by transferring some figures to Appendix 1.</p><p>The original Appendix containing mathematical derivations has been renamed Appendix 2, and edited for clarity. The Discussion was shortened by deleting less important material, and clarified in numerous locations. The primary readouts were explicitly identified as the average polarization, &lt;<italic>p</italic>&gt;, and the variance of the polarization distribution, Var(<italic>p</italic>). In addition, we note that the overall shape of polarization histograms and photon scatterplots can provide additional clues as to the underlying physical constraints on the probe’s rotational mobility (subsection “Outline of the p-PALM Method”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The method that is developed here could be of broader use to examine also other disordered/dynamic structures and, for example, could be applied to analyze the poorly understood organization of membrane-less compartments such as nucleoli, processing bodies, stress granules, splicing bodies etc. This is an obvious strength of the paper yet the authors fail to discuss this and neglect to point this out.

We now briefly mention in the Abstract the suitability of the p-PALM method for probing other crowded environments, and specifically identify its application to membrane-less compartments at the end of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> for the N- and C-terminally tagged version of POM121 is used to argue in favor of POM121 having 2 transmembrane helices placing the N-terminus into the FG-network. The difference in the effect of WGA on both mutants, however, is quite substantial and is not really commented on by the authors. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> suggest a localization of the N-terminus in the very center of the transport channel (thus supporting the above result). A distinct and significant impact on the mobility by WGA should therefore be expected on the N-terminally tagged POM121, which was not seen. These data appear to be quite inconsistent and the authors need to address this or at least comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>The PALM density maps were generated by determining the position of the nuclear envelope, and by aligning clusters of spots based on their centroids. This procedure positioned all cluster centroids on the central axis of the NPC. This approach was necessary since there were at most a few tens of spots per NPC, and we had no independent marker for the NPC scaffold. Thus, while the axial dimension was calibrated based on the nuclear envelope position, the lateral dimension was artificially squeezed. In short, tags on the periphery of the pore can appear to be centrally distributed in the PALM density maps. Thus, the Pom121 maps are not inconsistent with a model wherein the N-terminus of Pom121 is near the scaffold and the C-terminus is in the center of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This issue has now been clarified in the text (subsection “Spatial Distribution of mEos3 Probes within the FG-Network”, second paragraph).</p><p>In the presence of WGA, the difference in Var(<italic>p</italic>)<sub>cir</sub> values for the probe on the N-and C-termini of Pom121 predicts a difference in <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> values of about 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which is actually not that substantial, especially considering that this difference can be readily explained by a differential distribution of the probe molecules between two sub-populations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and supplements). The Nup98 data show less effect of WGA near the scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that the same would be true for Pom121. The mixed population hypothesis has now been evaluated further for the probes on Pom121 and Nup98 under wildtype conditions, and both proteins yield results consistent with higher crowding near the NPC scaffold (Discussion, eighth paragraph), assuming the 2 TMD model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for Pom121. We therefore disagree that the results on Pom121 are inconsistent, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Spatial Distribution of mEos3 Probes within the FG-Network”, last paragraph: the result on the spatial distribution of RanGAP is very important, but at the same time quite surprising. Can the authors validate these results by an alternative approach?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the RanGAP distribution is surprising, and we have expanded our discussion of these data (Discussion, third paragraph). We do not feel that we can further appropriately address this issue in the short period allotted to develop a revised version of this manuscript. Nonetheless, this will be an important issue for us moving forward as we develop a super-resolution 3D method for examining particle distributions in NPCs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
