neural networks are thought to underlie the evolutionary adaptation of animal behaviours. Among the many developmental phenomena that generate change programmed cell death (PCD) appears to play a key role. We show that cell death occurs continuously throughout insect neurogenesis and happens soon after neurons are born. Mimicking an evolutionary role for increasing cell numbers, we artificially block in the medial neuroblast lineage in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, which results in the production of ‘undead’ neurons with complex arborisations and distinct neurotransmitter identities. Activation of these ‘undead’ neurons and recordings of neural activity in behaving animals demonstrate that they are functional. Focusing on two dipterans, which have lost flight during evolution, we reveal that reductions in populations of flight interneurons are likely caused by increased cell death during development. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary modulation of death-based patterning could generate novel network configurations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just like a sculptor chips away at a block of granite to make a statue, the nervous system reaches its mature state by eliminating neurons during development through a process known as programmed cell death.</p><p>In vertebrates, this mechanism often involves newly born neurons shrivelling away and dying if they fail to connect with others during development. Most studies in insects have focused on the death of neurons that occurs at metamorphosis, during the transition between larva to adult, when cells which are no longer needed in the new life stage are eliminated.</p><p>Pop et al. harnessed a newly designed genetic probe to point out that, in fruit flies, programmed cell death of neurons at metamorphosis is not the main mechanism through which cells die. Rather, the majority of cell death takes place as soon as neurons are born throughout all larval stages, when most of the adult nervous system is built. To gain further insight into the role of this ‘early’ cell death, the neurons were stopped from dying, showing that these cells were able to reach maturity and function. Together, these results suggest that early cell death may be a mechanism fine-tuned by evolution to shape the many and varied nervous systems of insects.</p><p>To explore this, Pop et al. looked for hints of early cell death in relatives of fruit flies that are unable to fly: the swift lousefly and the bee lousefly. This analysis showed that early cell death is likely to occur in these two insects, but it follows different patterns than in the fruit fly, potentially targeting the neurons that would have controlled flight in these flies’ ancestors.</p><p>Brains are the product of evolution: learning how neurons change their connections and adapt could help us understand how the brain works in health and disease. This knowledge may also be relevant to work on artificial intelligence, a discipline that often bases the building blocks and connections in artificial ‘brains’ on how neurons communicate with one another.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Braula coeca</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Crataerina pallida</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Thermobia domestica</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P025552/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Darren W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L022672/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Darren W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>175667</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramdya</surname><given-names>Pavan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Eccellenza 181239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramdya</surname><given-names>Pavan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R'Equip 177102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramdya</surname><given-names>Pavan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Developmental cell death plays a key role during insect neurogenesis and is increased in specific neuronal populations in flies that have evolved flightlessness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nervous systems are exquisitely adapted to the biomechanical and ecological environments in which they operate. How they evolve to be this way is largely unknown. Such changes can occur through modifications in receptor tuning, transmitter/receptor repertoires, neuronal excitability, neuromodulation, structural connectivity, or in the number of neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS). The differences seen in networks, over an evolutionary timescale, ultimately result from heritable changes in developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horder, 1989</xref>). Advancing our knowledge of the mechanisms of neural development using comparative approaches will help us understand how specific elements can be modified, how new ‘circuits’ and behaviours evolve, and will ultimately lead to a better understanding of how nervous systems function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ramdya and Benton, 2010</xref>). Studies comparing the nervous systems of mammalian species that occupy diverse ecological niches reveal clear differences in the number of cells within homologous brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014</xref>). Such differences have occurred either through expansion or reduction of specific cell populations, through changes in proliferation or apoptotic programmed cell death (PCD) during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charvet et al., 2011</xref>). Most studies of nervous system evolution have focused on stem cell identity and the role of differential proliferation dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biffar and Stollewerk, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rakic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Truman and Ball, 1998</xref>). While one recent study has elegantly shown a role for PCD in the evolution of peripheral olfactory sensory neurons in drosophilids and mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Prieto-Godino et al., 2020</xref>), how changes in cell death can modify central circuits still remains an open question.</p><p>In insects, the number and arrangement of neural progenitor cells that generate central neurons (termed neuroblasts, NBs) are highly conserved despite the remarkable diversity of insect body plans and behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bate, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biffar and Stollewerk, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Booker and Truman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doe and Goodman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartenstein and Campos-Ortega, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nordlander and Edwards, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shepherd and Bate, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tamarelle et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Truman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Truman and Ball, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wheeler, 1891</xref>). In the ventral nerve cord (VNC – functionally equivalent to the vertebrate spinal cord) all but one NBs are arranged in a bilaterally symmetric array across the midline, while an unpaired, single medial neuroblast (MNB) stands out in the posterior end of each segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Early neurogenesis in insects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of a young grasshopper embryo, here used as a depiction of a generic insect embryo (modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Truman, 1996</xref>).

After several rounds of GMC divisions, a lineage produced by a single NB is composed of two half-lineages: ‘hemilineage A’ made up of all the A cells and ‘hemilineage B’ made up of B cells.

Following reactivation from quiescence NBs produce neurons throughout larval life until the early pupal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Booker and Truman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>). These postembryonic neurons – which make up most of the adult CNS – extend simple neuritic processes into the neuropil and stall until the pupal-adult transition when they grow complex arborisations, synapsing with their target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Truman, 1990</xref>). In the VNC, NBs bud off a ganglion mother cell (GMC) which undergoes a terminal division to generate two neurons with distinctly different cell fates (an A cell and a B cell). As the A and B cells result from a single division, one cannot be produced without the other. After several rounds of GMC divisions, a lineage produced by a single NB is composed of two half-lineages: ‘hemilineage A’ made up of all the A cells and ‘hemilineage B’ made up of B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Hemilineages act as functional units in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shepherd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shepherd et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Truman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Truman et al., 2004</xref>). For example, in the MNB lineage, hemilineage A cells mature into GABAergic local interneurons while hemilineage B cells become efferent octopaminergic neurons. Our previous work showed that a common fate of postembryonic neurons is PCD affecting approximately 40% of VNC hemilineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Truman et al., 2010</xref>), this is also seen in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). The pattern of PCD is stereotypical and targets the same hemilineages across individuals. Taken together, the breadth of PCD suggests it plays a major role in shaping the final makeup of the adult nervous system, while its stereotypy points towards a heritable genetic basis. We therefore propose that changes in neural circuits may result from heritable alterations in the extent and pattern of PCD in hemilineages.</p><p>To mimic such an evolutionary role for PCD, we use the powerful genetic tools available in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to block death in one doomed hemilineage. We chose to target the MNB lineage for the following reasons; Its easy-to-locate position made the MNB identifiable in all developing insects described from as early as 1891 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wheeler, 1891</xref>, and spanning all insect orders from wingless silverfish to locusts, beetles, moths and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bate, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biffar and Stollewerk, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Booker and Truman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doe and Goodman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartenstein and Campos-Ortega, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shepherd and Bate, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tamarelle et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Truman and Ball, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>). The MNB gives rise to two distinct populations of neurons, one GABAergic and one octopaminergic, which are also homologous across insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia and Siegler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pflüger and Stevenson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rowell, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Siegler and Pankhaniya, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Siegler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Siegler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stevenson and Spörhase-Eichmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thompson and Siegler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Witten and Truman, 1998</xref>). There appears to be a relationship between cell number and function in these populations. Flying insects have greater numbers of octopaminergic neurons within segments that control wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stevenson and Spörhase-Eichmann, 1995</xref>), while grasshoppers have more GABAergic neurons in the fused metathoracic/abdominal ganglia, where they receive auditory input from the abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Witten and Truman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thompson and Siegler, 1991</xref>). Alongside differences in numbers of the same cell type between segments and species, numbers of GABAergic and octopaminergic neurons found in one segment are never equal. This is especially intriguing as during development each GABAergic neuron is a sister cell to an octopaminergic neuron, arising from one cell division and are produced in equal number (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The greater number of GABAergic cells in each segment results from PCD targeting octopaminergic neurons in both grasshoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia and Siegler, 2002</xref>) and fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Truman et al., 2010</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Pieced together, these data suggest that, at least in part, the evolution of some behaviours can be explained by variation in the number of octopaminergic neurons caused by PCD during MNB development.</p><p>Octopamine release in the thoracic ganglion has been reported to induce and maintain rhythmic behaviours such as stepping movements and flight muscle contractions in locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sombati and Hoyle, 1984</xref>) and walking, wing flicking and hindleg grooming in decapitated fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yellman et al., 1997</xref>). All octopaminergic neurons produce tyramine as well, the precursor of octopamine, and tyramine has also been shown to induce fictive walking and flight in a thoracic preparation in locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rillich et al., 2013</xref>). Throughout our work, we do not discriminate between the role of tyramine and octopamine release from hemilineage 0B and collectively refer to these neurons as octopaminergic. Consistent with its role in both (1) walking and (2) flight, we show that (1) blocking PCD in the octopaminergic hemilineage produced by the MNB in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> results in mature differentiated ‘undead’ neurons that survive into adulthood, elaborate complex arborisations and induce walking when activated; and (2) PCD may be responsible for reducing hemilineage 0B in the mesothorax of the flightless swift louse <italic>Crataerina pallida</italic>. Alongside, we propose that PCD may have caused reductions in flight hemilineages within thoracic networks in another true fly, <italic>Braula coeca</italic> (the bee louse), during the evolution of flightlessness. Additionally, using new tools in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we demonstrate that PCD takes place in these neurons early, very soon after they are born. We find evidence of this early PCD in primitively wingless firebrats and hippoboscid louseflies suggesting that it is deployed widely. This ‘early’ death is categorically different to the neuronal death described in the majority of studies in insects, that focus on hormonally gated PCDs occurring at moults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our work highlights the importance of viewing hemilineages as functional units of neurodevelopment in all insects and shows that their alteration through an early mode of PCD can lead to adaptive changes in central circuits during evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An early and rapid mode of developmental cell death eliminates significant numbers of newly born neurons throughout postembryonic development in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>First, we wondered what specific type of PCD is responsible for sculpting VNC lineages in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, reasoning that only by gaining insight into the exact developmental process involved can we understand its role in nervous system evolution. The majority of studies on neuronal PCD in insects have focused on its role at metamorphic transitions, where death eliminates fully differentiated neurons either at puparium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Truman et al., 1994</xref>) or in adults post-eclosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Draizen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura and Truman, 1990</xref>).

However, our previous observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Truman et al., 2010</xref>), together with studies in the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nordlander and Edwards, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lovick et al., 2017</xref>), made us consider that hemilineage-specific PCD takes place early, in newly born neurons. So far, the dynamics of cell death has been difficult to evaluate on a cell-by-cell basis within a complex nervous system.</p><p>To interrogate postembryonic neuronal death, we have built a novel genetically encoded effector caspase probe called SR4VH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). SR4VH consists of a membrane-bound red fluorescent protein (Src::RFP) and a yellow fluorescent protein with a strong nuclear localisation signal from histone H2B (Venus::H2B) separated by four tandem repeats of the amino acid sequence DEVD. When effector caspases cleave the DEVD site, Venus accumulates in the nucleus while RFP remains bound to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This reporter is similar in design to Apoliner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardet et al., 2008</xref>), but has different subcellular localisation signals as well as four tandem caspase cleavage sites instead of one. We also found that tethering the probe to the membrane with the myristoylation signal from Src means that there is no excess signal accumulation in the Golgi apparatus (Mukherjee et al., in preparation). The nuclear localisation signal from H2B allows for highly efficient sequestration of cleaved Venus in the nucleus even in late stages of apoptosis, when the nuclear membrane is likely compromised.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Early neuronal cell death occurs throughout postembryonic development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simple schematic of programmed cell death (PCD) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

The number of progeny we can detect at any one time using <italic>Worniu-GAL4</italic> varies from 10 to 20, most likely as a result of differential proliferation rates across lineages. We confirmed that SR4VH is reliable as a reporter for cell death in larvae by analysing its expression pattern in all lineages of postembryonic neurons in the thoracic VNC and comparing it to our previous work on MARCM homozygous mutant clones of the initiator caspase <italic>Dronc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Truman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D,E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found dying cells associated with lineages in the brain and VNC throughout the whole of postembryonic neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D,E,F</xref>), which lasts for 3.5 days, from mid-2<sup>nd</sup> instar (L2) to 12 hr after pupariation. As previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Truman et al., 2010</xref>), the time course of PCD indicates that cells die early – very soon after they are born – often before they have even extended a neuritic process. This death appears to be unlike the ‘trophic’ PCD found in vertebrates, where a neuron extends a process, interacts with its target cell and dies in the absence of appropriate survival signals. In support of an early onset of PCD, we were able to see sequential stages of cell death, dependent on the distance from the NB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Older cells located further away from the NB appear to be at a more advanced stage of PCD indicated by the complete translocation of Venus from the membrane to the nucleus (Cell three in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>) and by the accumulation of RFP-positive dead cell membranes close to the lineage bundle (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>).</p><p>The number of dying cells within a doomed lineage varied from 1 to 8, with most lineages containing 1–2 dying cells from a total of 10–20 cells labelled with <italic>Worniu-GAL4</italic> (dying cells/lineage: 1.3 ± 1.5 given as average ± standard deviation; n = 444 doomed lineages from 5 VNCs). From a total of 444 doomed lineages, 243 harboured more than one dying cell, of which 148 displayed a progression of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref> approximated the cell cycle of an NB to 55 min and that of a GMC to 6.5 hr, with 7 GMCs present in a proliferating lineage at all times. Therefore, after subtracting the NB and GMCs from clusters of 10–20 <italic>Worniu-GAL4</italic>-labelled cells, 2–12 will be neurons which resulted from 1 to 6 divisions, each separated in time by 55 min. This means that PCD was initiated early, at some time between 0 and 5.5 hr after neurons were born.</p><p>To look at death specifically during the development of the MNB lineage (lineage 0) we imaged SR4VH in wandering L3 larvae and used molecular markers to identify members of hemilineage 0A and 0B. The transcription factors Engrailed/Invected (En/Inv) are known to be expressed in immature and fully differentiated interneurons of hemilineage A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lacin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Truman et al., 2004</xref>). As previously reported, the mature differentiated octopaminergic neurons found in hemilineage B express the transcription factor Vestigial (Vg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Landgraf et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we find that a small number of immature postembryonic neurons (about 3–5) in close proximity to the MNB also express Vg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Within these immature neurons the expression of Vg and En are mutually exclusive. Using <italic>Worniu-GAL4</italic> to drive SR4VH we found that only the engrailed-negative cells are undergoing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), i.e. the same small number of cells that express Vg. Their proximity to the MNB suggests that Vg-positive B cells (i.e. immature octopaminergic neurons) undergo an early death, very soon after they are born.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Blocking PCD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> generates identifiable, differentiated populations of undead neurons</title><p>After observing the extent of early PCD during development, we wondered if, by reducing PCD, we could generate novel functional expansions of a hemilineage.

It is well known that there are 3–4 extra octopaminergic neurons generated postembryonically in the wing bearing second (T2) thoracic neuromere in adult flies compared to the 3 cells found in each thoracic segment in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Monastirioti et al., 1995</xref>). Until our inquiry into the timeline of postembryonic neurogenesis, it was thought that all octopaminergic neurons born in the embryo persist into adulthood, but to our surprise, that is not the case. We noticed that one postembryonic octopaminergic cell is born in wild-type flies in both the first (T1) and third (T3) thoracic segments, bringing the total number of cells to 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,D</xref>).

For this purpose, we deployed the same MARCM-based technique detailed above which ensured that only postembryonic octopaminergic neurons expressed CD8::GFP and TrpA1. The stochastic nature of MARCM allowed for generating both controls and flies with undead neurons in one mating cross using the same genotype, rearing and heat-shock conditions, i.e. there would be animals that would have experienced the heat- shock but have no octopaminergic neurons labelled. This further meant that behavioural experiments were performed blindly and each fly was matched to its control or undead neuron group only following dissection and imaging of the VNC. As mentioned above, we excluded flies with MARCM clones containing bilaterally symmetric neurons from our analysis, as these may be wild-type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E,F,G</xref>). Additionally, we examined the effects of heat exposure in negative control flies with the genotype UAS-TrpA1 and the effects of heat-activation of wild-type octopaminergic neurons in positive controls expressing UAS-TrpA1 driven by TDC2-GAL4.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Undead neurons are functional: thermogenetic activation of undead neurons induces walking in decapitated <italic>Drosophila.</italic></title><p>.

The direction of walking was either forward, sideways or backwards and most flies turned or walked in circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), probably caused by variation in step size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yellman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our data are consistent with the observation that octopamine applied to the exposed anterior notum of decapitated flies causes walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yellman et al., 1997</xref>) and suggests that undead neurons are functional and capable of releasing neurotransmitters in the CNS. The extent of walking was greater in positive control flies than in the undead MARCM condition (compare panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This is likely because, alongside activating thoracic octopaminergic neurons in the VNC, in the positive controls we also stimulate the severed axons of octopaminergic cells in the brain which send descending projections to the VNC. These are not present in our <italic>TDC2-GAL4</italic> MARCM flies.</p><p>To determine if undead neurons are integrated into thoracic motor circuits, we recorded the activity of mixed undead and wild-type octopaminergic neuron populations expressing GCaMP6s (an activity reporter) and tdTomato (an anatomical fiduciary) in intact <italic>H99/XR38</italic> flies during tethered behaviour on a spherical treadmill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). The complexity of our calcium imaging experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), together with a rate of success for obtaining MARCM clones with undead neurons of 15%, prompted us to approach our question whether undead neurons are functional during natural walking by using <italic>H99/XR38</italic> flies. Keeping in mind that, instead of bifurcating, undead neurons collectively take a turn (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,C,D</xref>), we interpret activity from the thickest bundle in the bifurcation as belonging to both undead and wild-type neurons. In these animals we observed conspicuous increases in neural activity during air-puff-induced walking in both wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and in <italic>H99/XR38</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). Because undead neurons outnumber their wild-type counterparts by a ratio of 6.5 to 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B,C,D</xref>), these results imply that both neuronal types are active in <italic>H99/XR38</italic> flies. Supporting this, we observed an increase in GCaMP6s fluorescence across all subregions along the width of the thickest primary neurite bundle in the bifurcation, which contains all undead neurons together with three wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

Swift louseflies are viviparous, with only one progeny being produced and carried by the female at any one time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lower panel).

Together, these studies provide an excellent starting point for anatomical comparisons of homologous hemilineages which may have served an ancestral role in flight.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Neuronal cell death sculpts the wing circuitry of wingless dipterans.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dorsal (top) and side view (bottom) of an adult bee lousefly with a reduced thorax lacking wings and halteres.

Comparing the Neuroglian-labelled axon bundle width of homologous hemilineages between flightless and flying species, we found that hemilineages 3B, 7B, 11B and 12A, which produce wing waving, wing buzzing or take-off in the fruit fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2015</xref>), hemilineages 6A and 19B, which innervate the wing neuropil, and 5B, which innervates both leg and wing neuropils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shepherd et al., 2019</xref>), are reduced in bee louseflies, but not in swift louseflies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C,D</xref>). Among the latter, hemilineages 5B and 6A are known to contribute to leg movements and changes in posture, while the role for 19B is yet to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, 3B, 6A, 11B, 12A and 19B belong to lineages in which both hemilineages survive in fruit flies (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A difference in axon bundle diameter between sister hemilineages could indicate a difference in cell number, possibly established by PCD during development. We chose to quantify the ratio of axon bundle diameters in lineage three because we expected a reduction in hemilineage 3B, which innervates the wing neuropil, but no change in hemilineage 3A, which projects into the leg neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shepherd et al., 2019</xref>). The fibre tracts of 3A and 3B originate as a common bundle and split only in the intermediate neuropil. After they split, the sister fibre tracts sit in the same plane before they defasciculate, making them easy to trace and compare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,F,G</xref>). We found that the ratio between sister hemilineages A and B is significantly higher in bee louseflies compared to fruit flies, indicating that hemilineage 3B, which controls flight-related behaviours, is severely reduced in these flightless flies (T1: fruit fly [0.6 ± 0.1, n = 7] versus bee louse [1.8 ± 0.4, n = 8], p &lt; 0.0001, t = −8.084, independent samples t-test; T2: fruit fly [0.7 ± 0.1, n = 7] versus bee louse [1.7 ± 0.4, n = 8], p=0.0001, F = 42.22, Welch’s t-test; T3: fruit fly [1.1 ± 0.4, n = 7] versus bee louse [1.7 ± 0.2, n = 8], p = 0.0044, F = 14.84, Welch’s t-test). Even though we cannot make a precise inference of cell numbers in each hemilineage, as the fibre tract of hemilineage 3B appears frayed while 3A is more compact in both species, our results clearly show that 3B is greatly reduced, associated with the loss of flight machinery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Hemilineage-specific cell death occurs in newly born neurons</title><p>To help us understand more about the patterning of PCD, we designed and used a new effector caspase probe SR4VH, which allowed us to interrogate the extent and dynamics of hemilineage-specific cell death. It shows us that an early onset PCD is responsible for the elimination of postembryonic neurons in the fly VNC, that this happens throughout the entire 3.5 days of postembryonic neurogenesis, and is hemilineage-specific. Although PCD has been reported as a fate within lineages in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karcavich and Doe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rogulja-Ortmann et al., 2007</xref>), the impact of this ‘early’ and hemilineage-specific PCD on the construction of the adult network has yet to be fully appreciated. This type of PCD is responsible for removing almost half of all postembryonic neurons that are born in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Truman et al., 2010</xref>). Until now, the most frequently reported type of neuronal death described in insects has been the hormonally regulated PCD that removes mature neurons during the narrow developmental windows at the beginning of metamorphosis and within the first day after adult eclosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Draizen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). We now know from our data that these make up only a small fraction, compared to the total number of neuronal deaths in the fly.</p><p>Our SR4VH probe allows us to see that newly born neurons initiate cell death within the first 5.5 hr after birth. We can capture different stages of cell death: with young cells at very initial stages of PCD located closer to the NB, while older cells at more advanced stages of PCD with RFP labelled cell membranes found close to the lineage bundle. Importantly, death happens before neurites have extended, strongly suggesting that this PCD is not an analogue of neurotrophic death, found in vertebrates - where neuron-target interactions play a major role in the decisions of cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dekkers and Barde, 2013</xref>). In <italic>Thermobia domestica</italic> and <italic>Crataerina pallida</italic>, where the use of sophisticated genetic reporters such as SR4VH was not yet possible, EdU incorporation to mark dividing cells and immunolabelling for the active effector caspase Dcp-1 as a proxy for cell death revealed dying cells close to sites of division. Dying cells were found in the proximity of NBs (identifiable in all insects by their large size and position in the outermost layer of the CNS cortex) and far removed from mature neurons which congregate in the innermost layer of the cortex, adjacent to the neuropil. Therefore, we speculate that these cells are immature neurons and propose that they too undergo a death with rapid onset following division, similar to the early hemilineage-specific cell death we see with SR4VH in fruit flies.</p><p>The critical question that these data bring into focus is how early onset PCD is orchestrated, especially that an early intrinsically determined mode of cell death seems to be widespread across animals, from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fricker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Southwell et al., 2012</xref>). Early PCD likely involves a combination of intrinsic patterning and cell-cell interactions between sibling neurons which ultimately deploy the activity of proapoptotic genes <italic>rpr</italic>, <italic>hid</italic>, <italic>grim</italic> and/or <italic>skl</italic>. Previously, patterning genes such as <italic>Ubx</italic> have been shown to contribute to the survival of hemilineages in the thoracic VNC in a parasegment-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marin et al., 2012</xref>), while the transcription factor Unc-4 has been recently demonstrated to provide neural identity to hemilineages involved in flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lacin et al., 2020</xref>). Such spatial patterning is also required to establish NB identity which, in turn, can determine which hemilineage is maintained and which dies. In the developing optic lobe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertet et al., 2014</xref> have shown that the temporal sequence of transcription factors expressed in NBs (inherited by the GMC and newly born neurons) produces a switch in the selective survival of one hemilineage over the other. In this manner, the changes to NB identity which have been documented in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biffar and Stollewerk, 2014</xref>), despite a conserved NB array and progeny, could in turn influence the pattern of PCD. Alongside, cell-cell interactions between newly born neurons could influence fate choices. The requirement of interactions between newly born siblings in determining asymmetric fates has been shown in the grasshopper VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doe et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuwada and Goodman, 1985</xref>), although this exact same mechanism has not been demonstrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The spatio-temporal pattern of death revealed with SR4VH shows us that understanding the molecular control of hemilineage-based death is the key question going forward and is likely to provide insight into how networks evolve.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Blocking death results in functional neurons that integrate into adult networks</title><p>Here we blocked PCD within the MNB lineage (called lineage 0 in the postembryonic literature) and found that ‘doomed’ neurons become octopaminergic, generate arborisations and target the tectulum neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Court et al., 2020</xref>). Previous work has shown that octopamine can induce and maintain walking in locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sombati and Hoyle, 1984</xref>) and decapitated fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yellman et al., 1997</xref>). Consistently, we find that our ‘undead’ hemilineage 0B cells can induce walking when activated thermogenetically in headless flies and show calcium activity during naturalistic bouts of locomotion. Thus, by blocking death, we have ‘resurrected’ functional neurons that are able to integrate into thoracic motor networks. Although this ‘dialling up’ of cell numbers, in our system, is artificial, it reveals how doomed neurons possess cryptic cellular phenotypes that can emerge when death is blocked, advocating for the evolvability of such a hemilineage-based system.</p><p>While these undead hemilineage 0B octopaminergic neurons share many conserved features with wild-type cells, the variations we see in their morphology could act as a substrate for evolutionary change. A recent study has linked structural changes in the VNC with changes in behaviour between strains of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mellert et al., 2016</xref>). Mellert et al., show that hemilineage 12A in the mesothorax has variable bundle morphologies and that these correlate well with the time of flight initiation. Flight is used as an escape response and can be instrumental for predator evasion, one of the major evolutionary forces which have selected for flight in insects in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dudley, 2002</xref>). With this in mind, it seems plausible that changes in either neuron number and/or innovations in ‘undead’ neuron structure could affect adult behaviour and be ultimately adaptive. Recently it has been shown that undead sensory neurons that are functional, integrate and appear to be tuned to specific odours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Prieto-Godino et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, Prieto-Godino et al. also show that there is cell number variation in this neuronal population across drosophilids and that blocking PCD in <italic>melanogaster</italic> results in the survival of mosquito-like CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons in the maxillary palps. This suggests that both the central and peripheral nervous system may use similar modes of early PCD to sculpt circuits during the evolution of true flies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cell death during neurogenesis is widespread across insects</title><p>Our data show that PCD is extensive and widespread during neurogenesis in the CNS of insects, from the primitive firebrats <italic>Thermobia domestica</italic>, to true flies <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and the swift lousefly <italic>Crataerina pallida.</italic></p><p>We wondered whether alterations in cell death may have contributed to adaptations in the VNC of flightless dipterans and found that a greater extent of PCD in the MNB lineage may be responsible for abolishing the segment-specific difference in octopaminergic cell numbers in the swift lousefly <italic>Crataerina pallida</italic> – which has lost flight and gained adaptations to a parasitic lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bequaert, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagan, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hutson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lehane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petersen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Walker and Rotherham, 2010b</xref>). As octopaminergic neurons are involved in flight-related behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brembs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duch and Pflüger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roeder, 2005</xref>), we suggest that PCD has been co-opted in this lineage during the evolution of flightlessness in the swift louse. We believe that this PCD takes place early, in newly born neurons, as we have seen dying cells close to the MNB in all of our 20 pupae, from Day 4 to Day 23. Therefore, the decrease in octopaminergic cell number in the mesothoracic segment of swift louseflies is likely the result of increased hemilineage-specific PCD during evolution. Alternatively, an increase in the number of neurons in the non-flying prothorax and metathorax could lead to a uniform population size across thoracic segments in swift louseflies. This could be achieved either by additional MNB divisions, or by reduced PCD. If changes in MNB proliferation play a role remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Midline neurons show hemilineage-based variations in different species</title><p>The midline neurons within the VNC of insects have long been a source of interest because they are homologous across species, yet show a diversity in cell numbers correlated with body form and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stevenson and Spörhase-Eichmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Witten and Truman, 1998</xref>).

These two midline neuronal populations are derived from the same NB, the MNB, which buds off multiple GMCs, each dividing once to generate a GABAergic (A cell) and an octopaminergic (B cell) neuron. Both A and B neurons are generated in equal numbers but, in all cases, the numbers of GABAergic (‘hemilineage A’) and octopaminergic (‘hemilineage B’) neurons within one segment are never the same. The greater numbers of GABAergic cells within each segment has been shown in grasshoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia and Siegler, 2002</xref>) and fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Truman et al., 2010</xref>) to be the result of removal by PCD of large numbers of cells from hemilineage B.</p><p>As suggested by our previous work, the ‘hemilineage’ emerges as a discrete developmental unit that shows common features of gene expression and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lacin and Truman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shepherd et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Truman et al., 2010</xref>).

It remains for us to determine if early PCD takes place in these specific bee lice lineages during development and causes the reduction in bundle diameter that we see in flight hemilineages. As with most parasitic insects, bee and swift louseflies are impossible to maintain in the laboratory in the absence of their hosts and procuring them is a challenge (e.g. bee louseflies are now only found on two islands in the UK, while collecting swift louseflies is restricted to the summer months due to <italic>Apus apus</italic> migrations). Nonetheless, our observations that PCD is widespread across insects complements our findings in bee louseflies, strongly suggesting that an extensive PCD in flight hemilineages may have accompanied the loss of flight during evolution. Interestingly, the reduction in fibre diameter we see in bee louseflies was not evident in swift louseflies. This difference is likely due to the more significant changes to body plan in bee louseflies, i.e. a complete loss of the flight apparatus during evolution. Swift louseflies however still maintain vestigial wings and halteres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Walker and Rotherham, 2010b</xref>), whereas bee louseflies have a severely reduced thorax, completely lacking wings, halteres and flight muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McAlister, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here we have shown that undead neurons elaborate complex arborisations, express distinct transmitter identities and function. We find that ‘early’ PCD is widespread during the development of the CNS of insects from the primitive firebrats, to most derived true flies. Early cell death appears to be a specific subtype of PCD present across animals. Understanding how early PCD is specified across species should help us elucidate how nervous systems are built and evolve. Our exploration of homologous lineages in flightless dipterans shows that changes in body plan may accompany changes in the extent and pattern of PCD. As the evolutionary changes seen in neural networks ultimately result from heritable differences in developmental processes, our future endeavours will be directed towards elucidating how genetic programs are deployed to establish the pattern of PCD. The cellular leitmotif of hemilineage-based cell death, we present here, provides us with something tangible that we can search for. Thus, we suggest that viewing the evolution of insect nervous systems through the lens of the ‘hemilineage’ will be critical for understanding how development brings about adaptive changes in neural network motifs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>worniu</td><td>FlyBase</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0001983</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>TDC2</td><td>FlyBase</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0050446</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>VGlut</td><td>FlyBase</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0031424</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>hid</td><td>FlyBase</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0003997</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>grim</td><td>FlyBase</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0015946</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>rpr</td><td>FlyBase</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0011706</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>skl</td><td>FlyBase</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0036786</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Dronc</td><td>FlyBase</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0026404</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Worniu-GAL4</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:56553; FLYB:FBtp0021524; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_56553">BDSC_56553</ext-link></td><td>FlyBase symbol: P{wor.GAL4.A}</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Tdc2-GAL4</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:9313; FLYB:FBtp0127561; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_9313">BDSC_9313</ext-link></td><td>FlyBase symbol: P{Tdc2-GAL4.C}</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>OK371-GAL4</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC: 26160; FLYB:FBti0076967; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_26160">BDSC_26160</ext-link></td><td>FlyBase symbol: Dmel\P{GawB}VGlut<sup>OK371</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-SR4VH</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Fly line maintained in DW Williams lab; See Materials and methods, section ‘Contstruction of <italic>UAS-SR4VH</italic>’</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-CD8::GFP</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:5137; FLYB:FBtp0002652 <break/>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_5137">BDSC_5137</ext-link></td><td>FlyBase symbol: P{UAS-mCD8::GFP.L}</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-tdTomato-p2A-GCaMP6s</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref></td><td/><td>Gift from MH Dickinson</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>H99</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:1576; FLYB:FBab0022359; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_1576">BDSC_1576</ext-link></td><td>FlyBase symbol: Df(3L)H99</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>XR38</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peterson et al., 2002</xref></td><td>FLYB:FBab0027961</td><td>FlyBase symbol: Df(3L)XR38</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>dronc<sup>∆A8</sup></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kondo et al., 2006</xref></td><td>FLYB:FBal0244156</td><td>FlyBase symbol: Dronc<sup>ΔA8</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Crataerina pallida</italic>)</td><td>Swift lousefly</td><td>Collected from Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, UK</td><td/><td>Whole CNS or just VNC freshly dissected from <italic>Crataerina pallida</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Braula coeca</italic>)</td><td>Bee lousefly</td><td>A.

After heat-shock, larvae were immediately returned to 23°C or 25°C. Cell death was blocked in clones homozygous for the loss-of-function allele of the initiator caspase Dronc. Because we used the octopaminergic driver line <italic>TDC2-GAL4</italic> to induce the expression of CD8::GFP and TrpA1, we were able to visualise and thermogenetically activate only postembryonic neurons of hemilineage 0B. A small number of wild-type octopaminergic neurons are born during postembryonic neurogenesis (one in T1 and T3, 4–5 in T2, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We used males as we found they are more responsive to octopamine release by thermogenetic activation than females (data not shown). The headless flies were brushed back into a food vial placed on its side and left to recover for at least 1 hr. To generate the heat ramp required to thermogenetically activate undead neurons, we used a 12V thermoelectric Peltier plate (model: TEC1-12706, size: 40 mm x 40 mm x 3.6 mm) connected to a DC power supply (HY3005D, Rapid Electronics) set at a constant current of 0.46A, with a variable voltage, calibrated using an infrared laser thermometer (N92FX, Maplin). These settings generated a temperature ramp which lasted 70 s from 22°C to 34°C. Videos were recorded at 25 fps using a Sony NEX-5N digital camera (kindly provided by Ian Wynne) mounted to a stereo microscope. A piece of graph paper was used for spatial calibration. To match the presence of undead neurons with behaviour, each decapitated fly used for thermogenetic activation was indexed and prepared for dissection and immunostaining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Two-photon calcium imaging in behaving intact flies</title><p>The method for in vivo two-photon imaging of the VNC in behaving adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>.

Walking epochs were determined by placing a threshold on ball rotations, which were first converted into anterior-posterior (v<sub>forward</sub>) and medial-lateral (v<sub>side</sub>) speeds (one rot s<sup>−1</sup> = 31.42 mm s<sup>−1</sup>) and into degrees s<sup>−1</sup> (1 rot s<sup>−1</sup> = 360° s<sup>−1</sup>) for yaw (v<sub>rotation</sub>) movements. Thresholds were 0.12 mm, 0.12 mm and 5°, respectively. Periods below these thresholds were considered ‘resting’ while other periods were considered ‘walking’. Fluorescence traces for epochs with the same behaviour were aligned by start point to compute average %∆R/R traces for specific actions.</p><p>To calculate fluorescence traces for small subregions-of-interest across neuritic bundles containing both undead and wild-type neurites, images were registered using an optic flow method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>. This registration served to minimise motion artefacts. Analysis was limited to a period with no warping artefacts and no ROI disappearance.

In this manner, all fluorescence intensity along Line plots have a common scale from 0 to 1, with one being the highest value encountered along that Line.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of thermogenetic activation</title><p>Decapitated flies were considered to be walking if they covered a distance greater than one body length and moved their legs in a coordinated sequence from T3 to T2 to T1 at least once on each side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2015</xref>). Forward, backward and sideway movements were all interpreted as walking when both aforementioned conditions were respected. To generate fly body traces video recordings were imported in MATLAB (R2018a, MathWorks) and the centroid of the decapitated fly (located on the scutellum) was extracted from each frame using a custom-written script which can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/snznpp/undead-walking">github.com/snznpp/undead-walking</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pop, 2020</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/undead-walking">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/undead-walking</ext-link>). Each frame was converted into a greyscale image, its contrast enhanced using contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalisation, filtered using a Gaussian smoothing kernel with a standard deviation of 4, binarised using a custom threshold and the geometric centre of the fly body automatically extracted and stored in an array. To confirm that the centroid detection was accurate, a red dot with the centroid coordinates was superimposed onto each frame of the original recording and the annotated movie was saved for manual inspection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification of 3A/3B bundle diameters</title><p>For calculating 3A/3B hemilineage bundle diameter ratios in fruit flies and bee louseflies, we generated transverse rendered maximum intensity projections of inverted greyscale confocal stacks for the pro- and mesothorax (T1 and T2) and frontal projections for the metathorax (T3). Optical sections were selected to include the common lineage bundle and the individual hemilineage bundles after their split.

It takes advantage of the idea that the bauplan of insect nervous systems is highly conserved and asks how programmed cell death (PCD) might be used in different species to construct their neural circuitry. First, the authors present comparative data illustrating high levels of programmed cell death in neurons that would likely have been associated with flight circuitry in insects that have lost flight. Then, by exploiting a new tool that they have developed to monitor cell death, they illustrate that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> programmed cell death occurs soon after neurons are born. By blocking cell death, they demonstrate that these &quot;undead&quot; neurons can be integrated into normal neural circuits and can drive behavior. The data are of high quality and well presented, and the manuscript is well written.</p><p>In our consultations, we all felt that the paper is written almost backwards from how we may have organized the data. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> results provide a compelling case that neurons are eliminated early after birth and that blocking their death can lead them to be integrated into functional circuits. The comparative work provides examples of how these results from <italic>Drosophila</italic> may generalize and may contribute to adaptation, should be presented later. This ordering would also have the salubrious effect of not encouraging readers to think that the authors should have done the manipulative experiments in the non-model species. The way it is structured now, the thought immediately occurs, &quot;Why don't they block programmed cell death in the species that have lost most of the neurons?&quot; Then one realizes that this experiment is probably technically impossible at the moment, given the challenges of rearing these species. By rearranging the results, the readers would not jump to this idea as an &quot;obvious&quot; experiment.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is no direct quantification of PCD between the different species, instead there are correlative measures. Therefore, the language surrounding the implications of Figures 2 and 3 needs to be tempered in regard to the stated goal in the subsection “Early mode of neuronal cell death is found in many different insects” (determining if the loss of flight resulted in increased PCD). This goal is difficult to meet without directly measuring differences in PCD and the comparative approach can only show correlation, not causation. In Figure 2 they use a ratio of the number of OA neurons present in the pro- vs. mesothoracic neuromeres as a correlate of PCD as previous work has shown that PCD eliminates OAergic neurons in some species. The assumption made here is that if there is a lower ratio of OA neurons in the pro vs. mesothoracic neuromeres, then there must have been more PCD in the mesothoracic segments for the flightless flies. However, could it not be just as likely that there is increased PCD in non-winged neuromeres in flying insects? There is a good deal of interspecies variability in the number of OA neurons within each neuromere, so it's hard to attribute loss of flight for differences in these ratios which is the stated in the aforementioned subsection. The same sort of concern can be raised for the data in Figure 3. The authors show a decrease in the bundle width of wing vs. leg neuropil innervating hemilineages, but again without quantification of PCD, this should be framed as correlational. In addition, there is a danger in placing too little stock in the possibility of non-flight related roles for OA neurons. Please note that we are not requesting additional experiments here.</p><p>2) The walking behaviour experiments. The Tdc2-Gal4 will be expressed in all 'undead' octopaminergic neurons (including those from the MNB). It will also be expressed in 'WT' octopaminergic neurons (that are dronc-/-). Because of this, it will not be possible for the authors to determine whether bouts of walking in the headless fly were initiated due to the activation of the 'undead' octopaminergic neurons from the MNB or from any of the other octopaminergic neurons. The authors seem to have images of each walking fly's thorax (5E). Can they examine these to determine whether all the animals that walked had 'undead' neurons from the MNB lineage?</p><p>3) The functional imaging experiments: The authors reason that undead neurons outnumber their wild-type counterparts, and therefore their Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal must be from the undead neurons. One can buy that, but we wonder if, in their images, the authors also have any of the neurites that are specific to the undead cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from there will be irrefutable.</p><p>4) A general comment that is also stated in the summary. We found each result in this manuscript interesting. Yet, there is a discontinuity in the way the results are stitched together. While the evolutionary comparisons are to do with flight and the lineages related to flight, the latter part of the story that deals with the 'undead' neurons relate to walking. We can't think of an appropriate fix for this. If the authors were to ignore flight, the evolutionary angle is meaningless; if they were to focus on the evolutionary angle (which is lovely), the functionality of the undead neurons must be assessed in the light of flight, not walking. It is possible that the Lineage 0B modulates both flight and walking – locomotion in general. In this case the authors could discuss upfront that walking is being used in their functional imaging experiments because it's an easier prep that will nevertheless report on connectivity of the undead neurons.</p><p>5) Do the authors have data looking at markers of PCD in the bee and swift louseflies? If so please include them. If not, given the challenges of COVID-19 and the difficulty of obtaining these animals we do not request these as new experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59566.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In our consultations, we all felt that the paper is written almost backwards from how we may have organized the data.

This goal is difficult to meet without directly measuring differences in PCD and the comparative approach can only show correlation, not causation. In Figure 2 they use a ratio of the number of OA neurons present in the pro- vs. mesothoracic neuromeres as a correlate of PCD as previous work has shown that PCD eliminates OAergic neurons in some species. The assumption made here is that if there is a lower ratio of OA neurons in the pro vs. mesothoracic neuromeres, then there must have been more PCD in the mesothoracic segments for the flightless flies. However, could it not be just as likely that there is increased PCD in non-winged neuromeres in flying insects? There is a good deal of interspecies variability in the number of OA neurons within each neuromere, so it's hard to attribute loss of flight for differences in these ratios which is the stated in the aforementioned subsection. The same sort of concern can be raised for the data in Figure 3. The authors show a decrease in the bundle width of wing vs. leg neuropil innervating hemilineages, but again without quantification of PCD, this should be framed as correlational. In addition, there is a danger in placing too little stock in the possibility of non-flight related roles for OA neurons. Please note that we are not requesting additional experiments here.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the language around the involvement of PCD in the evolution of flightlessness from causative to correlational, see Results and Discussion. We discussed that changes in the MNB lineage in the swift lousefly may be due to changes in proliferation. We clarify that octopaminergic neurons have a role in both walking and flight, Introduction section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The walking behaviour experiments. The Tdc2-Gal4 will be expressed in all 'undead' octopaminergic neurons (including those from the MNB). It will also be expressed in 'WT' octopaminergic neurons (that are dronc-/-). Because of this, it will not be possible for the authors to determine whether bouts of walking in the headless fly were initiated due to the activation of the 'undead' octopaminergic neurons from the MNB or from any of the other octopaminergic neurons. The authors seem to have images of each walking fly's thorax (5E). Can they examine these to determine whether all the animals that walked had 'undead' neurons from the MNB lineage?</p></disp-quote><p>Because of MARCM, the TDC2-Gal4 is only expressed in dronc+/+ neurons. To clarify, we include Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and clarify in subsection “Undead neurons are functional and integrate into motor networks”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The functional imaging experiments: The authors reason that undead neurons outnumber their wild-type counterparts, and therefore their Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal must be from the undead neurons. One can buy that, but we wonder if, in their images, the authors also have any of the neurites that are specific to the undead cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from there will be irrefutable.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the complex nature of this experiment, we used H99/XR38 where it’s impossible to separate WT from undead. We justify our choice of fly and clarify that the thicker bundle of the bifurcation must contain mostly undead neurons in the Materials and methods. Additionally, Figure 3—figure supplement 2 of MARCM undead neurons helps us make the point that all undead neurons take a turn collectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A general comment that is also stated in the summary. We found each result in this manuscript interesting. Yet, there is a discontinuity in the way the results are stitched together. While the evolutionary comparisons are to do with flight and the lineages related to flight, the latter part of the story that deals with the 'undead' neurons relate to walking. We can't think of an appropriate fix for this. If the authors were to ignore flight, the evolutionary angle is meaningless; if they were to focus on the evolutionary angle (which is lovely), the functionality of the undead neurons must be assessed in the light of flight, not walking. It is possible that the Lineage 0B modulates both flight and walking – locomotion in general. In this case the authors could discuss upfront that walking is being used in their functional imaging experiments because it's an easier prep that will nevertheless report on connectivity of the undead neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Rearranging the manuscript and explaining that octopaminergic neurons are involved in both walking and flight hopefully helps to clear this confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Do the authors have data looking at markers of PCD in the bee and swift louseflies? If so please include them. If not, given the challenges of COVID-19 and the difficulty of obtaining these animals we do not request these as new experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We use 2 criteria for detecting dying cells: 1) antibody for active effector caspase Dcp-1 which and 2) the morphology of Dcp-1 labelled cells – they are clearly pyknotic cell remnants indicative of a cell dying and being broken down into bits, see Figure 7I compared with Figure 2—figure supplement 1. We don’t have any other data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
