When cell division is favored, centrioles accumulate thousands of copies of hundreds of different proteins to amass the pericentriolar material (PCM). From this PCM, microtubules are nucleated to form the mitotic spindle that facilitates accurate chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wittmann et al., 2001</xref>). Under conditions where division is not favored, or the cell is terminally differentiated, a ciliogenesis program is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>). During ciliogenesis, the centriole moves from the cell center to the plasma membrane to become a basal body. Doublet microtubules elongate from the distal end of the basal body to form the axoneme, which extends beyond the cell periphery covered in plasma membrane to form a specialized compartment called the cilium. These nine, doublet microtubules provide a structural scaffold, and are essential for transport within the ciliary compartment, which can be up to several micrometers in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stepanek and Pigino, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>). Depending on the needs of the cell, the cilium can be either a motile cilium, like those that propel sperm or move fluid in the airway, or an immotile sensory cilium, like the light-sensitive compartment of photoreceptor cells or cilia that participate in tissue patterning via the Hedgehog signal-transduction pathway. Genetic mutations that result in structurally defective axonemes, such as those lacking axonemal dyneins, result in defective cilia and give rise to a group of human diseases called ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). The wide range of phenotypes associated with ciliopathies reveal the important role that axoneme structure and cilium integrity play in human development.</p><p>In all species in which centrioles have been defined, centrioles are comprised of microtubules arranged in a 9-fold symmetrical cylinder. During centriole duplication in S phase, a 9-fold symmetric structure called the cartwheel is assembled that defines the fundamental centriole geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azimzadeh and Marshall, 2010</xref>). The cartwheel is composed of nine symmetrically arranged SAS-6 homodimers that attach to the microtubules of the centriole through a structure called the pinhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>). At the end of mitosis, many cartwheel proteins are no longer present at the centriole, presumably because the cartwheel has been degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vorobjev and Chentsov, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arquint and Nigg, 2014</xref>). While all organisms that have centrioles use SAS-6 to set the 9-fold geometry, the microtubules that comprise the centriole cylinder can be singlet, doublet or triplet microtubules depending on species, and the structures that the centriole will nucleate in the cell. In the early <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryo, centrioles are comprised of 9 singlet-microtubule (SMT) rods surrounding a central cylinder and non-motile cilia are formed in sensory neurons after the singlet centriole has been converted to a doublet basal body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie and Thomson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pelletier et al., 2006</xref>). Most <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells have full or incomplete doublet-microtubule (DMT) centrioles, although singlets seem to dominate in the early embryo, which has very rapid cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bate, 2009</xref>). DMT centrioles template the formation of nonmotile cilia in the sensory organ precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hartenstein and Posakony, 1989</xref>). However, in the male germline stem cells, the doublet centriole is converted to a triplet basal body, and it is this triplet basal body that facilitates the formation of a motile axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gottardo et al., 2015</xref>). In mammals, the triplet centriole is the default state, and depending on cell fate, triplet centrioles facilitate the formation of the appropriate cilium type.</p><p>The relationships between the microtubules of the centriole and the axoneme are poorly understood. Data from plastic-embedded sections have shown that centrioles in mammalian cells are composed of angled TMTs that give rise to axonemes with inline DMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paintrand et al., 1992</xref>). However, it is unclear how this change in geometry is achieved. Electron cryo-tomography studies of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> basal bodies have shown that the microtubules of the axoneme are contiguous with those of the basal body and have also revealed numerous non-tubulin decorations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012</xref>). However, the lack of high-resolution structural data of centrioles prior to ciliogenesis has hampered our understanding of centriole biogenesis and axonemal templating. Recent technological advances have pushed the attainable resolution of single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) to rival that of X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paulsen et al., 2015</xref>). These single-particle cryoEM methods have been applied to solve the structure of isolated axonemes at sub-nanometer resolution, revealing new aspects of its structure and decoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>). Such high resolution is facilitated by the structural rigidity and extreme length of axonemes, greatly enhancing the number of units that can be averaged. However, the contextual information and information on the connection between the axonemes and the basal bodies is lost upon isolation. By contrast, electron cryo-tomography (cryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging can maintain all relevant spatial information, albeit at the expense of resolution due to a thicker sample and typically reduced potential for averaging (1000 s of copies of the relevant structural unit vs. 100,000 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mahamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kourkoutis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we focus on defining the structure of centrioles purified from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) or <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cells by cryoET. Our data show that, although mammalian and fly centrioles have a broadly similar quasi-9-fold symmetrical cylindrical architecture, the linkages between centriole microtubules that achieve this architecture are completely different. Furthermore, the longer mammalian centriole is organized into two distinct domains along its proximal-distal axis: a proximal domain, whose composition of interconnected triplets shares geometry with the fly centriole, and a distal domain comprised of novel linkages between centriole microtubules, generating a geometry that is intermediate between that of the proximal centriole and an axoneme. Together our data suggest a model where the distal mammalian centriole provides a transitional region that allows for the templating of both motile and sensory axonemes, a region and potential that does not exist in somatic fly centrioles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mammalian centriole structure</title><p>We first examined the overall structure of mammalian centrioles in ice. Purified CHO centrosomes were imaged using electron cryo-tomography (cryoET), and tomograms of centrioles were generated. These CHO centrioles were on average 440 nm long, and appeared to taper along their length, being wider at the proximal end, which would be connected to the central hub, and narrower at the distal end which, in a basal body, would face the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Proximal and distal ends of the centriole are denoted ‘p’ and ‘d’, respectively. (<bold>b</bold>) Sub-volume averaging of CHO centrioles generated a map with triplet microtubules, consisting of a complete 13-protofilament A-tubule, and 10-protofilament B- and C-tubules. Both parts of the A-C linker (green double arrowheads) that connects adjacent triplets were obvious in the map, as was the pinhead (gold arrow) attached to protofilament A03.

We did not observe any distal or subdistal appendages decorating the TMTs, and were thus unable to use appendages to distinguish mother from daughter centrioles in our tomograms. To determine the structure of the TMTs, disc-shaped volumes 3 tubulin heterodimers in height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were extracted along the length of each individual TMT rod, for each centriole (N = 9) (see Materials and methods). The choice of a 3 tubulin (24 nm) segment length is somewhat arbitrary, but was chosen as a tradeoff between maximizing the number of segments (better averages) but still reliably allowing for the discovery of structures having 4, 8, and 16 nm repeats. This produced a dataset that contained ~2100 unique subvolumes, which were aligned to a common reference (see Methods) and averaged to generate a global map of the CHO TMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) (EMD-7775) at ~3.5 nm resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) although local resolution metrics indicate that the majority of the volume has a resolution between 2.4 and 2.8 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Consistent with previously published data from basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guichard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012</xref>), the CHO centriole consisted of a TMT having a 13 protofilament A-tubule and 10 protofilament B- and C-tubules. The external surface of the global map showed two large densities - the ‘pinhead’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> - orange arrow) that bound to protofilament A03, and both parts of theA-C linker’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> - green double arrowheads) a structure known to bridge adjacent TMTs through the C08/C09 and A09 protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Winey and O'Toole, 2014</xref>). Additionally, external densities were evident in three clusters near A01/A02-B10 (the inner A-B junction), A09-A10 and B08-C10 (the inner BC-junction). Given the high degree of structural preservation using cryoET, the lack of cartwheel spokes attaching to the pinhead is in agreement with published work suggesting that the cartwheel is specific to procentrioles and removed during the progression from mitosis to interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vorobjev and Chentsov, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arquint and Nigg, 2014</xref>).</p><p>At this resolution, we observed four microtubule-internal proteins (MIPs) on the luminal surfaces of the TMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The most prominent was within the A-tubule, straddling a gap between the A09 and A10 protofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>), a gap that was much larger than between any of the other protofilaments of the A-tubule (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Recent single-particle cryoEM data on cilia assigned the microtubule seam between the A09 and A10 protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>). This suggested that the large A-tubule MIP is binding along the internal surface of the A-tubule at the unique microtubule seam. This roughly two-fold symmetric MIP connects diagonally across the seam, although whether the connection is to the two adjacent α- or β-tubulin subunits cannot be determined at this resolution. A second, smaller A-tubule MIP appeared to bind directly to protofilament A11. MIPs also bound to the luminal surfaces of the B- and C-tubules, bridging the B01-B02 and C01-C02 protofilaments, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). While the function of the B- and C-tubule MIPs is unknown, their similarity in shape and positioning suggest a common mechanism likely important for defining or stabilizing the outer AB- and BC-junctions.</p><p>To regenerate the 9-fold symmetry of the centriole, the average was fit back into the raw data using the refined coordinates and angles from the sub-volume alignment. This refitting revealed that all centrioles in our dataset were significantly flattened. While the degree of flattening varied between datasets, some centrioles more closely resembled two parallel arrays of triplet microtubules than the stereotypical 9-fold symmetric structure that was expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This flattening implied that while the centriole linkages are strong enough to maintain the 9 triplet microtubules in an ensemble structure, the linkages are also quite flexible and readily deformed when centrioles are isolated from the crowded cellular environment. Furthermore, the centriole refits indicated that other structures, which we had wanted to study, such as the cartwheel, would be non uniformly deformed in our isolated centrosomes.

These data also suggested that it is not the isolation procedure that induces flattening, but likely the forces generated during ice-sheet formation.

Applying the published distal symmetry to the distal portion of our CHO centriole produced a map clearly different from the proximal centriole map. The overall diameter of the distal centriole had decreased to ~220 nm, a change achieved by a rotation of the triplets inwards by ~15˚. This change in diameter from the proximal centriole accounts for the centriole tapering that we initially observed in the tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Far from being universally conserved, our data show distinct strategies used by <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals and reveal unexpected heterogeneities within centrioles of each species. Adaptations in the microtubule-microtubule linkages compensate for differences in microtubule number with adjacent doublets in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> centriole connected by an A-A linker, while an A-C linker connects the mammalian triplets. Within the mammalian centriole, there is an abrupt transition between a proximal core domain and a distal domain leading to distinct 9-fold geometries and requiring novel linkages for stabilization in these two distinct zones. The net result is that the distal centriolar segment is much closer in geometry to the ciliary axoneme than is the proximal core.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Novel linkages maintain the 9-fold symmetry of centrioles despite differences in microtubule structure</title><p>The 9-fold symmetry of all motile and nonmotile cilia is universally conserved in all organisms thus far studied. However, the decoration of motile cilia with dyneins and radial spokes differentiates motile cilia from sensory cilia both structurally and functionally. While the 9-fold symmetry of the cilium is highly conserved, the centriolar microtubules that nucleate them are structurally diverse.</p><p>Bioinformatic data suggest that the ancestral eukaryotic centriole was composed of triplet microtubules; this architecture has been maintained across the evolutionary spectrum in organisms ranging from trypanosomes to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2011</xref>). However, there are numerous examples where centriole microtubule number has changed. In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster</italic> early embryos, centrioles are composed of SMTs, while centrioles are composed of DMTs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> somatic cells. Previous studies have established that adjacent triplet microtubules in basal bodies are linked through an A-C linker connecting A09 with C08/C09 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guichard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paintrand et al., 1992</xref>). This is also the case for the proximal half of the mammalian centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) leaving unexplained how SMTs and DMTs could be linked.</p><p>Rather than adapting the A-C linker to fit the doublet centriole, a structurally distinct linkage has evolved to support SMTs and DMTs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> – the A-A linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). A similar connection strategy may very well be employed in other organisms without TMTs, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic>. From our maps, this A-A linker consists of a hinge-like density extending from protofilaments A05/A06 and reaching across to make attachments to a new domain of an elaborated pinhead from the adjacent doublet. Structurally, the A-A linker does not resemble the A-C linker. This is perhaps unsurprising given that the A-A linker resides in a different location from the A-C linker. Moreover, this linkage also appears to serve as the primary anchor point for the surrounding PCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6b</xref>) connecting either directly or indirectly to proteins such as Asl and Plp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roque et al., 2018</xref>). Given the diversity in the linkages, yet the maintenance of the geometry, it is clear that evolution puts a premium on maintaining the geometry of the centriole, an organization that is instructive in determining cilium geometry.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Centriole domains</title><p>Rather than being homogeneous, the proximal and distal portions of the mammalian centriole have distinct architectures. The proximal ~200 nm are decorated with the pinhead, consistent with previous structures of basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guichard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012</xref>), while the ~200 nm distal domain lacks the pinhead and exhibits a distinct architecture. In the fly, only the ~175 nm, pinhead-decorated domain is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These data suggest that all centrioles share a common core,~200 nm in length, but that mammalian centrioles are distally extended. Since fly DMT centrioles are only competent to form sensory cilia, whereas mammalian TMT centrioles can form both motile and sensory cilia, it is tempting to speculate that the distal extension endows the centriole with this expanded potential.</p><p>The distal mammalian centriole transitions to a narrower diameter and a geometry more reminiscent of an axoneme. This change in geometry parallels the appearance of two novel linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). One is a non-canonical A-C linker that links protofilament A09 with protofilaments C07/C08 at the end of the partial C-tubule, helping to explain the persistence of the partial C-tubule along the distal centriole. Whether the incomplete C-tubule helps in the formation of the linker or the linker blocks C-tubule completion cannot be discerned from our data. The second distal linker zigzags from one inner AB-junction to an adjacent inner AB-junction. In the absence of a canonical A-C linker in the distal centriole, these novel linkers work together to link adjacent TMTs and enforce more axoneme-like and perhaps more rigid geometry.</p><p>The mechanism by which the pinhead terminates at ~200 nm along the centriole from the proximal end is unclear, but its disappearance along the centriole axis happens quite abruptly indicating that it is precisely determined, rather than developed statistically. One possibility is that length determination resides within the cartwheel rather than within the centriole, with cartwheel length being actively controlled, thereby defining the length of the pinhead-containing region. Indeed, recent work in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo shows that cartwheel length is actively regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aydogan et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>MIPs</title><p>A pronounced feature of previously determined basal body and axoneme structures is the presence of a plethora of MIPs that decorate the luminal surface of the microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Linck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maheshwari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oda et al., 2014</xref>). Due to their position and structure, it is believed that many of these MIPs add to the structural integrity of the microtubules, especially important within axonemes that are generating or subject to force.</p><p>While the purpose of the A-tubule MIP that straddles protofilaments A09 and A10 in both fly and mammalian centrioles is unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5b</xref>), its common location and shape are suggestive of a conserved role in microtubule stability. A similarly located density has been identified in axonemes, and is called MIP2. We favor the idea that this MIP is binding across the seam of the A-tubule, the position of which has been assigned from recent cryoEM work in axonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, these two protofilaments are more widely separated than the others and the MIP binds diagonally across the gap, thus preferentially interacting with the same tubulin type (either α-tubulin or β-tubulin) on either side of the seam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A MIP straddling the microtubule seam may confer extra stability to the A-tubule, accounting for the extraordinary stability of centriolar microtubules. The larger spacing between protofilaments A09 and A10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), may also allow the A-tubule to distort creating unique binding sites on the A-tubule. Consistent with this idea, protofilament B01 binds to the lateral surface of protofilament A10, suggesting that an A10-B01 lateral interaction may contribute to B-tubule nucleation or stabilization. Furthermore, both the canonical- and non-canonical A-C linkers bind to protofilament A09 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and d</xref>). Taken together, we believe that this seam-MIP combination is a hotspot providing unique sites that contribute to A-tubule functionality.</p><p>Based on their binding location, we initially speculated that the mammalian B- and C-tubule MIPs also played some role in tubule formation or stabilization. While the MIP straddling A09 and A10 in both species supports a role in B-tubule initiation, the MIP linking B01/B02 does not as it is only present in the mammalian TMT. Moreover the B-tubules in both species have the same curvature and protofilament number independent of this B01/B02 MIP. Given the apparent pause in B-tubule completion observed in the S2 centriole, it seems more plausible that a B01/B02 MIP enhances construction kinetics of the B-tubule, ensuring its timely construction. The corresponding and similarly shaped MIP at C01/C02 is likely to play an analogous role in facilitating efficient initiation and timely completion of the C-tubule which is necessary for formation of a stable A-C linker. The A-A linker of the fly centriole imposes no such restraint on B-tubule construction, allowing the completion of the B-tubule to be somewhat <italic>ad hoc</italic>. The similar shape and parallel roles of the B and C tubule MIPS also suggests that they likely share molecular components. An intriguing possibility is that this Y-shaped MIP corresponds to the recently discovered TED complex composed of delta and epsilon tubulins and two accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breslow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In the absence of the delta- and epsilon-tubulin complex, centrioles do form, but are unstable and subsequently disintegrate, suggesting that the delta/epsilon-tubulin complex is necessary to stabilize the TMT. Consistent with this, these proteins are absent in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and S2 centrioles lack those MIPs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Biogenesis of the B-tubule</title><p>Incomplete B-tubules in the fly centriole have previously been described and are thought to represent construction intermediates in the rapidly dividing embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moritz et al., 1995</xref>). Intriguingly, classification of the B-tubule gave a class in which microtubule sheets curve inward from both the inner- and outer-AB junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Surprisingly, these ‘microtubule stubs’ are sufficiently stable to have a curvature indistinguishable from the complete tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Based on these microtubule stubs, we favor the idea that we are capturing B-tubule construction intermediates. If this is indeed the case, it implies that B-tubule construction is bidirectional, with the sheets presumably meeting to complete the B-tubule.</p><p>We do not see any such B-tubule, microtubule stubs in our CHO centrioles as all those B-tubules are complete, and so we have no hints as to how B-tubules form in CHO centrioles. Microtubule stubs reminiscent of those we see in our cryo-tomography data of S2 centrioles have previously been observed in thermally fractionated (40˚ C for 5 min) Sea Urchin DMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Linck et al., 2014</xref>). While we did not subject our centrioles to thermal fractionating, we cannot exclude the possibility that the microtubule stubs seen in our S2 data represent damaged or depolymerizing B-tubules that occurs during purification or grid preparation.</p><p>While our cryoET data have resolved structures of the fly and mammalian centriole for the first time, it has only scratched the surface on determining the molecular structure of the centriole. Of relevance to many human diseases is how the centriole changes during ciliogenesis to become a membrane-anchored basal body, and allow for the establishment of structures like the transition zone and ciliary necklace, structures that are central to cilium formation and function. Many, if not most, of the densities that we see in centrioles are molecularly unidentified and of unknown function. With so many intriguing yet unidentified densities being revealed by this study and others, the focus now shifts to assigning their molecular identities and determining their functional roles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source/Reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell Line <break/>(Cricetulus griseus)</td><td valign="top">Chinese Hamster Ovary/CHO</td><td valign="top">UCSF Cell Culture Facility</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0214">CVCL_0214</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(Drosophila melanogaster)</td><td valign="top">Drosophila S2U/S2</td><td valign="top">Vale laboratory</td><td valign="top">Flybase ID: FBtc9000006</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound/drug</td><td valign="top">Demecolcine</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">SKU: D7385</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound/drug</td><td valign="top">Nocodazole</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">SKU: M1404</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">Relion</td><td valign="top"> <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bharat and Scheres, 2016</xref></td><td valign="top">PMC5215819</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Mycoplasma testing kit</td><td valign="top">Lonza</td><td valign="top">LT07-318</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-5-1"><title>Centrosome purification</title><p>Centrosome purification protocols were based on published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reber, 2011</xref>).

The cloudy lysate (~40 mL) was collected in a 50 mL conical tube, with care taken to leave the cell carcasses attached to the bottom of each flask, and the lysate made to 10 mM K-PIPES pH 7.2.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Insights into centriole biogenesis and evolution revealed by cryoTomography of doublet and triplet centrioles&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three reviewers (including myself, Reviewer #1), and the evaluation has been overseen by me, Jordan Raff, as Guest Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Tim Stearns (Reviewer #3).</p><p>I have discussed the reviews with the other reviewers and I am pleased to say that we think your article is of sufficient interest to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, although there are a number of issues that will need to be addressed prior to acceptance. I discuss the major points below and also provide lightly edited versions of the major points raised by the other two reviewers in the hope that these comments will help you address the four Major points listed below.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) You will need to supply more information about how the data was analysed, and why certain strategies were chosen. Why, for example, was a 24nm periodicity chosen as the basis for your averaging strategy? Were you able to measure any longitudinal periodicities from your data? Did you combine mother and daughter centrioles in your averaging? In addition, you claim a resolution of 25 Å, but give no details as to how this was determined and whether this applies to the whole structure.</p><p>2) You will need to explain more clearly why certain aspects of these structures were not analysed. Mammalian centrioles are generally thought to have a distal region composed of DMTs: was this absent from the centrioles you analysed here, or was it ignored for technical reasons? Similarly, an analysis of cartwheel structure would be extremely useful to the field, yet you make no attempt to do this, even in fly centrioles where most centrioles have this structure (and it is clearly evident in the centriole shown in Figure 5A).</p><p>3) Perhaps these omissions are due to the &quot;flattening&quot; problem but, if so, this needs to be better explained. Indeed, we felt it might be better to more prominently discuss the &quot;flattening&quot; problem at the start of the Results section, and to more directly describe how this influenced your subsequent analysis.</p><p>4) It would have greatly increased the impact of this work if you had examined the structure of fly centrioles lacking pericentrin/PLP. Your previous work showed that PLP is a key component of the interphase centriole in flies, and very likely a component of the amorphous brush-like structures you highlight in Figure 5A (Mennella et al., 2012 – see also Roque et al., 2018, which should be mentioned). We would have thought this analysis would be relatively straightforward. We would not insist on this but, if you really can't get this data, it would be helpful to discuss any insights you have as to why this approach may not be as straightforward as one might assume.</p><p>Reviewer comments informing summary review:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>1) The basis of averaging strategy, such as nine-fold symmetry and 24nm (3 tubulin dimers) periodicity, which is the fundamental basis of this study, is not clearly indicated. In the case of the axoneme, there are a number of studies (such as Goodenough and Heuser or by Peter Satir in 1980s) which proved 96nm repeat. In the axoneme, some structures such as MIPs follow, not 24nm, but other (16nm, 32nm) periodicity. 9fold symmetry and symmetry breaking (Hoops &amp; Witman; Bui et al., 2012, JCB) have been described in the axoneme field. Are there any evidence that these centrioles follow 24nm periodic and 9fold symmetry? Alternative periodicity cannot be excluded to explain some weak densities. In the tomogram of vertically oriented <italic>Drosophila</italic> centrioles, it will be possible to discuss 9fold symmetry. Did they mix daughter and mother centrioles?</p><p>2) Plunge-frozen centrioles used in this study were (except the one oriented vertical in ice) flattened. The authors fit averaged subtomograms from these tomograms but fitted it to another 3D tomogram which retained 9fold in the past work. Based on this fitting they discussed the positions of the A-C and A-A linkers. If these linkers keep linking the same protofilaments, they should be oriented differently in the flattened centrioles and thus should be smeared out by subtomogram averaging. What do the authors think? Do the linkers actually detach from the adjacent triplet (or doublet), retaining the angles of protrusion?</p><p>3) Classification process is not clear. In the text, they stated that four separate structures were obtained, but only two are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 1C is interesting. Do all the mammalian centrioles, which this reviewer thinks to have variety of the entire length, share the same length of the proximal region? How do they explain significant amount of &quot;red&quot; subtomograms within the white area in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C? Do they appear in all the centrioles analyzed in this work?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1) Doublet microtubule region of the centriole: The authors extracted the triplet microtubule region of centrioles for subvolume averaging (subsection “Mammalian centriole structure”). However, it is well-known that mature (as these seem to be) mammalian centrioles have a distal region composed of doublet microtubules (Paintrand et al., 1992). Analysis of this region is especially important to understanding the transition between the centriole and ciliary axoneme. The authors do describe differences that appear between the proximal end of the centriole and the region where the C-tubule becomes only a partial tubule, but it would helpful to know whether they averaged the doublet microtubule region proper, to determine whether there may be similarities or differences between the doublet and triplet microtubule regions. If not, this should be clearly stated in the text, in addition to a rationale about why this region was not analyzed. This is potentially very important in understanding whether the mature mammalian centriole could more properly be thought of as a core centriole with an axoneme initial segment on its distal end.</p><p>2) The cartwheel: The authors state that due to the centriole cycle, it is likely that none of the CHO cell centrioles retained their cartwheels. However, only centrioles in G1 lack cartwheels – procentrioles in S-phase, G2, and even early mitosis have cartwheels. In addition, centriole pairs in which the mother and procentriole are orthogonal and close to each other are probably engaged and thus be at a stage prior to removal of the cartwheel after disengagement (Shukla et al., 2015, Nature Communications). Thus, the centriole pair in Figure 1A is likely engaged based on orientation and proximity of the two centrioles. Did the authors analyze the base of this daughter centriole (or procentriole, if still engaged) to determine whether there is a cartwheel present? Were there other orthogonal pairs in their dataset that may have cartwheels in the procentrioles? This would be especially important to understand the nature of centriole engagement, for which no structural correlates are known. If no cartwheel was found in the orthogonal centriole pair(s), the authors should note that there is a possibility that the cartwheels were lost from CHO cell centrioles during isolation and fixation. <italic>Drosophila</italic> centrioles, in contrast to mammalian centrioles, retain their cartwheel though the cell cycle, so one would expect that all fly centrioles examined have, or had, cartwheels. Consistent with this, the fly centriole shown in Figure 5A has a cartwheel, based on the presence of a central tubule, which is likely the hub of the cartwheel. Was the cartwheel retained in all fly centrioles examined? If not, it would be important to note that the preparation results in loss of some cartwheel structure. This might also allow a determination as to whether it is retention of the cartwheel that better allowed some <italic>Drosophila</italic> centrioles to retain their structure and overall geometry.</p><p>3) Evolution: The authors previously published structural analysis of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> centrioles, which, like mammalian centrioles, have triplet microtubules. To maximize the evolution impact of this work, it would be helpful to know whether the linkages that reinforce 9-fold symmetry are similar between <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and mammalian centrioles, as well as whether any of the non-microtubule densities observed in C.r. are similar to those described here. In addition, the authors note that the density spanning A09 to A10 is conserved between all centriole and axoneme structures – could they state more definitively the degree to which the shape of this structure is similar between species, and thus whether it is consistent with a similar protein (complex) forming this structure?</p><p>4) Partial B-tubules: The authors interpret the presence of partial B-tubules that lack protofilaments B03-B06 as evidence that B-tubule assembly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> occurs from both the inner and outer edges of the A-tubule. However, it is known that during thermal fractionation of axonemes, B-tubule stubs attached to the A-tubule remain, while the rest of the B-tubule is lost (Linck and Langevin, 1981, JCB; Linck et al., 2014). Can the authors rule out the possibility that the partial B-tubule is a degradation product? If not, this interpretation should either be removed or qualified accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36851.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) You will need to supply more information about how the data was analysed, and why certain strategies were chosen.

Normally one makes this segment size as small as is consistent with signal to noise and alignability in an effort to minimize incoherence from bending, etc. Typically underlying periodicities are some multiple of the basic 4 nm tubulin repeat. Prompted by the reviewer’s question, we did assess whether we were missing a repeat larger than 8 nm (the largest observed) and generated a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). For this, we generated a starting model filtered to 10 nm resolution and devoid of repeating units such as the pinhead, A-C linker, or A09-A10 MIP. Furthermore, the proximal and distal subvolumes were taken as two separate classes, and independently aligned to this starting model.</p><p>Using subvolumes that were 40 nm in height (5 tubulin heterodimers), we did a translational search ( ± 13 nm) against the filtered model. After several iterations of searching, there was little change, and we present the averages after 10 iterations (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). This experiment showed the 8 nm periodicity of the A09-A10 MIP to be the same in the two independent, proximal and distal averages. The proximal average showed the pinhead and A-C linker with an 8 nm periodicity, while the distal average showed the novel inner-AB junction to also have 8 nm periodicity. We believe this is the best way to test the possibility of other periodicities along the longitudinal axis.</p><p>Mother versus daughter centrioles</p><p>Of the 9 centrioles that we used to generate the CHO TMT map, only one of the centrioles is unambiguously a daughter centriole (Figure 1). All other centrioles are not part of an obvious, orthogonal pair. Furthermore, we see no evidence of distal- or subdistal-appendages in any of the centrioles that we imaged, even in the centriole that is unambiguously a mother centriole (Figure 1). We have added a sentence addressing the appendages to the main text of the paper (Results first paragraph). Without obvious appendages, and in the absence of orthogonally arranged centrioles, we had no reliable way to determine whether non-paired centrioles are mother or daughter centrioles in our EM data, and so we averaged all centrioles together.</p><p>In future projects we would like to acquire a lot more data of orthogonally-arranged centriole pairs and be able to generate separate maps of mother and daughter centrioles. Such studies will help to address pertinent questions about mother versus daughter centrioles as raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Resolution</p><p>In the original manuscript, we reported a resolution of 2.5 nm for our maps. This calculation was based on the signal to noise ratio using Class3D alignment in Relion. A real-space local resolution assessment using ResMap also indicates the bulk of the triplet as being between 2.4 nm and 2.8 nm (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). A more unbiased method that avoids the possibility of over fitting the data is to use the gold standard FSC. We have re-calculated the resolution of our maps using the gold standard FSC in Relion, and this gives a resolution of ~3.5 nm. We have generated a new figure showing the masked region used for gold-standard FSC calculation, and the resolution plots for the maps that we show in the main figures (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) You will need to explain more clearly why certain aspects of these structures were not analysed. Mammalian centrioles are generally thought to have a distal region composed of DMTs: was this absent from the centrioles you analysed here, or was it ignored for technical reasons? Similarly, an analysis of cartwheel structure would be extremely useful to the field, yet you make no attempt to do this, even in fly centrioles where most centrioles have this structure (and it is clearly evident in the centriole shown in Figure 5A).</p></disp-quote><p>Doublet microtubules of the distal centriole</p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, the transition between the TMT mammalian centriole and the DMT axoneme is an especially important region. Work from the laboratory of Michel Bornens (Paintrand et al., 1992) using serial sectioning of resin-embedded centrosomes showed how the mammalian centriole changed along it’s proximal-distal axis. Their averaging of the extreme distal region indicated a DMT, but with a curved extension (Paintrand et al., Figures 3 and 8).</p><p>The centrioles in our dataset varied in length; the average length was 440 nm, the shortest and longest being 400 nm and 480 nm, respectively. Due to this variability, we decided to use only the data common to all, which is the proximal 0 – 400 nm. In the original manuscript, we averaged along the centriole axis, grouping subvolumes into four bins of 100 nm (Figure 2).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s comments, we now have regrouped the subvolumes into smaller bins of 50 nm to get better discrimination along the centriole axis. This also allowed us to generate a new average consisting of all subvolumes in the 400 nm + region (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). This new grouping emphasizes how sharp the transition is from the pinhead to non-pinhead structure; the pinhead is a strong density up to 200 nm, and essentially absent thereafter. This fits nicely with recent data on cartwheel-length determination in the fly embryo (Aydogan et al., 2018).</p><p>The new 400 nm + average is essentially a DMT, but there is still some density for a partial C-tubule. Based on the small number of unique subvolumes in this class (N = 272), and the increase in noise in the average, we do not feel confident stating that the distal centriole is a DMT, as some partial C-tubule density persists within the extreme distal centriole average.</p><p>To better address the question on the nature of the centriole-axoneme transition in a more quantitative way, one would need to collect a larger dataset and average only centrioles of the same length, or collect data of basal bodies that have extended an axoneme. Both of these are experiments would be informative, but are beyond the scope of this current study.</p><p>The cartwheel</p><p>As noted by the reviewers, a structural analysis of the cartwheel would be extremely useful to the field. On this point we are in total agreement with the reviewers, and, as was correctly pointed out, we did not explain our reasoning for excluding it from our analysis.</p><p>We had initially wanted to analyze all components of centriole, including the cartwheel, but the flattening problem prevented that analysis. All CHO centrioles were significantly flattened, even the daughter centriole in Figure 1A.</p><p>In 2 out of 30 <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 centrioles, flattening was undetectable, and it is one of those centrioles that we have used in Figures 5–7. We did try to average the cartwheels from the two non-flattened centrioles, but we were not able to get an informative average, likely due to a combination of factors. The small number of subvolumes available from two centrioles that were each ~150 nm in length was undoubtedly a limiting factor. Furthermore, the orientation of these centrioles parallel to the beam axis, while visually striking, dramatically degrades Z-resolution and results in tomograms that are sub-optimal for averaging structures that are along the Z-axis. In the 28 out of 30 centrioles that are more-optimally arranged for sub-volume averaging, all are flattened, all cartwheels are displaced, and we cannot discern them in the raw data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Perhaps these omissions are due to the &quot;flattening&quot; problem but, if so, this needs to be better explained. Indeed, we felt it might be better to more prominently discuss the &quot;flattening&quot; problem at the start of the Results section, and to more directly describe how this influenced your subsequent analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Centriole flattening was a major issue for our data analysis, and we accept that we did not satisfactorily address it. We have now changed the Results section by introducing the issue much earlier, and explaining why the flattening precluded an analysis of the cartwheel structure.</p><p>It is unclear to us how to overcome the centriole flattening that we observed in both the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 and CHO systems, and it dramatically affects the overall geometry of the centriole. Centrioles that are arranged parallel to the beam axis (proximal-distal axis orthogonal to the ice sheet) are not flattened and visually informative, but are missing information that contributes to the alignment and subsequent average. Based on the tomograms, it was apparent that the ice was still substantially thicker that the length of the centrioles, thus it appears to be a surprisingly long-range effect. We did collect several tomographic tilt series of centrosomes in substantially thicker ice, but we had difficulty aligning the tilt-series at tilts above 30˚. Future studies on centrioles may be better performed using ion milling, where thick samples are thinned using a focused-ion beam, preserving the geometry in a thinner sample or perhaps thick ice in conjunction with a Volta phase plate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would have greatly increased the impact of this work if you had examined the structure of fly centrioles lacking pericentrin/PLP. Your previous work showed that PLP is a key component of the interphase centriole in flies, and very likely a component of the amorphous brush-like structures you highlight in Figure 5A (Mennella et al., 2012 – see also Roque et al., 2018, which should be mentioned). We would have thought this analysis would be relatively straightforward. We would not insist on this but, if you really can't get this data, it would be helpful to discuss any insights you have as to why this approach may not be as straightforward as one might assume.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewers, PLP is likely a component of the brush-like structures that we observe in the tomograms of S2 centrioles, and this fits with both light-microscopy data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (Mennella et al., 2012) and mutational analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (Roque et al., 2018).</p><p>Previous experiments showed that Plp RNAi leads to the disappearance of γ-tubulin from interphase centrosomes (Mennella et al., 2012). Unlike our mammalian centrosome preps, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 centrosome preps tend to be contaminated with many particles that are a similar size to centrosomes, and more numerous than centrosomes. We overcame this problem by regrowing centrosome microtubules, enabling us to follow microtubules and to distinguish centrosomes from contaminants, which would be difficult with successful Plp RNAi. While this is clearly a very interesting experiment, these practical issues make it well beyond the scope of a revision.</p><p>An alternative strategy of genetically tagging proteins followed by sub-volume averaging has proven informative in defining the localization of axonemal proteins (Nicastro, Kikkawa labs and others). We have recently started a collaboration to use CRISPR to tag endogenous proteins with tags like GFP, with the aim of identifying the location of the tagged protein in the average map after sub-volume averaging. The candidates that we plan to pursue initially are those that are part of the centriole itself, and thus likely to average well and be visible in the centriole averages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comments informing summary review:</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) The basis of averaging strategy, such as nine-fold symmetry and 24nm (3 tubulin dimers) periodicity, which is the fundamental basis of this study, is not clearly indicated. In the case of the axoneme, there are a number of studies (such as Goodenough and Heuser or by Peter Satir in 1980s) which proved 96nm repeat. In the axoneme, some structures such as MIPs follow, not 24nm, but other (16nm, 32nm) periodicity. 9fold symmetry and symmetry breaking (Hoops &amp; Witman; Bui et al., 2012, JCB) have been described in the axoneme field. Are there any evidence that these centrioles follow 24nm periodic and 9fold symmetry? Alternative periodicity cannot be excluded to explain some weak densities. In the tomogram of vertically oriented Drosophila centrioles, it will be possible to discuss 9fold symmetry. Did they mix daughter and mother centrioles?</p></disp-quote><p>We have hopefully satisfactorily addressed most of these points in the ‘Major points’ section above. In addition, we have no evidence from any of our centrioles (including the end-on S2 centriole) for any symmetry other than quasi-9-fold symmetry. We do not argue that the symmetry is definitely 9-fold, but in the absence of any evidence to the contrary we assume that it is 9-fold symmetry for the purposes of regenerating the centriole geometry. Note that no strict symmetry was assumed in any of our averaging – we simply align 24 nm-long segments and average, whatever intrinsic periodicity exists is “discovered” via the unbiased alignment process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Plunge-frozen centrioles used in this study were (except the one oriented vertical in ice) flattened. The authors fit averaged subtomograms from these tomograms but fitted it to another 3D tomogram which retained 9fold in the past work. Based on this fitting they discussed the positions of the A-C and A-A linkers. If these linkers keep linking the same protofilaments, they should be oriented differently in the flattened centrioles and thus should be smeared out by subtomogram averaging. What do the authors think? Do the linkers actually detach from the adjacent triplet (or doublet), retaining the angles of protrusion?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the linkers in the flattened centrioles are not adopting their correct conformation. However, the fact that all centrioles studied here are still part of an ensemble structure indicates that a majority of linkers must still be linking adjacent MTs. At high contour the MT linkers show lower occupancy in the maps than the protofilaments of the microtubules, suggestive of structural flexibility in the MT linkers. It would appear that the linkers are most coherent near where they attach to the A- and C-tubules and then become more disordered farther away.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Classification process is not clear. In the text, they stated that four separate structures were obtained, but only two are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 1C is interesting. Do all the mammalian centrioles, which this reviewer thinks to have variety of the entire length, share the same length of the proximal region? How do they explain significant amount of &quot;red&quot; subtomograms within the white area in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C? Do they appear in all the centrioles analyzed in this work?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more to the Materials and methods section about classification and clarified the main text: “As a first step, unbiased 3D classification (Bharat and Scheres, 2016) suggested two major structural-distinct classes arranged differentially along the centriole length (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). While the classification was somewhat noisy, likely due to a combination of biological and imaging noise, it indicated changes along the proximal-distal axis, in agreement with previously published data (Paintrand et al., 1992)”.</p><p>Major point 2 deals with centriole length, and the invariant length of the proximal region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) Doublet microtubule region of the centriole: The authors extracted the triplet microtubule region of centrioles for subvolume averaging (subsection “Mammalian centriole structure”). However, it is well-known that mature (as these seem to be) mammalian centrioles have a distal region composed of doublet microtubules (Paintrand et al., 1992). Analysis of this region is especially important to understanding the transition between the centriole and ciliary axoneme. The authors do describe differences that appear between the proximal end of the centriole and the region where the C-tubule becomes only a partial tubule, but it would helpful to know whether they averaged the doublet microtubule region proper, to determine whether there may be similarities or differences between the doublet and triplet microtubule regions. If not, this should be clearly stated in the text, in addition to a rationale about why this region was not analyzed. This is potentially very important in understanding whether the mature mammalian centriole could more properly be thought of as a core centriole with an axoneme initial segment on its distal end.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the issues raised here and hope we have addressed them in the major points section, and with the accompanying Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The cartwheel: The authors state that due to the centriole cycle, it is likely that none of the CHO cell centrioles retained their cartwheels. However, only centrioles in G1 lack cartwheels – procentrioles in S-phase, G2, and even early mitosis have cartwheels. In addition, centriole pairs in which the mother and procentriole are orthogonal and close to each other are probably engaged and thus be at a stage prior to removal of the cartwheel after disengagement (Shukla et al., 2015, Nature Communications). Thus, the centriole pair in Figure 1A is likely engaged based on orientation and proximity of the two centrioles. Did the authors analyze the base of this daughter centriole (or procentriole, if still engaged) to determine whether there is a cartwheel present? Were there other orthogonal pairs in their dataset that may have cartwheels in the procentrioles? This would be especially important to understand the nature of centriole engagement, for which no structural correlates are known. If no cartwheel was found in the orthogonal centriole pair(s), the authors should note that there is a possibility that the cartwheels were lost from CHO cell centrioles during isolation and fixation. Drosophila centrioles, in contrast to mammalian centrioles, retain their cartwheel though the cell cycle, so one would expect that all fly centrioles examined have, or had, cartwheels, Consistent with this, the fly centriole shown in Figure 5A has a cartwheel, based on the presence of a central tubule, which is likely the hub of the cartwheel. Was the cartwheel retained in all fly centrioles examined? If not, it would be important to note that the preparation results in loss of some cartwheel structure. This might also allow a determination as to whether it is retention of the cartwheel that better allowed some Drosophila centrioles to retain their structure and overall geometry.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we are in agreement with this and hope we have satisfactorily addressed the concerns. While we wanted to examine the cartwheel in centrioles and compare it with that from basal bodies, the data did not allow us to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Evolution: The authors previously published structural analysis of Chlamydomonas centrioles, which, like mammalian centrioles, have triplet microtubules. To maximize the evolution impact of this work, it would be helpful to know whether the linkages that reinforce 9-fold symmetry are similar between Chlamydomonas and mammalian centrioles, as well as whether any of the non-microtubule densities observed in C.r. are similar to those described here. In addition, the authors note that the density spanning A09 to A10 is conserved between all centriole and axoneme structures – could they state more definitively the degree to which the shape of this structure is similar between species, and thus whether it is consistent with a similar protein (complex) forming this structure?</p></disp-quote><p>While a MIP at the A09/A10 position has also been identified in axonemes (MIP2), we cannot draw direct structural comparisons between it and the A09/A10 MIP in CHO and S2 centrioles. At our resolution our MIP appears to be a dimer of two similarly-sized proteins that bind to each other and to the microtubule lattice across the microtubule seam. High-resolution work from Ichikawa et al. (2017) shows MIP2 binding an analogous location, but our resolution is much too low to allow a more-detailed comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Partial B-tubules: The authors interpret the presence of partial B-tubules that lack protofilaments B03-B06 as evidence that B-tubule assembly in Drosophila occurs from both the inner and outer edges of the A-tubule. However, it is known that during thermal fractionation of axonemes, B-tubule stubs attached to the A-tubule remain, while the rest of the B-tubule is lost (Linck and Langevin, 1981, JCB; Linck et al., 2014). Can the authors rule out the possibility that the partial B-tubule is a degradation product? If not, this interpretation should either be removed or qualified accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>No, we cannot rule out depolymerisation/damage as a cause for the microtubule stubs in the S2 centriole, and so we have included the caveats as suggested by the reviewer (subsection “Biogenesis of the B-tubule”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
