combining mobile service data and fine-granular metadata (such as postal codes and genomic data) to advance integrated genomic surveillance of the pandemic in the federal state of Thuringia, Germany. We sequenced over 6500 SARS-CoV-2 Alpha genomes (B.1.1.7) across 7 months within Thuringia while collecting patients’ isolation dates and postal codes. Our dataset is complemented by over 66,000 publicly available German Alpha genomes and mobile service data for Thuringia. We identified the existence and spread of nine persistent mutation variants within the Alpha lineage, seven of which formed separate phylogenetic clusters with different spreading patterns in Thuringia. The remaining two are subclusters. Mobile service data can indicate these clusters’ spread and highlight a potential sampling bias, especially of low-prevalence variants. Thereby, mobile service data can be used either retrospectively to assess surveillance coverage and efficiency from already collected data or to actively guide part of a surveillance sampling process to districts where these variants are expected to emerge. The latter concept was successfully implemented as a proof-of-concept for a mobility-guided sampling strategy in response to the surveillance of Omicron sublineage BQ.1.1. The combination of mobile service data and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance by genome sequencing is a valuable tool for more targeted and responsive surveillance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nanopore sequencing</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>WGS</kwd><kwd>mobility data</kwd><kwd>cluster tracking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13N15745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pletz</surname><given-names>Mathias W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004403</institution-id><institution>Thüringer Aufbaubank</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021 VF 0035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleischmann-Struzek</surname><given-names>Carolin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>512648189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spott</surname><given-names>Riccardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrating mobile service and fine-granular sample data enhances SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, improving variant tracking, optimizing efficiency, and guiding targeted sampling strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) as a global pandemic due to its rapid spread and high infection rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). The airborne virus has since caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>). In an attempt to control its spread, many countries initiated comprehensive surveillance efforts with molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">COVID-19 Genomics UK, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corona-Surveillanceverordnung, 2022</xref>). Consequently, nearly 15.8 million SARS-CoV-2 sequences have been deposited into the ‘Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data’ database (as of July 21, 2023, GISAID). Many research groups have undertaken studies examining the viral spread by integrating sequencing and epidemiological data to monitor the pandemic and investigate local outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Page et al., 2021</xref>). Most of these local projects are part of national surveillance programs such as the UK’s Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) or ‘national genomic surveillance’ in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">COVID-19 Genomics UK, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lambrou et al., 2021</xref>). In Germany, the ‘Coronavirus-Surveillanceverordnung’ (CorSurV) enacted by the State Ministry of Health on January 19, 2021, mandated that laboratories with sequencing capabilities process SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, offering financial compensation until April 2023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corona-Surveillanceverordnung, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Bioinformatics workflows developed in Germany, such as poreCov (for Oxford Nanopore data) and CoVpipe2 (for Illumina data), reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 consensus genomes from the sequencing data and prepare the results for upload and submission to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lataretu et al., 2024</xref>). As the German government’s public health and biomedical research institute responsible for disease control and prevention, the RKI collected the genomes via the German Electronic Sequence Data Hub (DESH) and integrated them with additional epidemiological information to provide an up-to-date overview of the ongoing viral spread. For keeping track of the rapid SARS-CoV-2 evolution, PANGO (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak) provides a standard naming convention based on unique mutation profiles and further criteria, resulting in the classification of over 3660 lineages (as of August 2023) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rambaut et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">PANGO, 2023</xref>). Additionally, the WHO classified important viral lineages as ‘Variants of Concern’ (VOC), ‘Variants of Interest’ (VOI), or ‘Variants under Monitoring’ (VUM), using Greek designations in the past (e.g. ‘Alpha’ [Pango lineage main designation B.1.1.7] or ‘Omicron’ [Pango lineage main designation B.1.1.529]). Further, the WHO also de-escalated former VOCs to reflect the current SARS-CoV-2 variant landscape better. The first defined VOC (now de-escalated), the Alpha lineage, rapidly replaced almost all previously circulating lineages globally by the end of 2020 until the VOC Delta (main lineage B.1.617.2) replaced it in mid-2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Washington et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Walker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michaelsen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To predict or monitor the rapid viral spread throughout regions, various data types, like travel data, passenger volumes, or passive wastewater monitoring, were examined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alpert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">O’Toole et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, different studies explored mobility data with genomic data to retrace the origin and spatial expanse of Alpha or utilized geolocation data to model the spread in metropolitan areas to recreate case trajectories and the impact of mobility restrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kraemer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2021</xref>). Mobility data was also used in Germany during the pandemic, revealing that lockdowns leave distant parts of the country less connected due to the sharp decline in long-distance travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schlosser et al., 2020</xref>). These studies focused on analyzing residential movement and contact tracing to evaluate and inform health policies but were not applied to active molecular surveillance.</p><p>Here, we investigated whether mobile service data and fine-granular metadata (such as postal codes and genomic data) can help predict the spread of the Alpha lineage or guide the sampling for more targeted genomic surveillance with a focus on the German federal state of Thuringia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Alpha lineage spread rapidly through Thuringia, showing a pattern similar to its nationwide spread</title><p>Thuringia is a rural federal state in central Germany with a population of 2.1 million and no major airports (overview of Thuringia’s population density in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We investigated if the spread of the Alpha lineage of SARS-CoV-2 behaved differently compared to the whole of Germany. To understand its spread, we used 289,487 public SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Germany (excluding Thuringia; including 137,024 Alpha genomes) and 7394 genomes from our own sequencing data for Thuringia (including 6307 Alpha genomes) to track Alpha’s occurrence from December 2020 to August 2021 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>; for details, see Methods section ‘Alpha spread datasets’).

Although sequencing was initially low, it gradually increased in the following month. However, the Corona-Surveillance regulation was passed at the end of January 2021, leading to a rapid increase in sampling and sequencing by February since sequencing costs could be reimbursed. Even though Thuringia sequenced a similar amount of SARS-CoV-2 samples compared to other German states (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the proportion of the Alpha variant to other lineages was relatively low. However, the proportion of Alpha increased heavily in February.</p><p>By March, Alpha had spread to nearly all states and districts (districts are similar to counties or provinces) in Germany (median: 76.47% Alpha samples among a federal states total sequenced samples compared to 36.03% in February, excluding Thuringia) and Thuringia (median: 85.29 %, up from 50.00% in February). So, there was no noticeable difference in the Alpha proportions between Germany and Thuringia after February. During the summer of June and July 2021, sequencing declined in Germany (including Thuringia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) due to the decrease in overall daily cases, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meintrup et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oh et al., 2022</xref>.</p><p>In summary, the spread of the Alpha lineage in Thuringia lagged roughly 2 weeks behind the general spread of other German federal states but showed similar proportions. This suggests that Thuringia experienced a delay in the initial arrival of Alpha. However, we did not observe any difference in the overall spread afterward. Thuringia was among the first states to adopt new containment measures, including contact limitations, closure of retail shops, and prohibition of tourist journeys (December 14, 2020). Jena, a city in Thuringia, was also the first German city to implement mandatory public masking in March 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pletz et al., 2023</xref>). Contacts were further restricted on January 9th, and people were urged to restrict their movement radius to 15 km, which might explain the delay besides the absence of major airports nearby.</p><p>All Thuringian genomes were evenly distributed between other German samples in the phylogenetic time tree (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, due to its rapid spread from February onward, it is difficult to accurately track how the Alpha lineage specifically expanded (point of entries, exact origins, etc.). Consequently, we investigated whether ‘sublineages’ might be identifiable and trackable to address this.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Monitoring of Alpha subclusters in Thuringia reveals temporally and regionally restricted distribution patterns</title><p>To identify possible clusters among the Alpha lineage spreading in Thuringia, we called each Alpha genome’s mutations via Nextclade by analyzing them using poreCov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aksamentov et al., 2021</xref>).

Subclusters 6.1 and 7.1 subsequently emerged from the same districts as their parent clusters (6 and 7) after 12 and 13 days, respectively. The subclusters mainly spread regionally confined and not across all of Thuringia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) but were also identified in other states of Germany (see ‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://microreact.org/">https://microreact.org/</ext-link>’-project). For example, the ‘S:S939F’ subcluster spread across 15 states, with the first samples being isolated outside of Thuringia. The eight Spike-mutation subclusters had expanded between 4 and 12 of the 23 Thuringian districts within the observable time period of each subcluster. They expanded by one to six districts per month, with a greater expansion accompanied mainly by a larger increase in the subcluster sample number. In contrast, the ORF1b-variant even comprised 21 districts and expanded between 2 and 7 districts per month (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Most of each subcluster’s samples were identified in their region of first occurrence, and no additional samples were found after the given periods.</p><p>Several limitations need to be considered. The identified subclusters may have multiple origins or may not originate from Thuringia. Due to the lack of precise zip codes (publicly available German genomes are limited to postal codes of sending and sequencing laboratories), monitoring the subclusters in other states on a district level was impossible. Nevertheless, we could follow how the subclusters developed in Thuringia, even if multiple origins may have affected the overall speed or length of each subcluster’s occurrence.</p><p>Our surveillance sampling heavily relies on various institutions and partners, and only a portion of the provided samples can be sequenced (see ‘Sampling’ in Methods). For example, the spread of subcluster ‘S:S939F’ revealed two districts in April where no respective samples were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) despite being surrounded by districts with ‘S:S939F’-samples present. This could be due to the lack of samples sent to sequencing from those regions or the low prevalence. We, therefore, investigated if mobile service data of residents, in addition to molecular surveillance, might be utilized to counteract this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mobile service data indicates Alpha subcluster spread and sampling bias</title><p>With the aim to predict the subcluster spread and, thereby, reduce surveillance-based sampling bias, we utilized anonymized mobile service data from T-Systems International GmbH. Around 200 million trips were used to determine the number of daily trips between the Thuringian districts. We then combined this information with our fine-granular genomic data to specify each district’s monthly proportion of inbound mobility from subcluster-affiliated districts (see Methods ‘Mobile service data’). The results are visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> (complete overview in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; data provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>The mobile service data-based assumption of a subcluster’s spread aligned well with the subsequent regional coverage of fast-spreading, highly prevalent subclusters, such as subcluster 7, which covered 811 samples (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, the assumed spread for the low-prevalence subclusters did not correspond well with the actual occurrence. Yet, adding mobile service data resulted in three different ‘types’ of districts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, annotated districts). Type 1 included districts with high inbound mobility from areas with an identified variant, where the variant was eventually found afterward, while Type 2 included districts with high inbound mobility from areas with an identified variant, where the variant was never identified. Type 3 included districts not directly connected to a district with an identified variant, but a variant was eventually identified while they border Type 2 district(s).</p><p>Our previous analysis of the subclusters’ spreading pattern across the districts, based solely on identified variants, indicated putative missed identifications in some districts due to the seemingly illogical spread to districts without a connection to others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, subcluster ‘S:S939F’). The inclusion of mobile service data revealed some of these districts to be Type 2 districts. This suggests that the specific variant should be identifiable within these districts due to the observed high incoming mobility from districts with identified variants. Type 2 districts were mainly observed for subclusters with low prevalence and, consequently, low sample counts, which are usually more difficult to monitor. For example, we assumed missing identifications in some districts of subclusters 1, 2, and 3, which, through the mobile service data, are now partially identified as Type 2 districts. However, due to their low prevalence, it is also possible that these subclusters have not spread to the indicated districts. Despite analyzing the mobile service data of districts from other federal states than Thuringia, we could not apply them, as the lack of precise location data for samples outside of Thuringia prevented the correct calculation of the incoming mobility. Based on the nine observable clusters, we concluded that mobile service data is a good prediction marker for the spread of high-prevalence variants but, more importantly, a good indication of districts that should have an identified low-prevalence variant. Next, we investigated if mobile service data can improve active surveillance via guiding sample collection for genomic sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Proof of principle: mobile service data-guided sampling for genomic surveillance for Omicron BQ.1.1</title><p>Based on our previous findings, we implemented the ‘mobility-guided’ sampling approach under real pandemic circumstances over 1 month in addition to our active surveillance.</p><p>As the subject of investigation, we searched for a newly emerging (based on global news reports) and ideally low prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Thuringia.</p><p>Among the various emerging Omicron sublineages during that time, sublineage BQ.1.1 fulfilled the defined criteria. First isolated in a northwestern Thuringian community with around 20,000 inhabitants on October 5, 2022, we identified this particular sublineage on October 14, 2022, among a routine batch of 42 samples. BQ.1.1 was a low-prevalence sublineage that was identified worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://outbreak.info/situation-reports?pango=BQ.1.1">https://outbreak.info/situation-reports?pango=BQ.1.1</ext-link>).</p><p>Following its first Thuringian identification, we utilized the latest available dataset of the past 2 years of mobile service data (October 2020 and June 2021) to investigate the residential movements for the community of first detection.

As a result, we specifically requested all the available samples from the eight communities with the highest incoming mobility. Still, we were restricted to the submission of third parties over whom we had no influence. This led to the inclusion of the following eight communities with the most residential movement from the originating community: four in central and three in NW of Thuringia, one in NW-neighboring state Saxony-Anhalt. The samples requested from central Thuringia were also due to their geographical arrangement as a ‘belt’ in central Thuringia, linking three major cities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Subsequently, we collected 19 additional samples (isolated between October 17 and October 25, 2022; see ‘Guided Sampling’ for October 2022, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) besides the randomized sampling strategy.

Randomized sampling was not influenced or adjusted based on the mobility-guided sample collection.

Our randomly sampled routine surveillance strategy did not detect another sample during the same period. This was despite a seven times higher overall sample rate, which included 31 samples from communities with an identified incoming mobility from the community of the first occurrence (October 2022, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Only in the 1-month follow-up were four other samples identified across Thuringia through routine surveillance (November 2022, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><p>During our attempt to implement the mobility-guided sampling approach in real-time during the pandemic, we encountered three distinct limitations, some of which are commonly observed in surveillance practices. The guided sampling depended on the individual sample submitting institutions, affecting the availability of suitable samples, especially for the communities of interest. By choosing a newly emerging Omicron sublineage for our experiment, spread and, therefore, suitability were uncertain. In our case, BQ.1.1’s prevalence in Thuringia was even lower than expected, and it also remained rare in subsequent months, with only 42 samples found until June 2023, 8 months after the first occurrence in Thuringia. Due to the short preparation time, only mobile service data from the past 2 years and no current data were available. Nevertheless, the available datasets still reflect pandemic movement behavior since the pandemic has been ongoing for 2 years.</p><p>In summary, increasing the sampling depth in the suspected regions successfully identified the specified lineage using only a fraction of the samples from the randomized sampling. Conversely, randomized surveillance, the ‘gold standard’ acting as our negative control, did not identify additional samples with similar sampling depths in regions with no or low incoming mobility or even in high mobility regions with less sampling depth. Implementing such an approach effectively under pandemic conditions poses difficult challenges due to the fluctuating sampling sizes. Although the finding of the sample may have been coincidental, our proof-of-concept demonstrated how we can leverage the potential of mobile service data for targeted surveillance sampling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, diverse data sources like travel, wastewater, and mobility data have been employed in surveillance and transmission tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alpert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">O’Toole et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kraemer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schlosser et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, we analyzed over 296,800 German SARS-CoV-2 genomes to examine whether mobile service data can predict the spatial distribution of the Alpha lineage in the German state of Thuringia and how they potentially benefit pandemic surveillance.</p><p>A plausible explanation for the delayed spread of the Alpha lineage in Thuringia is the lack of major transport hubs, as Alpha first occurred in federal states with such hubs. Previous studies have already highlighted the impact of major transportation hubs in the spread of Sars-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alpert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tegally et al., 2023</xref>). However, its impact on the total distribution is limited, and the spread was ultimately comparable between Germany and Thuringia. While our findings on mobile service data may also apply to Germany, we could not verify this because the limited location data of publicly available German genomes prevented in-depth investigations outside of Thuringia. Thus, precise sampling location data are crucial to utilize mobile service data in genomic surveillance, but privacy regulations may restrict access to this data. Shortly after Alpha’s emergence, mutation variants formed like the known sublineages Q.1 to Q.8 and the Thuringian subclusters identified by us. This reflects the ongoing evolution during active circulation and indicates an even greater sublineage diversity, which has not been surveyed as closely as in the subsequent Delta and Omicron waves. By monitoring the nine Thuringian subclusters, rather than focusing solely on the parental lineage B.1.1.7, we were again able to effectively track transmissions and gain a comprehensive understanding of the regional spread. So, it underscores the importance of sequencing in pandemic surveillance to explore such genomic changes and, thereby, keep track of the transmission chains and potential outbreaks.</p><p>Mobile service data can support such surveillance in different ways. Previous studies examined the capabilities of mobility data in the context of, e.g., case trajectories, but retrospectively applied to already collected data, it can be used to examine surveillance sampling coverage and possible sampling bias. We exemplified this approach with the Alpha lineage, where mobile service data indicated a putative sampling bias and partially predicted the spread of our Thuringian subclusters.</p><p>Another approach is actively guiding the sampling process through mobile service data, which we demonstrated with our proof of principle focusing on the Omicron-lineage BQ.1.1 as a real-life example. This approach could allow for a flexible allocation of surveillance resources, enabling adaptation to specific circumstances and increasing sampling depth in regions where a variant is anticipated. By incorporating guided sampling, much fewer resources may be needed for unguided or random sampling, thereby reducing overall surveillance costs.</p><p>Additionally, while this approach is particularly useful for identifying low-prevalence variants, it is not limited to such variants. Still, it can provide a guided, more cost-efficient, low-sampling alternative to general randomized surveillance that can also be applied to other viruses or lineages. For this purpose, pre-generated mobility networks automatically tailored to each state’s unique infrastructure and population dynamics could provide better-targeted sampling guidance rather than simple geographical proximity. However, the feasibility depends on the availability and cost of such mobile service data. Alternatively, financial resources could also be invested directly in increasing sampling capacity and coverage, which ultimately depends on individual factors of the respective surveillance. Mobile service data can also be used with other surveillance approaches and elements. For example, wastewater surveillance can give further indications to supplement guided sampling.

Each cell is assigned to exactly one transmitter mast, with a spatial resolution from 500 m × 500 m up to 8 km × 8 km (depending on the transmitter mast network density). Cell phones always register to the closest traffic cell, which is recorded and stored in an origin-destination matrix (ODM). For population representation, the data was extrapolated with Deutsche Telekom’s market share. Due to data privacy, the registration data is combined into movement streams between traffic cells, the status resolution is reduced to 1 hr (greater time intervals = less resolution), and individual traffic cells are grouped into districts. The degree of anonymization (k-value=30, data privacy regulation) removed movement streams with less than 30 participants, resulting in approximately 200 Mio trips in the ODM. SMA Development GmbH analyzed all movements between the single Thuringian districts, adding each Alpha sample’s isolation time and location data (per subcluster). The movements were further divided by months and originating district (subcluster-affiliated vs. -unaffiliated), determining each district’s monthly inbound mobility proportion from cluster-affiliated districts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Research in context</title><sec id="s3-6-1"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p>We searched PubMed for studies about the use of mobile service data for surveillance written in English.

Our search yielded 1285 publications published between 1966 and 2023. We manually screened all these publications but found no study that applied mobile service data for active, targeted surveillance. Across all studies, the general focus was on tracking contacts or analyzing movements to assess, for instance, the efficiency of non-pharmaceutical interventions or generate prediction models. Some studies suggested targeted surveillance based on their results, but it was not yet applied. Additionally, we used ‘suite.ai’ and ‘chatGPT’ (with BING-search access) to let them search for ‘studies that utilize mobile service data to guide the sampling process for infectious disease surveillance’. While ‘suite.ai’ found two studies and ‘chatGPT’ found another ten studies and reviews, none covered the direct application of the mobility data in active surveillance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-2"><title>Added value of this study</title><p>This study highlights the value of combining mobile service data with fine-granular metadata for integrated genomic surveillance during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a German federal state.

They further prospectively identified districts with strong mobility links to the first district in which BQ.1.1 was observed to direct additional surveillance efforts to these districts. The additional surveillance effort resulted in the earlier identification of BQ.1.1 in districts with strong links to the district in which BQ.1.1 was first observed.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>There are two important strengths of this work. The first, is the scale and detail in the data that has been generated an analyzed as part of this study. Specifically, the authors use 6,500 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and district level mobility data within Thuringia. I applaud the authors for making a subset of their analyses public e.g. on the associated micro react page.</p><p>Further, the main focus of the article is on the potential utility of mobility-directed surveillance sequence. While I may certainly be mistaken, I have not seen this proposed elsewhere, at least in the context of SARS-CoV-2. The authors were further able to test this concept in a real world setting during the emergence of BQ.1.1 and compare it to the &quot;gold standard&quot; of random sampling. This is a unique real-world evaluation of a novel surveillance sequencing strategy and there is considerable value in publishing this analysis. Given the increased focus on optimizing sampling strategies for genomic surveillance, this work provides a novel strategy and will hopefully motivate additional modeling and real-world implementations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The article is quite strong and I find the analyses to generally be rigorous. Limitations of the analysis, particularly due to the fact that BQ.1.1 remained a low-prevalence variant, are adequately addressed. The results do not provide quantitative, definitive proof that mobility-guided sampling is an optimal strategy, but they also do not claim to nor do I think they need to to make an important contribution to the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94045.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In the manuscript, the authors combine SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from a state in Germany and mobility data to help in understanding the movement of virus and the potential to help decide where to focus sequencing.

Upon carefully reading through the comments, we noticed that, based on the Reviewer's questions, some of our answers were already available but “hidden” as supplementary data. Thus, we changed the following two figures and text accordingly to showcase our results to the reader better:</p><p>A) To highlight how mobile service data can indicate the spread of highly prevalent variants, we added a high-prevalence subcluster to Figure 2 (previously shown in Supplementary Figures S4 and S5) and, in exchange, moved one low-prevalence subcluster from Figure 2 back into the supplement. The figure is now showing a low and a high prevalent subcluster instead of two low prevalent subclusters.</p><p>B) Based on Reviewer 1’s question about where samples were taken in regards to the mobility data from the community of the first identification (negative controls), we now highlight all the mobility data that was available to us in Figure 3 (as triangles) instead of just a few top mobility hits for both - mobility guided and random surveillance (serving as a negative control for the former). This way, we think, it is clearer how random sampling was also performed in some regions where mobility was coming from the community of origin (as asked by Reviewer 1) - the detailed trips and sampling are now part of the supplement for data transparency reasons. We also noticed a typo in the GPS coordinates, aligning one of the arrows falsely, which is corrected in the improved Figure 3.</p><p>We have also included the R-Scripts used to generate all the figures in the manuscript in an OSF repository (we updated the “Data sharing statement”). We also updated Figure 1 slightly and extended the supplemental material. The remaining comments to reviewers are addressed point-by-point below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In &quot;1 Exploring the Spatial Distribution of Persistent SARS-CoV-2 Mutations -Leveraging mobility data for targeted sampling&quot; Spott et al. combine SARS-CoV-2 genomic data alongside granular mobility data to retrospectively evaluate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 alpha lineages throughout Germany and specifically Thuringia.

As such, you can only conclude that increasing sampling depth increased the rate of detection for BQ.1.1., not necessarily that doing so in a mobility-guided fashion provided an additional benefit. I absolutely understand the challenges of doing this in a real-world setting and think that the work remains valuable even with this limitation, but I would like the lack of control districts to be more explicitly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the critical assessment of our work. We agree that a control is essential for interpreting the results. In our case, randomized surveillance (“the gold standard”) served as a control with a total sampling depth seven times higher than the mobility-guided sampling. To better reflect the sampling in regards to the available mobility data, we revisited Figure 3 and added all the mobility information from the origin that was available to us. We also added this information to the random surveillance to provide a clearer picture to the reader. This now clearly shows how randomized surveillance covered communities with varying degrees of incoming mobility from the community of first occurrences, thereby underlining its role as a negative control. We updated the manuscript to reflect these changes and included the October 2020 and June 2021 mobility datasets in Supplementary Table S6. We agree that the sampling depth increases the detection, which is the point of guided sampling to increase sampling, specifically in areas where mobility points towards a possible spread. In regards to the negative control: Random surveillance (not Mobility-guided) in October covered 40 samples in the northwest region of Thuringia (Mobility-guided covered 19 samples). Thus, random surveillance also contained 31 out of 132 samples with a mobility link towards the first occurrence of BQ1.1 but with varying amounts of mobility (low to high).</p><p>We added this information to the main text:</p><p>Line 270 to 293:</p><p>Following its first Thuringian identification, we utilized the latest available dataset of the past two years of mobile service data (October 2020 and June 2021) to investigate the residential movements for the community of first detection. Considering the highest incoming mobility from both datasets, we identified 18 communities with high (&gt; 10,000), 34 with medium (2,001-10,000), and 82 with low (30-2,000) number of incoming one-way trips from the originating community (purple triangles in Figure 3a). As a result, we specifically requested all the available samples from the eight communities with the highest incoming mobility. Still, we were restricted to the submission of third parties over whom we had no influence. This led to the inclusion of the following eight communities with the most residential movement from the originating community: four in central and three in NW of Thuringia, one in NW-neighboring state Saxony-Anhalt. The samples requested from central Thuringia were also due to their geographic arrangement as a “belt” in central Thuringia, linking three major cities (see Supplementary Figure S1). Subsequently, we collected 19 additional samples (isolated between the 17th and 25th of October 2022; see “Guided Sampling” for October 2022, Figure 3a) besides the randomized sampling strategy. Thus, the sampling depth was increased in communities with high incoming mobility from the first origin.</p><p>As part of the general Thuringian surveillance, we collected 132 samples for October (covering dates between the 5th and 31st) and 69 samples in November (covering dates between the 1st and 25th; see Figure 3b and c). Randomized sampling was not influenced or adjusted based on the mobility-guided sample collection. Thus, it also contains samples from communities with a mobility link towards the first occurrence of BQ.1.1, as they were part of the regular random collection (see gray triangles in Figure 3b). A complete overview of all samples is provided in Supplementary Table S5. The mobility datasets from October 2020 and June 2021 for all sampled communities are provided in Supplementary Table S6.</p><p>Line 305 to 313:</p><p>Among the 19 samples specifically collected based on mobile service data, we identified one additional sample of the specific Omicron sublineage BQ.1.1 in a community with high incoming mobility (n = 14, number of trips = 37,499) with a distance of approximately 16 km between both towns. Our randomly sampled routine surveillance strategy did not detect another sample during the same period. This was despite a seven times higher overall sample rate, which included 31 samples from communities with an identified incoming mobility from the community of the first occurrence (October 2022, Figure 3b). Only in the one-month follow-up were four other samples identified across Thuringia through routine surveillance (November 2022, Figure 3c).</p><p>Line 325 to 333:</p><p>In summary, increasing the sampling depth in the suspected regions successfully identified the specified lineage using only a fraction of the samples from the randomized sampling. Conversely, randomized surveillance, the “gold standard” acting as our negative control, did not identify additional samples with similar sampling depths in regions with no or low incoming mobility or even in high mobility regions with less sampling depth. Implementing such an approach effectively under pandemic conditions poses difficult challenges due to the fluctuating sampling sizes. Although the finding of the sample may have been coincidental, our proof of concept demonstrated how we can leverage the potential of mobile service data for targeted surveillance sampling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 313: While this work has reliably shown that the spread of Alpha was slower in Thuringia, I don't think there have been sufficient analyses to conclude that this is due to the lack of transportation hubs. My understanding is that only mobility within Thuringia has been evaluated here and not between Thuringia and other parts of Germany.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We noticed that the original sentence lacked the necessary clarity. The statement in line 313 was based on the observation that Alpha first occurred in federal states with major transport hubs, such as international airports and ports, which Thuringia lacks, as demonstrated in the Microreact dataset. For clarification, we adjusted the sentence as follows:</p><p>Line 340 and following:</p><p>A plausible explanation for the delayed spread of the Alpha lineage in Thuringia is the lack of major transport hubs, as Alpha first occurred in federal states with such hubs. Previous studies have already highlighted the impact of major transportation hubs in the spread of Sars-CoV-2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 333 (and elsewhere): I'm not convinced, based on the results presented in Figure 2, that the authors have reliably identified a sampling bias here. This is only true if you assume (as in line 235) that the variant was in these districts, but that hasn't actually been demonstrated here. While I recognize that for high-prevalence variants, there is a strong correlation between inflow and variant prevalence, low-prevalence variants by definition spread less and may genuinely be missing from some districts. To support this conclusion that they identified a bias, I'd like to see some type of statistical model that is based e.g. on the number of sequences, prevalence of a given variant in other districts, etc. Alternatively, the language can be softened (&quot;putative sampling bias&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for addressing this legitimate point of criticism in our interpretation. Due to the retrospective nature of the analysis and the fact that we found no additional samples of the clusters after the specified timeframes, we were limited to the samples in our dataset. Therefore, it is impossible to demonstrate if a variant was present in the relevant districts afterward. We agree that the variant’s low prevalence means they may genuinely not have spread to some districts. For clarification, we added the following statements and changed the wording accordingly:</p><p>Additional statement in line 248:</p><p>However, due to their low prevalence, it is also possible that these subclusters have not spread to the indicated districts.</p><p>Adjusted wording in line 361:</p><p>We exemplified this approach with the Alpha lineage, where mobile service data indicated a putative sampling bias and partially predicted the spread of our Thuringian subclusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations:</bold></p><p>(1) I applaud the use of the microreact page to make the data public, however, I don't see any reference to a GitHub or Zenodo repository with the analysis code. The NextStrain code is certainly appreciated but there is presumably additional code used to identify the clusters, generate figures, etc. I generally prefer this code be made public and it is recommended by eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your appreciation. We have now included the R-scripts in the manuscript’s OSF repository. These were used to create the figures in the manuscript and supplement utilizing the supplementary tables 1-6, which are also stored in the repository. To clearly communicate which data is provided, we changed lines 513 and 514 of the “Data sharing statement” as follows:</p><p>Line 513 and following:</p><p>Supplementary tables and the R-scripts used to generate all figures are also provided in the repository under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/n5qj6/">https://osf.io/n5qj6/</ext-link>. These include the mobile service data used in this study, which is available in processed and anonymized form.</p><p>The subcluster identification was performed manually. By adding each sample's mutation profile to the Microreact metadata file, we visually screened the phylogenetic time tree for all non-Alpha specific mutations present in at least 20 Thuringian genomes. We then applied the criteria described in the Methods section to identify the nine Alpha subclusters. For clarification, we changed line 436:</p><p>Line 436:</p><p>We then manually screened for mutations present in at least 20 genomes with a small phylogenetic distance and a time occurrence of at least two months.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In the manuscript, the authors combine SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from a state in Germany and mobility data to help in understanding the movement of the virus and the potential to help decide where to focus sequencing. The global expansion in sequencing capability is a key outcome of the public health response. However, there remains uncertainty about how to maximise the insights the sequence data can give. Improved ability to predict the movement of emergent variants would be a useful public health outcome. Also knowing where to focus sequencing to maximising insights is also key. The presented case study from one State in Germany is therefore a useful addition to the literature. Nevertheless, I have a few comments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for taking the time to review our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) One of the key goals of the paper is to explore whether mobile phone data can help predict the spread of lineages. However, it appears unclear whether this was actually addressed in the analyses. To do this, the authors could hold out data from a period of time, and see whether they can predict where the variants end up being found.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on your feedback, we noticed that the results of the other seven clusters presented in the supplement were not appropriately highlighted, causing them to be overlooked. We indeed demonstrated that predicting viral spread based on mobility data is possible, as shown for the high-prevalence subcluster 7 (Cluster “ORF1b:A520V”, 811 samples). This was briefly mentioned in lines 240-242, but the cluster was only shown in Supplementary Figures S4 and S5. Instead, we focused more on the putative sampling bias that the mobility for low-prevalence subclusters could indicate as an interesting use case of mobility data. This addresses a concrete problem of every surveillance: successfully identifying low-prevalence targets. However, based on your feedback, we revisited Figure 2, adding the plots of the high-prevalence subcluster: “ORF1b:A520V” from Supplementary Figures S4 and S5 while moving the low-prevalence subcluster “S:N185D” from Figure 2 into the Supplementary Figures S4 and S5. Additionally, we changed line 229 to highlight this result properly.</p><p>line 229 and following:</p><p>The mobile service data-based prediction of a subcluster’s spread aligned well with the subsequent regional coverage of fast-spreading, highly prevalent subclusters, such as subcluster 7, which covered 811 samples (see Figure 2). In contrast, the predicted spread for the low-prevalence subclusters did not correspond well with the actual occurrence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The abstract presents the mobility-guided sampling as a success, however, the results provide a much more mixed result. Ultimately, it's unclear what having this strategy really achieved. In a quickly moving pandemic, it is unclear what hunting for extra sequences of a specific, already identified, variant really does. I'm not sure what public health action would result, especially given the variant has already been identified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your critical assessment of the presented results and their interpretation.</p><p>Here, we aimed to provide an alternative to the standard randomized surveillance strategy. Through mobility-guided sampling, we sought to increase identification chances while necessitating fewer samples and decreasing costs, ultimately enhancing surveillance efficiency. The Omicron-lineage BQ.1.1 was the perfect example to prove this concept under actual pandemic conditions. Yet, the strategy is not limited to low-prevalence sublineages but can be applied to virtually any surveillance case. However, from your question, we recognize that this conclusion was unclear from the text. Therefore, we adapted the conclusion to better communicate the real implications of our proof of concept. Additionally, we altered line 42 in the abstract for clarification.</p><p>However, we did not assess the benefits of surveillance itself, as the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI) already had outlined its importance for tracking different viral variants. This tracking served several reasons, like monitoring vaccine escapism, mutational progress, and assessing available antibodies for treatment.</p><p>Line 42:</p><p>The latter concept was successfully implemented as a proof-of-concept for a mobility-guided sampling strategy in response to the surveillance of Omicron sublineage BQ.1.1.</p><p>Line 364 to 374:</p><p>Another approach is actively guiding the sampling process through mobile service data, which we demonstrated with our proof of principle focusing on the Omicron-lineage BQ.1.1 as a real-life example. This approach could allow for a flexible allocation of surveillance resources, enabling adaptation to specific circumstances and increasing sampling depth in regions where a variant is anticipated. By incorporating guided sampling, much fewer resources may be needed for unguided or random sampling, thereby reducing overall surveillance costs.</p><p>Additionally, while this approach is particularly useful for identifying low-prevalence variants, it is not limited to such variants. Still, it can provide a guided, more cost-efficient, low-sampling alternative to general randomized surveillance that can also be applied to other viruses or lineages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Relatedly, it is unclear to me whether simply relying on spatial distance would not be an alternative simpler approach than mobile phone data. From Figure 2, it seems clear that a simple proximity matrix would work well at reconstructing viral flow. The authors could compare the correlation of spatial, spatial proximity, and CDR data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. While proximity data might appear to be an obvious choice, it has significant limitations compared to mobility data, especially in the context of our study. Proximity data assumes that spatial distance alone can accurately represent movement patterns, which would only be true in a normally distributed traffic network. Geographic features such as mountains, cities, and highways affect traffic flows, leading to variability over distance and time, which are beyond the scope of spatial proximity but efficiently captured by mobility data. In Figure 2, we presented a simplified view of the mobility data. Hence, proximity and mobility data appear to provide the same insights. However, as shown in the updated Figure 3, a detailed overview of the available mobility data reveals obvious and non-obvious spatial connections that proximity data can not capture. Incorporating such a level of detail in Figure 2 would have cluttered the figure and reduced its clarity (e.g., adding triangles for each Thuringian community).</p><p>While a comparison between proximity data and mobility data would indeed be informative, it is beyond the scope of our current study, as our primary focus was to examine the useability of mobility data in explaining our subcluster’s spread in the first place. However, we agree it would be a valuable direction for future research. We summarized our thoughts from above in the following additional sentence:</p><p>Line 374:</p><p>Pre-generated mobility networks automatically tailored to each state's unique infrastructure and population dynamics could provide better-targeted sampling guidance rather than simple geographical proximity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations:</bold></p><p>(1) Line 128: What do these percentages mean - the proportion of States with at least one Alpha variant? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the values at their first appearance in the text:</p><p>Line 127:</p><p>By March, Alpha had spread to nearly all states and districts (districts are similar to counties or provinces) in Germany (Median: 76·47 % Alpha samples among a federal states total sequenced samples compared to 36·03 % in February, excluding Thuringia) and Thuringia (Median: 85·29 %, up from 50·00 % in February).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 134: It's a little strange to compare the dynamics of a state with that of the whole country.

The statement refers to the comparison of Alpha-lineage proportions across federal states, excluding Thuringia, in lines 118 to 130. To simplify, we collectively referred to these federal states as “Germany” in the text. However, we recognize that this formulation is misleading, so we adjusted line 135 for clarification:</p><p>Line 135:</p><p>In summary, the spread of the Alpha lineage in Thuringia lagged roughly two weeks behind the general spread of other German federal states but showed similar proportions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
