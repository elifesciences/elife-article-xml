trajectories and genetic architectures underlying ecological divergence with gene flow are poorly understood. Sympatric timing types of the intertidal insect <italic>Clunio marinus</italic> (Diptera) from Roscoff (France) differ in lunar reproductive timing. One type reproduces at full moon, the other at new moon, controlled by a circalunar clock of yet unknown molecular nature. Lunar reproductive timing is a magic trait for a sympatric speciation process, as it is both ecologically relevant and entails assortative mating. Here, we show that the difference in reproductive timing is controlled by at least four quantitative trait loci (QTL) on three different chromosomes. They are partly associated with complex inversions, but differentiation of the inversion haplotypes cannot explain the different phenotypes. The most differentiated locus in the entire genome, with QTL support, is the <italic>period</italic> locus, implying that this gene could not only be involved in circadian timing but also in lunar timing. Our data indicate that magic traits can be based on an oligogenic architecture and can be maintained by selection on several unlinked loci.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Clunio marinus</kwd><kwd>ecological speciation</kwd><kwd>magic trait</kwd><kwd>sympatric speciation</kwd><kwd>circalunar clock</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>802923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaiser</surname><given-names>Tobias S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaiser</surname><given-names>Tobias S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the marine midge <italic>Clunio marinus</italic>, sympatric ecological population divergence with gene flow is based on at least four genetic loci, which partially overlap with large chromosomal inversions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolutionary biology has seen a long debate on whether speciation can only happen with geographic isolation (<italic>allopatry</italic>) or also with full range overlap (<italic>sympatry</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayr, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Via, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foote, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coyne and Orr, 2004</xref>. Today, allopatric and sympatric speciation are viewed as the two extremes on a multifaceted continuum of speciation with gene flow, for which there is growing evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foote, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richards et al., 2019</xref>. Speciation with gene flow is generally assumed to start with divergent ecological selection, but for speciation to complete, additional components of reproductive isolation must come into play <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smadja and Butlin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seehausen et al., 2014</xref>. Traits underlying ecological divergence and other components of reproductive isolation must be genetically coupled, as otherwise they cannot withstand the homogenizing effects of gene flow and recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smadja and Butlin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Felsenstein, 1981</xref>. Such coupling can be achieved via pleiotropy, magic traits, or genetic linkage between respective genes. Pleiotropy describes the situation where ‘one allele affects two or more traits’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2007</xref> contributing to reproductive isolation. Here, the coupling can be achieved via a single genetic locus. A ‘magic trait’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gavrilets, 2004</xref> in turn is a single trait which affects several components of reproductive isolation at the same time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smadja and Butlin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Servedio et al., 2011</xref>. It is therefore also referred to as a ‘multiple-effect trait’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smadja and Butlin, 2011</xref>. The concept does per se not include an assumption on the genetic basis of the trait, and should therefore not be equated with pleiotropy. Classically, magic traits are thought to affect ecological divergence and assortative mating at the same time. Of particular interest to our study is the scenario where divergent ecological adaptations lead to differences in reproductive timing, that is <italic>allochrony</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor and Friesen, 2017</xref> or <italic>isolation by time</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hendry and Day, 2005</xref>. One such example is found in the apple maggot <italic>Rhagoletis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Filchak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doellman et al., 2018</xref>. Finally, genetic linkage imposed by genomic regions of low or suppressed recombination, such as chromosomal inversions, can entail a coupling of ecological and reproductive traits even if they are controlled by different sets of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butlin, 2005</xref>. As an example, a chromosomal inversion in the monkey flower <italic>Mimulus guttatus</italic> was found to contribute to ecological adaptation and reproductive isolation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lowry and Willis, 2010</xref>. Other examples of inversions associated with ecologically relevant traits are found in <italic>Littorina</italic> snails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faria et al., 2019</xref> and <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterflies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joron et al., 2011</xref>. In this study, we assessed if magic traits or genetic linkage play a role in sympatric population divergence in the marine midge <italic>Clunio marinus</italic> (Diptera: Chironomidae).</p><p><italic>C. marinus</italic> is found in the intertidal zone of the European Atlantic coast. Larvae live at the lower levels of the intertidal, which are almost permanently submerged. For successful reproduction, the adults need these regions to be exposed by the low tide. The lowest tides predictably recur just after new moon and full moon. Therefore, <italic>C. marinus</italic> adults emerge only during full moon or new moon low tides, reproduce immediately and die a few hours later in the rising tide. This life cycle adaptation is based on a circalunar clock, that is an endogenous time-keeping mechanism which synchronizes development and maturation with lunar phase. Circalunar clocks are common in marine organisms, but their molecular basis is still unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaiser and Neumann, 2021</xref>. Additionally, a circadian clock ensures that <italic>C. marinus</italic> adults only emerge during the low tide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neumann, 1967</xref>. As the pattern and amplitude of the tides differ dramatically along the coastline, <italic>C. marinus</italic> populations from different geographic sites show various genetic adaptations in circadian and circalunar timing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neumann, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaiser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>.</p><p>Notably, low tide water levels follow a bimodal distribution across a lunar month, with minima at both full moon and new moon. These minima are ecologically equally suitable for <italic>C. marinus’</italic> reproduction, representing different <italic>timing niches</italic> that are occupied by different <italic>timing types</italic> (for details and definitions see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaiser et al., 2021</xref>). Some timing types of <italic>C. marinus</italic> use both niches (‘<italic><underline>s</underline>emi-<underline>l</underline>unar rhythm’</italic>; SL type), but there are also dedicated full moon (FM) or new moon (NM) timing types, which occupy only one timing niche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaiser et al., 2021</xref>. As water levels outside the minima are much less suitable for successful reproduction, we can expect divergent selection toward either full moon or new moon emergence. This divergence into FM and NM timing types represents a magic trait, as it automatically entails assortative mating. Additionally, hybrids between timing types are expected to emerge at intermediate times with respect to their parents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neumann, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>, that is during neap tide high tides. As this tidal situation is unfavorable for <italic>C. marinus</italic>’ reproduction, we can expect selection against hybrids, a form of an ecologically imposed postzygotic incompatibility. We recently discovered that in Roscoff (France) FM and NM timing types occur in sympatry, largely separated by reproductive timing, but still connected by gene flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaiser et al., 2021</xref>. Here, we present evidence for polymorphic chromosomal inversions in all chromosome arms of the sympatric FM and NM types. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for divergence in lunar reproductive timing identifies four unlinked and additive QTL in different chromosomes and inversions. Individual loci inside the inversions are more differentiated than the inversions, suggesting that the inversions themselves are not directly required to maintain linkage disequilibrium between adaptive loci and that ecological divergence is kept up by permanent selection on unlinked loci on different chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome sequencing confirms limited genetic differentiation between the sympatric FM and NM types</title><p>In order to gain insights into the loci and processes underlying sympatric divergence in reproductive timing, we sequenced 48 individual genomes for the FM and NM timing types (24 individuals each, defined by their lunar timing phenotype; genome size: 79.4 Mbp; average read coverage: 20 x). The resulting set of 721,000 genetic variants (608,599 SNPs; 112,401 small indels) indicated limited genetic differentiation between the FM and NM types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; weighted genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.028). Principal component analysis (PCA) and ADMIXTURE identify one individual as a <italic>migrant in time</italic>, which was caught at full moon among FM type individuals, but genetically clearly is of NM type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; blue circle and arrow). Many other individuals, particularly in the NM type, show ADMIXTURE fractions close to 0.5 or 0.25, suggesting they are F1 hybrids or backcrosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; yellow circle and arrows). Finally, there are four FM individuals, which are genetically distinct along principal component 2 and in ADMIXTURE at K=4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; red circle and arrows). These might constitute either a sub-lineage of the FM type or migrants from a different geographic location. Taken together, full genome resequencing confirms that there is considerable hybridization of sympatric timing types and overall low genome-wide differentiation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Population structure of the FM and NM types in Roscoff based on 721,000 genetic variants.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Principal component analysis (PCA; <bold>A</bold>) and admixture analysis (<bold>B</bold>) identify one migrant in time (blue; pure NM genotype caught at full moon), many potential F1 hybrids (yellow) and four individuals in the FM strain that appear genetically distict from all other samples (red).

Two windows correspond to those parts of the large inversion that do not overlap with the small inversion (roughly 2.7–4.4 Mbp and 11.3–18.7 Mbp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The central window corresponds to the overlap of both inversions (roughly 4.4–11.3 Mbp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). In a principal component analysis (PCA) on the genetic variants in these windows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), the four FM individuals that were already identified as genetically distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) always cluster separately and cannot be assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-G</xref>, red question mark). The remaining 44 individuals are split into three genotype classes when PCA is performed on the non-overlapping regions of the large inversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref>). These classes correspond to individuals homozygous for the standard haplotype (SS), individuals homozygous for an inverted haplotype (I<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub>), and heterozygotes for the inversion (SI<sub>1</sub>). Genotype assignments are confirmed by local admixture analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), as well as heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–K</xref>). Local observed heterozygosity is clearly elevated in individuals heterozygous for the inversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and J</xref>), suggesting there are polymorphisms specific to the S or I<sub>1</sub> haplotypes. This is corroborated by the patterns of genetic differentiation between SS and I<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub> homozygotes, which show F<sub>ST</sub> values of up to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). For the homozygous genotypes, the haplotype which has the higher observed heterozygosity in homozygotes is considered the ancestral standard haplotype S (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>).</p><p>In the region where both inversions overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the 44 individuals separate into six genotype clusters, corresponding to three clusters of inversion haplotype homozygotes (SS, I<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>) and three clusters of heterozygotes (SI<sub>1</sub>, SI<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>1</sub>I<sub>2</sub>). Individuals that are I<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub> genotypes in the 2.7–4.4 Mbp and 11.3–18.7 Mbp windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref>) now separate into the I<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>1</sub>I<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This indicates that the small inversion leading to haplotype I<sub>2</sub> happened in the already inverted haplotype I<sub>1</sub> of the large inversion (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). This is backed up by genetic linkage data (Figure 5A and B) and consistent with I<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> homozygotes showing even lower heterozygosity than I<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Again, heterozygosity is clearly elevated in the inversion heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). A sliding-window PCA analysis along the chromosomes (500 kb windows, 100 kb steps; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s21">21</xref>) confirms these patterns of segregation and the approximate genomic positions of inversion breakpoints.</p><p>Sliding-window PCA also indicated that there might be a third inversion, which ends at 24.8 Mbp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s21">21</xref>).

This inversion is only clearly detected in three SI<sub>3</sub> heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and K</xref>).

However, the pattern in which these individuals segregate in the 4.4–11.3 Mbp window unequivocally indicates that these must be I<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub> homozygotes. They also show much lower heterozygosity than the SI<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes. Their peculiar clustering may indicate a certain degree of gene conversion between inversion haplotypes or a complex demographic history.</p><p>Taken together, our data support three inversion events, which we name In(1a), In(1b) and In(1c), leading to four distinct haplotypes of chromosome 1 (S, I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>3</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). From the PCA-derived genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>), we can infer the frequency of each haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). There is marked genetic differentiation between the sympatric timing types. The FM type carries all haplotypes but is dominated by the S haplotype, while the NM type almost exclusively carries the inverted I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> haplotypes. The distribution of haplotypes also explains the observed patterns of LD. As the NM type is segregating almost exclusively for I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>, it shows recombination suppression only over the length of I<sub>2</sub>. The FM type is segregating for the S haplotype vs both I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>, and thus shows recombination suppression along I<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Non-differentiated inversions on chromosomes 2 and 3</title><p>The analysis of long-range LD also identifies one putative chromosomal inversion on each arm of the metacentric chromosomes 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The inversion genotypes of the parents were SI<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>1</sub>I<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>), so that in the F1 we can expect partial recombination suppression, depending on the F1 genotypes.

The genomic regions underlying these QTL are large and show several peaks in genetic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Possibly, the QTL on chromosome 2 and 3 harbor a set of linked loci influencing the lunar emergence phenotype. Taken together, there are at least four unlinked loci which influence this magic trait. Given that the QTL mapping was based on a single pair of parents, the overall genetic architecture in the populations may be even more complex than what we described here.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Divergent alleles are not associated with specific inversion haplotypes</title><p>While some chromosomal inversions show up as genetically differentiated blocks, in all chromosomal inversions there are loci that are far more differentiated than the inversion itself (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref> to O with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This implies that the inversions are not required for protecting genetic differentiation. One explanation for such divergence peaks could be that individual SNPs in the ancestral arrangement are strongly differentiated between the timing types (while it is generally assumed that the inversion is fixed for one allele). Alternatively, there could be recombination and gene conversion placing the divergent alleles also in the inverted haplotypes. In both scenarios individual loci can diverge, while the surrounding inversions remain less differentiated. We tested these scenarios for the most differentiated locus in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, red asterisk), which is the <italic>period</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

However, we could not find a close association between the <italic>period</italic> alleles and the inversion haplotypes of chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Both alleles occur is several inversion haplotypes, confirming that there is gene flux between standard and inversion haplotypes. This implies that differentiation of the <italic>period</italic> locus is not driven by differentiation of the inversion system, that is it is not enhanced by LD with other locally adaptive variants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Candidate loci</title><p>The overlap of genetic divergence peaks and the QTL’s 95% Bayesian intervals, allows us to identify potential candidate genes for controlling the magic trait, i.e. phenotypic divergence in lunar reproductive timing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref> for an overview).

These gene functions are plausible to be involved in lunar time-keeping and congruent with the results from a companion study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuhrmann et al., 2023</xref>, which assessed the loss of lunar timing in a different set of <italic>Clunio</italic> populations. Thus, evidence from gene function, genetic divergence and QTL mapping align to support these candidate genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found multiple large and polymorphic chromosomal inversions in the sympatric FM and NM strains, covering all chromosome arms of the <italic>C. marinus</italic> genome. This is consistent with large non-pairing and inverted regions observed in <italic>C. marinus</italic> polytene chromsomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michailova, 1980</xref>. These inversions reduce recombination, as is observed in large LD blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and possibly lock several loci involved in divergent reproductive timing into supergenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). However, most of these inversions are not differentiated between timing types and in all inversions, there are loci more divergent than the inversion itself. We show that divergent alleles at the <italic>period</italic> locus are not associated with specific inversion haplotypes or the standard haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, there must be considerable recombination and/or gene conversion inside the inversion, placing the <italic>period</italic> alleles in different inversion haplotypes. This is likely also true for other divergent loci and forms the basis for genetic differentiation at individual loci to exceed the inversion background. We therefore propose that in this study system genetic linkage is not the major mechanism for coupling ecological divergence and assortative mating. Instead, we favor the magic trait scenario, in which recombination does not matter, because the relevant components of reproductive isolation are influenced by a single trait. Given a magic trait, all loci influencing the trait will be under divergent natural selection. We thus assume that peaks of genetic differentiation include the loci responsible for ecological adaptation, and that their differentiation is driven by permanent divergent natural selection. As a consequence, physical linkage between adaptive alleles and inversion haplotypes, though incomplete, may drive the spread of specific inversion haplotypes and thus differentiation of the inversion system on chromosome 1. Differentiation of the inversion system then creates a genetic substrate for further components of reproductive isolation to evolve and be genetically linked to the existing loci responsible for reproductive isolation. Eventually, this may lead to the completion of speciation.</p><p>At the same time, QTL mapping revealed at least four independent loci underlying lunar reproductive timing. Therefore, we are neither dealing with a single pleiotropic locus that affects several components of reproductive isolation, nor with a single supergene that would combine genetic variants underlying different components of reproductive isolation, such as local adaptation and assortative mating. Our data show that an oligogenic architecture can underlie ecological and reproductive divergence in sympatric populations. In addition, the four QTL we identified here for the difference in lunar reproductive timing between the FM and NM types in Roscoff do not overlap with the two QTL we identified previously for difference in lunar reproductive timing between Normandy (Por-1SL) and Basque Coast (Jean-2NM) strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaiser and Heckel, 2012</xref>. This indicates that within the species <italic>C. marinus</italic>, different populations have found different genetic solutions for adapting lunar reproductive timing to the local tidal regime. Given that both studies relied on a single crossing family, the overall genetic basis of lunar reproductive timing may even be more complex than what we have shown here.</p><p>During the last ice age, the English Channel did not exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patton et al., 2017</xref>, setting the time frame of establishment of the sympatric Roscoff populations roughly to the last 10,000 years. Genetic differentiation between the inversion haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) is higher than what would be expected to evolve in this time-frame. We thus assume that the inversions were already segregating in the ancestral populations or may have recently introgressed from a different geographic site. The latter might also be true for the genetic variants underlying sympatric ecological divergence.</p><p>The detection of <italic>period</italic> as the most differentiated locus between NM and FM types, overlapping with a QTL for lunar reproductive timing, suggests that this circadian clock gene might also be involved in lunar time-keeping. The other prominent candidates, <italic>plum</italic>, <italic>cask,</italic> and <italic>stat1</italic> are involved in neuronal or synaptic development and plasticity. Notably, <italic>cask</italic> is a direct interaction partner of <italic>CaMKII</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gillespie and Hodge, 2013</xref>, which we previously found to be involved in circadian timing differences in <italic>Clunio</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaiser et al., 2016</xref>. Hence, both QTL on chromosome 1 suggest a close connection of circadian and circalunar time-keeping. This is backed by recent findings in Baltic and Arctic <italic>Clunio</italic> strains, for which genomic analysis of the loss of lunar rhythms also implied circadian GO terms as the top candidates for affecting circalunar time-keeping, followed by GO terms involved in nervous system development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuhrmann et al., 2023</xref>. Thus, our data not only elucidate the genetic architecture underlying a magic trait, but also give hints to the genetic basis of the yet enigmatic circalunar clock.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling and laboratory strains</title><p>Laboratory strains for crossing experiments and field samples for whole genome sequencing of 48 individuals were available from a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaiser et al., 2021</xref> (FM type = Ros-2FM; NM type = Ros-2NM).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see, both expert reviewers like the topic and the system you have established, but have also significant concerns, mostly about interpretation, but some also regarding technical issues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please be more stringent in your discussion and interpretation of 'magic traits' and their genetic basis, and especially how they can be differentiated from related genetic and evolutionary phenomena.</p><p>State clearly that the conclusions are drawn from a single cross rather than population-wide linkage mapping and that it cannot be excluded that the species-wide genetic architecture of the trait of interest is more complex than suggested here.</p><p>Temper your claims of genomic regions of high differentiation being the causal drivers of the ecological differentiation.</p><p>Add technical detail, as outlined in the individual reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a very interesting set of experiments on co-located populations of marine midge that emerge either at full or at new moon. There are several aspects of the study that will attract broad attention: the genetic architecture of a trait involved in reproductive isolation, the role of chromosomal inversions in population divergence and the link between the circadian and circalunar clocks. The authors choose to focus on 'magic traits'. This is not a straightforward idea. For a broad audience, it is important that the idea is explained carefully and I do not think that the current Introduction provides such a clearly-argued context. I have made specific comments by line numbers below. A related issue is whether the timing difference is actually under divergent selection. Probably it is but this is important for the argument in the manuscript and so reasons for expecting divergent selection and the likely nature of the selection should be described.</p><p>The experiments and analyses generally appear robust and appropriately interpreted. I have some reservations that are detailed below but I doubt any of them will influence the major conclusions. Data are not presented for long-read detection of SVs. There is generally some uncertainty about the interpretation of inversions, but this is handled well. The inversion genotypes of individuals used in the QTL mapping crosses were not determined (or at least they are not presented). This influences the direct interpretation of the crosses but it may also influence the larger picture because the mapping cross is just between two individuals. If these individuals were homozygous for the same arrangement of a given inversion, the cross might give a very different outcome from one between individuals homozygous for different arrangements.

Alternatively, hybrids might suffer a fitness cost – a form of incompatibility. This would fit the multiple-effect trait definition advanced by ref. 6 but not the definition of magic traits used here (although I think it might fit the definition originally used by Gavrilets).</p><p>72 – I think the authors probably mean 'linkage disequilibrium' here, rather than 'genetic linkage'.</p><p>91-2 – some caution is needed here since F1 and BX hybrids alone do not represent gene flow. A plot of heterozygosity against hybrid index, or an analysis using NewHybrids would help to show whether later generation hybrids occur. However, caution is also needed because of segregation of structural variants that might be shared between ecotypes and can distort Fst and admixture analyses.</p><p>98-100 – meaning 'polymorphic in both timing types', I assume. It seems that the data behind the SV calls in figure 1C are not shown anywhere.</p><p>Figure 1 and S4 – running the windowed PCA and the PCAs in Figure 1 without the 4 outlying FM individuals might well give clearer patterns.

At present, this is all quite hard to access, even though I am used to plots of this type.</p><p>150-2 – it may be worth noting that this helps to explain the LD patterns in Figure S2: because NM segregates only for I1 and I2, there is LD only in the I2 region (the only region where recombination is suppressed). In FM, recombination is suppressed over the length of I1, but we might expect more gene flux in the area of I2 because it is collinear in SI2 individuals. However, this is all without thinking about gene flow between FM and NM. The strong differences in LD seem quite surprising to me, given the previous inference of extensive gene flow.</p><p>Table S1 gives the margins of the area of SD (with surprisingly high precision).

Do points around day 25 belong to the 'spurious' distribution? Are conclusions about QTL sensitive to decisions about boundaries?</p><p>168 – maybe 'at least four QTL' since it is impossible to exclude the presence of other loci or of more loci under the broad peaks observed (indeed, Figure S8 does suggest multiple loci under some peaks).</p><p>Figure 4A,B – it is not clear why two lines are plotted in 4A for Chr1. The inference that the gene order is 'reversed' in I1 and I2 is relative to the reference genome (and actually quite hard to see in the current plot). Importantly, there is no evidence of recombination suppression in the cross analysed, which implies that the FM and NM parents were homozygous for the same (inverted) arrangement. This is actually quite surprising, given the arrangement frequencies inferred from Figure 1. However, it is unclear whether the methods used would have picked up partial recombination suppression due to heterozygosity in the grandparents (leading to heterozygosity in some but not all of the F1 individuals).</p><p>185 – does 'largely additive' mean that dominance effects were small or not significant? In Table S4d, the dominance effects look non-significant but there is no comparison of models with or without dominance. Fig, S7B,C have not come through well in my PDF. Here the tests for epistasis seems to exclude dominance.</p><p>187-90 – this, of course, confirms that other loci are likely to contribute.</p><p>193-5 – see comments above on Figure 4A,B. It needs to be clear what the inferred inversion genotypes of the parents and F1 were in these crosses. This influence interpretation substantially.</p><p>199 – but these inversions were also apparently not segregating in the cross families.</p><p>207 – Figure 4B does not make this clear because it does not show Fst for each inversion, only for SNPs within inversion. Also note that a new inversion is typically fixed for one allele at any locus where the ancestral arrangement is polymorphic. There are then many combinations of inversion and SNP frequencies in two populations for which Fst is higher for the SNP than for the inversion, without any requirement for gene flux (as suggested on line 209). Gene flux is needed for cases where both arrangements carry both alleles (as seems to happen in some cases in Figure 4D, although the situation here is complicated by the putatively overlapping inversions which can enhance gene flux).</p><p>217-8 – there is no expectation that differentiation at a single locus will be protected by an inversion so it would help to reword this sentence a bit.

The basis of this idea is that recombination is less important because recombination cannot separate the two (or more) components of reproductive isolation influenced by the trait. If one component of isolation is local adaptation (as proposed here but not directly established) then each locus influencing the trait will be under divergent selection. An inversion might be favoured because it maintains advantageous combinations of these loci (the Kirkpatrick-Barton mechanism) but this is different from the case where assortative mating (for example) is not under direct selection and so only evolves in response to indirect selection (as in classical models of reinforcement).</p><p>251-3 – this is a slightly odd distinction.

This should be made explicit. The inversion genotypes of the parents should be determined (and ideally of the F1 individuals, but this would have to be inferred from their offspring, I think), because the parents may have been heterozygous and so the F1 may have varied.</p><p>389-90 – so far as I can see this was without formal testing for dominance effects.</p><p>395-413 – it seems that the results of these analyses are not available anywhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study system promises to hold exciting insights into the genetic basis of ecological traits but there are limitations in the analyses and interpretation that temper my overall enthusiasm for the paper. These are included in my public review but I list them with specific analysis suggestions below:</p><p>1) The QTL mapping relies on a modest number of individuals and there are important details missing. The authors should provide the overall heritability of the trait, which can be estimated from their parental and offspring data with some assumptions. For the estimates of QTL effect sizes from such small samples, there is a common issue known as the Beavis effect that can inflate the effect size of individual QTL. Related to this, the total effect size of the QTL reported is extremely high and the authors should consider (e.g. with simulations) that the effect size is substantially inflated. The authors should report individual effect sizes and explore their power to detect QTL with different effect sizes given their study design. I think that consideration of heritability and overall power will help with interpretation of this result.</p><p>2) My major issue with the paper is the interpretation of divergence within the inversion as linked causally to the genes underlying ecological divergence. As the authors observe, divergence will vary within an inverted region. This can be traced to myriad factors, including variation in mutation rate, variation in constraint, patterns of ancestral polymorphism within this region, and variation in gene conversion within the inversion. Given this, I do not think it is valid to interpret the regions of high differentiation as the causal drivers of the ecological differentiation. In my view, the results need to be reframed in the context of ecological adaptation dependent on large inversions and potentially interesting candidate genes, without a claim that the results can be narrowed to individual genes.</p><p>3) The authors imply in the discussion based on historical results that the ecotype evolved in situ in the last ~60 years. This speculation should be removed as it seems much more likely that the ecotype was either missed in sampling or a recent migrant introduced it to the area in the recent past.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82825.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please be more stringent in your discussion and interpretation of 'magic traits' and their genetic basis, and especially how they can be differentiated from related genetic and evolutionary phenomena.</p></disp-quote><p>We have completely rewritten the introduction as well as the discussion, in order to now make a clear distinction between magic traits, pleiotropy and genetic linkage as mechanisms for coupling different components of reproductive isolation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>State clearly that the conclusions are drawn from a single cross rather than population-wide linkage mapping and that it cannot be excluded that the species-wide genetic architecture of the trait of interest is more complex than suggested here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included respective statements in the results (lines 209-218; 259-261), discussion (lines 386-398) and method sections (lines 481-482).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Temper your claims of genomic regions of high differentiation being the causal drivers of the ecological differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We tempered our wording and now speak of “potential candidate genes” which “may” point to specific molecular mechanisms to be involved in ecological divergence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Add technical detail, as outlined in the individual reviews.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added technical detail in many sections, as requested by the reviewers (for details see specific replies below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript describes a very interesting set of experiments on co-located populations of marine midge that emerge either at full or at new moon.

The idea that timing ecotypes might accumulate other components of reproductive isolation and eventually complete speciation was added to the paragraph above (lines 328-337).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>287-8 – in line with previous comments, I think that describing the genetic basis of a putative ‘magic trait’ is a valuable contribution but does not require any re-evaluation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have rewritten the sentence accordingly (lines 378-380).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods</p><p>328-30 – this identifies the margins of the region of LD, which do not necessarily correspond to breakpoints.</p></disp-quote><p>We are fully aware that the region of LD can only approximate the breakpoints and have changed the wording accordingly (lines 420-423).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>372-3 – this does not provide sufficient information – see comments on the Results.</p></disp-quote><p>We inserted a statement of how the peaks are delineated (lines 466-469).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>384-5 – this analysis used all F2 families derived from one pair of grandparents, I believe.

For clarity, we have repeated it in the section on QTL mapping (lines 481-482). We did determine the inversion genotypes of the parents and have inserted the information in the text (lines 244-246; 253-255, see comments above). Indeed, the F1 likely varied for inversion genotypes, leading to recombination suppression in some families, but not others, i.e. partial recombination suppression overall.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>389-90 – so far as I can see this was without formal testing for dominance effects.</p></disp-quote><p>The R/qtl function we used (<italic>fitqtl</italic>) includes the calculation of dominance effects, which are given in Supplementary File 5d (previously Supplementary Table 4).

In order to avoid the confusion, we have replaced “additive” with “non-epistatic” (lines 489-491).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>395-413 – it seems that the results of these analyses are not available anywhere.</p></disp-quote><p>Initially, we only picked the support we could find for specific inversions from the large SV dataset.

A full account of the SV calls will be given in a separate manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study system promises to hold exciting insights into the genetic basis of ecological traits but there are limitations in the analyses and interpretation that temper my overall enthusiasm for the paper. These are included in my public review but I list them with specific analysis suggestions below:</p><p>1) The QTL mapping relies on a modest number of individuals and there are important details missing. The authors should provide the overall heritability of the trait, which can be estimated from their parental and offspring data with some assumptions. For the estimates of QTL effect sizes from such small samples, there is a common issue known as the Beavis effect that can inflate the effect size of individual QTL. Related to this, the total effect size of the QTL reported is extremely high and the authors should consider (e.g. with simulations) that the effect size is substantially inflated. The authors should report individual effect sizes and explore their power to detect QTL with different effect sizes given their study design. I think that consideration of heritability and overall power will help with interpretation of this result.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments but we are not sure how they would affect our overall conclusions. Heritability is evidently dependent on the environmental conditions, which would be rather different in nature, compared to the laboratory conditions. It is not clear what we would gain by calculating a heritability for our QTL experiment. Additionally, even if we make the assumption that environmental variance is equal in the F1 and F2 generations and thus calculate the genetic variance as the difference between the variances in the F1 and the F2, we are still lacking an independent estimate of environmental variance and we can still not calculate broad sense heritability. We do not see which additional reasonable assumptions we can make in order to obtain an estimate of heritability. But we provide now the individual effect sizes for the QTLs in the text (they were previously somewhat hidden in the suppl. tables). In addition, we point out that they could be overestimated about 3-fold, due to the Beavis effect (lines 236-240). Given that all evidence points to an oligogenic architecture, an overestimate of effect sizes is actually a conservative assumption.</p><p>Similarly, we think that performing simulations to estimate the power of our QTL mapping approach would not help the overall argument (and is also somewhat beyond the scope of the paper). We expect that we are likely missing QTL with minor effects and state so in the revised manuscript (lines 239-240).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) My major issue with the paper is the interpretation of divergence within the inversion as linked causally to the genes underlying ecological divergence. As the authors observe, divergence will vary within an inverted region. This can be traced to myriad factors, including variation in mutation rate, variation in constraint, patterns of ancestral polymorphism within this region, and variation in gene conversion within the inversion. Given this, I do not think it is valid to interpret the regions of high differentiation as the causal drivers of the ecological differentiation. In my view, the results need to be reframed in the context of ecological adaptation dependent on large inversions and potentially interesting candidate genes, without a claim that the results can be narrowed to individual genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that divergence peaks can be traced to many different factors. We were not intending to make the claim that all genes underlying these divergence peaks are identical with the genes underlying ecological divergence. But we do think that the divergent genes are good candidates for being ecologically relevant. In the end, we have tempered our wording – as suggested by the editor and the reviewer – and now speak of “potential candidate genes” which “may” point to specific molecular mechanisms underlying ecological divergence (lines 286-290; 300-306).</p><p>We don’t think that we can make the alternative claim suggested by the reviewer, namely that adaptation is dependent on the large inversions. Firstly, the inversions cover the largest part of the genome so that some QTL will necessarily overlap with them. Secondly, except for chr1 there is no differentiation of inversions between ecotypes. We have given the F<sub>ST</sub> values now in Figure 3 (previously Figure 2) in order to underline there is no differentiation. We have therefore not followed this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors imply in the discussion based on historical results that the ecotype evolved in situ in the last ~60 years. This speculation should be removed as it seems much more likely that the ecotype was either missed in sampling or a recent migrant introduced it to the area in the recent past.</p></disp-quote><p>We were not intending to imply that the ecotype necessarily evolved in situ. We have therefore re-written the entire paragraph to include an alternative time-frame (postglacial, i.e. roughly 10,000 years) and to explicitly refer to the possibility of introgression (while we explicitly do not refer to evolution in situ).
