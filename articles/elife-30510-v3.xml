Tissue-dissociative technologies enable deep single cell molecular profiling but do not provide spatial information. We developed a proximity ligation in situ hybridization technology (PLISH) with exceptional signal strength, specificity, and sensitivity in tissue. Multiplexed data sets can be acquired using barcoded probes and rapid label-image-erase cycles, with automated calculation of single cell profiles, enabling clustering and anatomical re-mapping of cells. We apply PLISH to expression profile ~2900 cells in intact mouse lung, which identifies and localizes known cell types, including rare ones. Unsupervised classification of the cells indicates differential expression of ‘housekeeping’ genes between cell types, and re-mapping of two sub-classes of Club cells highlights their segregated spatial domains in terminal airways. By enabling single cell profiling of various RNA species in situ, PLISH can impact many areas of basic and medical research.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30510.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human body contains several hundred types of specialized cells that have different roles.

These smISH techniques involve hybridization of fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide probes, typically 24–96 per gene, to mark individual RNA molecules with a discrete, diffraction-limited punctum that can be quantitatively analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. smISH has been used in cultured cells to study the subcellular distribution of RNAs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buxbaum et al., 2015</xref>]), the consequences of stochastic noise on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raj et al., 2006</xref>), and the impact of cell shape and environment on expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moffitt et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battich et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An increasingly important application for smISH is the simultaneous localization of customized panels of transcripts in tissue, which is used to validate putative cell subtypes identified by scRNA-seq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grün and van Oudenaarden, 2015</xref>). Performing smISH in intact tissue can also reveal the spatial relationship between the cells expressing secreted signaling factors and the cells expressing the corresponding receptors, information that current scRNA-seq approaches cannot resolve because they require tissue dissociation with irretrievable loss of spatial context. Finally, when applied on a genome-wide scale in tissues, smISH has the potential to entirely bypass scRNA-seq as an upfront discovery tool.</p><p>The development of multiplexed smISH for use in tissue has been challenging due to autofluorescent background and light scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sylwestrak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moffitt et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lyubimova et al., 2013</xref>). One strategy for addressing this problem is to amplify probe signals by the hybridization chain reaction (HCR, reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2016</xref>); see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) for branched-DNA amplification), which provides up to five orthogonal detection channels. Higher levels of multiplexing can be achieved by repeated cycles of RNA in situ hybridization followed by a re-amplification step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shah et al., 2016</xref>), but because a single round of probe hybridization in tissue sections takes hours, multiplexing with HCR is laborious. Unamplified smISH techniques have the practical advantage that hundreds of endogenous RNA species can be barcoded in a single reaction, and then read out with rapid label-image-erase cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moffitt et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moffitt et al., 2016c</xref>), but these do not provide adequate signal in tissues.</p><p>Ideally, a technique for high-throughput profiling would combine all of the RNA probe hybridization and signal amplification steps into a single reaction. Previously, Nilsson and colleagues presented an elegant enzymatic solution to this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ke et al., 2013</xref>). They used barcoded padlock probes to label cDNA molecules in cells and tissues, and rolling-circle amplification (RCA) to transform the circularized probes into long tandem repeats. The approach worked in tissues and handled an unbounded number of orthogonal amplification channels. The only limitations were that the RNA-detection efficiency was capped at about 15% (each transcript could only be probed at a single site because the 3' end of the cDNA served as the replication primer), and that the approach required an in situ reverse transcription step with specialized and costly locked nucleic-acid primers.</p><p>Here, we report an in situ hybridization technique with performance characteristics that enable rapid and scalable single-cell expression profiling in tissue. Our approach is a simplified variant of the padlock/RCA technique which replaces padlock probes with RNA-templated proximity ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Söderberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frei et al., 2016</xref>) at Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labib et al., 2013</xref>); hence, we term it proximity ligation in situ hybridization (PLISH). As demonstrated below, PLISH generates data of exceptionally high signal-to-noise. Multiplexed hybridization and signal amplification of all target RNA species is carried out in a single parallel reaction, and the RNAs are then localized with rapid label-image-erase cycles. PLISH exhibits high detection efficiency because it probes multiple sites in each target RNA, and high specificity because of the proximity ligation mechanism. PLISH utilizes only commodity reagents, so it can be scaled up inexpensively to cover many genes. It works well on conventional formalin-fixed tissues that have been cryo- or paraffin-embedded, and can be performed concurrently with immunostaining, making it extremely versatile. Using the murine lung as a characterized model tissue, we show that multiplexed PLISH can rediscover and spatially map the distinct cell types of a tissue in an automated and unsupervised fashion. An unexpected discovery from this experiment is that murine Club cells separate into two populations that differ molecularly and segregate anatomically. PLISH constitutes a novel, single cell spatial-profiling technology that combines high performance, versatility and low cost. Because of its technical simplicity, it will be accessible to a broad scientific community.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proximity ligation in situ hybridization (PLISH)</title><p>Proximity ligation at Holliday junctions offers a simple mechanism for the amplified detection of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labib et al., 2013</xref>). First, a transcript is targeted with a pair of oligonucleotide 'H' probes designed to hybridize at adjacent positions along its sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The left H probe includes a single-stranded 5' overhang while the right probe includes a 3' overhang. Importantly, target RNAs can be tiled with H probe pairs at multiple sites, which is critical for efficient detection of low abundance transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The overhangs are then hybridized to 'bridge' and linear 'circle' oligonucleotides with embedded barcode sequences to form a Holliday junction structure, after which ligation at the nick sites creates a closed circle. Finally, the 3' end of the right H probe primes rolling-circle replication, which generates a long single-stranded amplicon of tandem repeats. Addition of fluorescently-labeled 'imager' oligonucleotides complementary to the barcodes generates an extremely bright punctum at the site of each labeled transcript. Because each barcode sequence is unique, the puncta derived from different target RNAs can be labeled with different colors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30510.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNA detection by proximity ligation at RNA-DNA Holliday junctions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mechanism of RNA detection by PLISH. Left (H<sub>L</sub>) and right (H<sub>R</sub>) DNA 'H' probes targeting adjacent sites hybridize to a target RNA. Subsequent addition of circle and bridge oligonucleotides harboring a specific 'barcode' sequence (red dash) results in an RNA-DNA Holliday junction. The nicks in the junction are then sealed by ligation to create a covalently closed circle, and rolling-circle amplification (RCA) generates complementary tandem repeats. The single-stranded amplicons are detected with a fluorescently-labeled 'imager' oligonucleotide (red star) that is complementary to the specific 'barcode' sequence. See note in 1C. (<bold>B</bold>) To increase efficiency of detection for low abundance transcripts, H probe pairs embedded with the same barcode sequence can be 'tiled' along the length of the target mRNA. (<bold>C</bold>) Up to five distinct transcripts can be simultaneously detected using five different barcode sequences (one unique sequence for each RNA), and five complementary imager oligonucleotides that are conjugated to spectrally-distinct fluorophores. (<bold>D</bold>) PLISH RNA detection requires coincident hybridization of both left and right H probes, and redundant probesets increase detection efficiency. Cultured HCT116 cells were stained with one (left panel) or ten (middle panel) pairs of H probes targeting the <italic>SOX4</italic> transcript.

The coefficients of variation for the puncta intensity distributions were typically between one and two.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Highly specific and sensitive detection of RNA transcripts</title><p>The requirement for coincident hybridization of two probes at adjacent sites in an RNA transcript should make PLISH highly specific. To evaluate this, we performed several experiments. First, we used PLISH to detect the transcription factor SRY-box 4 (SOX4) in cultured HCT116 cells. A pool of ten H probesets exhibited much higher RNA detection efficiency than a single H probeset, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, when the RNA-recognition sequence of either the left or right H probe in each set was scrambled, there were no detectable puncta. Thus, both H probes had to be correctly targeted to generate a signal. Second, we tested the sequence-specificity of the PLISH signal in tissue by pre-incubating samples with antisense 'blocking' oligonucleotides complementary to the target RNA at the H probe hybridization sites. For these experiments, we stained mouse lung sections for secretoglobin 1a1 (Scgb1a1), a marker of airway Club cells. Antisense oligonucleotides drastically attenuated the number of PLISH puncta, whereas scrambled blocking oligonucleotides of the same length had no apparent effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Third, we analyzed murine lung sections for the co-localization of the mRNA transcript and protein product of surfactant protein C (Sftpc), which is expressed in alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) cells. Of the cells that were positive for PLISH signal, 98.5% were also positive for antibody staining (n = 184, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This level of specificity is excellent relative to HCR-amplified smISH, where off-target binding of hybridization probes can account for a quarter of the observed puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shah et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the sensitivity and accuracy of RNA detection, we benchmarked PLISH measurements against a reference-standard dataset of single-cell, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and RNA-seq measurements on HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). For genes with fragment-per-kilobase-per-million-read (FPKM) values greater than one, the single-cell qPCR technique detected mRNA in &gt;90% of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, the fraction of transcript-positive cells dropped quickly between FPKM values of 1 and 0.1. A fit of the qPCR data to a Poisson sampling model suggested that an FPKM value of one corresponded to 2.5 copies per cell (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marinov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Battich et al., 2013</xref>]). The PLISH technique detected RNA transcripts with a sensitivity comparable to single-cell qPCR. For example, Caspase-9 (CASP9) has an FPKM value of 2, and it was observed in 100% of the cells by PLISH. We detected an average of 8 puncta per cell, which is consistent with the prediction of 5 copies per cell from the fit to the qPCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, inset). For a set of ten genes covering the full spectrum of expression levels in HCT116 cells, the number of PLISH puncta per cell correlated with bulk FPKM values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>To quantify RNA-detection efficiency in tissue, we marked a set of axin 2 (Axin2) transcripts in mouse lung sections using an HCR-amplified smISH procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2014</xref>) and then determined the fraction of the marked transcripts that could be identified by PLISH. We chose the Axin2 gene because of its low expression level in the lung. HCR detected a sparse population of cells with one to two puncta each (the HCR detection efficiency was low because we used a single HCR probe rather than 24). PLISH puncta generated with a pool of four H probe pairs co-localized with 32% of the HCR puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the four PLISH probesets detected <italic>Axin2</italic> transcripts with a composite efficiency of 32% and an average per-site efficiency of 9%. This probe efficiency matches or exceeds that of other smISH techniques. The PLISH detection efficiency can be tuned on a per gene basis by altering the number of H probe pairs. Decreasing the number of probesets pro-rates the number of puncta from highly-expressed genes, while increasing the number of probesets can facilitate sensitive detection of very low-abundance transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Visualization of molecular and histological features in tissue</title><p>We next characterized the performance of PLISH for low-plex RNA localization in tissues.

One example is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a fatal lung disease of unknown pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Travis et al., 2013</xref>). The diagnosis of IPF is based on the presence of specific histological features, including clusters of spindle-shaped fibroblasts, stereotyped 'honeycomb' cysts, and epithelial cell hyperplasia. In this regard, single-cell profiling approaches that operate on dissociated tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2016</xref>) are intrinsically limited because they cannot correlate molecular data with cytologic and spatial features. As a preliminary test, we used PLISH to analyze RNA expression of the AT2 cell marker SFTPC in resected lung tissue from control and IPF patients. In contrast to the uniformly cuboidal <italic>SFTPC</italic>-expressing AT2 cells distributed throughout alveoli of non-IPF lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), we observed clusters of <italic>SFTPC</italic><sup>Hi</sup> cells of heterogeneous size and varying degrees of flattening lining the airspace lumen of IPF lungs. Surprisingly, many cells that did not appear to be epithelial (i.e., they were not lining an airway lumen) expressed <italic>SFTPC</italic> at low levels. Based on this pilot experiment, PLISH should be a suitable tool for building atlases of RNA expression in human disease. The PLISH data can be overlaid with monoclonal antibody staining patterns that are the mainstay of pathologic diagnosis and classification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Multiplexed and iterative PLISH in tissues</title><p>Highly multiplexed measurement of different RNA species requires iterated data collection cycles, since conventional fluorescence microscopy only provides up to five channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The data collection cycles include fluorescent labeling of a subset of the 'barcodes' (i.e., unique nucleotide sequences complementary to fluorescently labeled 'imager' oligonucleotides) in a sample, imaging of the labeled transcripts, and erasure of the fluorescent signal. Ideally, the cycles should be fast, and the erasure should not cause any mechanical or chemical damage to the sample. Consistent with prior work, we found that PLISH puncta could be imaged in the presence of a 3 nM background of freely-diffusing imager oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1A</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blab et al., 2004</xref>]).

First, the Club cell class mapped perfectly onto the bronchial epithelium, while cells from the AT1 and AT2 classes were distributed throughout the alveolar compartment. The rare BASCs also localized precisely to the bronchioalveolar junctions, where they have been shown to reside by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

It combines high performance in four key areas: specificity, detection efficiency, signal-to-noise and speed. The specificity derives from coincidence detection, which requires two probes to hybridize next to one another for signal generation. Efficient detection of low-abundance transcripts is accomplished by targeting multiple sites along the RNA sequence. Enzymatic amplification produces extremely bright puncta, and allows many different RNA transcripts to be marked with unique barcodes in one step. The different RNA transcripts can then be iteratively detected to rapidly generate high dimensional data.</p><p>While low-plex PLISH on a handful of different genes can be valuable, the PLISH technology is also scalable, without requiring specialized microscopes (or other equipment), software, or computational expertise. The oligonucleotides and enzymes are inexpensive and commercially available from multiple vendors. The H probes are the cost-limiting reagent, but can be synthesized in pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murgha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beliveau et al., 2012</xref>). Assuming five pairs of H probes for each target RNA species, and 20 cents for a 40mer oligonucleotide, the cost of PLISH reagents amounts to $3 per gene. It should therefore be practical to simultaneously interrogate entire molecular systems, such as signaling pathways or super-families of adhesion receptors. The high specificity and signal-to-noise of PLISH will be advantageous for deep profiling, where non-specific background increases with increasingly complex mixtures of hybridization probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moffitt et al., 2016c</xref>).</p><p>Our initial studies demonstrate PLISH's capacity for rapid, automated and unbiased cell-type classification, and illustrate how it can complement single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq). Sc-RNAseq offers greater gene depth than in situ hybridization approaches, but it is less sensitive, fails to capture spatial information, and induces artefactual changes in gene expression during tissue dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van den Brink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). PLISH provides the missing cytological and spatial information, and it is applied to intact tissues. Going forward, sequencing can be used to nominate putative cell types and molecular states based on the coordinate expression of 'signature genes', and multiplexed PLISH can be used to distinguish true biological variation from technical noise and experimentally-induced perturbations. Importantly, multiplexed PLISH provides the tissue context of distinct cell populations, which is essential for understanding the higher-order organization of intact systems like solid tumors and developing organs. In diseases like IPF where morphology and gene expression are severely deranged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2016</xref>), histological, cytological and spatial features may even be essential for making biological sense of sequencing data.</p><p>Currently, efforts are underway to more deeply characterize cellular states by integrating diverse types of molecular information. We have already demonstrated the combined application of PLISH with conventional immunostaining. Going one step further, oligonucleotide-antibody conjugates make it possible to mix and match protein and RNA targets in a multiplexed format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weibrecht et al., 2013</xref>). The generation of comprehensive, multidimensional molecular maps of intact tissues, in both healthy and diseased states, will have a fundamental impact on basic science and medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were from Thermo-Fisher and Sigma-Aldrich.

NCBI BLAST searches were used to eliminate detection sites that shared 10 or more contiguous nucleotides with a non-target RNA. The detection sites were also selected to minimize self-complementarity as indicated by the IDT oligo analyzer. Each detection site was targeted with a pair of H probes designated HL (left H probe) and HR (right H probe). The HL and HR probes included ~20 nucleotide binding sequences that were complementary respectively to the 5' and 3' halves of the detection site. The binding sequences were chosen so that the 5' end of the HL binding sequence and the 3' end of the HR binding sequence would abut at a 5’-AG-3’ or a 5’-TA-3’ dinucleotide in the target RNA. The lengths of the binding sequences were adjusted so that the melting temperature of the corresponding DNA duplex would fall between 45–65°C as computed by IDT Oligo analyzer using default settings of 0.25 μM oligo concentration and 50 mM salt concentration. To generate H probes, suitable HL and HR binding sequences were catenated at their respective 5' and 3' ends with overhang sequences taken from one of eight modular design templates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Nuclear boundaries were assigned by a propagation algorithm, and then expanded by ~1 micron to define sampling areas. The following data were then recorded: (i) average pixel intensities for each data channel over each sampling area; (ii) the coordinates of the sampling areas; (iii) shape metrics for the corresponding nuclei; and (iv) an image with the boundary pixels of each nucleus set equal to the associated index value. For each RNA species, the PLISH data were first normalized onto a 0:10 scale by dividing through by the largest value observed in any cell over all of the fields of view, and then multiplying by ten. The data were then log-transformed onto a −1:1 scale by the operation: transformed_data = log(0.1 + normalized_data).

It presents a technique the authors call PLISH which is an improved variation of the &quot;in situ sequencing&quot; technique published in 2013. The manuscript convincingly demonstrates that in cultured cells the PLISH technique can detect a variety of transcripts which are expressed at different levels and that PLISH detection levels correlate extremely well with FPKM values obtained by RNA-seq. In addition, they provide proof-of-principle that in tissue sections their technique can be used in a multiplex fashion to detect highly-expressed transcripts with very good specificity e.g. the blocking of the Scgb1a1 signal by antisense oligos, but not scrambled oligos, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> is very impressive given how highly Scgb1a1 is transcribed.</p><p>Beyond <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the additional experiments presented all show that the PLISH technique works well in mouse and human lung sections (which are complex tissues) when highly-expressed mRNAs are detected.</p><p>However, no biological insights are presented. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the technique basically works in formalin-fized paraffin embedded human samples using extremely highly expressed transcripts, but these results had previously been obtained by immunostaining so no biological insights are presented. Note: the cell shape changes that are described in the text for SpC+ cells are not visible in the image on the merged pdf.</p><p>The analysis of adult mouse lungs – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> is a bit disappointing. This is solid proof-of-principle that the PLISH technique works. However, these transcripts are all highly expressed – no real biological insights are gained at all here. To publish in <italic>eLife</italic> I would at least expect to see low level transcripts detected, or some new biology, in addition to the proof of principal work shown here. No prior evidence springs to mind as to what the 2 types of club cells could be – prox and dist, but this change in B-actin could be purely structural to do with cell size/shape in different parts of the airways.</p><p>&quot;Proper&quot; analysis of a tissue section using probes to transcripts that are thought to be expressed at low levels, in addition to highly expressed genes such as Sftpc, is required. Plus some biological insight.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The present study by the Desai lab shows the development of a proximity ligation in situ hybridization technology and its use to examine various cell type markers in the mouse and human lung. The technique appears to work well and if employed correctly could enhance studies on human tissue samples where histology is possible but isolation of single cells is limited. One limitation of the current study is that it does not extend our understanding of lung cell heterogeneity as most if not all of the markers examined have already been extensively characterized in the lung.</p><p>1) Much of the histology shown is at far too low of a magnification to assess the patterns of expression. The authors should provide high mag pictures in all situations, especially for the alveolar region as it is difficult to assess where the positive cells are located. Use of 3D reconvolution (i.e. IMARIS) would be helpful.</p><p>2) It would be nice for the authors to show data from some new novel markers that were isolated from the current study. This would provide novel insight into how this technique has advantages over other techniques.</p><p>3) A lot of the co-staining is difficult to assess. These data may be helped by higher mag imaging.</p><p>4) In the scRNA-seq experiment, was this done on whole lung cell suspension or Epcam+? It is not mentioned in the paper that I can see.</p><p>5) Many of the figures need better annotation. It’s very hard to interpret what some of the panels are trying to convey.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30510.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, Nagendran et al. validate the use of an improved version of RNA in situ hybridization that they name PLISH, which utilizes rolling circle amplification rather than the proprietary amplification procedures commercially available (i.e. RNAScope, ViewRNA, etc.), thus providing an accessible tool for the broad scientific community.

We have clarified our language on this point. PLISH's exceptional signal-to-noise is a striking improvement over tiling and HCR approaches, which because they require computational processing to remove false positives and to improve signal-to-noise, are not amenable to direct visual analysis.</p><p>With respect to 'subcellular resolution', we use the term in an introductory paragraph describing past applications of single-molecule in situ hybridization (smISH). We did not make any claims about the subcellular resolution of PLISH in tissue. However, PLISH puncta can in fact be localized with subcellular resolution. The revised high-magnification micrograph of Scgb1a1 RNA in BASC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) now illustrates this point, as does the micrograph of Foxj1 RNA in ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although the ability to resolve single RNA molecules will be useful for studies of subcellular RNA distribution in tissues, this was not an objective of our work.</p><p>It is not clear to us what other claims the reviewer feels are unsupported.

We applied them to our multiplexed PLISH data so that it would be comprehensible to us, and hopefully to readers.

We do not believe that the Club cell sub-classes represent &quot;new cell types&quot;, but more likely that the difference in β actin expression between them relates to regional differences in mechanical forces within the terminal bronchioles, as suggested by reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work is much better suited to a methods journal, as there is no exploratory work, and only validation and confirmation of what was already known.

PLISH is a pioneering technological advance on this basis alone.</p><p>Our data show that even modest multiplexing (8 transcripts) for cell type markers and 'housekeeping' genes can reveal new biology. Our observations include: (i) that Ager is not an AT1-specific marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B- C</xref>), (ii) that Lyz2 expression distinguishes a subset of AT2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>), and (iii) that β-Actin levels distinguish terminal versus pre-terminal airway Club cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B, E</xref>).</p><p>The technical basis for PLISH is proximity ligation and rolling circle amplification, which has nothing in common with RNAScope, ViewRNA, Stellaris or HCR. PLISH's enzymatic amplification is a departure from the DNA-based amplification used by these alternate methods, and therefore cannot be described as building upon them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Pixels in tissue images look highly saturated/blurry, even DAPI – why?</p><p>-Does not help support claims of superior resolution/is not subcellular.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the low quality of the micrographs, which suffered from file compression and inadequate magnification. We have substituted or added higher-magnification insets to the figures showing raw PLISH micrographs, and we have corrected the compression problem.</p><p>Regarding superior or subcellular resolution, please see above. To summarize: (i) we made no claims about superior or subcellular resolution; (ii) nonetheless, we have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to illustrate subcellular resolution in tissue; (iii) however, our objective in this manuscript was to show that PLISH can identify, localize, and quantify molecularly distinct cell classes. This does not require subcellular localization of PLISH puncta.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) PLISH gives puncta, as described, in cells, but looks like weak IF in tissues with no clear subcellular resolution (which is a major claim in the Introduction).</p></disp-quote><p>We used the term 'subcellular resolution' only once in the manuscript, in an introductory paragraph describing past applications of smISH. We did not intend for this to be perceived as a major claim of our manuscript.</p><p>We now show that PLISH can precisely localize transcripts within cells (detailed above). Because the RNAs we selected to profile do not have unusual subcellular distributions, we have not emphasized this feature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Scale bars need to be in every separate image, especially in diseased vs. normal e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this, and have added the scale bars as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Dotted lines outlining relative structures, such as basement membrane/lumen, would make it easier to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included dotted outlines and increased the magnification of the micrographs to improve clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Define &quot;technical terms&quot; if this is to be &quot;biologist friendly&quot; – &quot;imager oligonucleotide&quot; is not clear without a search in the Materials and methods. Workflow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is not readily apparent or obvious. As a major aspect of PLISH, this would be easier appreciated if described more thoroughly.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree. We have significantly re-organized the manuscript to make the technical aspects easier to follow, including the addition of two workflow schematics (one for simple PLISH and the second for multiplexed PLISH with automated analysis). We also now define technical terms (including &quot;imager oligonucleotides&quot;) where they first appear in the figure legends.</p><p>We regret the confusion caused by our use of &quot;biologist friendly&quot;. We meant that performing the staining does not require any special molecular biology or computational expertise. We have clarified the language in the text on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Usage of terms like &quot;barcode&quot; and &quot;imager nt&quot; make something that is not complex much more complicated and &quot;jargon-y&quot; than necessary. &quot;RCA followed by hybridization of a fluorescently labeled nt probe&quot; would be much simpler.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to minimize the use of 'jargon-y' language. In sections of the manuscript focused on multiplexed PLISH, however, we still use the term &quot;barcodes&quot; to connote a set of recognition sequences with minimal cross hybridization. We also still use the term &quot;imager oligonucleotide&quot; rather than &quot;fluorescently labeled probe&quot; to verbally differentiate between the RNA-detection probes (the &quot;H&quot; probes) and the oligonucleotides that toggle puncta on/off during label-image-erase cycles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The inclusion of number of cells (2900) and visualization of the data in tSNE plots deceivingly equates PLISH to a sequencing approach, rather than a standard snapshot visualization tool.</p></disp-quote><p>We are puzzled by the assertion that we are 'deceiving' readers by including data for a large number of cells and displaying the results in tSNE plots.</p><p>The tSNE plot is a universal tool used in almost every field of science and engineering. It is the clearest way to visualize high-dimensional data sets, like the multiplexed PLISH data set. We use k-means clustering to empirically define cell classes and their centroid expression profiles, but the tSNE plots are a useful complement because they efficiently display the number of cells in each class and the cell-to-cell variation within classes.</p><p>We collected data on a large number of cells because this capability is an important feature of PLISH. Unbiased identification of rare cell types requires a smISH approach with high cell-throughput.</p><p>The 'snapshot visualization' feature of PLISH is a downstream application enabling anatomical re-mapping of single cells or cell classes back onto the profiled tissue, and is independent of the tSNE plot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Higher mag images are needed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref> to support the claim that this is &quot;on par with IF&quot; – the current images are not on par with IF and hardly support the presence of a putative BASC, while the IF in Figure 4—figure supplement 2E is much clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>By &quot;on par with fluorescence immunostaining&quot; we meant that the PLISH signal is strong enough that it can be easily visualized, facilitating applications like co-staining for a few transcripts (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, for example). We have clarified the language in the manuscript to reflect this. We have also added a close-up image of several AT2 cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and of 2 BASCs at an airway terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), previously shown at low magnification. These micrographs demonstrate that overlaying PLISH stains in conjunction with DAPI allow discrimination of co-labeling in individual cells on par with the discrimination afforded by immunostaining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 3DE – what is the &quot;other&quot;?

This demonstrates an important application of PLISH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Much of the histology shown is at far too low of a magnification to assess the patterns of expression. The authors should provide high mag pictures in all situations, especially for the alveolar region as it is difficult to assess where the positive cells are located. Use of 3D reconvolution (i.e. IMARIS) would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor image quality, and have now included high-magnification micrographs and used dashed lines to mark bronchial and alveolar structures. We have tried to illustrate two distinct ways to apply PLISH: (i) direct visual examination of marker RNA overlays in a small field of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) versus (ii) automated, computational analysis of multiple markers in a large number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The former does not require any computational expertise. The latter does not require visual analysis by a human being with a high-level of biological expertise – but as we show, accurately distinguishes cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be nice for the authors to show data from some new novel markers that were isolated from the current study. This would provide novel insight into how this technique has advantages over other techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the validation of a new AT1 cell type marker inferred from a prior scRNAseq analysis (Akap5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>We note that the key advance of PLISH over existing techniques (RNAScope, ViewRNA, Stellaris, HCR etc.) is that it enables fast multiplexing in intact tissue. We have focused the manuscript on demonstrating this aspect of the technology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A lot of the co-staining is difficult to assess. These data may be helped by higher mag imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor quality of the images in the original submission. We have substituted higher magnification images in the revised manuscript, and also incorporated dashed lines to demarcate lung structure for easier interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the scRNA-seq experiment, was this done on whole lung cell suspension or Epcam+? It is not mentioned in the paper that I can see.</p></disp-quote><p>The scRNA-seq data was from a previously published manuscript that employed depletion of CD45+ cells and enrichment of Epcam+ cells from dissociated mouse lung with the use of magnetic bead-activated cell sorting (Treutlein et al., Nature, 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Many of the figures need better annotation. It’s very hard to interpret what some of the panels are trying to convey.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback. We have improved figure annotation, added outlines of anatomical structures, provided higher resolution and close-up micrograph images, and revised the legends for clarity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
