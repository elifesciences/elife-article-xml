Their interaction with dendritic cells (DCs) allows DC activation and maturation toward presentation of NET-associated antigens. Differently from other types of cell death that imply protein denaturation, NETosis preserves the proteins localized onto the DNA threads for proper enzymatic activity and conformational status, including immunogenic epitopes. Besides neutrophils, leukemic cells can release extracellular traps displaying leukemia-associated antigens, prototypically mutant nucleophosmin (NPMc+) that upon mutation translocates from nucleolus to the cytoplasm localizing onto NET threads. We tested NPMc+ immunogenicity through a NET/DC vaccine to treat NPMc-driven myeloproliferation in transgenic and transplantable models. Vaccination with DC loaded with NPMc+ NET (NPMc+ NET/DC) reduced myeloproliferation in transgenic mice, favoring the development of antibodies to mutant NPMc and the induction of a CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response. The efficacy of this vaccine was also tested in mixed NPMc/WT bone marrow (BM) chimeras in a competitive BM transplantation setting, where the NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination impaired the expansion of NPMc+ in favor of WT myeloid compartment. NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination also achieved control of an aggressive leukemia transduced with mutant NPMc, effectively inducing an antileukemia CD8 T-cell memory response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>extracellular traps</kwd><kwd>nucleophosmin</kwd><kwd>myeloproliferation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Fondazione AIRC per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG22204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sangaletti</surname><given-names>Sabina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009647</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GR-2013-02355637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sangaletti</surname><given-names>Sabina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Fondazione AIRC per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassani</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Fondazione AIRC per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5x1000 program, grant ID22759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tripodo</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Fondazione AIRC per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG24363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colombo</surname><given-names>Mario P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neutrophil extracellular traps are an immunogenic source of leukemia antigens in dendritic cell-based vaccination and are able to instruct antileukemia CD8 T-cell responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fifteen years ago, a scanning electron microscopy image from Volker Brinkmann showed for the first time spider web-like chromatin structures extruded by neutrophils, called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), to entrap fungi and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>). Such extracellular chromatin is composed by DNA and histones also decorated with antimicrobial proteins like myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase suggesting the hypothesis that eukaryotic chromatin evolved under the need of maintaining genome integrity while defending the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brinkmann and Zychlinsky, 2012</xref>). Extracellular traps can be released by other innate immune cells including eosinophils, macrophages, and mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldmann and Medina, 2012</xref>) and, as recently shown, by cells of the adaptive immunity like CD4 T-helper cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Costanza et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, since their discovery, NET has been associated with inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases like diabetes, arthritis, systemic vasculitis, and lupus erythematosus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jorch and Kubes, 2017</xref>). In a previous study, we demonstrated that the adoption of a NET-based dendritic cell (DC) vaccination was able to break tolerance against neutrophil cytoplasmatic antigens and induce antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies (ANCA)-associated autoimmunity. Indeed, NET is highly immunogenic by virtue of the immune adjuvant effect of DNA and its associated proteins, as well as for the sticky properties of the DNA thread that enable NET persistent interaction with DCs for efficient loading of antigens followed by DC maturation and migration to draining lymph nodes for cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sangaletti et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Also, myeloid transformed cells can extrude NET into the extracellular space to activate the contact system of coagulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demers et al., 2012</xref>) or to sustain myeloproliferation. We have recently described extracellular traps enrichment in bone marrow (BM) biopsies from <italic>NPM1</italic> mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and, using an ad hoc transgenic mouse, we showed that NPM cytoplasmic compartmentalization allows mutant NPM (NPMc+) to be relocalized onto the NET threads, exerting alarmin functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tripodo et al., 2017</xref>). The colocalization of histones with NPMc+ is a supporting evidence of their direct release from the leukemic clone.</p><p>The immune system has the capacity to eradicate AML as shown by the graft-versus-leukemia effect that is obtained after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Accordingly, ideal immune molecular targets of AML should be restricted to leukemic cells including stem cells and be part of leukemic development. Indeed, the leukemia-associated antigens that entered clinical trials as peptide vaccines, such as RHAMM, Proteinase 3, and Wilms’ tumor antigen-1 (WT-1), possess these features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anguille et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>NPM1</italic> mutations are among the most frequent molecular alterations in AML, where they play a prognostic role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Falini et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>NPM1</italic> gene encodes for the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin that regulates the ARF-p53 tumor-suppressor pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colombo et al., 2011</xref>). NPMc mutations cause the stable relocalization of the protein from nucleus to cytoplasm, an event that, per se, is sufficient to trigger AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Falini et al., 2007</xref>). The improved overall survival of patients with NPMc+ AML has been possibly explained by a T-cell response against the mutant epitopes. The specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response against these epitopes raised the possibility of exploiting such property to immunize NPMc+ patients to control MRD or during maintenance treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, NET directly released by leukemic cells could efficiently display tumor-specific associated antigens and be used as vehicles for new DC-based vaccines.</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether the AML-associated NPMc is immunogenic when became part of the NET threads and whether it can be adopted in vaccination strategies to control leukemia outgrowth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NPMc+ NET/DC immunization controls NPMc-driven myeloproliferation</title><p>The h-MRP8-<italic>NPM1+</italic> (NPMc<italic>+</italic>) transgenic mice develop a myeloproliferation with expansion of mature CD11b+ myeloid cells and Gr-1+c-Kit+ myeloblasts, without development of overt acute leukemia. Using NET from NPMc+ transgenic mice we previously demonstrated that mutant NPM can work as an alarmin when localized in the cytoplasm as part of the NET thread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Swerdlow et al., 2016</xref>), gaining immunogenicity. In this work, we tested the possibility of using NPMc+ NET in a DC-based vaccination strategy to control myeloproliferation of NPMc+ transgenic mice. To this end, mice were immunized with DC cocultured with NPMc+ NET or WT NET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During coculture, DC became loaded with the prototypical NET-associated antigen MPO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, red signal) and, only in case of NPMc+ NET, with mutant NPMc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, green signal). NPMc+ NET/DC immunization, but not immunization with WT NET/DC, conspicuously reduced the signs of myeloid expansion in the BM of NPMc+ mice, with a decrease in dense clusters of morphologically immature granulocytic elements, as shown by histopathological analysis of H&amp;E-stained BM sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and a reduction of myeloid blasts, in favor of more segmented forms on BM blood smears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, NPMc+ NET immunization resulted in a significant decrease of cytoplasmic NPM-expressing elements, as assessed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Accordingly, Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analysis of the PB confirmed the reduction of circulating immature GR-1+c-Kit+ precursors and of the overall frequency of CD11b+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>) in the same vaccinated mice.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Vaccination with NPM+ NET/DC controls NPMc+-driven myeloproliferation</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the vaccination experiment.

DC-loaded ex vivo with tumor antigens have largely been tested as cancer vaccines to induce Th1-type responses and trigger cytotoxic T cells targeting antigen-expressing tumor cells.</p><p>This strategy has been proposed for patients with AML, with variable clinical benefits (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Van Acker et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, common weaknesses emerged from different clinical trials including the low ability of DC to mount an effective CD8 T-cell response because of a weak immunostimulatory activity and/or the existing immunosuppressive microenvironment instigated by leukemic clones fostering tolerogenic IDO-expressing DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Weinstock et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>This work represents a proof-of-concept featuring NET-based DC vaccination of NPMc+ AML.

Despite the proimmune conditions endowed by a NET-permissive BM environment, the inflammatory skewing and the leukemic clone immunomodulatory profile associated with signs of myelomonocytic differentiation could eventually foster the development of a tolerogenic milieu suitable for NPMc+ AML progression, a condition potentially reverted by vaccination.</p><p>The main novelty of our work consists in the adoption of AML blast-derived NET as antigens source for DC presentation. This NET-based approach enables the display of leukemia-specific and -associated antigens, such as NPMc, and the conveyance of costimulatory signals through the dsDNA thread. In the case of NPMc+ AML, we demonstrated that mutant NPMc exerts a potent adjuvant function, similar to that described for the alarmin HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tripodo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination is able to break tolerance against mutated NPM, eventually promoting a strong cytotoxic activity in naive and in AML-bearing NPMc+ Tg mice. These experimental results could represent an important complement to the reported effect of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in inducing antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses against immunogenic epitopes derived from mutant <italic>NPM1</italic>, which indicates an existing antigen-specific CD8 response in NPMc+ AML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greiner et al., 2020</xref>). Comparing NPMc+ NET/DC vaccines with DC pulsed with NPMc-derived peptides, we found a consistent capacity of NET-based vaccines to promote antitumor immunity inducing CD8 T-cell responses along with the development of NPMc-specific antibodies. Although the efficacy of the NET-based vaccine to control leukemia growth was similar to the DC+ peptides counterpart, only the former reach statistical significance for several immune parameters, in a side-by-side comparison. Also, we would stress the novelty of the NET-based vaccines in AML, using the leukemic blasts as source of NETs, which largely represent the majority of the AML antigenic repertoire displayed onto DNA threads, per se endowed of adjuvant functions. Differently, peptide-based vaccines require prior knowledge of the immunogenic peptides to be loaded onto in vitro-activated DCs.</p><p>One potential limitation of the proposed NET/DC vaccination strategy lies on the possibility of inducing autoimmune responses against NET-exposed self-antigens, as in the case of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies induced against MPO or proteinase-3. Autoimmune vasculitides of small vessels have been detected in peripheral tissues as the result of NET-loaded DC intraperitoneal injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sangaletti et al., 2012</xref>), but no signs of autoimmunity were observed upon adoption of a subcutaneous NET/DC vaccination, as for the here presented vaccination of C1498-NPMc+ tumor-bearing transgenic mice. Another potential caveat is related to the long-term effects of the immune response elicited by NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination on the hematopoietic niche and on its sustaining nonmalignant hematopoiesis. Experiments with BM chimeras show that NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination selectively impaired the NPMc+ elements, without disrupting the WT hematopoiesis. However, if the induction of sustained immune responses targeting BM resident elements can in turn favor the establishment of proinflammatory conditions contributing to BM niche disfunction is hard to be envisaged, in patients. BM hematopoietic stromal niche alterations have been demonstrated to causally affect the arousal and progression of hematopoietic malignancies, either through transcriptional/phenotypical rewiring of key cellular components of the niche (e.g., osteoblasts, nerve fibers, mesenchymal stromal cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kode et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arranz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zambetti et al., 2016</xref>) or through the modulation of extracellular matrix organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tripodo et al., 2012</xref>). In this regard, extracellular matrix amount and composition have been demonstrated to affect the activation state, cross-presentation activity, and immunoregulatory properties of myeloid elements, an issue that could prove of particular relevance in the unfavorable setting of myeloid malignancies associated with BM fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sangaletti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sangaletti et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>hMPR8-<italic>NPM1</italic> transgenic mice, hereafter referred as <italic>NPM1</italic> tg mice, have been acquired on a mixed (C57BL/6J × CBA) F1 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tripodo et al., 2017</xref>) and backcrossed to C57BL/6 (B6.Ptprc &lt; a &gt; ) mice.

Histopathological analysis was performed on routinely stained hematoxylin-and-eosin sections by a pathologist with specific expertise in hematopathology and murine pathology (CT). Briefly, tissue samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, decalcified using an Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA)-based decalcifying solution (MicroDec, Diapath) and paraffin embedded. Four-micrometers-thick sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The antigen unmasking technique was performed using Novocastra Epitope Retrieval Solutions pH 6 and pH 9 in a thermostatic bath at 98°C for 30 min. Subsequently, the sections were brought to room temperature and washed in PBS. After neutralization of the endogenous peroxidase with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Fc blocking by a specific protein block (Novocastra, UK), the samples were incubated with the primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were adopted for IHC and IF: NPM (clone 376, dilution 1:100 pH 6, Dako); CD8α (clone D4W2Z, dilution 1:400 pH 9, Cell Signaling); and granzyme B (dilution 1:10 pH 6, Cell Marque). The staining was revealed using IgG (H&amp;L) specific secondary antibody HRP-conjugated (1:500, Novex by Life Technologies) and DAB (3,3<italic>′</italic>-diaminobenzidine, Novocastra) as substrate chromogen. For double-marker immunofluorescence, after antigen retrieval, the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with NPM and CD8α primary antibodies. The binding of the primary antibodies to their respective antigenic substrates was revealed by made-specific secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa-488 (Life Technologies, 1:250) and Alexa-568 (Life Technologies, 1:300) fluorochromes. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4<italic>′</italic>,6-diamidin-2-fenilindolo). Slides were analyzed under an Axioscope A1 microscope equipped with an Axiocam 503 Color digital camera and Zen 2.0 Software (Zeiss). Quantitative IHC data were obtained by calculating the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> or granzyme B+ cells in five nonoverlapping fields at high-power magnification (×400).</p><p>To measure the cell–cell contact between NPMc+ cells (green signal) and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (red signal), we applied the redundant wavelet transform called à trous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sciortino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellavia et al., 2014</xref>) because it preserves the original resolution of the image while allowing the removal of noise. With such a method, the quality of the data was preserved without the need of pre- or postprocessing techniques. The intensity of overlay signal (yellow signal) was then measured only within the significant zones identified automatically and related to their own areas. This approach makes the methodology we developed independent of the zoom factor used to acquire the photomicrographs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Confocal microscopy analysis</title><p>To evaluate NET formation, NPMc relocalization onto the NET threads, and the transfer of MPO and NPMc+ antigens to DC, agar neutrophils from WT and NPMc+ mice were seeded onto poly-<sc>D</sc>-lysine coated glasses (IMDM 2% FCS), allowed to adhere for 30 minutes and added with mDCs (1:1 PMN:DC).

In these experiments we compare the immune microenvironment of mice bearing AML cells either not vaccinated or vaccinated with DC loaded with NPMc+ NET or NPMc-peptides. FASC analysis of flushed BM show that vaccination promotes the activation of CD8 T cells that are proliferating (Ki-67+) and producing TNF and IFNγ.

JEM2003, Bassani et al. Front. Immunology 2021). Nonetheless, we agree with the Reviewer about the potential caveat regarding the hypothetical residual host component, which we did not evaluate by FACS. However we reasoned that using CD45.1 mice as recipients could potentially result in an under-estimation of the effect of the NPMc+ vaccine in case of residual host CD45.1. In this experiment we evaluated the local expansion and distribution of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through histopathological analysis. Unfortunately, we could not perform an additional experiment involving lethal irradiation and BMT because of limitations imposed by the animal experimentation project approval. We hope that this will not preclude a positive evaluation of our research efforts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: NPMc+ NET vaccination prevents transplantable NPMc+ leukemia cell growth and promotes CD8 lysis.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original version of the study, leukemic cells were subcutaneously injected.
