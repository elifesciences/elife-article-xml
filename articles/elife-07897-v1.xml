birth defects caused by T-box3 mutations in humans. Mechanisms whereby T-box3 regulates limb development are poorly understood. We discovered requirements for T-box at multiple stages of mouse limb development and distinct molecular functions in different tissue compartments. Early loss of T-box3 disrupts limb initiation, causing limb defects that phenocopy Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) mutants. Later ablation of T-box3 in posterior limb mesenchyme causes digit loss. In contrast, loss of anterior T-box3 results in preaxial polydactyly, as seen with dysfunction of primary cilia or Gli3-repressor. Remarkably, T-box3 is present in primary cilia where it colocalizes with Gli3. T-box3 interacts with Kif7 and is required for normal stoichiometry and function of a Kif7/Sufu complex that regulates Gli3 stability and processing. Thus, T-box3 controls digit number upstream of Shh-dependent (posterior mesenchyme) and Shh-independent, cilium-based (anterior mesenchyme) Hedgehog pathway function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07897.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07897.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07897.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called T-box3 cause serious birth defects, including deformities of the hands and feet, via poorly understood mechanisms. Several other proteins are also important for ensuring that limbs develop correctly. These include the Sonic Hedgehog protein, which controls a signaling pathway that determines whether a protein called Gli3 is converted into its “repressor” form. The hair-like structures called primary cilia that sit on the surface of animal cells also contain Gli3, and processes within these structures control the production of the Gli3-repressor.</p><p>Emechebe, Kumar et al. have now studied genetically engineered mice in which the production of the T-box3 protein was stopped at different stages of mouse development. This revealed that turning off T-box3 production early in development causes many parts of the limb not to form. This type of defect appears to be the same as that seen in mice that lack the Sonic Hedgehog protein.</p><p>If the production of T-box3 is turned off later in mouse development in the rear portion of the developing limb, the limb starts to develop but doesn’t develop enough rear toes. When T-box3 production is turned off in the front portion of the developing limbs, mice are born with too many front toes. This latter problem mimics the effects seen in mice that are unable to produce Gli3-repressor or that have defective primary cilia.</p><p>Further investigation unexpectedly revealed that T-box3 is found in primary cilia and localizes to the same regions of the cilia as the Gli3-repressor. Furthermore, T-box3 also interacts with a protein complex that controls the stability of Gli3 and processes it into the Gli3-repressor form.</p><p>In the future, it will be important to determine how T-box3 controls the stability of Gli3 and whether that process occurs in the primary cilia or in other parts of the cell where T-box3 and Gli3 coexist, such as the nucleus. This could help us understand how T-box3 and Sonic Hedgehog signaling contribute to other aspects of development and to certain types of cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07897.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07897.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>limb development</kwd><kwd>hedgehog</kwd><kwd>gli3</kwd><kwd>kif7</kwd><kwd>tbx3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcription and splicing factor T-box3 is present in primary cilia, regulates multiple aspects of limb development, and interacts with members of the protein complex required for the stability and processing of the Gli3 transcription factor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>T-box</italic> gene family encodes transcription factors that play critical roles during embryonic development, organogenesis, and tissue homeostasis.

Embryonic lethality of both types of mutants has prevented elucidation of Tbx3’s limb-specific roles.</p><p>The Hedgehog pathway is a key regulator of limb development. Shh signaling in posterior mesenchyme promotes digit development and prevents processing of full length Gli3 (Gli3FL) to its repressor form, Gli3R, which constrains digit number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Litingtung et al., 2002</xref>). The balance of Gli transcriptional activation and repression is critical for proper digit number and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hill et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Litingtung et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">te Welscher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhulyn et al., 2014</xref>).

We discovered a novel molecular function of Tbx3 in the primary cilia where it interacts directly with Kif7 and is in a complex with Gli3. Loss of Tbx3 decreases Kif7-Sufu interactions, resulting in excess Gli3 proteolysis and decreased levels of both Gli3FL and Gli3R.

The observation that Gli3FL is virtually undetectable in <italic>Tbx3;PrxCre</italic> anterior mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A'</xref>) indicates that despite the increased amount of Sufu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), it fails to prevent degradation of Gli3FL in the absence of Tbx3.</p><p>We next tested whether decreased levels of Gli3 proteins in the anterior mesenchyme reflected perturbed interactions between Sufu, Gli3 and Kif7.

The altered levels of protein expression seen in mutant limb buds were recapitulated in whole embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Notably, the interaction between Gli3 and Sufu is reproducibly decreased in excess of the decrement in Gli3 proteins; this is evident by quantitating and comparing the ratio of Gli3 proteins detected in control versus mutant to that complexed with Sufu.

Levels of Gli3R are abnormally low due to a combination of decreased amount of Gli3FL precursor and its processing to Gli3R, and excess degradation.

Because Spop facilitates processing of Gli3FL to Gli3R in the presence of Sufu, increased levels of Spop in mutants drives complete degradation of any Gli3FL not converted to Gli3R, resulting in undetectable levels of Gli3FL in anterior mesenchyme. The decreased levels of Gli3R in the anterior likely result from a combination of decreased levels of Gli3FL precursor, inefficient processing due to altered Kif7/Sufu function, and excess Gli3R degradation, as evident by the lower molecular weight species present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><p>This synthesis is consistent with the large body of published data indicating that anterior digit number is tightly regulated by the balance of Gli3A and Gli3R, in turn controlled by Kif7 and Sufu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhulyn et al., 2014</xref>).

This processing is believed to occur at the basal body/centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ryan and Chiang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wigley et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, our data strongly support that Tbx3 functions at the cilia or basal body, as a part of the complex that regulates Gli3 processing and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ryan and Chiang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Loss of Tbx3 could also influence stability and processing of Gli2. The anterior PPD phenotype of <italic>Gli3</italic> heterozygotes is slightly more severe in a <italic>Gli2</italic> null background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mo et al., 1997</xref>). Gli2 is also expressed in the posterior mesenchyme where it regulates digit patterning but not digit number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowers et al., 2012</xref>). Bowers’ study also demonstrated that the role of Gli activators is in AP patterning of the posterior limb, whereas Gli repressors regulate digit number and anterior limb AP patterning. This is consistent with our findings that Tbx3 affects anterior digit number by regulating Gli3 repressor stability in the anterior mesenchyme.</p><p>The functional significance of increased interaction between Kif7 and Gli3R that we detect in mutants requires additional study nonetheless, since the anterior phenotype of <italic>Tbx3;PrxCre</italic> mutants is one of Gli3R deficiency rather than absence, we conclude that either there is a pool of Gli3R unbound by Kif7 and/or Gli3R complexed with Kif7 still has repressor function.</p><p>In addition to its function as a Gli3R co-repressor, Zic3 also regulates cilia morphogenesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sutherland et al., 2013</xref>). Since decreasing Zic3 levels in <italic>Gli3<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>mutants rescues their preaxial polydactyly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Quinn et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Zic3</italic> overexpression in <italic>Tbx3;PrxCre</italic> mutants may contribute to the PPD phenotype.</p><p>Our data exclude ectopic Shh pathway activity as a cause of the PPD in <italic>Tbx3;PrxCre</italic> mutants: using multiple methods at multiple stages, we did not detect anterior <italic>Shh, Gli1,</italic> or <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression in the anterior mesenchyme. Notably, expression of the BMP antagonist <italic>Grem1</italic> is normally increased in PPD associated with ectopic anterior Shh pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lopez-Rios et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), but in <italic>Tbx3</italic> mutants, <italic>Grem1</italic> expression is markedly decreased.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All referees agreed that the part of the paper describing the phenotype of Tbx3 loss in limb development is solid, and thus the comments concerning this part were relatively minor. However, the referees were much more skeptical about the strength of the experimental support for the most novel and interesting claim, the localization of Tbx3 to the cilia and the interaction of Tbx3 with the Hedgehog pathway components such as KIF7. Both the biochemical and subcellular localization experiments would need to be very significantly extended (for example, by using tagged proteins for immunoprecipitation assays), and more thorough controls for these experiments would need to be included. Also the strength and the value of the RNA-seq data presented in the paper were questioned, and these data thus need to be improved. Taken together, it appears that very significant additional work will be necessary to make the story convincing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper describes the role of Tbx3 in limb development and connects this function to cilia-dependent regulation of the Hedgehog pathway. The authors use conditional ablation of Tbx3 to characterize in detail its role in limb formation. The authors also show that Tbx3 localizes to cilia, interacts with Gli3 and Kif7 and affects the formation of protein complexes involved in Hedgehog signaling.</p><p>I think that the paper is interesting and potentially suitable for publication in e<italic>Life</italic>. However, while the phenotypic description of Tbx3 loss appears solid to me, the part describing the biochemical interactions and ciliary localization of Tbx3 misses important controls and is therefore less convincing.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: it is very surprising that Tbx3 precipitates with equal efficiency with Tbx3 and Kif7 antibodies. Anti-Kif7 blot must be included here to show the efficiency of Kif7 immunoprecipitation. In the legend, the% of input loaded must be indicated, so that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation can be estimated.</p><p>A similar comment applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>. A Tbx3 blot must be included in this panel, as well as the input lanes, so that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation can be estimated. The loading of IgG in the control lane seems to be lower than in the two other lanes, which makes the value of this control doubtful. It would be preferable, instead of IgG, to use as a negative control antibodies against another protein, which does not bind to Gli3 or Tbx3.</p><p>Similar comments also apply to the blots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, G</xref> and H. Arl13 blot should be shown in panel E, Kif7 blot in panel G and Sufu blot in panel H. Are the cut blots in panel E (including input lanes) derived from the same or different gels and do they show the same exposures? The observed differences in immunoprecipitation efficiency are not convincing and therefore need to be quantified using three independent experiments for all data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>2) Are there any indications that the interactions of Tbx3 with Kif7 and Gli3 might be direct? For example, do these proteins co-immunoprecipitate when overexpressed in cultured cells?</p><p>3) The specificity of the Tbx3 staining in cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) must be confirmed using Tbx3 knockout cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an extensive body of work using a range of genetic tools and molecular approaches to tease apart the function(s) of Tbx3 in the limb.</p><p>The first part of the paper describes an analysis of the phenotypes produced following conditional deletion of Tbx3 at different times and places during limb development using a variety of cre lines. I have relatively minor comments on this.</p><p>The second, and main part of the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) covers all the work from which the title of the manuscript derive. I have several concerns here and in general remain skeptical (but with an open mind) about the data and particularly the interpretation.</p><p>In many instances I feel the authors have gone too far in their conclusions without the necessary experimental data to support the <italic>final</italic> conclusions.</p><p>First and foremost, immunostaining for Tbx3 and Arl13b on limb sections is interpreted as showing Tbx3 in limb mesenchymal cilia. Immunostaining of Tbx3 is throughout the entire cell and apparent co-expresssion with Arl13b could simply be explained by overlap in stain. Much higher resolution microscopy imaging that can circumvent these potential artifacts is required. The staining on MEFS do not clarify the issue. It is not clear why the Tbx3 staining pattern is so different in these cells from that shown in A-C. (Other issues such as the legend for panels H-K states 25/33 cilia were Tbx3+. I do not see more than 20 cells or so in this panel further compounding the problem) (It can also be argued that any patterns identified in MEFs may not have relevance to the limb.)</p><p>I also could not see a clear effect on KIf7 localization form the panels C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Table E appears to be an extreme way to show an apparent 8% difference on cilia length (I could not see where these numbers came from). This section ends with the conclusion that the data show that Tbx3 is present at baseline in cilia and is trafficked to and within cilia in response to hedgehog signaling. Unfortunately, I remain unconvinced of any of this.</p><p>There are similar issues with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Fundamentally I don't see clear evidence of co-expression of Tbx3, Gli3 Arl13b although I appreciate that IP data is also included.</p><p>The data on effect on GLi3 stability are potentially interesting but perplexing</p><p>What is the effect on Gli3 expression in the mutant limbs? It might be expected following reduction of hand2 and Shh expression in the mutant that Gli3 expression would be expanded but the western data would suggest not. Is there more GLi3FLin the MP? It is perhaps surprising that apparently equivalent levels of Gli3R are present in CP and MP.</p><p>The Tbx3 cKO is close (but I would not say identical to or a phenocopy of) a Het <italic>Gli3</italic> mutant. This is not conveyed in the final schematic which suggests a critical role of Tbx3 in Gli processing and that this in its absence <italic>all</italic> Gli processing is affected. I would expect a more profound polydactyly if this were the case. The actual 'polydactyly that presents lacks a structure that could be considered a true digit (1H, H').</p><p>A further question raised is that if Tbx3 is playing such a critical role in Gli processing/Shh signalling in the anterior is it or why is it not playing a similar role in the posterior.

In the text the authors conclude that this &quot;reveals a role for Tbx3 in later aspects of Indian hedgehog regulated bone morphogenesis.” This has not been investigated to any extent and this type of comments goes far beyond what is actually shown in this paper.

Most of the conclusions based on whole mount RNA in situs are convincing and new findings. The most novel and surprising finding of the study is that the transcription factor TBX3 is localized to the cilium and interacts with KIF7. HOX proteins have been shown to interact with and inhibit GLI3 in the limb, however cilium localization was not explored. Given that the vast majority of TBX3 protein is in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), it seems surprising to me that the tiny amount in the cilium can be detected with IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-H</xref>). The interaction with GLI3 could be in the nucleus and/or cilium, but KIF7 should not be in the nucleus. To further bolster the most significant claim of the paper, I think that additional experiments are needed. In particular, the specificity of the antibodies must be proven (e.g. using Tbx2 mutant MEFs for the Tbx3 antibody) and ideally some results confirmed using tagged proteins. Tagged GLI3 is available and other proteins could be easily generated. A genetic test would be to determine whether heterozygosity for Kif7 in mice (or knockdown in cells) rescues the defect proposed to be due to increased KIF7. In addition, many of the claims of changes in gene expression based on the RNA-seq data in Tables 2 and 3 do not seem to be significant differences, and some are opposite to what is said in the Results. Thus, the value of the RNA-seq data, is not clear, especially as only two samples were analyzed for each genotype, although I appreciate it is a difficult experiment. Many of the additional points listed below are simple changes that would make the paper more accessible and data more convincing.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>': The mutant limb looks smaller than the control limb in (A), therefore the domain is expected to be smaller.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There are some remaining concerns about the quality of the biochemical data. Specifically, the composition and the order of loading of the lanes is not the same in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>, creating the impression that the shown immunoprecipitations are not from the same experiment. Gli3 and KIF7 blots should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. Most importantly, error bars should be included in the plots showing the quantification of immunoprecipitation results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in order to illustrate that the experiment was performed more than once and the observed differences are significant.</p><p>2) Better discussion should be included to explain why the authors insist that TBX3 does not regulate GLI3 function in the posterior limb, and why they have ignored the highly related protein GLI2. If their hypothesis is correct, one would expect the same might be true for GLI2 since it also binds SuFu and requires cilia for proper processing. Also, if whole embryos reveal the same protein interactions as the anterior limb, why would the posterior limb be different? Gli2/3 double limb mutants could well have a worse posterior limb phenotype than Gli3 null or het mutants. Only a relatively late double conditional mutant of Gli2/3 has been published, and it indicated the posterior phenotype is worse than in single Gli3 mutants. Thus, some of the posterior phenotype in Tbx3 mutants could be due to the altered GLI processing and activity in this tissue, rather than just the decreased Shh expression, especially as Shh heterozygous mutants have normal limbs. Finally, it seems to be an over-interpretation of the data to say that the posterior limb is not dependent on cilia. In cilia mutants’ production of both activators and repressors is altered (diminished), but obvious phenotypes are only seen where the balance is greatly skewed. It would be nice to extend the Discussion of your paper to address these points.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;T-box 3 is a Ciliary Protein and Regulates Gli3 Stability to Control Digit Number&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The polysyndactylous digit of Tbx3;PrxCre mutants has two phalanges, the primary criteria for digit 1 (thumb) identity. Even in our mutants, although the penetrance is 100%, the severity of the duplication varies. <italic>Tbx3;PrxCre</italic> mutants are Gli3 deficient and not completely lacking Gli3R, thus PPD is the observed (and expected) phenotype. In the Discussion we consider other molecular events occurring in these mutants that may contribute to the phenotype, including overexpression of Zic3.</p><p>Our schematic model shows that in the anterior mesenchyme, some Gli3FL remains complexed with Sufu, but most is processed to Gli3R (which is also the case in controls); some of this Gli3R is aberrantly degraded which is what our data show. Our model does <italic>not</italic> indicate that all Gli3 processing is affected. The very low levels of Gli3FL detectable in the mutants are consistent with excess degradation of Gli3FL.</p><p><italic>A further question raised is that if Tbx3 is playing such a critical role in Gli processing/Shh signalling in the anterior is it or why is it not playing a similar role in the posterior. This is not discussed and does not appear to have been studied.</italic> </p><p>With due respect to the reviewer, this is not discussed because, unlike other regions of the embryo, Shh signaling in the posterior limb mesenchyme is not dependent on cilia or Gli3R. Mouse mutants of Kif7 and ciliary components have anterior PPD; posterior digits are apparently normal. Our data indicate that Tbx3 regulates ligand-dependent Shh signaling in the posterior mesenchyme by affecting the level of <italic>Hand2</italic> expression upstream of <italic>Shh</italic> and its downstream activator functions. In the anterior, we show strong evidence that Tbx3 regulates ligand-independent pathway function by controlling the stability and processing of Gli3. Gli3 processing requires Kif7, Sufu and intact cilia. Although the interactions and processing may not occur within the cilia proper; the literature supports that they occur in the cytoplasm or centrosome/basal body adjacent to the cilia (reviewed in Ryan and Chiang 2012; Ingham and McMahon 2009; and Wang et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2010, Humke et al., 2005; Tukachinsky et al., 2010).</p><p>As the reviewers are aware, the cellular compartments in which different functionally relevant interactions are occurring is an ongoing and highly controversial area in the field for all components of the pathway. Elegant work has been done with tagged proteins and overexpression systems. Despite this, these issues have not yet been resolved, especially for endogenous interactions and functions of Kif7, Sufu or Gli3. What is clear is that even if the functionally relevant interactions are occurring in the cytoplasm adjacent to (or even far) from cilia, processing of Gli3 to Gli3R requires the cilia.</p><p> <italic>Some other minor issues from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> include:</italic></p><p> <italic>1L: I do not see any loss of Sox9 activity in the region indicated with the red arrow head.

Most of the conclusions based on whole mount RNA in situs are convincing and new findings. The most novel and surprising finding of the study is that the transcription factor TBX3 is localized to the cilium and interacts with KIF7. HOX proteins have been shown to interact with and inhibit GLI3 in the limb, however cilium localization was not explored. Given that the vast majority of TBX3 protein is in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), it seems surprising to me that the tiny amount in the cilium can be detected with IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-H</xref>).

As discussed above, dissecting the cellular compartments in which different functionally relevant interactions has been a major, unsolved challenge in the field. What is clear is that processing of Gli3 to Gli3R requires the cilia.

In general, control embryos have ~ 1.6 fold more Gli3R than <italic>Tbx3<sup>△fl/</sup><sup>△fl</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, A’</xref> lanes 1-4, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). However, the ratio of Gli3R interacting with Sufu in controls ranges from 4.3 to 9.5 fold higher than in mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>’). The interaction with Gli3FL is harder to assess reliably/quantitatively because of variable transfer efficiency due to high molecular weight. In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, the ratio of Gli3FL in controls to mutants is 1.6-1.7, while the ratio of that IPd with Sufu is 4.6 fold greater in controls.

However, band intensity ratios, which are currently presented per experiment, should be easy to combine and average between two or more experiments/samples, generating error bars. The authors should also label these plots appropriately (for example, instead of &quot;ratio wt to mutant, lanes 1:2&quot; use a label &quot;Gli3FL, anti-Gli3-IP, ratio wt to mutant&quot;, etc.).

We have remedied this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p> <italic>2) Better discussion should be included to explain why the authors insist that TBX3 does not regulate GLI3 function in the posterior limb, and why they have ignored the highly related protein GLI2. If their hypothesis is correct, one would expect the same might be true for GLI2 since it also binds SuFu and requires cilia for proper processing. Also, if whole embryos reveal the same protein interactions as the anterior limb, why would the posterior limb be different? Gli2/3 double limb mutants could well have a worse posterior limb phenotype than Gli3 null or het mutants. Only a relatively late double conditional mutant of Gli2/3 has been published, and it indicated the posterior phenotype is worse than in single Gli3 mutants. Thus, some of the posterior phenotype in Tbx3 mutants could be due to the altered GLI processing and activity in this tissue, rather than just the decreased Shh expression, especially as Shh heterozygous mutants have normal limbs.</italic> </p><p>We agree, and have considered and investigated this further. While <italic>ShH<sup>+</sup></italic>/- mutants do not have an abnormal digit phenotype, and they have half as much <italic>Shh</italic> mRNA in their limb buds, the amount of protein is normal (Brian Harfe, personal communication/manuscript in revision) revealing a compensatory mechanism at the translational or post-translational level. Sanz-Ezquerro and Tickle (2000) proposed a compensatory, buffering system to stabilize polarizing activity in chick limb stating: “A buffering system can account for several regulative features of polarising region signalling. It can explain why limbs with normal patterns develop after application of extra Shh polarising region cells (Tickle et al., 1975), Shh expressing cells (Riddle et al., 1993) or Shh beads (Yang et al.,1997) to the posterior margin of chick buds, and why normal patterned limbs also develop after most, but not all, of the polarising region is removed (Fallon and Crosby, 1975; Pagan et al., 1996).”</p><p>Additionally, the <italic>ShH<sup>+</sup></italic>/- genotype is sensitized to other mutations. For example, Zeller’s lab showed that rescued digits in Grem1-/-;Bmp4+/- are more sensitive to reduced Shh level (Benazet et al., 2009) and Hui's lab showed that Irx3/5 KO (excess HH activity) is improved by Shh dosage reduction. In addition, the Wnt7a mutant (Parr and McMahon, 1995), which affects Shh activation, has loss of digit 5. Mackem’s group re-evaluated the Wnt7a mutant (Zhu and Mackem, 2009), and found delayed onset and decreased level of <italic>Shh</italic> expression – which is consistent with our results.</p><p>In consideration of this information and to address the reviewers’suggestions, we have modified the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and added the following paragraphs to the relevant sections of the Discussion.</p><p>For the section discussing posterior phenotype and mechanisms:</p><p>“Digit 5 formation is exquisitely sensitive to Shh activity and Grem1 (Harfe et al., 2004; Scherz et al., 2007; Zhu and Mackem, 2011; Zhu et al., 2008), so the altered expression of these genes in posterior mutant mesenchyme helps explain loss of this digit. […] Nonetheless, it is possible that decreased Shh signaling in the posterior of <italic>Tbx3;PrxCre</italic> mutant limb buds creates changes in Gli3 levels/ratios below our ability to detect. If so, decreased Shh activity would be predicted to increase Gli3R, decreasing digit number.”</p><p>For the section discussing anterior phenotype and mechanisms we have added:</p><p>“Loss of Tbx3 could also influence stability and processing of Gli2. The anterior PPD phenotype of <italic>Gli3</italic> heterozygotes is slightly more severe in a <italic>Gli2</italic> null background (Bowers et al., 2012; Mo et al., 1997). […] This is consistent with our findings that Tbx3 affects anterior digit number by regulating Gli3 repressor stability in the anterior mesenchyme.”</p><p><italic>Finally, it seems to be an over-interpretation of the data to say that the posterior limb is not dependent on cilia. In cilia mutants’ production of both activators and repressors is altered (diminished), but obvious phenotypes are only seen where the balance is greatly skewed. It would be nice to extend the Discussion of your paper to address these points.</italic></p><p>We agree; in the manuscript, we discuss what is known with regard to ciliary function and limb phenotypes but do not exclude the possibility of posterior functions yet to be determined.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: 1) The scan of the Western blot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> is not publication quality.

We are open to suggestions if the title is still not satisfactory.</p><p>We have revised the Abstract as requested to include additional reference to Gli3 as a transcriptional effector in the Hedgehog pathway:</p><p>“Crucial roles for T-box3 in development are evident by severe limb malformations and other birth defects caused by T-box3 mutations in humans. […] Remarkably, T-box3 is present in primary cilia where it colocalizes with Gli3. T-box3 interacts with Kif7 and is required for normal stoichiometry and function of a Kif7/Sufu complex that regulates Gli3 stability and processing. Thus T-box3 controls digit number upstream of Shh-dependent (posterior mesenchyme) and Shh-independent, cilium-based (anterior mesenchyme) Hedgehog pathway function.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
