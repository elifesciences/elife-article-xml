While this ensures efficient use of resources to clear parasites, the underlying cause of the individual’s fever remains unknown due to potential coinfection with a non-malarial febrile illness. Widespread use of RDTs does not necessarily prevent over-estimation of clinical malaria cases or sub-optimal case management of febrile patients. We present a new approach that allows inference of the spatiotemporal prevalence of both <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria-attributable and non-malarial fever in sub-Saharan African children from 2006 to 2014. We estimate that 35.7% of all self-reported fevers were accompanied by a malaria infection in 2014, but that only 28.0% of those (10.0% of all fevers) were causally attributable to malaria. Most fevers among malaria-positive children are therefore caused by non-malaria illnesses. This refined understanding can help improve interpretation of the burden of febrile illness and shape policy on fever case management.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd><kwd>fever</kwd><kwd>non-malarial febrile illness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Training Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dalrymple</surname><given-names>Ursula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H5R00640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cameron</surname><given-names>Ewan</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhatt</surname><given-names>Samir</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Gething</surname><given-names>Peter W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H5R00690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cameron</surname><given-names>Ewan</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhatt</surname><given-names>Samir</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Gething</surname><given-names>Peter W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fevers amongst African children are often assumed to be caused by a malaria infection, but here it is estimated that the majority of fevers amongst African children, including those with a patent malaria infection, are due to infections with diseases other than malaria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Following new case management guidelines issued by the World Health Organization in 2010, individuals presenting with fever at a health clinic in sub-Saharan Africa have an increased chance of receiving a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) prior to receiving antimalarial treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>). This reduces the over-prescription of antimalarial drugs to uninfected patients while ensuring patent infections are identified and the parasites cleared through treatment. However, in highly endemic areas, malaria infections are both common and frequently asymptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bousema et al., 2014</xref>), meaning that for many patients presenting at health care facilities, their fever and parasitaemia are not causally related.</p><p>Ambiguity around causality in RDT-positive fever cases is problematic from both the disease surveillance and health system perspectives. Routine case surveillance systems generally report the incidence of clinical malaria based on counts of febrile individuals with a presumed or confirmed malaria infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>). If the malaria infections in many of these cases are in fact asymptomatic then the resulting case reports will over-represent clinical malaria, even where RDT testing is ubiquitous, leading to an overestimation of morbidity due to malaria. Conversely, fevers caused by another pathogen but coincident with a malaria infection will suffer a systematic under-reporting under this protocol and consequently the disease burden of non-malarial febrile illness (NMFI) will be underestimated. In instances where a febrile individual has both a malaria infection and a NMFI, both infections can simultaneously be the cause of the fever. Indeed co-infections have been known to modulate both the parasite load of both diseases and the severity of the individual’s fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">French et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hartgers and Yazdanbakhsh, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Diagnosing and treating NMFI is challenging as symptoms of many of these diseases can be non-specific and similar to malaria, for example bacterial infections such as pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hildenwall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Källander et al., 2004</xref>) and meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gwer et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, routine diagnostic tests have not yet been developed or are not commonplace for many of these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chappuis et al., 2013</xref>). From the health systems perspective, case management may be inadequate if individuals who receive a positive RDT result but have a co-infection with another pathogen do not receive effective treatment for their fever. For these reasons, there is a pressing need to understand the contribution of malaria to febrile illness and how this varies spatially and temporally across endemic Africa.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Estimating malaria-attributable fever prevalence</title><p>The rate of fever associated with (but not necessarily caused by) a malaria infection has been shown to have declined over time in some settings, halving between 1986 and 2007 in one collation of field studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Acremont et al., 2010</xref>); a trend likely driven by the declining prevalence of malaria over the latter portion of that time period. Estimating the fraction of these fevers in which the malaria infection is the causal pathogen (i.e. the malaria-attributable fraction) is challenging, and various methods have been developed. Attempts have been made to measure the malaria-attributable fraction arithmetically using case-control trials, where the difference in the rate of malaria positivity in febrile and afebrile individuals is used to calculate the attributable fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrhardt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schellenberg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 1994</xref>). Alternatively, logistic regression approaches have been developed to estimate causal fractions based on measurements of blood parasite density. This approach has been demonstrated in numerous field trials, including various settings in Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afrane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloland et al., 1999</xref>), in an area of seasonal transmission in Burkina Faso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisoffi et al., 2010</xref>), and in a national survey in Mozambique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mabunda et al., 2009</xref>). Computational simulations of malaria transmission can also be adapted to estimate an upper bound on the malaria-attributable fraction of fevers at varying levels of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> prevalence (<italic>Pf</italic>PR), by monitoring the proportion of parasite-positive individuals within a simulation with a symptomatic infection (here, a symptomatic infection is synonymous with a malaria attributable fever, as co-infections with other pathogens are not typically simulated) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ross et al., 2006</xref>). None of these approaches make use of the rich trove of national household survey data recording malaria infection status as well as fever history that are now available for multiple countries and years from sources such as the DHS Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DHS Program, 2017</xref>) and the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">UNICEF, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Using household survey data to model malaria-attributable fever and non-malarial febrile illness</title><p>Household survey data on malaria infection status and two-week fever history do not allow direct attribution of malaria causality at the individual level. However, when data from multiple individuals are combined, then the causal contribution of malaria infections to fevers within the group can be explored by measuring the extent to which fevers are more common in infected versus uninfected individuals. Building on this intuitive logic, we have developed a multinomial geospatial model (described in detail in Materials and methods) that uses the georeferenced survey data on individual-level malaria infection and fever status to infer the community-level fraction of malaria positive fevers that are either caused by or coincident with underlying malaria infections, and subsequently to map these quantities across sub-Saharan Africa. This refined understanding of the contribution of malaria versus other causes to febrile illness can improve disease burden estimation and interpretation and thus inform case management policy in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Model overview</title><p>Using a total of 38 household surveys in 24 Saharan African countries collected between 2006 and 2014, we collated 155,369 observations of two-week fever prevalence and RDT diagnostic outcome for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in children from 10,606 locations with two modelled predictor variables: <italic>P. falciparum</italic> prevalence in children under five years of age (<italic>Pf</italic>PR<sub>0-5</sub>); and suitability for fever without a malaria infection.

The majority of febrile illness in Africa is caused by pathogens other than <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria, even in areas where malaria is highly endemic, and the proportion of all fevers caused by NMFI has risen since 2006. We estimate here that over a typical two-week period in 2014 one in four children under five years old residing in the limits of stable malaria transmission will suffer a fever not caused by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria, whereas only one in every 32 children will suffer a fever directly caused by <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. We show that current estimations of malaria burden in Africa based on RDT-positive cases of fever may be overestimating the burden by up to two-thirds, and the level of overestimation is likely to be highly heterogeneous between different countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For example, countries such as Niger, Gabon and Nigeria, where fewer than 21% of malaria-positive fever cases are causally attributable to malaria, may be substantially overestimating the morbidity caused by malaria (and systematically underestimating the burden of other diseases that may be co-infecting and causal). Additionally, these results have implications for the effectiveness of treatment received at point of care, as a substantial proportion of RDT-positive fevers are likely to be coincident with and caused by a NMFI. Our estimations of MAF prevalence in the past two weeks are comparable to estimations of clinical incidence from an ensemble of transmission models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cameron et al., 2015</xref>) although our estimates match more closely to transmission model estimations of the prevalence of febrile illness lasting the duration of the past two-to-four weeks, rather than the past zero-to-two. For 13 of the 38 household surveys used in this analysis, the number of days since the onset of the child’s fever was available. Children in these surveys had a fever for on average 5.38 days (±3.85 days) prior to the interview. This disparity between fever duration in our estimates and transmission model estimates can perhaps be explained by the cross-sectional nature of the surveys; the transmission models estimate the full course of the fever without treatment, whereas the household surveys aim to curtail the fever at the interview by administering appropriate medication to febrile children.</p><p>The total number of fever cases accompanied by an RDT-patent <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection declined substantially over the study period (from 48.5% in 2006 to 35.7% in 2014), linked with declining <italic>Pf</italic>PR<sub>0-5</sub> over the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). The only country with a noteworthy increase in malaria-positive fevers over the study period was Gabon, which also experienced an increase in <italic>Pf</italic>PR<sub>0-5</sub> between 2006 and 2014.</p><p>This modelling approach makes use of household survey datasets in a novel way; no previous attempts have been made to measure childhood fever prevalence (and the malaria/non-malaria causality of the fever) from surveys recording two-week fever history. This approach has some drawbacks: it relies on two-week recall of fever from the child’s caregiver, the accuracy of which can be subject to biases such as (i) length of time since the fever; (ii) the child’s frequency of febrile episodes, (iii) the economic status of the family, and (iv) even the child’s sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Das et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rockers and McConnell, 2017</xref>). We also include fever caused by <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria as a NMFI by definition, as not all household surveys tested for <italic>P. vivax</italic> with RDT and thus only <italic>P. falciparum</italic> outcomes were used in this analysis. This is unlikely to have a major effect on most of Africa due to high Duffy negativity resulting in unstable <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission, and very low levels of stable transmission in Madagascar and the horn of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gething et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howes et al., 2011</xref>). One drawback of using household survey data to generate predictions such as those presented here is that the survey data interviews children on one day within the time frame that the survey is conducted (typically two to four months). It is not necessarily the case that children who present a patent malaria infection but no history of infection over two weeks prior to their survey date have never, or will never, develop a malaria-attributable fever, and may have already done so outside of the two-week recall period of the survey interview. Additionally, co-infections may lead to a fever that would not have occurred had the child only had a monoinfection with malaria or the NMFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">French et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hartgers and Yazdanbakhsh, 2006</xref>).This study does not consider the effects of co-morbidity in this sense, and fevers that fall into this category are accounted for within NMFI. We also incorporate no predictor variables at resolutions below the pixel-level (e.g. individual or household level), which are likely to be significantly predictive of both MAF and NMFI prevalence. Predictors such as household wealth and other associated health indicators are available within the household survey datasets, but owing to the heterogeneity of individual level variables measured in different surveys and the lack of a common set of information directly representative of those variables outside of surveyed countries, we have not incorporated them in the current model.</p><p>The low prevalence of malaria-positive fevers at all levels of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> endemicity suggests that passive case detection alone may not be enough to halt transmission of malaria, as many infected children are afebrile at any one time (regardless of whether their fever is attributable to the malaria infection or not). Further, this study estimates MAF prevalence in children less than two years of age, and between two and four years of age. We find that the relationship between MAF prevalence and <italic>Pf</italic>PR is not equivalent across all age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), with children under two years of age having a higher probability of developing a malaria-attributable fever than children older than two in areas where <italic>Pf</italic>PR<sub>0-5</sub> is greater than 30%. For older children living in high <italic>Pf</italic>PR locations, a higher proportion of the population will have acquired immunity to malaria infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doolan et al., 2009</xref>), and therefore may be less likely to present with a malaria-attributable fever. Although there is uncertainty over how long malaria immunity lasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Filipe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wipasa et al., 2010</xref>), in areas of rapid decline of malaria prevalence that are now moving towards elimination, this residual acquired immunity may present problems for elimination if programs rely on passive case detection and treatment to halt transmission. Again, the limitation of our estimates which use a two-week window for reporting of symptoms means that, in order to assert with confidence that passive case detection would be insufficient to halt transmission, evidence for a high prevalence of never-symptomatic infections would also be necessary.</p><p>Despite all malaria-endemic countries now adopting the official policy of parasite-based diagnosis of suspected malaria cases before issuing antimalarials, a large number of suspected malaria cases still do not receive a diagnostic test before treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hertz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>). This proportion has decreased over the time period of this study, from 64% of suspected cases not receiving a diagnostic test in 2005 to only 35% in 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>). The reasons for this high proportion of suspected cases not receiving parasite-based diagnosis lies predominantly in resource limitation in rural health clinics in malaria endemic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghai et al., 2016</xref>). This remaining proportion of NMFI that is assumed to be caused by malaria, and thus treated with an antimalarial, exacerbates the problem of over-prescription of antimalarials. By enumerating the proportion of NMFI, this study provides evidence of the on-going need to test febrile individuals for parasitaemia, but can also be used identify different geographic and malaria-burden settings where administering antimalarials in the absence of a positive test for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is least warranted.</p><p>This suite of maps demonstrates the need for better diagnostic tests for other pathogens causing NMFI in Africa, which will in turn lead to a better understanding of the range of diseases that make up the non-malarial fraction of all-cause fever prevalence. Whilst the spatial distribution of pathogens that cause NMFI is largely unknown, occurrence data for these diseases are becoming more widely available, particularly in the context of identifying diseases with similar symptomatic presentations as malaria. The Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) now collects clinical evidence of non-malarial febrile illness (NMFI) caused by neglected tropical diseases from peer-reviewed case studies of fever diagnoses from across the malaria-endemic world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network, 2017</xref>). The collation of these studies is designed to give an overview of the presence of fever-causing pathogens in areas of overlapping endemicity with malaria, but cannot presently be used to quantify the spatiotemporal distribution of NMFI, nor can it be used to measure the individual contribution of each disease as an underlying cause of febrile illness. For example, a major review of 146 case studies in the Mekong region of Southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acestor et al., 2012</xref>), showed that misdiagnosis and mistreatment of the fever was a common outcome for individuals who were co-infected with malaria and other diseases with overlapping symptoms (e.g., Dengue fever virus, <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic> and <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species). In addition to implicating potential overestimation of the burden of malaria in the past, the results of this study suggest that current WHO guidelines for integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) is currently suboptimal for the treatment of non-malarial fever. Whilst treating positive malaria infections is the correct strategy for slowing malaria transmission, removing the malaria-attributable fevers from the population, and reducing the reservoir of infected individuals that perpetuate transmission; current procedures may lead to systematic mismanagement of NMFI. This study shows the need for increased efforts to develop and distribute routine diagnostics for NMFI-causing pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Household survey data</title><p>Thirty-eight cross sectional, nationally-representative georeferenced surveys of malaria prevalence in children less than five years of age across 24 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were obtained from the Malaria Atlas Project database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guerra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malaria Atlas Project , 2017</xref>).

The BRT approach generates a flexible regression model in two steps. Initially, response data are split recursively by predictor variables, where predictor variables that maximise the partitioned response data’s homogeneity are selected more frequently in subsequent steps. This is followed by a ‘boosting’ step, where the regression tree models are combined to reduce the model’s overall predictive deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elith et al., 2008</xref>), and at each iterative step cross-validated against a randomly held-out subset to avoid overfitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Firstly, a training dataset was constructed, consisting of a subset of the household survey dataset where survey cells with ten or fewer tested individuals were removed in order to increase the reliability of observed prevalence values. This procedure reduced the final number of data points in the training dataset to 5320. Background fever prevalence was obtained at each data point through aggregation of individuals with a fever in the previous two weeks without a patent malaria infection.</p><p>A large suite of potential environmental and socio-demographic covariates was assembled, as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, 5 × 5 km resolution surfaces across the African continent of different environmental and sociodemographic covariate types—elevation, land cover, population density, precipitation, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), land surface temperature (LST), <italic>P. falciparum</italic> temperature suitability index (TSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weiss et al., 2014</xref>), tasselled cap wetness (TCW), tasselled cap brightness (TCB), nighttime lights, Global Urban Footprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esch et al., 2012</xref>), and national-level World Bank indicators of poverty and healthcare quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">World Bank, 2017</xref>)—were obtained from the Malaria Atlas Project database and leveraged by constructing pixel-level spatial summaries (maximum, mean, minimum, standard deviation and range). These summarisations produced a total of 986 spatially- and temporally-contemporaneous covariates from which we extracted results for each of the 5320 georeferenced response data points.</p><p>To reduce the number of covariates an exploratory BRT model was constructed using background fever prevalence as the response variable and the covariates as predictor variables using the 'gbm.step' function in the 'dismo' package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elith et al., 2008</xref>). The BRT model was parameterised with a tree complexity of 5, a learning rate of 0·05, a hold-out fraction of 0·05 and an error structure within the family 'gaussian' after a suitable inverse-sigmoid transform of the observed background fever prevalences. Each of the 986 covariates was ranked by their contributions to the fitted exploratory model. To reduce redundancy, each variable within the assembled suite of covariates was tested for collinearity with every other variable. Covariates were considered collinear if a correlation of greater than 0.7 existed between the two covariates, and when collinearity was identified only higher-ranked covariate was retained. This approach left a final dataset of 174 predictor variables for each of the 5320 response data points.</p><p>The final model, using the reduced set of 174 non-collinear predictor variables, was fitted with 2000 trees, a tree complexity of 5, and a reduced learning rate of 0.01 (reducing the learning rate improves model performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elith et al., 2008</xref>]). A list of the 174 predictor variables and each variable’s contribution to the final model used can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. Predictions for the environmental suitability for background fever amongst children under five years old for each month between January 2006 and December 2014 across the area of stable malaria transmission in Africa were generated using the fitted BRT model and the 174 predictor variables. For a number of predictor variables, data were unavailable in November and December 2014, so data from the same month in the previous year were used instead. Yearly predictions for 2006–2014 were generated as a mean of each monthly prediction for use in the multinomial model. Gaps in the resulting predicted layers, caused by small gaps in the remotely-sensed covariate layers, were filled by recursively scanning through each raster cell by cell, and filling in cells with no data with the mean of the first layer of surrounding cells until no gaps remained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Multinomial model</title><p>A training dataset for the multinomial model was constructed from all 10,606 points in the household survey dataset.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Quantifying the contribution of malaria versus other causes to febrile illness amongst African children&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Prabhat Jha (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Mark Jit, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Eisele.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We agree that while the manuscript is not acceptable in its current state, we believe that it has potential and would like to see a version with major revisions.</p><p>In particular, the reviewers and I agreed that you took an interesting approach to an important public health question, using a large, rich dataset. However we felt that there were methodological shortcomings in the model (or at least in the current description of it) that needed to be addressed. The main issues that need to be addressed are listed below.</p><p>1) Model validation</p><p>Although it is mentioned that the fever model has been validated (subsection “Model overview”), it is not clear how this was actually done. Part of the problem is that you have not presented any of the original data on fevers and malaria prevalence. This makes it impossible to tell the goodness of fit.</p><p>Given that <italic>eLife</italic> has no space or figure restrictions, the following data plots would ideally be shown:</p><p>- The raw 2x2 table showing all fevers versus RDT positivity (data and predictions), which is really interesting and is key to the message of the paper. This should also be plotted by country and transmission intensity.</p><p>- Model-predicted vs. observed all cause fever by pixel or by country. A fairly small subset of the available DHS and MICS surveys are used, presumably because the rest do not have any data on RDT positivity (and/or GPS?). However these other surveys do contain data on all-cause fever and therefore would be an excellent source of validation data for this aspect of the model.</p><p>- A plot of the final fitted relationship between fever prevalence, parasite prevalence and the malaria-attributable fraction (and data on the 1st two variables)</p><p>- Comparison with observed vs. predicted fever prevalence. These data are not presented, and one of the reviewers who checked could not reconcile some of their predictions with the available data online. E.g. Results subsection “Prevalence of all-cause fever”: fever prevalence in Liberia is quoted as 51.7% in 2014, but on the DHS survey website only a Liberia survey in 2013, which gave fever prevalence as 28.6%. Similarly the most recent data from Niger (DHS 2012) shows a fever prevalence of 14.2%, but the quoted value by the authors is 57.2%. Please could you check and explain the reasons for any discrepancies.</p><p>- Related to those countries with the highest and lowest prevalence of fever (subsection “Prevalence of all-cause fever”): predicted values are given for Eritrea, Niger, Botswana and Zimbabwe. But in the supplementary data table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), the list of surveys does not include any data from any of these countries. Is this correct, or is the data list incomplete? If correct it seems concerning that the least certain estimates produce the outlying predictions. This should warrant some reinvestigation of the model fit. We suggest at least comparing the predictions against available fever prevalence estimates, even if not coupled with RDT data (as mentioned above).</p><p>More generally, external validation should be performed by comparing model results to datasets not used to parameterise it. For instance you mention that case-control studies, transmission models etc. have been used to estimate the attributable fraction of malaria in fever – it would be useful to compare the model results with these studies.</p><p>For transparency and to comply with <italic>eLife</italic> policy for mathematical models, you should provide the initial and final set of model equations (including coefficients) and the code used to select the final model, either in Supplementary Materials or in a suitable online repository such as github. Major data sets used that are not already in the public domain should also be provided unless there are compelling scientific or ethical reasons not to.</p><p>2) Extending the model beyond environmental variables</p><p>Although in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Covariates” it mentions that socio-demographic predictors of fever were considered, all the examples in the paragraph and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> are environmental. This seems like quite a large omission, especially given that fever is self-reported. As well as many varied causes of fever, cultural perceptions of fever are important here (and language, e.g. some languages do not have a specific word for fever). We were not clear how well environmental variables could be expected to predict this, especially given that you are extending fever predictions into countries for which there are no data.</p><p>Besides cultural factors, a list of suitable covariates may include socioeconomic factors such as nutrition, crowding, mother's education, access to clean water etc. Many of these are available in DHS/MICS data but it is difficult to see how they were used. Indeed, given that the final model contained 167 predictor variables, it is difficult to see why there was any human selection at all. The authors have not tried to justify any of their chosen variables based on causality arguments, so would it not make more sense to use the entire DHS dataset as predictors, and then let variable selection algorithms winnow this down?</p><p>We are also concerned about the apparent lack of variables at the household or even individual level. This may be a problem if being malaria-positive is (positively or negatively) associated with having a fever beyond what can be explained by the spatial covariates examined. For instance, within a particular town or village (with homogeneous environmental variables) there will be poorer households who are more likely to be both malaria-positive and to have non-malaria fevers. Within the household there will be further associations in distribution due to the age, gender, birth order, genetic makeup etc. of individuals. Perhaps this has been taken into account, but it is not clear how this happened.</p><p>In general, we get the impression that the ecology of the pathogen, its environment and insect host is well-described, but the epidemiological, immunological, cultural and socioeconomic determinants of disease within the human host are either less well captured or at least less well explained. Perhaps you should include someone with clinical or at least public health training in your authorship list.</p><p>3) Scope</p><p>There are a number of areas where we believe that the scope and implications of the results may be overstated.</p><p>- You need to clarify that this study aims at improving burden estimates of uncomplicated malaria, and not case management policy. WHO clearly recommends, as do all national policies in African countries with endemic malaria, that all fevers/suspected malaria presenting at facilitates in malaria endemic areas should receive a laboratory diagnosis for malaria, and if positive treated with the first-line antimalarial. This doesn't mean the attending health professional cannot go on to treat other presenting illnesses and symptoms. But even if the fever is not directly attributable to the Pf infection at that time, it should be treated. This needs to be made clear in the paper. You should stick to how these findings impact the overall epidemiology of fever illness among children in Africa, and not make recommendations or draw conclusions from this study in the discussion for malaria case management (or IMCI) policy.</p><p>- You argue that the results of their work will improve burden estimates. We find this to be somewhat of a 'straw man' attack, as to our knowledge no burden estimates have been based on an RDT positive child with a history of fever in the past 2 weeks. Neither WHO GMP, MAP nor GBD uses such a method.</p><p>- You present cross-sectional household survey data that measures a 2-week (or there about) RDT period prevalence based on persisting HRP2 antigenemia from a Pf infection, plus an overlapping fever history based on the recall by the mother/caregiver. Their primary results suggest a large proportion of these fevers are not directly attributed to the underlying Pf infection. While this seems an appropriate interpretation of the results and in line with malaria epidemiology, the cross-sectional nature of the study is a major limitation. You need to make note that the underlying Pf infection likely would have resulted in at least 1 parasite-attributable fever, likely in the first month of the infection, and additional parasite-related fevers will likely occur, especially if a new infection occurs on top of the existing infection (just based on the malaria therapy data). So the timing of the observed RDT+ and fever is important in understanding the true relationship between the underlying Pf infection, the observed fever recall, and the relationship between the underlying infection and fever at that time. Results and Discussion should take this into consideration when interpreting results throughout the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29198.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, the reviewers and I agreed that you took an interesting approach to an important public health question, using a large, rich dataset. However we felt that there were methodological shortcomings in the model (or at least in the current description of it) that needed to be addressed. The main issues that need to be addressed are listed below.</p><p>1) Model validation</p><p>Although it is mentioned that the fever model has been validated (subsection “Model overview”), it is not clear how this was actually done. Part of the problem is that you have not presented any of the original data on fevers and malaria prevalence. This makes it impossible to tell the goodness of fit.</p><p>Given that eLife has no space or figure restrictions, the following data plots would ideally be shown:</p><p>- The raw 2x2 table showing all fevers versus RDT positivity (data and predictions), which is really interesting and is key to the message of the paper. This should also be plotted by country and transmission intensity.</p></disp-quote><p>A 2x2 table of RDT and fever positivity, from data and predictions, can now be found in an augmented <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. Additionally, we have added extra columns to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> detailing the RDT/fever positivity breakdown by survey. The predicted national population-weighted prevalence of fever and RDT positivity can also be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Pie charts of national MAF, malaria-positive fever, and NMFI can also be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>.</p><p>A plot of the relationship between <italic>Pf</italic>PR<sub>0-5</sub> and the fever metrics of interest (all-cause fever, malaria-positive fever, and malaria-attributable fever) at surveyed sites, and pixel-level predictions, can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Model-predicted vs. observed all cause fever by pixel or by country. A fairly small subset of the available DHS and MICS surveys are used, presumably because the rest do not have any data on RDT positivity (and/or GPS?). However these other surveys do contain data on all-cause fever and therefore would be an excellent source of validation data for this aspect of the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We used thirty-eight DHS and MICS surveys as both RDT result and GPS location were required for the model. Other DHS surveys do contain information on all-cause fever either at a national or ADMIN1 level collected typically over 3-4 months, often with data being collected in a non-randomised fashion (e.g. collecting data from one region at a time). Fever prevalence is likely to be highly seasonal and heterogeneous between (and within) countries due to the seasonality of diseases that contribute to all-cause fever.</p><p>For this reason, national or sub-national measurements of all-cause fever prevalence from these surveys cannot be directly compared with our estimates (or used directly to validate them), as we estimate the annual all-cause fever prevalence within an average two weeks in that year. Our model is able to bypass this restriction with georeferenced surveys by incorporating information on both the location and month of measurement within the model.</p><p>We do agree with the reviewers that these surveys are a valuable source of currently untapped information; a potential extension to this modelling framework would include predicting metrics at monthly time-steps to allow direct comparability with household surveys.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A plot of the final fitted relationship between fever prevalence, parasite prevalence and the malaria-attributable fraction (and data on the 1st two variables)</p></disp-quote><p>These plots have been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Comparison with observed vs. predicted fever prevalence. These data are not presented, and one of the reviewers who checked could not reconcile some of their predictions with the available data online. E.g. Results subsection “Prevalence of all-cause fever”: fever prevalence in Liberia is quoted as 51.7% in 2014, but on the DHS survey website only a Liberia survey in 2013, which gave fever prevalence as 28.6%. Similarly the most recent data from Niger (DHS 2012) shows a fever prevalence of 14.2%, but the quoted value by the authors is 57.2%. Please could you check and explain the reasons for any discrepancies.</p></disp-quote><p>For the same reasons explained in our second response to point 1, national surveys are not directly comparable to our predictions due to the differing temporal dynamics of the surveys and predictions, and the seasonality of all-cause fever.</p><p>Since improving the model with suggestions from the reviewers (described in detail in following answers), all the noted disparities have decreased. To investigate this fully, we extracted all-cause fever prevalence from 78 DHS/MICS surveys between 2006 and 2014; 72% of our predictions had a disparity of fewer than 10 percentage points from the household surveys. The majority of surveys with a disparity of more than 10 percentage points were from either the earlier or later years of the study period where less response data is available (the bulk of the surveys used were conducted in 2009-2012). As more data becomes available in later years, we expect model performance to improve.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Related to those countries with the highest and lowest prevalence of fever (subsection “Prevalence of all-cause fever”): predicted values are given for Eritrea, Niger, Botswana and Zimbabwe. But in the supplementary data table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), the list of surveys does not include any data from any of these countries. Is this correct, or is the data list incomplete? If correct it seems concerning that the least certain estimates produce the outlying predictions. This should warrant some reinvestigation of the model fit. We suggest at least comparing the predictions against available fever prevalence estimates, even if not coupled with RDT data (as mentioned above).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that four out of the six countries we predict to have either the highest or lowest prevalence of all-cause fever are countries for which we do not have response data. In this exercise we have data from 38 household surveys, with each survey collecting data from one country across a few months. Our prediction spans 43 African countries across a 9-year time period, totalling 387 country-years. Our data therefore only covers a tiny fraction of this period so it is not unexpected that some of the highest and lowest predictions are in country-years with no data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More generally, external validation should be performed by comparing model results to datasets not used to parameterise it. For instance you mention that case-control studies, transmission models etc. have been used to estimate the attributable fraction of malaria in fever – it would be useful to compare the model results with these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We do discuss the contribution of case-control studies and transmission model estimates of MAF in the Introduction (subsection “Estimating malaria-attributable fever prevalence”).</p><p>We have overlaid the estimated clinical incidence from an ensemble of transmission models on our plot of all-cause fever, malaria-coincident fever, and malaria-attributable fever in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> (explained in more detail in our first response to point 1). As outlined in the Discussion (first paragraph), our MAF predictions match most closely with the transmission model estimates when the transmission models are predicting clinical incidence (i.e. fever) for the duration of the past 2-4 weeks (rather than the previous 0-2 weeks). The number of days prior to the interview since the onset of the child’s fever is known in 13 of the household surveys. In these surveys, the mean number of days since the onset of fever was 5.78 (SD: 3.85). Fevers in the interview are unlikely to always be detected in the final day of their natural cycle, so the close fit between our estimates and transmission model estimates of MAF within the past 2-4 weeks are comparable. The ensemble transmission model was calibrated using active case detection (ACD) studies where any fever occurring within the same 30-day period was counted as a single incident case of malaria (standard protocol for counting incident cases in ACD studies).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For transparency and to comply with eLife policy for mathematical models, you should provide the initial and final set of model equations (including coefficients) and the code used to select the final model, either in Supplementary Materials or in a suitable online repository such as github. Major data sets used that are not already in the public domain should also be provided unless there are compelling scientific or ethical reasons not to.</p></disp-quote><p>The model equations are given in the manuscript; we have added final model coefficients to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.</p><p>The code for both the final multinomial model and the BRT covariate generation model are available at https://github.com/udalrymple/MAF-NMFI</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Extending the model beyond environmental variables</p><p>Although in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Covariates” it mentions that socio-demographic predictors of fever were considered, all the examples in the paragraph and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> are environmental. This seems like quite a large omission, especially given that fever is self-reported. As well as many varied causes of fever, cultural perceptions of fever are important here (and language, e.g. some languages do not have a specific word for fever). We were not clear how well environmental variables could be expected to predict this, especially given that you are extending fever predictions into countries for which there are no data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the model to incorporate four indicators of national-level socio-demographic factors for 2006-2014, these are: percentage coverage of diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) immunization; annual GDP growth; percentage of pregnant women who received prenatal care; and percentage with primary school education. These data were obtained from the World Bank Database and are described in full in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Covariates” and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p><p>We have also incorporated three additional socio-demographic variables at the same spatial resolution as the existing predictor variables (5x5km pixels) derived from the Global Urban Footprint dataset of global urban coverage; again these are described in full in the aforementioned paragraph and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p><p>Additionally some of the variables used in the initial analysis are of a socio-demographic nature despite being remotely-sensed (accessibility, night-time lights).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Besides cultural factors, a list of suitable covariates may include socioeconomic factors such as nutrition, crowding, mother's education, access to clean water etc. Many of these are available in DHS/MICS data but it is difficult to see how they were used. Indeed, given that the final model contained 167 predictor variables, it is difficult to see why there was any human selection at all. The authors have not tried to justify any of their chosen variables based on causality arguments, so would it not make more sense to use the entire DHS dataset as predictors, and then let variable selection algorithms winnow this down?</p></disp-quote><p>The predictor variables used in the creation of the covariate surfaces (<italic>Pf</italic>PR<sub>0-5</sub> and the BRT predicted surface of background fever prevalence) are required to be complete surfaces of known values across the continent, prompting the decision to use remotely-sensed variables. These variables (with the exception of the variables added in the revision, described in the answer to Q4) were the same as those used in the MAP <italic>Pf</italic>PR<sub>2-10</sub> model (Bhatt et al., Nature 2015), with the logic that this broad suite of variables are inclusive of most currently available geospatial data informing on the distribution of diseases that are constrained by environmental conditions.</p><p>We agree with the notion that other DHS variables would be suitable predictors of MAF and NMFI prevalence; however their values are unknown in locations other than the survey sites and so cannot function as covariates in a predictive spatial model. We have addressed this in more detail in our next response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We are also concerned about the apparent lack of variables at the household or even individual level. This may be a problem if being malaria-positive is (positively or negatively) associated with having a fever beyond what can be explained by the spatial covariates examined. For instance, within a particular town or village (with homogeneous environmental variables) there will be poorer households who are more likely to be both malaria-positive and to have non-malaria fevers. Within the household there will be further associations in distribution due to the age, gender, birth order, genetic makeup etc. of individuals. Perhaps this has been taken into account, but it is not clear how this happened.</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout this study we have placed greater emphasis on predicting the patterns of fever throughout Africa and relative contributions of malaria and other causes. As such we have configured our model to predict these quantities for 5x5km pixels across Africa. As in the previous response, this precluded the use in our predictive model of any individual-level or household-level covariates since these are not available on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We agree with the reviewers that at the individual level many survey covariates (such as housing type and income level) are likely to be significantly predictive of both malarial and non-malarial fever prevalence, and moreover able to explain a correlation of increasing risk for both. Including this information in our model could potentially have increased predictive power for the former effect and reduce the possibility of over-dispersed errors contributed by the second effect. However, we have not included these individual level predictor variables in our current model owing to the heterogeneity of individual level variables measured in different surveys and the lack of a common set of information directly representative of those variables outside of surveyed countries.</p><p>During model building we attempted fitting an over-dispersed multinomial model but encountered a number of numerical difficulties suggestive of an ill-conditioned Laplace approximation step. Hence we remain concerned as to the potential for some errors due to ignoring the potential for correlated risk factors within cells. We have made a new note of this in our discussion and draw some reassurance from the probability integral transform diagnostic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that suggests our model uncertainties are reasonably well, though not perfectly, calibrated. In order to further explore the potential extent of this effect we have examined the relationship between leave-one-out predictive error for <italic>Pf</italic>PR and NMFI and the standard deviation of relative wealth (a variable consistently reported across surveys), and found no significant effect when plotted against the PIT histogram or with quantile regression at quantiles 0.025, 0.5 and 0.975.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, we get the impression that the ecology of the pathogen, its environment and insect host is well-described, but the epidemiological, immunological, cultural and socioeconomic determinants of disease within the human host are either less well captured or at least less well explained. Perhaps you should include someone with clinical or at least public health training in your authorship list.</p></disp-quote><p>Following our last two responses, we reiterate that our focus has been on continental prediction of the quantities of interest and their interaction rather than to explicitly offer new insight into the contextual factors listed above. We agree these are interesting and worthy of further investigation but propose that doing so is not an essential component of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Scope</p><p>There are a number of areas where we believe that the scope and implications of the results may be overstated.</p><p>- You need to clarify that this study aims at improving burden estimates of uncomplicated malaria, and not case management policy. WHO clearly recommends, as do all national policies in African countries with endemic malaria, that all fevers/suspected malaria presenting at facilitates in malaria endemic areas should receive a laboratory diagnosis for malaria, and if positive treated with the first-line antimalarial. This doesn't mean the attending health professional cannot go on to treat other presenting illnesses and symptoms. But even if the fever is not directly attributable to the Pf infection at that time, it should be treated. This needs to be made clear in the paper. You should stick to how these findings impact the overall epidemiology of fever illness among children in Africa, and not make recommendations or draw conclusions from this study in the discussion for malaria case management (or IMCI) policy.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the major findings of this paper is that many fevers that are coincident with a malaria infection are causally attributable to another disease. This analysis is the first, to our knowledge, to quantify this; and the spatial heterogeneity in the proportion of fevers attributable to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria and other diseases means that a febrile child has a differing chance of having MAF or NMFI depending on where they are in Africa. This does have ramifications on the likelihood of missing a co-infecting disease given a positive RDT at the clinic, should the child be infected with a disease with overlapping symptoms to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria.</p><p>IMCI for fever in high to low malaria risk, in situations when the child’s RDT tests positive, recommends looking also for a bacterial cause of fever from external examination of temperature, stiffness, lesions etc. However if no external symptoms are present an antibiotic will not necessarily be provided. The child will, at the end of the consultation, receive a first-line antimalarial and an antibiotic if the visual examination suggests that they have a bacterial co-infection. By claiming that current WHO guidelines for integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) currently suboptimal for the treatment of fever, we intend to convey that the diagnosis of NMFI is far less robust than for malaria, given that it is a visual diagnosis rather than a parasite based diagnosis, and could be improved should diagnostic tests for common NMFIs become more widely available.</p><p>We have adapted the Discussion to convey this more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- You argue that the results of their work will improve burden estimates. We find this to be somewhat of a 'straw man' attack, as to our knowledge no burden estimates have been based on an RDT positive child with a history of fever in the past 2 weeks. Neither WHO GMP, MAP nor GBD uses such a method.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for using RDT positivity, rather than microscopy, is the advantage of HRP2 persistence giving a more accurate indication of two-week positivity. We are unable to use microscopy results (although available from the household surveys) as microscopy results are not a reliable indicator of 2-week malaria positivity in situations where an individual has already received antimalarial treatment for their fever. Additionally, as RDTs become more widely available, they may be used in the future for burden estimates, particularly in new 'real-time' burden estimations from new routine case reporting systems (such as DHIS2).</p><p>When estimating the total malaria burden, confirmed malaria “cases”- that is, a febrile individual who seeks care at a facility that reports to a national HMIS and receives a positive <italic>P. falciparum</italic> diagnosis- are utilised to calculate the total incidence of malaria nationally. If many of these malaria cases are actually asymptomatic malaria cases with a coincident and symptomatic NMFI, then the number of these types of malaria “case” would vary due to the prevalence of NMFI rather than the prevalence of malaria. A more accurate (although clinically challenging) measurement of malaria cases would be to calculate the total number of malaria-attributable fevers, rather than those that simply present at a clinic with a positive RDT. We would expect that, in the hypothetical complete absence of NMFI, the number of individuals presenting with a fever at clinics would decline and subsequently the total number of positive RDTs within clinics would also decline.</p><p>Additionally, the treatment-seeking rate for all-cause fever is used as a further adjustment to calculate national <italic>P. falciparum</italic> incidence. It is possible that the treatment seeking rate for MAF and NMFI is not equivalent. While measuring the treatment seeking rate for MAF and NMFI is not within the scope of this paper, a better understanding of the causal contributions of MAF and NMFI to all fevers is crucial to enhancing our estimates of malaria burden in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- You present cross-sectional household survey data that measures a 2-week (or there about) RDT period prevalence based on persisting HRP2 antigenemia from a Pf infection, plus an overlapping fever history based on the recall by the mother/caregiver. Their primary results suggest a large proportion of these fevers are not directly attributed to the underlying Pf infection. While this seems an appropriate interpretation of the results and in line with malaria epidemiology, the cross-sectional nature of the study is a major limitation. You need to make note that the underlying Pf infection likely would have resulted in at least 1 parasite-attributable fever, likely in the first month of the infection, and additional parasite-related fevers will likely occur, especially if a new infection occurs on top of the existing infection (just based on the malaria therapy data). So the timing of the observed RDT+ and fever is important in understanding the true relationship between the underlying Pf infection, the observed fever recall, and the relationship between the underlying infection and fever at that time. Results and Discussion should take this into consideration when interpreting results throughout the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept these comments and have adjusted the Results and Discussion accordingly. “…[I]n any given two-week period” has been added, and we also added a discussion point on ever-symptomatic fevers in the Discussion (third paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
