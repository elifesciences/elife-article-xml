export signals (NESs), which are highly variable in sequence and structure. The plasticity of the CRM1-NES interaction is not well understood, as there are many NES sequences that seem incompatible with structures of the NES-bound CRM1 groove. Crystal structures of CRM1 bound to two different NESs with unusual sequences showed the NES peptides binding the CRM1 groove in the opposite orientation (minus) to that of previously studied NESs (plus). Comparison of minus and plus NESs identified structural and sequence determinants for NES orientation. The binding of NESs to CRM1 in both orientations results in a large expansion in NES consensus patterns and therefore a corresponding expansion of potential NESs in the proteome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10034.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10034.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10034.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many organisms keep their DNA within a structure inside their cells called the nucleus. Two layers of membrane surround the nucleus and keep the DNA separate from the rest of the cell's contents. Yet, proteins and other molecules can move in and out of the nucleus by passing through small pores in this nuclear membrane.</p><p>To travel through these pores, larger molecules such as proteins rely on the assistance of transport receptors, including one called CRM1. This transport receptor helps to export hundreds of different proteins from the nucleus by recognizing a part of their structure called the ‘nuclear export signal’. Earlier work has shown that three different nuclear export signals interact with CRM1 in a similar ways by binding to a groove on its outer surface. But, there are several different types of nuclear export signal, and many are predicted to have three-dimensional structures that would seem to prevent them from binding to CRM1 in this way. As yet, it remains unknown how these diverse signals interact with this important transporter receptor.</p><p>Protein crystallization is a technique that is used to visualize a protein's three-dimensional structure. Fung et al. have now used this approach to investigate how a particular class of nuclear export signals (called ‘class 3’) bind to CRM1. First, a modified form of CRM1 was crystallized once it had bound to a small fragment of protein that contains a class 3 nuclear export signal. The protein's molecular structure was then revealed by performing X-ray diffraction on the crystals.</p><p>The results show, unexpectedly, that two different nuclear export signals in class 3 bind to the groove of CRM1 in the opposite direction to that reported previously. Additional biochemical and structural experiments then identified a particular feature or motif in the nuclear export signals that determines which way round they bind to CRM1.</p><p>This discovery advances our understanding of how these signals work, which will allow us to more accurately identify new nuclear export signals from genome sequences. As more CRM1-binding nuclear export signals are discovered in the future, the experimental data sets used to train the computational programs that are currently used to locate these signals in genomic sequences will be diversified and improved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10034.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10034.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>nuclear transport</kwd><kwd>exportin-1</kwd><kwd>CRM1</kwd><kwd>nuclear export signal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP120352, RP150053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chook</surname><given-names>Yuh Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM069909</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chook</surname><given-names>Yuh Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007914</institution-id><institution>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Endowed Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chook</surname><given-names>Yuh Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation (Robert A.

CRM1 recognizes its protein cargos through 8–15 residue long nuclear export signals (NESs) in the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">la Cour et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kosugi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2010</xref>).

The NESs bind in a hydrophobic groove, which is located on the outer/convex surface of the ring-shaped CRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monecke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>). The NESs use almost exclusively their side chains, especially their hydrophobic Φ side chains, to bind CRM1. The NES-binding groove of CRM1, which is wide at one end and narrow at the other end, consists of 5 hydrophobic pockets P0–P4 and is virtually identical in all CRM1-NES structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). NESs from PKI and SNUPN (PKI<sup>NES</sup> and SNUPN<sup>NES</sup>) share a similar structure when bound to CRM1—an N-terminal 3-turn α-helix followed by a short C-terminal β-strand-like extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monecke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>). The NES helix binds the wide part of the CRM1 groove, while the β-strand binds the narrow end of the groove. The Rev<sup>NES</sup> peptide binds the CRM1 groove in a different manner by adopting an entirely extended conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>). All three NES peptides bind in the same direction, with their N-termini at the wide part of the groove.</p><p>The vastly different conformations of the extended Rev<sup>NES</sup> compared to the helix-strand PKI<sup>NES</sup> and SNUPN<sup>NES</sup> suggest that CRM1 may recognize divergent signal sequences in part by binding different peptide structures. The repertoire of conformations for CRM1-bound NESs remains unclear, but the asymmetric and seemingly structurally invariant NES-bound CRM1 groove presents physical constraints on structures of bound NESs. For example, the class 3 NES consensus of Φ1X<sub>(2,3)</sub>Φ2X<sub>(2,3)</sub>Φ3X<sub>2</sub>Φ4 with two intervening residues between Φ3 and Φ4 suggests a single long NES helix. The substitution of a narrow strand or extended chain at the C-terminus of an NES with a helix presents a steric problem as the thicker helix is unlikely to fit into the tapering CRM1 groove. In current NES databases, class 3 NES sequences are as prevalent as NESs of classes 1b, 1c, 1d, and 2, but information of how they are able to bind CRM1 is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have developed a general strategy to crystallize CRM1 bound to NES peptides in order to study how diverse sequences, including the enigmatic class 3 NESs, bind the exportin. Crystal structures of two different class 3 NESs bound to CRM1 revealed a novel NES binding mode where polypeptide direction of the NES is reversed. We show that NES peptides can bind the CRM1 groove bidirectionally (in both plus and minus directions), and biochemical and structural analyses identified determinants for one direction of binding vs the other. Bidirectional exportin-signal interactions suggest a significant expansion of the current NES consensus patterns that will enable new, previously unknown NESs to be identified.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A general strategy for structure determination of CRM1 bound to NES peptides</title><p>Crystallization of CRM1-Ran-NES peptide complexes has generally not been successful, possibly due to conformational flexibility and low affinities for the NESs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kutay and Guttinger, 2005</xref>). Crystal structures of NESs bound to CRM1 were instead determined using the CRM1-Ran-SNUPN complexes, including ones where the SNUPN<sup>NES</sup> was replaced with the PKI<sup>NES</sup> and Rev<sup>NES</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>). This strategy was limited because of severe mosaicity of the CRM1-Ran-SNUPN crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, the ternary complex of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> CRM1 (<sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup>CRM1) with RanGTP (human or yeast RanGTP, Gsp1p) and RanBP1 (Yrb1p) reliably yields crystals that diffract to high resolution and has been used to determine structures of several CRM1-inhibitor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koyama and Matsuura, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lapalombella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Etchin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haines et al., 2015</xref>).

We engineered CRM1 to shift the open-closed groove equilibrium toward the open state, in order for CRM1-Ran-RanBP1 to bind NESs. We started with a <sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup>CRM1 construct (residues 1–1058, Δ377–413, <sup>537</sup>DLTVK<sup>541</sup> to GLCEQ) that is known to crystallize easily and has an NES groove that is virtually identical to that of human CRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lapalombella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Etchin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haines et al., 2015</xref>). Koyama and Matsuura showed that mutation of the H9 loop of CRM1, which packs against the back of a closed NES groove, stabilizes the open CRM1 groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koyama and Matsuura, 2010</xref>). Thus, we mutated the H9 loop (Val441Asp) to detach it from the back of the NES groove and to open the groove even when CRM1 is complexed with Ran and RanBP1. The resulting CRM1* construct, with <sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup>CRM1 residues 1–1058, Δ377–413, V441D and groove residues <sup>537</sup>DLTVK<sup>541</sup> mutated to GLCEQ (to mimic human CRM1, see methods), binds NES peptides in the presence of RanGTP and RanBP1.

The structures show that the two minus NESs clearly match the consensus pattern Φ1XΦ2XXXΦ3XXΦ4XXΦ5, which is the reverse of the class 1a pattern, Φ0XXΦ1XXΦ2XXXΦ3XΦ4. The five hydrophobic residues of the hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>, designated Φ1–Φ5, bind the same P0–P4 pockets as the plus NESs, but in reverse order, with Φ1 in P4 and Φ5 in P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>).

In an α-helix, amino acid side chains are angled toward the N-terminus of the helix. Thus, since plus and minus helices progress from N- to C-terminus in opposite directions, side chains that emanate from the helices also project in opposite directions. The Φ0, Φ1, Φ2, and Φ3 side chains of the plus NES helix project toward the wide end of the CRM1 groove near P0 to occupy the P0–P4 CRM1 pockets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Smaller hydrophobic side chains like alanine, valine, and isoleucine in these positions are disfavored as the mutants do not bind CRM1 efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The CRM1 grooves in the hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R complexes are almost identical to those in the wild-type hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> complexes (Cα rmsds 0.2–0.3 Å).

Their C-terminal strand-like ΦXΦ segments bind in the narrow part of the CRM1 groove, but are placed slightly outward toward solvent, perhaps to better accommodate the large Phe and Met side chains in the P3 and P4 CRM1 pockets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

The preference for smaller hydrophobic side chains in ΦXΦ segment can possibly be explained by the relief of steric constraints caused by the bulky phenylalanine in the native hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R sequence. The structures of CRM1-bound hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R peptides support the idea that the spacing between the hydrophobic residues is critical for determining the orientation the NES binds. When the sequence and the hydrophobic spacing pattern of an NES are reversed, the direction of the peptide binding CRM1 is also reversed. However, binding affinities of the NESs are similar regardless of binding orientation, consistent with the observation that hydrophobic interactions between the CRM1 groove and side chains in the Φ positions of hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>, which likely govern CRM1-NES affinity, are preserved in hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10034.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R are plus NESs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structures of hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R (light blue) and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R (light pink) bound to CRM1 (gray surfaces).

Each of the asymmetric class 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d patterns, which represent plus NESs, could be reversed to give class 1a-R, 1b-R, 1c-R, and 1d-R patterns that represent minus NESs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In principle, symmetric class 2 and 3 patterns can also bind CRM1 in both the plus and minus directions.

Each CRM1 cargo contains multiple sequences that match NES consensus patterns but most of these sequences are not functional export signals. Dbase reports a total of 290 experimentally identified NES regions for the 246 CRM1 cargos in the database. Matches for both class 1 (plus) and class 1-R (minus) patterns appear to be similarly prevalent in the 246 CRM1 cargos (1849 minus vs 1950 plus matches) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, plus patterns seem to be somewhat enriched within NES regions (340 plus vs 230 minus matches; Chi-square test, p-value = 1.378e<sup>−05</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The bias for plus patterns in these previously reported NES regions may be a consequence of NES searches that were guided solely by the plus consensus patterns, since the minus patterns were unknown. The Dbase data set is further complicated by a lack of validation of direct CRM1-NES interactions. Only 60% of previously reported class 1 NESs that were tested recently were found to actually bind CRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2012a</xref>). Of the 290 NES regions in Dbase, 40% (116) contain sequences that match both class 1 (plus) and class 1-R (minus) patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). 89 NES regions match class 1 pattern exclusively and 24 match class 1-R patterns exclusively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that there are still a significant population of putative minus NES even though the current NES annotation is biased and imperfect.</p><p>We further investigated the 24 NES regions that contained only class 1-R matches, filtering out four because of overlap with the class 2 consensus, which was previously not considered in the analysis. The remaining 20 NES regions contain 22 sequences that match class 1-R patterns, which were tested for CRM1 binding in pull-down assays. Of the 22 sequences tested, one degraded and another aggregated during purification resulting in only 20 relevant NES sequences. 10 out of the 20 putative minus NESs, or 50%, bind CRM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This percentage is similar to the proportion of tested class 1 (plus) NESs that bind CRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2012a</xref>). These results suggest that there are a substantial number of functional NESs that likely bind CRM1 in the minus direction, even in an NES dataset like Dbase where many NESs were previously identified using the only plus NES consensus patterns. These possibly include cases where NES patterns have been mistakenly annotated or annotated as previously non-canonical patterns. This new expansion of NES consensus provides a means to identify previously unrecognizable NESs in previously identified and new CRM1 cargos.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10034.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Putative minus NESs in the Dbase data set.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of putative minus NESs (in the Dbase data set that match class 1-R patterns exclusively) tested for CRM1 binding.

This is in contrast to several modular-domain signaling systems, which are known to bind their linear motifs in both polypeptide chain directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Osawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swanson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorenz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neufeld et al., 2009</xref>). Are protein systems that recognize linear motifs in opposite orientations unique or will most linear motifs bind their receptors in both orientations even though this phenomenon has not yet been observed for many? Alternatively, do linear motifs that bind only in a single orientation do so because of spatial constraints inherent to their cellular functions?</p><p>Regularly spaced hydrophobic pockets in the CRM1-NES groove interact with similarly spaced NES side chains that often project from one face of amphipathic α-helices. Interestingly, several other linear motifs that bind in opposite orientations (Paxillin LD motifs, HBP1/Mad1 Sin2-interaction domains, SH3-binding polyproline peptides, and various calmodulin targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Osawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swanson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorenz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neufeld et al., 2009</xref>]) also present side chains from helices for recognition. Side chain to side chain distances within secondary structural elements of motifs are preserved regardless of polypeptide orientation, thus producing a feature that may be conducive for binding in opposite orientations. The required shift of the backbone to put the plus and minus side chains in the same position is more likely for linear motifs than for extensive interfaces between two folded proteins, since the latter are constrained by many additional contacts outside of the helix-binding groove. Thus, bidirectional recognition is probably more prevalent in recognition of linear helical motifs than in recognition of larger structured elements.</p><p>Extended linear motifs such as phosphotyrosine peptides that bind SH2 domains also bind in opposite orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2008</xref>). Here, side chains, mainly the phosphotyrosine side chain, contribute the majority of binding energy, which can still be preserved when peptide orientation is reversed. Linear motifs that use mostly side chains for binding may be amenable to interactions in opposite orientations but those that make extensive contacts using their backbones may be limited to a particular orientation. For example, the IBB region of Importin-α, which is the nuclear localization signal or NLS that binds directly to Importin-β, is a long 28-residue helix that is preceded by a loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cingolani et al., 1999</xref>). The IBB uses mostly charged and polar side chains to interact with Importin-β, and perhaps these side chain interactions could be preserved when polypeptide direction of the NLS peptide is flipped. Similarly, PY-NLS binding to Karyopherin-β2 (also known as Transportin-1) involves mostly the NLS side chains, and we may observe these NLSs binding to Karyopherin-β2 in the opposite orientation in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soniat et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the classical-NLS recognition by Importin-α and the Kap121-specific lysine-rich NLS (also called the IK-NLS) recognition by Kap121 involve extensive interactions with the NLS main chains and are therefore less likely to bind bidirectionally to their importins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fontes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soniat and Chook, 2015</xref>). Further studies will inform on orientation requirements for NLSs binding to their respective importins. We suggest that bidirectional recognition may, in fact, be widely present, but simply not widely observed.</p><p>Components of modular-domain signaling and nuclear-targeting systems consist of mostly soluble proteins that bind linear motifs found within intrinsically disordered regions. These protein–peptide interaction systems are relatively free of spatial constraints compared to systems that bind organelle-targeting signals for delivery into membrane compartments. An example of the latter is the binding of ER signal sequences by the signal recognition particle SRP, which is likely constrained spatially by the nascent chain emerging from the ribosome and by subsequent delivery into the lumen of the translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akopian et al., 2013</xref>). In principle, linear motifs that could bind in both orientations are sometimes constrained by other factors that limit them to only one. The CRM1-NES interaction is free from such spatial constraints as the entire exportin–cargo complex enters the nuclear pore complex for transport to the cytoplasm, thereby allowing some NESs to bind CRM1 in the plus orientation and others in the minus orientation.</p><p>Finally, accurate prediction of NESs has been difficult because of the breadth and simultaneously, the insufficient coverage of the NES consensus. Many functional NES-containing regions of proteins contain multiple NES consensus matches and sometimes no NES match, suggesting that the set of NES consensus does not provide sufficient coverage for NES identification. Our study shows that structures of NESs bound to CRM1 can accurately define consensus patterns and sometimes identify new consensus patterns. Expansion of the NES consensus upon discovery of minus NESs leads to improved coverage of potential NESs, thus allowing identification of previously unrecognized NESs in known and new CRM1 cargos. However, the improved coverage afforded by the knowledge of bidirectional NES-binding is largely orthogonal to the problems in NES prediction that arise from false positive NESs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2012a</xref>). The majority of the NES patterns describe the ubiquitous 2-turn amphipathic helix, which are found in most helix-containing proteins, and many of these consensus-matching sequences are part of hydrophobic cores that are not accessible for CRM1 binding. In the development of NES predictors (NESsential by the Horton Lab and LocNES by the Chook lab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), we found that prediction accuracy was improved by using both sequence and structural/biophysical properties (such as disorder propensity and/or solvent accessibility) as features for machine-learning methods. The latter features allowed consensus-matching sequences in the interior of folded domains to be flagged. A set of consensus sequences with high coverage rate such as the expanded set in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> is desirable when employed as a pre-filter in NES prediction as the machine-learning process that follows serves to reduce false positive matches. Future identification of minus NESs will also increase the size, diversity, and accuracy of experimental NES databases, which are the training/testing data sets for the development of our next generation NES predictors.</p><p>In summary, we have found that NES peptides can bind the narrow CRM1-NES groove in two opposite orientations, which we now describe as the plus and minus orientations. Whether an NES binds CRM1 in the plus or minus orientation is determined by the location of its ΦXΦ strand motif. A C-terminal ΦXΦ motif that follows a helix dictates a plus NES, while an N-terminal ΦXΦ followed by a helix results in a minus NES. The five hydrophobic pockets in the CRM1-NES groove interact with hydrophobic side chains that are presented in many different ways on NES peptides, by different secondary structural elements and in both polypeptide chain directions, to enable specific recognition of diverse NES sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression, purification, and complex formation</title><p><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup>CRM1 (1–1058, Δ377–413, <sup>537</sup>DLTVK<sup>541</sup> to GLCEQ, V441D) was cloned into the previously described pGEX-TEV vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chook and Blobel, 1999</xref>).

Live cell images were collected using a spinning disk confocal microscope system, Nikon-Andor (Nikon, NY), and MetaMorph software. Image analysis was performed similarly with ImageJ. CRM1 dependence was demonstrated by the nuclear accumulation of EYFP fusion proteins after treatment with 2 nM Leptomycin B for 16 hr at 37°C. Experiments were performed in at least duplicates with over a total of 150 transfected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Competition differential bleaching assay monitored by microscale thermophoresis to measure CRM1-NES affinities</title><p>Differential bleaching was used as a parameter to monitor binding of MBP-NES proteins to CRM1. In short, we observed that the fluorophore reporter attached to PKI<sup>NES</sup> (FITC) underwent a reproducible time-dependent bleaching when exposed to excitation light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, this phenomenon was concentration-dependent, that is, the bleaching was accelerated when the FITC-PKI<sup>NES</sup> probe was exposed to increasing concentrations of CRM1. However, this phenomenon was saturable at high concentrations of CRM1, indicating that it was a function of CRM1 binding and not simply the presence of the protein that was causing the change. The differential bleaching can be counteracted by titrating of mixture of FITC-PKI<sup>NES</sup> and CRM1 with a known competitor, MBP-PKI<sup>NES</sup>, which competes directly with the fluorescent probe for the NES binding groove in CRM1. A sigmoidal appearance of the binding and competition isotherms is observed when differential bleaching, quantified as the average fluorescence at a time after bleaching normalized by the averaged fluorescence just after the beginning of bleaching, is plotted vs titrant concentration in a semilog graph (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).This illustrates that this bleaching behavior can be described as a two-state system where unbound probe and CRM1-bound probe bleach at different but specific rates, and that these quantities report on the populations of bound and unbound FITC-PKI<sup>NES</sup>. A detailed description of the data-fitting procedures will be described in manuscript in preparation by C.A.B. For error reporting, we used F-statistics and error-surface projection method to calculate the 68.3% confidence intervals of the fitted data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bevington and Robinson, 1992</xref>). While error reporting using the error surface projection method is relatively uncommon, the ranges more accurately represent the true confidence intervals given the observed noise in the performed set of experiments because they explicitly account for the ability of the fitting algorithm to compensate for fitting defects by modifying correlated parameters. Thus, they provide better evaluation of the fitted data than other, more commonly used methods (e.g., error estimations from the parametric variance-covariance matrix).</p><p>All proteins used were subjected to an extra gel filtration step and dialysis overnight in TB buffer with 15% glycerol to remove possible aggregation and ensures buffer matching. The FITC-PKI<sup>NES</sup> peptide (FITC-SGNSNELALKLAGLDINKT) was chemically synthesized by GenScript, NJ and dissolved in the TB buffer with 15% glycerol. For the direct titration, <sup><italic>Hs</italic></sup>CRM1 was serially diluted from 40 μM to 1.2 nM and incubated with mixture of 120 μM <sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup>Ran-GTP and 40 nM FITC-PKI<sup>NES</sup> in 1:1 vol to a total volume of 20 μl, and incubated for 1 hr in the dark at room temperature. For competition experiments, MBP-NESs were serially diluted from 100 μM to 3 nM in presence of 40 nM of FITC-PKI<sup>NES</sup> and incubated with mixture of 300 nM <sup><italic>Hs</italic></sup>CRM1 and 120 μM <sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup>Ran-GTP in 1:1 vol to a total of 20 μl, and incubated for 1.5 hr in the dark at room temperature. All reactions mixtures were supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20. Following incubations, reactions were loaded into NanoTemper's ‘Standard’ treated capillaries and fluorescence signals were monitored by NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 equipment (NanoTemper Technologies, München, Germany) with 60% LED power for 10 s. Titrations for parallel comparisons were performed in triplicates on the same day. Data collected were then analyzed with PALMIST (manuscript in preparation) and imported to GUSSI for generating figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brautigam, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Bioinformatic studies of plus and minus NESs in the Dbase data set</title><p>Protein sequences in the Dbase data set, a non-redundant compilation of CRM1 cargos from two of the most recent NES databases, ValidNESs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2013</xref>), and NESdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu, Grishin et al., 2012b</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prodata.swmed.edu/LRNes">http://prodata.swmed.edu/LRNes</ext-link>), were used for analyses of plus and minus NESs. All protein sequences in the Dbase data set were first compiled along with their annotated NES regions into an in-house database implemented by MySQL (version 5.5.43) on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04). NES regions are defined according to original reports in the published literature that identified the CRM1 cargos. PHP (version 5.3) regular expression with look-ahead assertions was used to capture all sequences (including overlapping sequences) that match the eight different class 1 (plus) and class 1-R (minus) NES consensus patterns. Duplicate matches (such as 10-mer sequences that simultaneously match both class 1a and 1d patterns, or match both 1a-R and 1d-R patterns) were removed using Linux command line tools, and the resulting numbers of consensus matches (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) were used for the enrichment test of plus consensus patterns within NES regions by Chi-square test using R (version 2.14.1). The same MySQL database was used to search for putative minus NESs, and 24 NES regions that match the 1-R patterns exclusively were identified. Four of these NES regions were removed because of overlap with class 2 patterns, resulting in 20 NES regions (containing 22 1-R consensus matches) for examination of CRM1 interactions by pull-down binding assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Accession codes</title><p>Structures and crystallographic data have been deposited at the PDB: 5DHF (CRM1-hRio2<sup>NES</sup> complex), 5DIF (CRM1-CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> complex), 5DI9 (CRM1-hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R complex), 5DHA (CRM1-CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R complex), 5DH9 (CRM1-PKI<sup>NES</sup>-Flip3 complex).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Structural Biology Laboratory and Macromolecular Biophysics Resource at UTSW for crystallographic and biochemical data collection assistance, M Soniat, M Rosen, and N Grishin for comments.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor), Mingjie Zhang (Guest Reviewing Editor), Douglas Barrick, and Gino Cingolani (peer reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes the binding of a new class of nuclear export signals (here Rio2 and CPEB4) to exporter CRM1. The typical hydrophobic spacing in these new signals differ from the crystallographically defined mechanism of recognition of protein kinase-A inhibitor (PKI), and using x-ray crystallography, the authors find that the orientation of the new CRM1s are reversed (N to C) when bound to the pocket. In retrospect, bidirectional recognition of NES is not surprising if one considers that CRM1 does not make contacts with the NES main-chain, unlike importins (e.g. Importin-α, β, etc.) that make extensive contacts with the NLS backbone, hence forcing the NLS side chains in an orientation-dependent conformation. The authors then deduce the spacing rules for orientation, and show that they can reverse the orientation of both PKI, and the Rio2 and PKI sequences. The authors also define specificities of hydrophobic binding residues qualitatively using pull-down assays. Finally, using their modified sequence profile, they identify a new potential set of sequences and show that a significant subset of them bind.

The comment above has inspired us to add a short discussion about interactions between various types of NLSs (classical-NLS, Kap121-specific NLS, PY-NLS and the IBB) with their importins, and how the interactions might affect NLS directionalities on the importins (please see in the Discussion section: “Extended linear motifs such as phosphotyrosine peptides […] may, in fact, be widely present, but simply not widely observed”).</p><p><italic>Essential revisions</italic>:</p><p><italic>The authors should address the following questions and comments in the form of revision.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors should try to expand on the correlation between NES directionality of binding to CRM1 and K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> <italic>of NESs for CRM1.

In the original paper, we reported binding affinities of hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R constructs that are two residues longer at the C-termini than constructs of their wild-type counterparts hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> (see sequences below). We have corrected the inconsistency of comparing constructs of different lengths and repeated the MST experiments with longer versions of hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> that are now the exact inverse counterparts of the hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R constructs. Sequences of old and new constructs are listed below:</p><p>Construct 1 hRio2<sup>NES</sup> (original manuscript): RSFEMTEFNQALEEI</p><p>Construct 2 CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> (original manuscript): RTFDMHSLESSLIDI</p><p>Construct 3 hRio2<sup>NES</sup> (new construct): RSFEMTEFNQALEEIKG</p><p>Construct 4 CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> (new construct): RTFDMHSLESSLIDIMR</p><p>Construct 5 hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R (original manuscript): GKIEELAQNFETMEFSR</p><p>Construct 6 CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R (original manuscript): RMIDILSSELSHMDFTR</p><p>New experiments comparing new constructs 3 and 4 with original constructs 5 and 6 show that affinities of NESs are similar regardless of binding orientation. These data support structural observations that hydrophobic interactions, which likely dominate CRM1-NES affinity, of the CRM1 groove with both plus and minus NESs are similar. Minus NESs do not appear to be systematically weaker binders compared to plus NES. However, the ability of NESs to bind in both directions likely allows more combinations of hydrophobic residues in the peptides that are viable for favorable interaction with CRM1 and the larger variation of hydrophobic residues in turn contributes to a wide range of K<sub>D</sub>s.</p><p>We have replaced old affinity data for hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> with new data for the longer constructs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. We have also changed the text in subsection “Structural determinants of the plus versus minus NES” to report the new comparisons: “Wild-type NESs MBP-hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and MBP-CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> bind CRM1 with K<sub>Ds</sub> of 2200nM [1600,2900] and 590nM [400,840], respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The ranges in brackets represent the 68.3% confidence intervals as calculated using F-statistics and error-surface projection method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bevington &amp; Robinson, 1992</xref>). When NES sequences are reversed, MBP-hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and MBP-CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R still bind CRM1 with similar affinities, K<sub>Ds</sub> of 2400nM [2100,2800] and 780nM [610,980], respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>).”</p><p>We have also added a sentence to the aforementioned subsection to connect comparison of affinities with structural comparisons:</p><p>“However, binding affinities of the NESs are similar regardless of binding orientation, consistent with the observation that hydrophobic interactions between the CRM1 groove and side chains in the Φ positions of hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>, which likely govern CRM1-NES affinity, are preserved in hRio2<sup>NES</sup>-R and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup>-R.”</p><p>Finally, affinity data for the old and shorter constructs of hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> (constructs 1 and 2) are now reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>, and a discussion about their affinities compared to the longer constructs (hRio2<sup>NES</sup> constructs 1 vs. 3; and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> constructs 2 vs. 4) is present in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>2) Related to the above point, the authors need to give uncertainties on their binding constants (subsection “Structural determinants of the plus versus minus NES”, first paragraph and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>).

It will be easier for readers to understand if conventional curve fitting errors are reported</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for the inadvertent omission of an explanation of the error used in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We now include a brief description and a citation for the statistical method that was used to calculate the ranges reported along with the fitted K<sub>Ds</sub> in the main text, in subsection “Structural determinants of the plus versus minus NES”, that report the binding affinities of the various NESs: “Wild-type NESs MBP-hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and MBP-CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> bind CRM1 with K<sub>Ds</sub> of 2200nM [1600,2900] and 590nM [400,840], respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The chances that such sequences will appear in random sequence (and non-import sequences) are quite high. And maybe it should be even higher in folded domains where hydrophobic residues show this kind of periodicity to form amphipathic secondary structures. The authors should comment about these false positives, and how likely they are to influence their numbers. Would it be possible if additional criteria can be included in improve the prediction power? For example, the predicted NESs should not be a part of folded protein structure</italic>.</p><p>We strongly agree that using consensus sequences alone is not sufficient for NES prediction. In fact, we have discussed and addressed this issue at length in our previous papers on NES prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al. 2011</xref>; Xu et al., 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al, 2015</xref>). In those studies, we incorporated disorder prediction into our NES predictors, NESsential and LocNES, such that NES candidates are deemed less probable NESs if not located in disordered regions of proteins. We have revised the current manuscript to include a summary of our work on NES prediction (Discussion) where the use of sequence patterns along with incorporation of biophysical/structural properties such as disorder propensity and predicted solvent accessibility have significantly improved NES prediction. However, the prediction accuracy of our most recent and best NES predictor (LocNES) is still far from ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). We have observed that structural information of CRM1 cargos can be useful to exclude NES candidates that reside within folded domains and thus are most likely inaccessible to CRM1. We plan to include more 3D structural information into our NES prediction schemes as more PDB entries of CRM1 cargos become available and modeling of 3D structures becomes more facile. In the meantime, we rephrased the Discussion accordingly (“Finally, accurate prediction of NESs has been difficult […] are the training/testing datasets for the development of our next generation NES predictors).</p><p><italic>4) The authors are suggested to include at least one omit map in the main text, as this validation is essential to determine the directionality of NES binding to CRM1</italic>.</p><p>We have included omit maps for both hRio2<sup>NES</sup> and CPEB4<sup>NES</sup> in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
