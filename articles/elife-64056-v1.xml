ATP-dependent proteolytic machine, which selectively degrades damaged proteins or native proteins carrying exposed motifs (degrons). Here we characterize the structural basis for substrate recognition and discrimination by the N-terminal domain (NTD) of LonA. The results reveal that the six NTDs are attached to the hexameric LonA chamber by flexible linkers such that the formers tumble independently of the latter. Further spectral analyses show that the NTD selectively interacts with unfolded proteins, protein aggregates, and degron-tagged proteins by two hydrophobic patches of its N-lobe, but not intrinsically disordered substrate, α-casein. Moreover, the NTD selectively binds to protein substrates when they are thermally induced to adopt unfolded conformations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that NTDs enable LonA to perform protein quality control to selectively degrade proteins in damaged states and suggest that substrate discrimination and selective degradation by LonA are mediated by multiple NTD interactions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are many different types of protein which each have different roles in biology. Most proteins are surrounded by water and are folded so that their water-attracting regions are on the outside and more fat-like regions, which repel water, are on the inside. When a protein becomes damaged or is assembled incorrectly, some of the fat-like regions end up on the outside of the protein and become exposed to water. This can prevent the protein from performing its role and harm the cell instead.</p><p>LonA proteases are responsible for dismantling and recycling these harmful proteins, as well as proteins that have been labelled for destruction. They do this by unfolding the unwanted protein and transporting it into an enclosed chamber made of six LonA molecules. Once inside the chamber, the target protein is broken down into smaller fragments that can be used to build other structures.</p><p>LonA proteases contain a region called the N-terminal domain, or NTD for short, which is thought to be responsible for identifying which proteins need degrading. Yet it remained unclear how the NTD recognizes and binds to these target proteins. To answer this question, Tzeng et al. studied the detailed structure of a LonA protease that had been purified from bacteria cells. This revealed that the NTD of LonA contains two water-repelling regions which bind to fat-like segments on the surface of proteins that have become unfolded or tagged for destruction.</p><p>Further experiments showed that the NTD is bound to the main body of LonA via a ‘flexible linker’. This led Tzeng et al. to propose that the NTD sways around loosely at the end of LonA searching for proteins with exposed water-repelling regions. Once an NTD identifies and attaches to a target, the NTDs of the other LonA molecules then bind to the protein and help insert it into the chamber.</p><p>Proteases are a vital component of all biological systems. Controlling protein destruction and recycling is a key factor in how cells divide and respond to a changing environment. This study provides new insights into how LonA operates in bacteria, which may apply to proteases more widely. This contributes to our knowledge of fundamental biology and may also be relevant in a range of diseases where protein recycling is defective or inefficient.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Lon AAA+ protease</kwd><kwd>N-terminal domain</kwd><kwd>degrons</kwd><kwd>misfolded proteins</kwd><kwd>protein aggregates</kwd><kwd>Meiothermus taiwanensis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST108-2113-M-002-006-</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzeng</surname><given-names>Shiou-Ru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST109-2113-M-002-018-</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzeng</surname><given-names>Shiou-Ru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST105-2320-B-001-015-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Chung-I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006477</institution-id><institution>National Taiwan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>108L7809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzeng</surname><given-names>Shiou-Ru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006477</institution-id><institution>National Taiwan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109L7809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzeng</surname><given-names>Shiou-Ru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The N-terminal domains enable Lon protease to discriminate and capture selected protein species for degradation by exposed hydrophobic patches and flexible linkages to the hexameric core complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Lon AAA+ protease (LonA), previously known as the protease La, is an ATP-dependent protease distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charette et al., 1981</xref>). It forms a homo-hexamer to execute its biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldberg et al., 1994</xref>). LonA belongs to the AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) superfamily and contains an N-terminal domain (NTD), a middle ATPase domain with conserved Walker motifs for ATP hydrolysis, and a C-terminal protease domain (CTD) with a serine-lysine catalytic dyad in the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rotanova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Botos et al., 2004</xref>). LonA is responsible for degrading damaged or unfolded proteins, as well as native proteins bearing specific recognition elements, known as degradation tags or degrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Higashitani et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wohlever et al., 2014</xref>). How can LonA discriminate its substrates from other non-substrate proteins in a cell? Substrate recognition of LonA is thought to be mediated by its NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ebel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roudiak and Shrader, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rudyak and Shrader, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Melnikov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>). The substrates are unfolded and translocated in an ATP-dependent process into a secluded chamber formed by the ATPase and protease domains. Finally, the unfolded substrates inside the chamber can be degraded into small peptide fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottesman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker and Sauer, 2006</xref>). The ATP-dependent translocation process of substrates into the hexameric chamber has been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Su et al., 2016</xref>). Structures of different N-terminal fragments of LonA had been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duman and Löwe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EcLon), <italic>Mycobacterium avium complex</italic> (MacLon), and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (BsLon). However, no structural study has been conducted to analyze substrate interactions by the NTD either in isolation or in the context of full-length LonA.</p><p>Here we address the question of substrate recognition and discrimination by the NTD of LonA using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To understand how LonA selectively recognizes protein substrates being in damaged states, we have used a thermal stable LonA isolated from <italic>Meiothermus taiwanensis</italic> (termed MtaLonA henceforth), which allows temperature cycling experiments to be used for switching the populations of protein substrates in the folded and unfolded states. In this work, five various protein substrates have been employed for NMR experiments, which include (1) Ig2 (domains 5 and 6 of the gelation factor from <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>], hereafter abbreviated as Ig2) with an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold forming a dimer that is natively folded up to 40°C; (2) α-casein, which is an intrinsically disordered protein with no tertiary structure; (3) native lysozyme with four disulfide bridges and reduced lysozyme forming loose and flexible aggregates; (4) Ig2D5 (domain 5 of the gelation factor from <italic>D. discoideum</italic>), which is used for characterization of substrate conformation selection by the NTD; and (5) a degron-tagged Ig2D5 designed to identify the residues of degrons that can be recognized and bound by the NTD.</p><p>Our results show that the presence of MtaLonA NTD is required to degrade damaged proteins and native proteins with degrons, but it does not play an active role in mediating the degradation by LonA of an intrinsically disordered substrate, α-casein. Here we report the crystal structure of an N-terminal fragment of MtaLonA determined at a 2.1 Å resolution, demonstrating that it is similar to the structures of both EcLon and MacLon NTDs, but not to that of BsLon. MtaLonA NTD appears to tumble independently of the hexameric core complex, indicating that the NTD is attached to the hexameric chamber by a flexible linker thus rendering it possible for detailed chemical shift perturbation (CSP) mapping of substrate binding in the context of full-length MtaLonA. We further structurally characterize the NTD-mediated interactions with unfolded proteins, protein aggregates, and degron-tagged proteins. This work suggests that the flexibly linked NTDs can help survey, discriminate, and selectively capture damaged unfolded protein species or native protein substrates carrying exposed degradation sequence motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The NTD is essential for efficient degradation of a thermally unfolded substrate but not intrinsically disordered protein substrate, α-casein</title><p>To evaluate the importance of the NTD in the proteolysis activity of MtaLonA, we constructed a MtaLonA variant, AAAP, of which the NTD (residues 1–241) was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), based on the structure of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> LonA. Substrate degradation activity of AAAP was evaluated using two protein substrates, namely α-casein and Ig2. Native α-casein is an intrinsically disordered substrate of LonA. Ig2 is an all β-stranded protein that becomes partially unfolded at 55°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and only then is susceptible to proteolysis by MtaLonA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Higashitani et al., 1997</xref>). Full-length MtaLonA degrades both α-casein and damaged Ig2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Van Melderen et al., 1996</xref>). Compared to the full-length MtaLonA, AAAP exhibited a slightly reduced degradation activity against α-casein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), while its proteolytic activity for thermally unfolded Ig2 was severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results showed that, despite the lack of the NTD, AAAP retains the proteolytic activity for intrinsically disordered protein substrates like α-casein. However, the NTD is essential for MtaLonA to recognize and degrade the thermally damaged substrate, Ig2, indicating the NTD may mediate specific interactions with damaged Ig2, but not α-casein.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The NTD of <italic>Meiothermus taiwanensis</italic> LonA (MtaLonA) is essential for efficient degradation of a thermally unfolded substrate, but not the intrinsically disordered substrate, α-casein.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagrams illustrating domain organization of full-length MtaLonA and the N-terminal domain truncated AAAP.

Therefore, we further investigated the structural feature of the corresponding residues 207–243 of MtaLonA using solution-state NMR spectroscopy. Most of the well-dispersed cross-peaks in two-dimensional <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H HSQC NMR spectra of NN206 and NN243 can be well superimposed, indicating that the folded domain structure corresponding to residues 1–206 is not perturbed by the C-terminal extension, residues 207–243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Nonetheless, NN243 exhibited extra intense and poorly dispersed cross-peaks around 7.5–8.5 ppm along the proton dimension that is indicative of a highly disordered peptide segment, which most likely corresponds to the C-terminal extension of NN243. Together, our crystallographic and NMR analyses suggest that the NTD of MtaLonA forms a bilobal globular structure (residues 1–206) followed by a C-terminal flexible extension (residues 211–243).</p><p>LonA forms a large homo-hexameric complex resulting in a very high molecular weight of 0.5 MDa. To verify the dynamic feature of the NTD, we compared the backbone amide <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H NMR correlations of protonated NN206 and those of full-length MtaLonA (with perdeuteration of the non-exchangeable hydrogens) recorded at 55°C. With the aid of perdeuteration labeling and transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY), we observed over 200 well-resolved <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H correlations of full-length hexameric MtaLonA at an apparent molecular weight of 0.5 MDa. Importantly, most of these correlations were very similar to those observed in the NN206 spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and a systematic chemical shift offset was due to deuterium isotope effects. These results indicated that the NTD adopts the same structure as the isolated NTD while loosely tethered to the near-megadalton hexameric LonA core via a long flexible linker leading to an independently fast tumbling motion to yield highly favorable NMR relaxation properties and thus high-quality multidimensional NMR spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We further applied multidimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments to assign the observed cross-peaks in <sup>1</sup>H–<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectrum of NN206 (BMRB code: 50697) and the NMR-derived secondary structure of NN206, based on the Chemical Shift Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hafsa et al., 2015</xref>), was highly similar to its solved X-ray structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these results suggested that in a MtaLonA complex, each of the six NTDs may connect to the hexameric core by a flexible ~40-residue linker. Therefore, each 24-kDa NTD may tumble independently of the 350-kDa hexameric core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The chemical shifts of MtaLonA NTDs are perturbed by thermally unfolded proteins, aggregates, and degron tags</title><p>To directly observe substrate discrimination mediated by the NTD, we treated NMR samples by one thermal cycle with temperature increasing from 32°C to 55°C and then returning to 32°C. With temperature rising, the exposed hydrophobic areas of thermally unfolded Ig2 was increased, as detected by SYPRO Orange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the population of Ig2 in unfolded states is increased by thermal denaturation. By contrast, thermal cycling of isolated NN206 exhibited no temperature effects on its protein structure monitored by NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which could be explained by the high melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>) of full-length MtaLonA and NN206 (68.0°C and 85.5°C, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

By increasing temperature from 32°C to 55°C for the same NMR sample, dramatic variations in the 2D spectral features were detected and the resonances underwent a prominent decrease in intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that the NTD interacts with thermally unfolded Ig2. With temperature dropping from 55°C to 32°C, linewidth of the expected bound-state resonances was too broad to be detected in the presence of binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting a certain portion of Ig2 still stays in the unfolded or aggregated state.

The residues of MtaLonA NTD with the pronounced CSPs are part of the interaction interface located mainly at helix α1, loop L1, L2, L3, and β-sheet β2/β5/β4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4A</xref>), which consist primarily of hydrophobic residues and are decorated by a number of polar residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B and C</xref>). To characterize the binding sites of MtaLonA NTD interaction with damaged Ig2, we chose to mutate two exposed hydrophobic residues P22 and M85 located at the center of β-sheet β2/β5/β4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). We found that NN206*, containing two specific mutations P22A and M85A (hereafter NN206*), may influence the substrate-binding interaction. Spectral analysis showed chemical shift differences between NN206 and NN206* can be negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D and E</xref>), suggesting that they have very similar structures, with the exception of the region surrounding the point substitutions. The NMR sample containing both <sup>15</sup>N-labeled NN206* and unlabeled Ig2 was also treated with one thermal cycle. NN206* showed much weak interactions with thermal damaged Ig2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4F</xref>), confirming that this binding event is mainly contributed by the specific hydrophobic residues with high hydrophobicity in the N-lobe. Collectively, our results showed that the NTD of LonA selectively interacts with protein substrates via critical hydrophobic residues of its N-lobe, demonstrating that the NTD enables LonA to perform protein quality control by selectively interacting with proteins in damaged or unfolded states.</p><p>To further examine how the NTD is involved with protein aggregation, we probed the interactions between the scrambled lysozyme aggregate and MtaLonA NTD by NMR spectroscopy. Native lysozyme is a 14.3-kDa protein (129 amino acids) comprising four disulfide bridges while reduced lysozyme forms loose and flexible aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). TCEP (Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine; nonthiol-based reducing agent) drives the formation of amorphous lysozyme aggregates. Moreover, there is no cysteine residue found in full-length MtaLonA, suggesting TCEP does not affect the structure of MtaLonA NTD. Addition of TCEP-treated denatured lysozyme leaded to substantial spectral changes of NN206 resonances recorded at 32°C, while NN206* only showed marginal CSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>). The structural mapping showed that the affected residues were also located mainly in the N-lobe shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B and C</xref>. Furthermore, we also examined the degradation activity of MtaLonA against either native or denatured lysozyme, respectively. A gel-based assay showed that full-length MtaLonA can efficiently degrade denatured-reduced lysozyme, but not native lysozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5D</xref>). Accordingly, AAAP, without the NTD, was inactive against either the scrambled lysozyme aggregate or native lysozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5E</xref>). Together, these results highlighted the key role of NTD, via the N-lobe region, in discriminating and recognizing protein aggregates before subsequent translocation and degradation.</p><p>LonA can also degrade natively folded proteins with degradation tags such as Sul20 degron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Higashitani et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gur and Sauer, 2008</xref>).

To understand how the NTD directly interacts with degrons, a 20-residue peptide (the C-terminal 20 residues of SulA; namely Sul20) was synthesized and used for NMR titration experiments. Addition of unlabeled Sul20 caused significant spectral changes of NN206 resonances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and the structural mapping showed that the affected residues were again located at β‐sheet β2/β5/β4, loop L1, L3, and helix α1 of the N-lobe subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

By addition of unlabeled NN206 to isotopically enriched Ig2D5-S20, we observed chemical shift changes and broadened resonances of C-terminal Sul20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>), suggesting that residues Y19 and H20 are strongly affected by the binding event based on the resonance broadening beyond detection. The secondary structure of Sul20 remained random coil in the presence of MtaLonA NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The NMR spectrum of Ig2D5-S20 in the presence of an equimolar amount of unlabeled NN206* showed a much less pronounced chemical shift effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>) than wild-type NN206 binding to Ig2D5-S20, indicating that Sul20 tag can be recognized by the hydrophobic patches of N-lobe of MtaLon NTD. Furthermore, we generated a Y19A/H20A double mutant in Ig2D5-S20 construct (hereafter abbreviated as Ig2D5-S20-Y19A/H20A). To investigate an effect attributed to Y19A/H20A double mutant, a gel-based assay was performed at 42°C while Ig2D5 was still at its native state. The results showed that the degradation by the full-length MtaLonA against Y19A/H20A double mutant of Sul20 was much less efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The NMR spectra of Ig2D5-S20 and Ig2D5-S20-Y19A/H20A were well superimposed and only the chemical shifts of residues Y19A and H20A were prominently changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). By addition of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled NN206 to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Ig2D5-S20-Y19A/H20A, careful comparison of chemical shifts revealed that no obvious changes, suggesting that Y19A/H20A double mutant indeed significantly reduces the binding with NN206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The thermally unfolded conformations of substrate proteins are stabilized by engagement with MtaLonA NTD</title><p>To understand further selective recognition of protein substrate in the unfolded states by the NTD, we asked whether the unfolding-refolding process of substrate may be modulated by interacting with the NTD. To investigate how the conformations of substrates are influenced in the presence of NTDs, we constructed a single-domain protein substrate Ig2D5 for NMR experiments due to its high-quality NMR spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). About 96% of the backbone resonances of Ig2D5 can be assigned by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments. Ig2D5 is a β-sheet protein with Ig-like fold and the T<sub>m</sub> of substrate Ig2D5 is similar to Ig2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Here we applied NMR spectroscopy to investigate the unfolding-refolding equilibrium of Ig2D5 induced by temperature cycling while the structure of MtaLon NTD remained stable. The NMR samples containing isotopically enriched Ig2D5 in the absence and presence of unlabeled NN206 were heated from 32°C to 60°C and then cooled to 32°C. Based on the intensity changes of resonances corresponding to native Ig2D5, we estimated that isolated Ig2D5 was largely unfolded at 60°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>; coloured green) and ~72% of Ig2D5 was folded after one thermal cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, in the presence of equimolar NN206, the folded ratio of Ig2D5 was reduced to ~15% after thermal treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; coloured blue). Similar results were obtained using equimolar full-length MtaLonA with catalytic mutant S678A (LonA*) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; coloured orange). However, on addition of equimolar AAAP* (residues 242–793 with catalytic mutant S678A), ~75% of Ig2D5 were folded under the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; coloured black). The results revealed that the unfolded state of Ig2D5 was engaged with MtaLon NTD and the temperature-induced unfolding-refolding of substrate was significantly affected in the presence of MtaLon NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Accordingly, we also examined how the unfolding-refolding of Ig2D5 could be affected by NN206*. After one thermal cycle, about 75% of Ig2D5 was folded in the presence of equimolar NN206* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Upon addition of eightfold excess of NN206*, about 60% of Ig2D5 was folded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that NN206* interacts with denatured protein substrates weakly. These results demonstrated that the conformations of Ig2D5 may be affected by the hydrophobic substrate-binding interaction and the thermally unfolded states of substrate proteins can be stabilized by engagement with the NTDs. Thus, by selectively interacting with hydrophobic residues exposed in the thermally unfolded states of substrate proteins, the NTDs prominently perturb temperature-induced unfolding-refolding process of substrates.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The unfolding-refolding of Ig2D5 is affected in the presence of MtaLonA NTDs.</title><p>2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC NMR spectra of Ig2D5 in the absence (green) and presence of NN206 (blue), LonA* (full-length MtaLonA with catalytic mutant S678A; coloured orange), or AAAP* (residues 242–793 with catalytic mutant S678A; coloured black) recorded through one thermal cycle starting from 32°C (<bold>A</bold>) to 60°C (<bold>B</bold>), and then returning to 32°C (<bold>C</bold>).

Native α-casein is an intrinsically disordered protein; by contrast, the native Ig2 is a β-sheet protein with T<sub>m</sub> at 46°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We show that the construct AAAP devoid of the NTD (residues 242–793, ATPase and protease domains), which retains wild-type ATPase and peptidase activities in LonA, lacks the degradation activity against thermally denatured Ig2 while exhibits a wild-type-like activity against α-casein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, the NTD is specific for denatured or damaged protein substrates, whose hydrophobic core regions normally buried in the folded state become exposed, but not for intrinsically disordered substrates like casein, which contains mainly charged or polar residues and lack hydrophobic regions in the protein sequence. Indeed, it has been shown that LonA prefers substrates rich in hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gur and Sauer, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our crystallographic results of NN206 and NN291 are consistent with previous findings that the ~40 residue region between the NTD and ATPase–Protease domains is structurally flexible with multiple accessible protease sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roudiak and Shrader, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duman and Löwe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Patterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vasilyeva et al., 2002</xref>). This notion is also corroborated by our high-resolution NMR analyses on MtaLonA NTD both in isolation and as a part of the full-length protein, demonstrating that the independently fast tumbling motion of the NTDs in the ~0.5 MDa hexameric assembly of LonA. Moreover, their highly favorable NMR relaxation properties have allowed us to analyze the interactions of the NTD with unfolded proteins, protein aggregates, degron tags, and intrinsically disordered substrates. Our work provides atomic details of the NTD-mediated substrate discrimination by temperature-based switching of the native folded protein to its unfolded state in an NMR sample. NMR characterization indicates MtaLonA NTD does not interact with well-folded Ig2, native lysozyme, or intrinsically disordered α-casein, whereas unfolded proteins, aggregates, and degron tags can elicit pronounced chemical shift changes to the N-lobe of its NTD, which is subsequently confirmed by structure-based mutagenesis. Collectively, these results suggest that LonA has two substrate-interacting modes: (1) the NTD-non-requiring mode for intrinsically disordered substrates lacking hydrophobic-rich region, which may be engaged directly with the pore-loops in the LonA assembly without involving the six NTDs; (2) the NTD-requiring mode for recognizing and trapping damaged/denatured substrates with exposed hydrophobic regions before their engagement with the pore-loops of the LonA assembly. The key role of NTD is to enable LonA to perform protein quality control to selectively capture and degrade proteins in damaged unfolded states.</p><p>Compared with two‐lobe organization of LonA NTDs, bacterial FtsH proteases have compact N domains formed by a topology of β1-α1-β2-β3-β4-α2-β5, while ClpXP and ClpEP proteases include N-terminal Zinc-binding domains. ClpAP and ClpCP proteases, as well as of ClpB chaperones, consist of globular α‐helical N domains which bear striking resemblances to the C-lobe of MtaLonA NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rotanova et al., 2019</xref>). All these N domains, although structurally very distinct, are thought to mediate the interactions with substrates or adaptor proteins. The periplasmic N-domain of FtsH contributes to oligomerization and is essential for modulation the activity of the hexamer in conjunction with the membrane proteins HflK and Hfl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scharfenberg et al., 2015</xref>). The N-domain of ClpX is required for recognition of adaptors and some substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker and Sauer, 2012</xref>). The role of ClpB NTD in protein disaggregation is well characterized by NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosenzweig et al., 2015</xref>), demonstrating that ClpB chaperone recognizes exposed hydrophobic stretches in unfolded or aggregated client proteins via a substrate-binding groove in its NTD. In the presence of ClpB NTD, the stability of client proteins can be seriously affected, indicating that the binding of client proteins to ClpB NTD selectively stabilizes their unfolded conformations. Interestingly, intrinsically disordered α-casein can significantly interact with ClpB NTD, but not MtaLonA NTD. Taken together, the α-helical NTD of ClpB chaperones and the beta-stranded N-lobe of MtaLonA NTD comprise substrate-binding sites that play similar roles in specifically recognizing exposed hydrophobic stretches in unfolded or aggregated proteins.</p><p>By analyzing the NTD of MtaLonA interactions with damaged Ig2, the scrambled lysozyme, and Sul20 peptide, we conclude that these binding events are mediated by two hydrophobic patches, which comprise (1) L10, V14, I15, P22, V23, and M85 (termed hpI in the following); (2) M75, L77, P78, and L82 (termed hpII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Our results also demonstrate that a double mutant NN206* (P22 and M85 replaced by Alanine), resulted in decreased hydrophobicity of hpI, has a significant effect on the ability of MtaLonA NTD to bind damaged proteins, indicating that the hydrophobic patches can be essential for substrate recognition and discrimination. We also examine the exposed hydrophobic residues of β-sheet β2/β5/β4, loop L1, and loop L3 located at the N-lobes of other reported structures of LonA NTDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duman and Löwe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).

In contrast, the structures of the N-terminal fragments from MtaLon, EcLon, and MacLon show that the N- and C-lobes are joined together via a short linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Interestingly, the NTD of MacLon shows merged hp I and II, while the hpI of BsLon NTD is a little distant from hpII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). The structural comparison reveals that, similarly to MtaLon NTD, all three reported structures exhibit exposed hp I and II with slight variations in their shapes and sizes, suggesting that the conserved hydrophobic patches at the N-lobes may be potentially responsible for conferring substrate selectivity toward damaged proteins and degrons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The NTD of MtaLonA selectively interacts with unfolded proteins, protein aggregates, and degron-tagged proteins via two hydrophobic patches of its N-lobe.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Based on the titration data, two hydrophobic patches at the N-lobe of MtaLonA are defined as follows: (1) L10, V14, I15, P22, V23, and M85 (termed hpI in the following); (2) M75, L77, P78, and L82 (termed hpII).

Here, our results show the C-terminal Sul20 has substantially low heteronuclear NOE values, reflecting this region undergoes rapid local motion and is solvent exposed in solution. Therefore, MtaLonA NTD can easily recognize and interact with the C-terminal aromatic and hydrophobic residues of Sul20. This finding indicates that a pair of aromatic residues consisting of Y19 and H20 in Sul20 may play crucial roles in the hydrophobic interactions with residues P22 and M85 of MtaLonA NTD, which is verified with a double-mutant NN206*. The analysis of the interaction of NN206 or NN206* with Ig2D5-S20 or Ig2D5-S20-Y19A/H20A suggests that the exposed substrate regions with aromatic or hydrophobic side chains are main determinants for their engagement with NN206, which forms a binding site with similar hydrophobic residues. The primarily hydrophobic or aromatic interactions with NN206, however, do not lead to specific disorder-to-order transition of the substrate, forming for example an extended or helical structures in the bound state. Perhaps, specific backbone or side-chain interactions are not involved in substrate binding by NN206. Rather, the N-lobe of NN206 engages non-specific interactions with non-contiguous patches of exposed hydrophobic residues of the substrates, thereby serving a role mainly to trap the substrates and keep them to the proximity of the AAA+ ring. Furthermore, by selectively binding to hydrophobic residues exposed in the thermally unfolded states of proteins, the NTDs prominently stabilize substrate’s unfolded conformation. These results show that the NTD–substrate interactions involve the hydrophobic residues on both partners, suggesting aromatic and hydrophobic side chains, which are usually buried in the native proteins, are important for the NTD to enable MtaLonA to selectively capture and degrade proteins in a damaged unfolded state or with degron tags.</p><p>Our results directly demonstrate that thermally damaged proteins and degrons induce chemical shift changes and broadened resonances located mainly in the two hydrophobic patches of N-terminal lobe, but we do not find evidence that the C-lobe of the NTD is involved in substrate interaction. However, upon titration of thermally unfolded Ig2 into U-<sup>2</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N-labelled full-length LonA*, affected residues were shown in both N- and C-lobes of MtaLonA* NTD at 55°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Compared <sup>1</sup>H–<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of protonated NN206 and highly deuterated MtaLonA* in the presence of thermally unfolded protein Ig2, the signals from the C-lobe of MtaLonA* NTD showed notable line broadening, suggesting that other NTDs of LonA* hexamer may join to interact with substrates. It is likely that when a substrate like Ig2 becomes damaged or partially unfolded one or more Lon binding sites are exposed. The multiple NTDs in the ~0.5 MDa hexameric assembly of LonA can work as team players and show the avidity effect on substrate binding. When one NTD of LonA hexamer binds to and tethers a substrate nearby, it would be easier for other NTDs to make further substrate contacts. All together, these results reveal the free molecular tumbling of the NTD and its substrate-binding site, based on which a model involving multi-NTD interactions, may be proposed for substrate recognition. The flexibly linked NTD of the hexametric LonA is swaying from side to side and back and forth to survey, recognize, and trap substrates with exposed hydrophobic sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). After initial binding, other NTDs may join to increase the avidity of the LonA–substrate interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>); the engagement of a substrate protein by multiple NTDs also serves to facilitate effective substrate unfolding and translocation mediated by the coordinated movements of the pore-loops in the ATPase modules of the LonA chamber, powered by cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Finally, the substrate polypeptide chain is pulled inside the chamber and undergoes proteolysis by protease modules of LonA.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for NTD-mediated substrate interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <sup>1</sup>H–<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of protonated <sup>15</sup>N-labeled NTD in the absence (black) and presence (magenta) of unlabeled Ig2 recorded at 55°C.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quickchange kit (Stratagene). NN206 (1–206 residues), NN243 (1–243 residues), and NN291 (1–291 residues) were cloned into pET-modified vector with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site. The three resultant plasmids, encoding the proteins NN206, NN243, and NN291 with the N-terminal His-tag, were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells. The target proteins synthesis was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-thio-β-D-galactoside (IPTG) at an absorbance at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) ~0.6 at 28°C.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Rina Rosenzweig as a Reviewing Editor and David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Björn Burmann (Reviewer #1); Mark Foster (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Tzeng et al. provide molecular insights into the mode of substrate recognition by the N-terminal flexible domain of the ubiquitous AAA+ protease. The authors combine atomic resolution structural information from NMR spectroscopy together with functional data to show that LonA selectively interacts with unfolded proteins, protein aggregates, and degron-tagged proteins by two hydrophobic patches located in its N-terminal domain.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors show that the NTD binds to hydrophobic regions exposed only in the thermally unfolded states of substrate proteins, with this binding blocking their refolding. These findings suggest that LonA selectively recognizes damaged and misfolded proteins via the interaction of their exposed hydrophobic residues with LonA N-terminal domains.</p><p>Overall, all reviewers agree that the results presented in this paper are of great interest and advance the field of protein quality control by AAA+ machineries. However, while the majority of the authors' conclusions are well supported by the presented data, the reviewers feel that the following points must be addressed prior to considering this manuscript for a publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The majority of the NMR data presented in this manuscript is qualitative. In order to support the conclusion of the paper, quantitative analysis of the NMR data should also be provided.</p><p>This, would include chemical shift perturbation and/or intensity ratio plots for 15N NN206 + Ig2 (Figure 3), 15N NN206* mutant + Ig2 (Figure 3), 15N NN206 + Sul20 (Figure 4), and 15N Ig2D5-S20 + NN206 (Figure 5) interactions, as well as for the data presented in supplementary figures Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, S4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and E.</p><p>In addition, the authors should provide a comparison between the NMR-derived secondary structure for the NN206 construct and their solved X-ray structure.</p><p>Furthermore, an analysis should also be included of the changes to the conformation / secondary structure of Sul20 upon interaction with NN206.</p><p>2) It would be helpful for the reader if the Discussion section included a detailed analysis of how the mechanism of LonA NTD substrate recognition and subsequent unfolding, uncovered in this manuscript, compares to other known proteins with similar functions – for example heat shock proteins or other chaperones, chaperonins, or other protein quality control members.</p><p>3) In general, the quality of the figures should be improved and the figures need to be remade so they fit into a single page / panel. Some of the material can be moved from the main to the supplementary.</p><p>It would be helpful for the readers if a thorough and consistent color coding of the different domains were used. The axis labels for the spectra should also be consistent throughout the figure/panel and should be written in a large enough font to read in the printed version. We would further suggest avoiding the use of red and green side by side in the figures.</p><p>4) The backbone resonance assignments should be deposited to the BMRB.</p><p>In addition we believe the following two suggestions made by the reviewers could greatly strengthen the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>1) The authors very convincingly show the importance of P22 and M85 to substrate recognition by characterizing the catalytic and structural/interaction properties of the P22A/M85A double mutant. Based on NMR spectra, they identify Y19 and H20 of the Sul20 degron as potentially lynchpin residues for the interaction with NN206. Showing that a Y19A/H20A double mutant of Sul20 does not bind the NTD and does not target proteins for degradation by the full-length protease would strengthen this conclusion.</p><p>2) The authors propose a model for substrate recognition and binding by the NTD of LonA, based on their new data and available structures. In this model (Figure 7C,D) the substrate is bound by one NTD in an &quot;open&quot; conformation, then is sequestered by binding to multiple NTDs. The model is supported by the observation that when the Ig2 substrate is added to full-length MtaLonA, amide resonances assignable to NTDs are significantly broadened, whereas if the substrate were engaged by a single NTD one would expect to observe the resonances from the other non-engaged NTDs. Although this model would be strengthened by quantitative data on stoichiometry and affinity, the model is certainly consistent with the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64056.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The majority of the NMR data presented in this manuscript is qualitative.

ClpAP and ClpCP proteases, as well as of ClpB chaperones, consist of globular α‐helical N domains which bear striking resemblances to the C-lobe of MtaLonA NTD. All these N domains, although structurally very distinct, are thought to mediate the interactions with substrates or adaptor proteins. The periplasmic N-domain of FtsH contributes to oligomerization and is essential for modulation the activity of hexamer in conjunction with the membrane proteins HflK and Hfl. The N-domain of ClpX is required for recognition of adaptors and some substrates. The role of ClpB NTD in protein disaggregation is well characterized by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating that ClpB chaperone recognizes exposed hydrophobic stretches in unfolded or aggregated client proteins via a substrate-binding groove in its NTD. In the presence of ClpB NTD, the stability of client proteins was seriously affected, indicating that the binding of client proteins to ClpB NTD selectively stabilizes their unfolded conformations. Interestingly, intrinsically disordered α-casein can significantly interact with ClpB NTD but not MtaLonA NTD. Taken together, the α-helical NTD of ClpB chaperone and the β-stranded N-lobe of MtaLonA NTD comprise substrate-binding sites that play similar roles in specifically recognizing exposed hydrophobic stretches in unfolded or aggregated proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In general, the quality of the figures should be improved and the figures need to be remade so they fit into a single page / panel.

Based on NMR spectra, they identify Y19 and H20 of the Sul20 degron as potentially lynchpin residues for the interaction with NN206. Showing that a Y19A/H20A double mutant of Sul20 does not bind the NTD and does not target proteins for degradation by the full-length protease would strengthen this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The point is well taken. To address the above points, we generated a Y19A/H20A double mutant in Ig2D5-S20 construct (hereafter abbreviated as Ig2D5-S20-Y19A/H20A) and have added the results in the text as follows:</p><p>“To investigate an effect attributed to Y19A/H20A double mutant, a gel-based assay was performed at 42°C while Ig2D5 was still at its native state. The results showed that the degradation by the full-length protease against Y19A/H20A double mutant of Sul20 is much less efficient (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). The NMR spectra of Ig2D5-S20 and Ig2D5-S20-Y19A/H20A can be well superimposed and only the chemical shifts of residues Y19A and H20A are largely changed (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and 2C). By addition of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled NN206 to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Ig2D5-S20-Y19A/H20A, careful comparison of chemical shifts reveals that no changes, suggesting that a Y19A/H20A double mutant indeed significantly reduces the binding with NN206 (Figure 4F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors propose a model for substrate recognition and binding by the NTD of LonA, based on their new data and available structures. In this model (Figure 7C,D) the substrate is bound by one NTD in an &quot;open&quot; conformation, then is sequestered by binding to multiple NTDs. The model is supported by the observation that when the Ig2 substrate is added to full-length LonA, amide resonances assignable to NTDs are significantly broadened, whereas if the substrate were engaged by a single NTD one would expect to observe the resonances from the other non-engaged NTDs. Although this model would be strengthened by quantitative data on stoichiometry and affinity, the model is certainly consistent with the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer comment and suggestion. It is likely that when a substrate like Ig2 becomes damaged or partially unfolded one or more Lon binding sites are exposed. The multiple NTDs in the ~0.5 MDa hexameric assembly of LonA can work as team players and show avidity effect on substrate bonding. When one NTD of LonA hexamer binds to and tethers a substrate nearby, it would be easier for other NTDs to make further substrate contacts. In fact, we have tried to detect the stoichiometry and affinity for the interaction between unfolded Ig2 and full-length LonA by ITC at 55°C; however, the change of binding enthalpy is too small to characterize the thermodynamics of this interaction. We also had thought an alternate biophysical method (e.g., SPR) to explore the stoichiometry but it is difficult to perform experiments at 55°C.</p></body></sub-article></article>
