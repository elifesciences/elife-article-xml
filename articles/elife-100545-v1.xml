In MPXV, the H3 protein mediates viral adhesion through its interaction with heparan sulfate (HS), yet the structural details of this interaction have remained elusive. Using AI-based structural prediction tools and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified a novel, positively charged α-helical domain in H3 that is essential for HS binding. This conserved domain, found across <italic>orthopoxviruses</italic>, was experimentally validated and shown to be critical for viral adhesion, making it an ideal target for antiviral drug development. Targeting this domain, we designed a protein inhibitor, which disrupted the H3-HS interaction, inhibited viral infection in vitro and viral replication in vivo, offering a promising antiviral candidate.

Proteins that mediate these interactions have been identified as essential therapeutic targets, offering promising opportunities for antiviral therapies. In <italic>orthopoxviruse</italic>s such as MPXV, the H3 protein plays a pivotal role in facilitating viral adhesion by binding to cell-surface heparan sulfate (HS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moss, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">da Fonseca et al., 2000a</xref>), a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) essential for viral entry. H3-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have shown to protective effects for rabbits and immunodeficient mice against lethal poxvirus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crickard et al., 2012</xref>). And H3 is a key component in recent mpox vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zuiani et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gulati et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the central role of H3 in MPXV infection and protection, the structural details of its specific interaction with HS remain elusive.</p><p>Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the H3-HS interaction is critical for advancing antiviral drug development. H3 is highly conserved across <italic>poxviruses</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), including VARV and VACV, making it a potential target for broad-spectrum therapies. The recent resurgence of MPXV infections has underscored the urgent need for specific antiviral treatments. Given the conserved nature of H3 across all known MPXV lineages, including clade Ib, which has been linked to the 2024 outbreak, designing therapies that target H3 could offer a robust solution to current and future outbreaks.</p><p>However, efforts to resolve the complete structure of H3-HS complex have been hampered by the dynamic and flexible nature of HS and the tendency of H3 self-cleavage. Classic structural biology techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, have been unable to capture the full interaction between H3 and HS due to these complexities. Therefore, alternative approaches are required to fully elucidate this critical interaction.</p><p>To address these challenges, we employed advanced AI-based protein structural prediction and generation tools, including AlphaFold2 (AF2) and RFdiffusion, alongside classic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These state-of-the-art computational techniques enabled us to identify key HS binding sites within H3 and to characterize the binding mechanisms of the previously uncharacterized α-helical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gräter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks et al., 2024</xref>). Corroborated by various experimental methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rief et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sieben et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raab et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller et al., 2009</xref>), the use of AI-driven tools proved pivotal in overcoming the limitations of traditional structural methods, allowing us to predict and validate the structure-function relationship of the H3-HS interaction. A powerful approach for unraveling complex protein-glycan interactions is demonstrated, offering new pathways for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dauparas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watson et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a novel helical domain for HS binding in H3</title><p>The H3 protein of MPXV is a 324 amino acid transmembrane protein conserved across all 12 identified <italic>orthopoxviruses</italic>. Previous studies have shown that its extracellular domain (residues 1–282) binds to cell-surface HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">da Fonseca et al., 2000b</xref>), facilitating viral entry in conjunction with other adhesion proteins and the fusion protein system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2000</xref>). Inhibiting the HS binding to H3, therefore, represents a promising strategy for developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapies against <italic>orthopoxviruses</italic>. While most structure of the extracellular region of VACV H3 (residues 1–240; PDB code: 5EJ0) has been solved, the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of HS as a biopolymer complicates the identification of precise binding sites.</p><p>To identify HS binding sites on the H3 protein, we first performed a comprehensive sequence and structural analysis. As a highly negatively charged GAGs, it is believed that HS interacts with positive charge residues on proteins by electrostatic interaction. Previous studies have indicated that the positively charged Mg (II) ion in H3 is critical for HS binding. Therefore, we focused on regions rich in basic amino acids—lysine (K), arginine (R), and histidine (H). Given that only the H3 structure from VACV was available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watson et al., 2023</xref>), we used AF2 to model the MPXV H3 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Our analysis revealed three potential HS binding motifs rich in positively charge residues: Motif 1 (K95, R96, R100), Motif 2 (K141, K146, K147), and Motif 3 (K161, K163) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan and Wang, 2013</xref>), all located within the homologous structure of VACV H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we also identified a cluster of seven additional positively charged residues (R242, H247, R248, K253, R259, K266, R267) in the protein C-terminal region. This region had not been previously structurally characterized due to its self-cleavage during sample preparation for X-ray diffraction studies, but was retained in all other biochemical and viral assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">da Fonseca et al., 2000b</xref>). AF2 predicted these residues to form a three-helical domain with high confidence (pLDDT score: 82.9 for overall structural; 80.6 for the helical domain, 100 for the maximum score), suggesting it may serve as an HS binding site as a structured domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also tested other models, such as ESMFold (pLDDT:70.6; 50.7) and RoseTTAFold2 (pLDDT: 70.2; 50.7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek et al., 2024</xref>). They all predict a helical structure. But their results are different in detail and had lower confidence scores. Thus, we used AF2 for further studies. Another concern is that the helical domain near the virus surface. Thus, we modeled the complete structure of H3 in virus using a model DPPC (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) membrane. It showed a dynamic movement between the helical domain and the membrane, with a maximum distance exceeding 1 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Thus, enough space be present for possible HS binding.</p><p>Flexible molecular docking and MD simulations identified the exact HS binding sites in the H3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eberhardt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). We used a 20-repeat HS unit with a specific composition for detailed analysis ([IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoA-GlcNS(3,6S)]<sub>5</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). A 500 ns MD simulation established the equilibrium conformation of H3, and subsequent docking with AutoDock Vina identified four high-scoring conformations for each motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The docking score calculated by the software reflects the total energy of interactions between molecules. Lower scores (more negative values) indicate more stable binding between the molecules.

A harmonic potential was applied to HS and gradually pulled away from H3, generating a series of reaction coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). The green force-extension curve represents the force during this stretching process. This curve, along with the corresponding PMF (potential of mean force) variation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, demonstrated the free energy changes throughout the umbrella sampling process, revealing that the helical domain possesses the highest binding affinity with a ΔG of –45 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have suggested the critical role of the Mg(II) ion in stabilizing HS binding, where its removal reduces binding efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, the α-helical domain is very close to the Mg(II)-bound region in H3. Notably, these two parts appear to form a distinct cavity-like binding pocket for HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, we conducted a 1000 ns REMD (replica exchange molecular dynamics) simulation of the H3-HS complex to further understand the binding dynamics. REMD, an advanced sampling technique, helps overcome the kinetic barriers typically encountered in conformational transitions by utilizing a series of temperature-controlled replicas to enhance the exploration of the conformational landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sugita and Okamoto, 1999</xref>). For this study, we set up 64 replicas over a temperature range from 310 K to 387 K, cumulatively simulating for 64 µs. This comprehensive simulation captured the HS molecule progressively binding deeper into a cavity formed by the α-helical domain, eventually interacting with the Mg (II) ion as hypothesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">Figure 2—video 3</xref>).</p><p>The free energy landscape, mapped out from these simulations, shows HS transitioning from a stable interaction with the helical domain across an energy barrier into the Mg (II)-enhanced cavity. This dual interaction—first with the helical domain and then with the Mg(II) site—was consistently observed to stabilize the complex further, evidenced by a significantly lower binding free energy of –67 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Govind Kumar et al., 2023</xref>). These results underscore the dynamic nature of the H3-HS interaction and validate our model of sequential binding, which could be critical for designing inhibitors that target these specific interactions.</p><p>Given the crucial role of electrostatic interactions in the HS-H3 binding process, we conducted an exhaustive analysis of salt bridge formations across all MD simulation trajectories. This analysis focused on the formation of salt bridges over time between the basic amino acids (R, K, H) of H3 and HS, with brighter areas indicating more frequent formation of salt bridges and robust interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). A bar graph accompanied these maps, quantifying the average number of salt bridges each amino acid formed during the simulations, further illustrating the intensity and frequency of these interactions. Our findings demonstrated a high affinity of HS for the helical domain of H3, with basic amino acids in this region forming more salt bridges compared to other parts of the protein. The surface hotspot map of H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) visually highlighted these interactions, with varying shades of blue representing the frequency of salt bridge formation, emphasizing their distribution and intensity. In the helical domain, a focus view showed that the 1st, 7th, 9th, and 18th sugar units of HS formed salt bridges with R248, R242, R267, and R259 of H3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, left), while the sulfate group on the 2nd sugar side chain of HS bound to Mg(II) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, right).</p><p>To further prove these findings, we performed two control experiments. First, we removed the Mg(II) ion during MD simulation. According to the results of umbrella sampling, we extended the simulation of the most stable H3-HS binding conformation to 1000 ns, then removed the Mg(II) ion and continued the simulations. The resulting increase in RMSD fluctuations confirmed the stabilizing role of Mg(II) in the binding process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video4">Figure 2—video 4</xref>). Second, we mutated all seven positively charged amino acids in the helical domain to serine, and name it H3 (uncharged). While AF2 predicted that the helical structure would remain intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), a significant alteration in HS binding dynamics was observed, supporting the critical role of these charged residues in stabilizing the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video5">Figure 2—video 5</xref>).</p><p>Our interaction model revealed that the α-helical domain of H3 functions like a thumb, guiding HS into a stable binding position, while the Mg(II) region acts like a palm, securing HS in place. This dynamic interaction allows HS to transition from an initial surface-level binding to being deeply anchored within the protein cavity, illustrating a complex yet well-organized binding process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).</p><p>Bioinformatic analysis of the H3 protein across the Poxviridae family highlights its evolutionary conservation and its significance in HS binding. Given the crucial role of electrostatic interactions in the H3-HS binding process, we analyzed the charge distribution within the helical domain.

Using NCBI’s BLAST, we retrieved sequences of these 66 H3 proteins and performed multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>). A heatmap detailing the side-chain charge distribution at a physiological pH of 6.5—mimicking the microenvironment of H3-HS interaction—revealed a significant concentration of positive charges at the helical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, structural predictions using AF2 showed that all these 66 sequences generally share a similar architecture to MPXV H3, particularly in the presence of the α-helical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Charge characteristics and structural analysis of H3 protein.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The heatmap shows the amino acid charge distribution in the H3 protein across 66 Poxviridae viruses, following multiple sequence alignment.

After removing duplicate sequence data, multiple sequence alignment was performed using MEGA11, with the ClustalW method employed for sequence alignment. The alignment results were uploaded to the WebLogo website for logo image generation. Acidic amino acids, basic amino acids, polar amino acids, and non-polar amino acids were represented in red, blue, green, and black, respectively. The font size in the logo corresponds to the probability of occurrence of the amino acid at that position, with larger fonts indicating greater conservation of the amino acid. The charge analysis of the amino acid sequences was conducted using the ProteinAnalysis function of the Biopython package. Surface charge maps of the H3 protein were generated using Chimera, and the charge distribution was calculated using APBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>AFM-SMFS protein unfolding experiment</title><p>The AFM cantilever/tip made of silicon nitride (MLCT-BIO-DC, Bruker Corp.) was used. The detailed protocol for AFM tip functionalization and protein immobilization on the glass coverslip can be found in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). In short, the tip and glass coverslip were coated with the amino group by amino-silanization. N<sub>3</sub> is functionalized on the surface from the reaction between ImSO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>·HCl and –NH<sub>2</sub>. Then, a heterobifunctional DBCO-PEGn-Mal can be reacted and adds the Mal group. Next, the peptide GL-ELP<sub>20</sub>-C or C-ELP<sub>20</sub>-NGL was reacted to the maleimide via the cysteine, respectively. The long ELP<sub>20</sub> serves as a spacer to avoid non-specific interaction between the tip and the surface as well as a signature for the single-molecule event. Finally, target protein H3 with C-terminal NGL sequence or GB1-Doc with N-terminal GL sequence can be site-specifically linked to the coverslip or tip by AEP, respectively.</p><p>Atomic force microscope (Nanowizard4, JPK) was used to acquire the force-extension curve. The D tip of the MLCT-Bio-DC cantilever was used. Its accurate spring constant was determined by a thermally induced fluctuation method. Typically, the tip contacted the protein-immobilized surface for 100 m<italic>s</italic> under an indentation force of 350 pN to ensure a site-specific interaction. Then, moving the tip up vertically at a constant velocity (1 µm/s), the polyprotein unfolded. Then, the tip moved to another place to repeat this cycle several thousands of times. As a result, a force-extension curve was obtained, which was analyzed using JPK data process analysis software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>AFM-SMFS unbinding experiment of H3-HS on CHO-K1</title><p>Force-extension-based AFM measurement on model surfaces was performed in PBS buffer at room temperature using functionalized D tip of MLCT-Bio-DC cantilever (Bruker, nominal spring constant of 0.030 N/m and actual spring constants calculated using thermal tune). AFM (Nanowizard4, JPK) operated in the force mapping (contact) mode was used. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in a 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 24 hr prior to force spectroscopy experiments. The relative positioning of the AFM probe and the adherent cells was determined using an inverted microscope. Areas of 5×5 µm<sup>2</sup> were scanned, ramp size set to 350 nm, and set point force of 300 pN with a contact time of 200 m<italic>s</italic>, with a resolution of 32×32 pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Flow cytometry experiment</title><p>Protein binding to GAGs expressed on the surface of CHO-K1 cells was assessed using FCM, following the previously described methods. H3-eGFP, H3(uncharged)-eGFP, and eGFP proteins (5 μM) were incubated with 1 million cells (200 μL) at 4°C for 20 min. Post-incubation, cell analysis was performed using the CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman) to collect fluorescence signals in the FITC channel. A total of 15,000 events were collected using the CytExpert software (version 2.5; Beckman), with 10 sets of data collected in parallel. The data from the live-cell gating were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.6.2; Tree Star, San Carlos, CA, USA).</p><p>The FCM experiment to validate the inhibitory effects of inhibitors utilized the same equipment and methods as previously described. The final concentrations of H3-eGFP and the inhibitor were 2 μM and 10 μM, respectively, with a total volume of 600 μL. The control group contained only 2 μM H3-eGFP, with the volume made up with PBS. Data from five parallel experiments were collected, with each experiment gathering 15,000 events. Using FlowJo, the fluorescence intensity of the mean of FITC-area signal in the live-cell gate was analyzed, normalizing the relative fluorescence intensity of the control group to 1.</p><p>To further verify the concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of AI-Poxblock 723, we conducted a concentration-dependent FCM experiment. The final concentration of H3-eGFP remained at 2 μM, while 723 was tested at three final concentrations (100 μM, 50 μM, and 10 μM), with a total volume of 600 μL. The control group contained only 2 μM H3-eGFP without inhibitor. Data from five parallel experiments were collected, with 15,000 events recorded for each experiment. The mean fluorescence intensity in the FITC-area signal within the live-cell gate was analyzed using FlowJo software, normalizing the relative fluorescence intensity of the control group to 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Design of inhibitors targeting the H3 helical domain</title><p>To design inhibitors targeting the helical domain of H3, hotspots information was first inputted into RFdiffusion. The selected residues for this purpose were 239, 242, 267, 266, 259 of H3, and the length of the inhibitor sequences was set to be 40–80 amino acids. This process generated 1000 backbone structures. After excluding single-stranded helical structures, the remaining 633 structures underwent sequence recovery using ProteinMPNN, producing 10 sequences per structure. All 6330 sequences were then subjected to structure prediction and scoring using AF2. Structures with an iPTM score greater than 0.9 and a PAE score less than 6 were selected, while sequences containing Cys were excluded to avoid the formation of disulfide bonds.</p><p>RMSD calculations were performed between the predicted structures and the RFdiffusion-designed structures, and sequences with an RMSD greater than 1.5 nm were excluded to ensure consistency between the predicted and designed structures. Additionally, solubility assessments were conducted for all sequences. Specifically, a solubility parameter was assigned to each of the 20 natural amino acids, and an average was calculated for the entire sequence. The sequences with the highest solubility were selected for expression and interaction testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>MD simulations of H3 and its inhibitors</title><p>The AF2-predicted structure of the H3-inhibitor complex was used for the MD simulations, utilizing the previously mentioned MD software and force field. The MD simulation was conducted at 310 K for 500 ns. Subsequently, the RMSD of the simulation trajectory was calculated using the built-in ‘rms’ program of GROMACS to analyze the stability of the inhibitor-H3 binding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>CD experiments</title><p>For CD experiments, AI-Poxblock723 and H3(240–279) were diluted to 0.15 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL in 10 mM K-PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.4) buffer, respectively. Spectra were acquired on a Chirascan V100 (Applied Photophysics). The data acquisition wavelength is set to 190–260 nm. All reported measurements were acquired within the linear range of the instrument.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>BLI binding experiments</title><p>BLI experiments were conducted using Octet HIS1K Biosensors on the Octet system. The buffer used throughout the experiments was uniform PBS. The tips were first pre-equilibrated in PBS solution for 10 min, followed by a 60 s baseline, 60 s loading, 100 s baseline, 100 s association, and 120 s dissociation steps. Baseline measurements of unloaded tips were subtracted from their matched measurement of the loaded tip. The inhibitor concentration was determined using the BCA method before loading and prepared at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL for the loading solution. The mass concentration of H3(1–282) and H3(1–239) was also determined using the BCA method, and their molar concentrations were calculated. The purity of H3 is above 60%. Various concentration samples were then prepared using a serial dilution method. After baseline correction and curve smoothing, a global fit was performed to calculate the K<sub>D</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Inhibition test for viral infection</title><p>Vero E6 cells were seeded at 1.5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well into 96-well plates and used the following day. AI-Poxblocks threefold serial diluted in maintenance medium were mixed with an equal volume of diluted live VACV or MPXV and then incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Medium from 96-well plates was aspirated, and the inhibitor-virus mixture was added (100 μL/well), then the Vero E6 cells were incubated at 37°C for about 16 hr. Then cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution, permeabilized with Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated with the HRP-conjugated anti-VACV polyclonal antibodies (Invitrogen) diluted in the Perm/Wash buffer at room temperature for 2 hrs.</p><p>The reactions were developed with KPL TrueBlue Peroxidase substrates (Seracare Life Sciences). The numbers of infected foci were calculated using an EliSpot reader (Cellular Technology Ltd). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated using GraphPad Prism software using the log (inhibitor) vs. normalized response-variable slope (four parameters) model. Experiments with live MPXV were performed in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility following standard biosafety practices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Animal experiments</title><p>Female BALB/c mice, 6–8 weeks of age, were obtained from GemPharmatech Co., Ltd (Guangdong, China). After arrival, all mice were acclimated for 3 days and then randomly assigned to experimental groups. For challenge, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1.25% tribromoethanol solution with a dosage of 20 μL/g. Intranasal infections were performed by introduction of 50 μL of virus into one nostril. Mock-infected control animals were similarly inoculated with an equivalent volume of diluent. After infection, mic e were given intraperitoneally with single dose of 10 mg/kg of AI-Poxblock723 or PBS. Animals were euthanized 4 days after infection for the determination of pulmonary viral titers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Animal ethics statement</title><p>Mice were housed in independent ventilation cages and utilized at five mice per treatment group.

Using a combination of advanced computational simulations and experimental validations, the authors discovered that this domain is essential for viral adhesion and potentially a new target for developing antiviral therapies.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study's main strengths include the use of cutting-edge computational tools such as AlphaFold2 and molecular dynamics simulations, combined with robust experimental techniques like single-molecule force spectroscopy and flow cytometry. These methods provided a detailed and reliable view of the interactions between the H3 protein and HS. The study also highlighted the importance of the α-helical domain's electric charge and the influence of the Mg(II) ion in stabilizing this interaction. The work's impact on the field is significant, offering new perspectives for developing antiviral treatments for MPXV and potentially other viruses with similar adhesion mechanisms. The provided methods and data are highly useful for researchers working with viral proteins and protein-polysaccharide interactions, offering a solid foundation for future investigations and therapeutic innovations.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have successfully addressed the questions raised in my review.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100545.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript presenting the discovery of a heparan-sulfate (HS) binding domain in monkeypox virus (MPXV) H3 protein as a new anti-poxviral drug target, presented by Bin Zhen and co-workers, is of interest, given that it offers a potentially broad antiviral substance to be used against poxviruses. Using new computational biology techniques, the authors identified a new alpha-helical domain in the H3 protein, which interacts with cell surface HS, and this domain seems to be crucial for H3-HS interaction. Given that this domain is conserved across orthopoxviruses, authors designed protein inhibitors. One of these inhibitors, AI-PoxBlock723, effectively disrupted the H3-HS interaction and inhibited infection with Monkeypox virus and Vaccinia virus. The presented data should be of interest to a diverse audience, given the possibility of an effective anti-poxviral drug.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In my opinion, the experiments done in this work were well-planned and executed. The authors put together several computational methods, to design poxvirus inhibitor molecules, and then they test these molecules for infection inhibition.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have addressed the comments I made in my review.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100545.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The article is an interesting approach to determining the MPOX receptor using &quot;in silico&quot; tools.

Using a combination of advanced computational simulations and experimental validations, the authors discovered that this domain is essential for viral adhesion and potentially a new target for developing antiviral therapies.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study's main strengths include the use of cutting-edge computational tools such as AlphaFold2 and molecular dynamics simulations, combined with robust experimental techniques like single-molecule force spectroscopy and flow cytometry. These methods provided a detailed and reliable view of the interactions between the H3 protein and HS. The study also highlighted the importance of the α-helical domain's electric charge and the influence of the Mg(II) ion in stabilizing this interaction. The work's impact on the field is significant, offering new perspectives for developing antiviral treatments for MPXV and potentially other viruses with similar adhesion mechanisms. The provided methods and data are highly useful for researchers working with viral proteins and protein-polysaccharide interactions, offering a solid foundation for future investigations and therapeutic innovations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>However, some limitations are notable. Despite the robust use of computational methodologies, the limitations of this approach are not discussed, such as potential sources of error, standard deviation rates, and known controls for the H3 protein to justify the claims. Additionally, validations with methodologies like X-ray crystallography would further benefit the visualization of the H3 and HS interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the evaluation and appreciation of our work. In response to the identified weakness, we have conducted additional analyses to further assess the limitations of the computational methodologies used. Specifically, we predicted the MPXV H3 structure using two other AI-based protein structure prediction models, ESMFold and RoseTTAFold2. Both models also predicted an a-helical structure, which supports our conclusion. However, they yielded lower pLDDT scores (Figure S1A-C in the revised SI), indicating that some error may be present.</p><p>We agree with this reviewer, as well as the other reviewers, that X-ray crystallography data for the H3 structure would be highly valuable. Unfortunately, we lack the expertise in structural biology to obtain these results at this stage. To complement this, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which suggest that the helical domain is connected to the main domain via a flexible linker. This flexibility may help explain the challenges in obtaining a high-resolution X-ray structure. In fact, to date, the only structural data available for H3 is from the VAVC, which excludes the helical domain (The helical domain part is cleaved for the X-ray studies). We have added this point to the discussion and hope that experts in structural biology will be able to resolve the structure of this domain in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript presenting the discovery of a heparan-sulfate (HS) binding domain in monkeypox virus (MPXV) H3 protein as a new anti-poxviral drug target, presented by Bin Zhen and co-workers, is of interest, given that it offers a potentially broad antiviral substance to be used against poxviruses. Using new computational biology techniques, the authors identified a new alpha-helical domain in the H3 protein, which interacts with cell surface HS, and this domain seems to be crucial for H3-HS interaction. Given that this domain is conserved across orthopoxviruses, authors designed protein inhibitors. One of these inhibitors, AI-PoxBlock723, effectively disrupted the H3-HS interaction and inhibited infection with Monkeypox virus and Vaccinia virus. The presented data should be of interest to a diverse audience, given the possibility of an effective anti-poxviral drug.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In my opinion, the experiments done in this work were well-planned and executed. The authors put together several computational methods, to design poxvirus inhibitor molecules, and then they test these molecules for infection inhibition.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One thing that could be improved, is the presentation of results, to make them more easily understandable to readers, who may not be experts in protein modeling programs. For example, figures should be self-explanatory and understood on their own, without the need to revise text. Therefore, the figure legend should be more informative as to how the experiments were done.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your appreciation of our work and your support. In response to the identified weakness, we have carefully reviewed all the figure legends to ensure they are more informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The article is an interesting approach to determining the MPOX receptor using &quot;in silico&quot; tools.

As you pointed out, the H3 protein, particularly the helical domain at the C-terminal, is indeed located close to the membrane, which could limit the available space for H3 binding. To investigate this further, we modeled the full-length H3 protein in the context of the membrane and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess the available space. Our results show that there is more than 1 nm of space between the helical domain and the membrane, which should be sufficient for potential heparan sulfate (HS) binding (see Figure 1E, and Figure S1D&amp;E in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor corrections:</p><p>Line 31: &quot;is an emerging zoonotic pathogen&quot; should be revised to reflect that Mpox is a re-emerging virus, given its history of causing outbreaks, such as in 2003.</p><p>Line 71 and Line 75: Adding an explanation of &quot;Mg binding sites&quot; and &quot;GAG motifs&quot; would enhance reader understanding, as these represent important points in the study.

Previous s NMR titration measurements have shown that UDP-glucose binds to H3, but no structural data for the complex exist.

So, it is not easy to see what are the authors referring to when they mention the Figure. For example, the text referring to Figure S8 mentions the GB1 domain and the Cohesin module, but these are not mentioned in Figure S8.</p><p>I do not understand the results presented in Figure 5B. It is not clear to me, from the Figure legend nor after reading the Material and Methods, how this experiment was done. Specifically, what is plotted on X, is it the amount of inhibitor or the amount of protein? These things have to be checked through the manuscript.</p><p>It would be interesting to confirm if the inhibition of infection is based on the inhibition of viral binding to the cells. This should not be complicated to realize, and it could provide evidence for the mechanism of action.</p><p>Extensive use of terms like &quot;this domain&quot; is not good in this type of article, like in lines 207, and 211. It is not always clear to what domain are authors referring to, so it may be much better to mention the domain in question by the exact name.</p><p>Line 337, If I am not mistaken dilutions are serial not series.</p><p>Line 613, in methods. Please use g force instead of rpm, it is more informative. Even if it is just to pellet cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your instructive comments. We have addressed most of them in the revised manuscript. For instance, the immobilization of the GB1 domain and the cohesin module is now mentioned in Figure S9. Additionally, in the previous Figure 5B, the &quot;x&quot; represents the concentration of the inhibitor. Serial and g force is updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Line 190</p><p>Did you mutate all the amino acids at the same time? What was the impact of all these mutations on the structure of the helical region? Or if you modeled the protein again after replacing these 7 amino acids, did you find that there was no difference? Regardless of your answer, you must include a superposition of the mutated structure and the wt.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the insightful comment. We have now also predicted the structure of the serine mutant using AlphaFold2 (AF2). As expected, the helical domain structure remains largely preserved with only minor differences. We have included these results in Figure S6, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2D</p><p>In this graph, the authors should indicate the ΔG as a negative value. In fact, the graph does not match the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reminder, it is corrected in the graph</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4B</p><p>Is the difference in binding force significantly different? 28.8 vs 33.7 pN</p></disp-quote><p>The absolute difference in binding force is not large (~5 pN). However, for a system with a relatively low binding force, this difference is significant. Specifically, the 5 pN difference accounts for approximately a 14% reduction in binding force. We have included this percentage in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5</p><p>If AI-PoxBlocks723 was the only peptide effective in inhibiting viral infection of MPOX and other related viruses but not with 100% effectiveness, do you think this could be a consequence of a low interaction efficiency or the existence of a different receptor? Or a secondary region of binding in the H3? Can you argue about this?</p></disp-quote><p>It has been proposed that there are other adhesion proteins for MPXV, such as D8, in addition to H3. We believe this accounts for the observed less-than-100% effectiveness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of peptides as &quot;inhibitory tools&quot; could have an interesting effect in vitro, however, in vivo the immunological response against the peptide will reduce/eliminate it, how you may optimize the &quot;drug&quot; development with this system, as you state in line 387.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. You are correct that the use of peptides as inhibitory tools could induce an immune response in vivo, which might limit their effectiveness over time. To optimize this approach for drug development, conjugate the peptides with carrier molecules, such as liposomes, nanoparticles, or dendrimers, which can protect the peptides from immune detection and improve their delivery to target cells. This could allow for more controlled and sustained release of the peptide in vivo, reducing the chances of immune clearance. We have added this discussion in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
