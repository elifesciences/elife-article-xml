proliferation and barrier formation in vitro. Whether these interactions are important in vivo, however, is unclear because previous studies reached conflicting conclusions (Prochera and Rao, 2023). To better define the roles of enteric glia in steady state regulation of the intestinal epithelium, we characterized the glia in closest proximity to epithelial cells and found that the majority express the gene Proteolipid protein 1 (<italic>PLP1</italic>) in both mice and humans. To test their functions using an unbiased approach, we genetically depleted PLP1<sup>+</sup> cells in mice and transcriptionally profiled the small and large intestines. Surprisingly, glial loss had minimal effects on transcriptional programs and the few identified changes varied along the gastrointestinal tract. In the ileum, where enteric glia had been considered most essential for epithelial integrity, glial depletion did not drastically alter epithelial gene expression but caused a modest enrichment in signatures of Paneth cells, a secretory cell type important for innate immunity. In the absence of PLP1<sup>+</sup> glia, Paneth cell number was intact, but a subset appeared abnormal with irregular and heterogenous cytoplasmic granules, suggesting a secretory deficit. Consistent with this possibility, ileal explants from glial-depleted mice secreted less functional lysozyme than controls with corresponding effects on fecal microbial composition. Collectively, these data suggest that enteric glia do not exert broad effects on the intestinal epithelium but have an essential role in regulating Paneth cell function and gut microbial ecology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enteric nervous system</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial peptides</kwd><kwd>glial cell</kwd><kwd>Paneth cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK130836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Meenakshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08DK110532</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Meenakshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK135707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Meenakshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016382</institution-id><institution>Schmidt Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muppirala</surname><given-names>Anoohya N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014037</institution-id><institution>National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuziel</surname><given-names>Gavin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001341</institution-id><institution>Smith Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Odyssey Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Meenakshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic depletion of enteric glia in vivo disrupts antimicrobial peptide secretion by Paneth cells to change fecal microbial composition but does not broadly alter other intestinal programs.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The intestinal epithelium is an important interface between an animal and its external environment, not just as a physical barrier but also as a dynamic regulator of digestion, energy balance, and mucosal immunity. The ENS, the intrinsic nervous system of the digestive tract, directs many intestinal epithelial functions. Glia are major cellular components of the ENS distributed throughout the radial axis of the intestine, from the muscular outer walls to the inner mucosal layer containing the epithelium. Most studies of enteric glia have focused on the cells which closely associate with neuronal soma in the myenteric plexus and have uncovered numerous roles for these glia in the regulation of neuronal functions in both health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seguella and Gulbransen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenberg and Rao, 2021</xref>). Many enteric glia, however, are located outside the myenteric plexus in the mucosa where they closely appose intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferri et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mestres et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krammer and Kühnel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neunlist et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bohórquez et al., 2014</xref>), raising the possibility that mucosal glia directly regulate epithelial cell functions.</p><p>Several enteric glia-derived cues, ranging from small molecules to growth factors, can alter epithelial cell proliferation and cell-cell adhesion in vitro (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prochera and Rao, 2023</xref>), supporting the possibility of glial-epithelial interactions. In the intestine, however, none of these factors are made exclusively by glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prochera and Rao, 2023</xref>). Moreover, studies in which enteric glia were depleted or disrupted in vivo have reported conflicting findings in terms of epithelial effects. For example, chemical gliotoxins do not cause major epithelial deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aikawa and Suzuki, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nasser et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, a chemical-genetic model using a human <italic>GFAP</italic> promoter fragment to target glia in mice showed profound epithelial barrier defects and fulminant inflammation specifically in the distal small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bush et al., 1998</xref>). Subsequent studies by multiple groups using more targeted systems to deplete or functionally disrupt glia defined by <italic>Plp1</italic>, <italic>Sox10,</italic> or <italic>Gfap</italic> expression, however, have not supported this finding. They found no major defects in epithelial properties at steady state or increased vulnerability to inflammation upon glial disruption even though all these models exhibited deficits in other ENS-regulated functions, such as motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kovler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baghdadi et al., 2022</xref>). One study reported that simultaneous depletion of <italic>Plp1</italic>- and <italic>Gfap</italic>-expressing populations could provoke intestinal inflammation, implicating a subset of glia with particularly high <italic>Gfap</italic> transcript expression in the regulation of epithelial turnover through the secretion of Wnt proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baghdadi et al., 2022</xref>). Genetic disruption of Wnt secretion in <italic>Gfap<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, however, affected epithelial turnover only upon radiation injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baghdadi et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, it largely remains unclear what, if any, epithelial functions enteric glia are necessary for in vivo at steady state.</p><p>To better delineate the functional significance of enteric glial-epithelial interactions in homeostasis, first we characterized the molecular phenotype of mucosal glia along the crypt-villus axis in both mice and humans. We found that <italic>Plp1</italic> was the most widely expressed marker of mucosal glia in both species, supporting the use of its promoter to probe glial functions in vivo. Then, to interrogate glial functions in an unbiased way, we depleted <italic>Plp1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in mice and examined gene expression along the longitudinal axis of the intestine. Surprisingly, glial loss had minimal effects on the intestinal transcriptome or the cellular composition of the epithelium. Targeting <italic>Plp1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, however, caused a specific defect in Paneth cells leading to enriched gene expression signatures, diminished antimicrobial peptide secretion, and altered gut microbial composition. These observations uncover a link between enteric glia and Paneth cells and establish a role for enteric glia in regulating epithelial function in the healthy intestine in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Plp1 expression broadly marks glia in the gut mucosa</title><p>Enteric glia, like Schwann cells in the periphery, are neural crest-derived and have been identified within tissues by molecular markers including <italic>Sox10, Gfap, Plp1,</italic> and <italic>S100b</italic>. Although most glia within enteric ganglia are labeled by these markers, heterogeneity in their expression has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jessen and Mirsky, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boesmans et al., 2015</xref>), particularly in glia located outside the myenteric plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rao et al., 2015</xref>). To determine which marker is most broadly expressed by mucosal glia and would thus be most useful for genetic interrogation of glial-epithelial interactions, we analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets of human and mouse intestinal mucosa.</p><p>In human small and large intestines, expression of <italic>SOX10</italic> and <italic>PLP1</italic> was restricted to cluster of cells with a glial signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). <italic>S100B</italic> was highly expressed by cells in this cluster but also detected in non-glial cells including macrophages and monocytes; <italic>GFAP</italic> was overall undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). To validate these findings, we examined expression of the corresponding proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the human small intestine and found SOX10-, PLP1-, and S100B-immunoreactive cells in three compartments along the radial axis: the mucosa, enteric ganglia in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses, as well as intramuscular glia in the muscularis externa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B, D</xref>). GFAP-immunoreactive cells were readily found within enteric ganglia but were rare in the mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These observations are consistent with a recent study that examined SOX10, GFAP, and S100B by IHC in the human colon and found little to no GFAP, but robust SOX10 and S100B expression across all three compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baidoo et al., 2023</xref>). In the small intestine of patients with Crohn’s disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), <italic>SOX10</italic>, <italic>PLP1,</italic> and <italic>S100B</italic> transcripts were highly enriched in mucosal glia while <italic>GFAP</italic> was enriched in various non-glial cells including fibroblasts and immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In sum, <italic>SOX10, PLP1, and S100B</italic> are broadly expressed by human enteric glia across the radial axis of the gut, including mucosal glia, in both healthy and inflamed states, with <italic>SOX10</italic> and <italic>PLP1</italic> exhibiting the most cell type specificity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mucosal glia in human and mouse small intestines widely express <italic>Plp1</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) t-SNE plot of 94,451 cells isolated from terminal ileal mucosal biopsies from 13 children with non-inflammatory, functional gastrointestinal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>), colored by annotated cell identity. <italic>PLP1</italic> and <italic>SOX10</italic> expression exhibit relative specificity to glia; the cells express high levels of these transcripts. <italic>S100B</italic> is expressed by glia as well as non-glial cells such as macrophages and monocytes. <italic>GFAP</italic> is undetectable in this dataset.

In the normal intestine, Paneth cells are loaded with secretory granules containing LYZ1 that are released into the gut lumen in response to acetylcholine (ACh) and other signals to regulate microbial composition. Upon glial depletion, Paneth cell secretion is disrupted leading to dysmorphic granules, diminished LYZ1 secretion, and altered fecal microbial composition. This occurs without a change in Paneth cell number, loss of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor expression, or denervation of the cholinergic fibers that normally surround epithelial crypts.

Thus, Paneth cells in mice lacking enteric glia exhibit morphological and functional evidence of diminished secretory function at baseline but remain competent to respond to at least some stimuli.</p><p>Baseline Paneth cell secretion in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice could be diminished if glia are necessary for tonic Paneth cell stimulation.

Together, these observations support a working model in which glia are necessary for Paneth cell secretion of proteins that modulate the composition of the gut microbiome, but unlike in the skin, are not required for maintaining epithelial innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Disruption of mucosal glia provokes muted and region-specific transcriptional changes in the intestine</title><p>Comparing expression of the four molecular markers used most commonly to label enteric glia, we found that SOX10 and PLP1 were the most cell-type-specific for glia in the mucosa, with little to no non-glial expression in healthy or inflamed states in both mouse and human tissues. In contrast, S100B was detectable in a subset of immune cells, while GFAP was variably expressed in the mouse mucosa and largely undetectable in human mucosal glia at the transcript and protein levels. Having identified PLP1 as the molecular marker most widely expressed by enteric glia adjacent to the epithelial layer, we utilized its promoter to probe their functional significance in adult mice using an unbiased approach. Transcriptional profiling of three different intestinal regions, quantification of cell type composition, and assessment of the histological and ultrastructural presentation of various epithelial subtypes all indicated that genetic depletion of enteric glia does not result in broad changes to the intestinal epithelium.</p><p>Our observations are contrary to some reports of the effects of <italic>Gfap</italic><sup>+</sup> cell depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bush et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aubé et al., 2006</xref>), but they are consistent with many other studies that did not uncover overt epithelial disruption when: (i) utilizing the <italic>Plp1</italic> or <italic>Sox10</italic> promoters to disrupt glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kovler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baghdadi et al., 2022</xref>), (ii) targeting <italic>Gfap<sup>+</sup></italic> cells in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kovler et al., 2021</xref>), or (iii) administering chemical gliotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aikawa and Suzuki, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nasser et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Gfap</italic> is often used as a marker of reactive glia in the central nervous system in the context of injury or disease.

Although glia can secrete a variety of factors that modulate epithelial proliferation and barrier integrity in vitro, they do not seem essential for these functions in vivo. This may indicate the existence of redundant mechanisms to preserve these fundamental epithelial functions in vivo and/or that glial-epithelial interactions are more consequential in the context of pathophysiology than normal physiology.</p><p>The GI tract exhibits functional, cellular, and molecular specializations along its longitudinal axis. The distinct transcriptional changes resulting from the ablation of PLP1<sup>+</sup> cells along this axis hint at a regional specialization of enteric glia. Consistent with this possibility, enteric glia have been shown to regulate colonic but not small intestinal GI motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rao et al., 2017</xref>), control secretomotor responses in the large intestine but not the upper GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grubišić and Gulbransen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavin et al., 2020</xref>), and exert different immunomodulatory roles in the small and large intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ibiza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Progatzky et al., 2021</xref>).

Future studies utilizing viral or intersectional genetic approaches to target enteric glia more selectively may enable a better understanding of the consequences of long-term glial disruption.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Enteric glia as putative regulators of Paneth cells</title><p>Genetic depletion of enteric glia in adult mice provoked selective transcriptional, morphological, and ultrastructural disruption of Paneth cells, a highly secretory cell type in the small intestinal epithelium that is important for regulation of microbial ecology and innate host defense. Although the close physical association between enteric glia and small intestinal crypts in which Paneth cells reside is well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neunlist et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bush et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Van Landeghem et al., 2011</xref>), to our knowledge this is the first study linking enteric glia and Paneth cell biology. Loss of PLP1<sup>+</sup> enteric glia did not affect Paneth cell number but caused many of them to lose their typical morphologies and altered the appearance of their secretory granules. These morphological changes were associated with reduced luminal secretion of lysozyme, one of the most abundant AMPs produced by Paneth cells.</p><p>Morphologic changes in Paneth cells, similar to those we observed in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, have been reported in studies where cholinergic signaling is blocked or vagal innervation to the intestine is severed. For example, the cholinergic antagonist atropine triggers accumulation and enlargement of Paneth cell secretory granules in mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Satoh, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Satoh et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sundström and Helander, 1980</xref>). Activation or inhibition of cholinergic signaling to Paneth cells has also been shown to increase or decrease their secretory activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Satoh et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Satoh, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Satoh et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Satoh et al., 1995</xref>). We found that Paneth cells in glial-depleted mice remained competent to respond to cholinergic stimulation. Furthermore, unlike in the skin, glial depletion did not cause denervation. Cholinergic terminals were still present in close proximity to Paneth cells in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice. These observations suggest that while the infrastructure for neuroepithelial signaling remains intact in the intestines of Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, neurotransmission across this interface may be compromised in the absence of glia.</p><p>An alternative mechanism for glial regulation of Paneth cells is through effects on autophagy, a process important for Paneth cell secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cadwell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wittkopf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolph et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bel et al., 2017</xref>). Autophagy-related pathways were not transcriptionally enriched in glia-deficient mice, but glial-derived signals could modulate secretory autophagy in Paneth cells indirectly. For instance, Paneth cells express a receptor for IL-22, a cytokine whose production is stimulated by neurotrophic factors secreted by enteric glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ibiza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaudino et al., 2021</xref>). IL-22 promotes Paneth cell maturation and can license the cells for secretory autophagy in the context of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaudino et al., 2021</xref>). A third potential mechanism is through direct ligand-receptor interactions. Paneth cell development and function are regulated by secreted WNT proteins, which are expressed by subpopulations of enteric glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baghdadi et al., 2022</xref>). The Paneth cell phenotypes described in mouse models of disrupted WNT signaling differ from those in glial-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batlle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Es et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ireland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fevr et al., 2007</xref>), but this possibility could be further explored.</p><p>Although Paneth cells are not typically found in the healthy mouse colon, differential gene expression analysis in glial-deficient mice revealed upregulation of transcripts characteristic of Paneth cells, including <italic>Lyz1</italic>. Although the magnitude of this upregulation was more significant than in the small intestine, the corresponding LYZ1 protein was undetectable by IHC, leaving it unclear which colonic cells upregulate <italic>Lyz1</italic> transcripts upon glial depletion.

Committees of Boston Children’s Hospital, adherent to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Drinking water and laboratory chow were provided ad libitum. Male and female littermate mice were used for most experiments except where noted (males indicated as triangles and females as circles unless stated otherwise). PLP1<sup>CreER</sup> mice (JAX 005975) and Plp1-eGFP mice (JAX 033357) were maintained on the FVB/NJ background while Rosa26<sup>DTA/DTA</sup> mice (JAX 009669) and ChAT-eGFP mice (JAX 007902) were maintained on C57BL/6 background. For generation of all experimental cohorts of glial-depleted mice, PLP1<sup>CreER</sup> hemizygous mice were bred with Rosa26<sup>DTA/DTA</sup> mice to generate PLP1<sup>CreER</sup> Rosa26<sup>DTA/+</sup> mice and Rosa26<sup>DTA/+</sup> littermate controls. These mice were administered 8 mg of tamoxifen in corn oil once by orogastric gavage at 5–6 weeks of age, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). All analysis was carried out 11 days after tamoxifen administration (11dpt) unless indicated otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For frozen sections, tissues were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1.5 hours (hr), equilibrated in 30% sucrose/PBS and embedded, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). For IHC, 10–14 µm sections of intestine were incubated in blocking solution (0.1% Triton  + 5% heat-inactivated goat [HINGS] or donkey serum in PBS), incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody/blocking solution, washed, and incubated for 1.5 hr at room temperature (RT) in secondary antibody or UEA-I (Vector Labs, #DL-1067–1)+DAPI. The slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, #H-1200).</p><p>For IHC of small intestinal whole mounts, 2–3 cm segments of small and large intestine from Plp1-eGFP mice were dissected, washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 1.5 hr at 4 °C, and then thoroughly washed with PBS. The samples were permeabilized with PBS, 0.5% Triton-X100, and incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer (5% HINGS, 20% DMSO, 0.5% PBS Triton) for 48 hr at RT. They were then washed with permeabilization solution and incubated for 24 hr with secondary antibodies +DAPI. The whole mounts were mounted in Vectashield.</p><p>For DAB immunochemistry, de-identified archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded female adult human small intestine tissue samples were used under the approved Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center IRB protocol 2020P001104. The samples were sectioned and subjected to dewaxing with incubation at 58 °C for 15–20 min followed by washes in 100% xylene (2x5 min). The slides were rehydrated in 100% ethanol bath (3x5 min) followed by 70% ethanol incubation for 10 min. Following a wash with PBS, the slides were subjected to antigen retrieval by incubation in boiling citrate buffer solution for 20 min. Subsequently, a blocking solution was applied (2.5% HINGS +2.5% BSA in 0.1% PBS-TritonX100) for 2 hr at RT. For PLP1 and GFAP staining, prior to staining, the sections were incubated with hydrogen peroxide blocking solution (Abcam, #ab64218) for 10 min at RT. Primary antibodies in the blocking solution were applied for overnight incubation at 4 °C.

Enteric glial cell heterogeneity and related methodological differences likely underlie the contrasting findings obtained by different laboratories. Here, Prochera and colleagues used Plp1-CreERT2 driver mice to deplete the vast majority of enteric glia from the gut, and performed an elegant set of transcriptomic, microscopic and biochemical essays to examine the impact of enteric glia loss. It was found that enteric glia depletion has very limited effects on the transcriptome of gut cells 11 days after tamoxifen treatment (used to induce Diphtheria Toxin A expression in the majority of enteric glia including those present in the mucosa), and by extension - more specifically, has only minimal impact on cells of the intestinal mucosa. Interestingly, in the colon (where Paneth cells are not present) they did observe transcriptomic changes related to Paneth cell biology. Although no overt gene expression alterations were found in the small intestine - also not in Paneth cells - morphological, ultrastructural and functional changes were detected in the Paneth cells of enteric glia-depleted mice. In addition, and likely related to impaired Paneth cell secretory activity, enteric glia-depleted mice also show alterations in intestinal microbiota composition. This is an excellent study that convincingly demonstrates a role for enteric glia in supporting Paneth cells of the intestinal mucosa, suggesting that enteric glial cells shape host-microbiome interactions via the regulation of Paneth cell homeostasis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97144.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This is an excellent and timely study from the Rao lab investigating the interactions of enteric glia with the intestinal epithelium. Two early studies in the late 90's and early 2000's had previously suggested that enteric glia play a pivotal role in control of the intestinal epithelial barrier, as their ablation using mouse models resulted in severe and fatal intestinal inflammation. However, it was later identified that these inflammatory effects could have been an indirect product of the transgenic mouse models used, rather than due to the depletion of enteric glia. In previous studies from this lab, the authors had identified expression of PLP1 in enteric glia, and its use in CRE driver lines to label and ablate enteric glia.</p><p>In the current paper, the authors carefully examine the role of enteric glia by first identifying that PLP1-creERT2 is the most useful driver to direct enteric glial ablation, in terms of the quantity of glial cells targeted, their proximity to the intestinal epithelium, and the relevance for human studies (GFAP expression is rather limited in human samples in comparison). They examined gene expression changes in different regions of the intestine using bulk RNA-seq following ablation of enteric glia by driving expression of diptheria toxin A (PLP1-creERT2;Rosa26-DTA). Alterations in gene expression were observed in different regions of the gut, with specific effects in different regions. Interestingly, while there were gene expression changes in the epithelium, there were limited changes to the proportions of different epithelial cell types identified using immunohistochemistry in control vs glial-ablated mice. The authors then focused on investigation of Paneth cells in the ileum, identifying changes in the ultrastructural morphology and lysozyme activity. In addition, they identified alterations in gut microbiome diversity. As Paneth cells secrete antimicrobial peptides, the authors conclude that the changes in gut microbiome are due to enteric glia-mediated impacts on Paneth cell activity.</p><p>Overall, the study is excellent and delves into the different possible mechanisms of action, including investigation of changes in enteric cholinergic neurons innervating the intestinal crypts. The use of different CRE-drivers to target enteric glial cells has led to varying results in the past, and the authors should be commended on how they address this in the Discussion.</p><p>Comments on the latest version:</p><p>Thanks to the authors for addressing my concerns. The additional stratification of male vs female microbiome data was very helpful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The role of enteric glial cells in regulating intestinal mucosal functions at a steady state has been a matter of debate in recent years. Enteric glial cell heterogeneity and related methodological differences likely underlie the contrasting findings obtained by different laboratories. Here, Prochera and colleagues used Plp1-CreERT2 driver mice to deplete the majority of enteric glia from the gut. They found that glial loss has very limited effects on the transcriptome of gut cells 11 days after tamoxifen treatment (used to induce DTA expression), and by extension - more specifically, has only minimal impact on cells of the intestinal mucosa. Interestingly, in the colon (where Paneth cells are not present) they did observe transcriptomic changes related to Paneth cell biology. Although no overt gene expression alterations were found in the small intestine - also not in Paneth cells - morphological, ultrastructural, and functional changes were detected in the Paneth cells of enteric glia-depleted mice. In addition, and possibly related to Paneth cell dysfunction, enteric glia-depleted mice also show alterations in intestinal microbiota composition.</p><p>In their analyses of enteric glia from existing single-cell transcriptomic data sets, it is stated that these come from 'non-diseased' humans. However, the data on the small intestine is obtained from children with functional gastrointestinal disorders (Zheng 2023). Data on colonic enteric glia was obtained from colorectal cancer patients (Lee 2020). Although here the cells were isolated from non-malignant regions, saying that the large intestines of these patients are nondiseased is probably an overstatement.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Zheng et al. dataset, “functional GI disorders” refers to biopsies from children that do not have any histopathologic evidence of digestive disease. The children do, however, have at least one GI symptom that prompted a diagnostic endoscopy with biopsies, leading to the designation of “functional” disorder. Given that diagnostic endoscopies are invasive procedures that necessitate anesthesia, obtaining biopsies from asymptomatic children without any clinical indication would not be allowable per most institutional review boards, leading the authors of that study to use these samples as a control group. We had thus used the “non-diseased” label to encompass these samples as well as those from the unaffected regions of large intestine from colorectal cancer patients. We now recognize, however, that this label could be misleading, so we have revised the Results and Figure Legends to more accurately reflect details of control tissue origin for this and the Lee <italic>et al</italic>. (2020) datasets. Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have removed the term “non-diseased”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another existing dataset including human mucosal enteric glia of healthy subjects is presented in Smillie et al (2019). It would be interesting to see how the current findings relate to the data from Smillie et al.</p></disp-quote><p>Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now added an analysis of the Smillie <italic>et al</italic>. dataset in Supp. Fig. 1B. This dataset derives from colonic mucosal biopsies from 12 healthy adults (8480 stromal cells) and 18 adults with ulcerative colitis (10,245 stromal cells from inflamed bowel segments and 13,147 from uninflamed), all between the ages of 20-77 years. These data show that <italic>SOX10, PLP1</italic>, and <italic>S100B</italic> are selectively expressed within the putative glial cluster from colonic mucosa of both healthy adults and individuals with ulcerative colitis, whereas GFAP is not detected (Supp. Fig. 1B). These observations are consistent with our observations from the two other human datasets already included in our manuscript in Fig. 1 and Supp. Fig. 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The time between enteric glia depletion and analyses (mouse sacrifice) must be a crucial determinant of the type of effects, and the timing thereof. In the current study 11 days after tamoxifen treatment was chosen as the time point for analyses, which is consistent with earlier work by the lab using the same model (Rao et al 2017). What would happen when they wait longer than 11 days after tamoxifen treatment? Data, not necessarily for all parameters, on later time points would strengthen the manuscript significantly.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question, particularly given the longer-lived nature of Paneth cells relative to other epithelial cell types. As detailed in our previous study, Cre<sup>+</sup> mice in the Plp1CreER-DTA model are well-appearing and indistinguishable from their Cre-negative control littermates through 11dpt. Unfortunately, a limitation of the model is that beyond 11dpt, Cre<sup>+</sup> mice become anorexic, lose body weight, and have signs of neurologic debility such as hindlimb weakness and uncoordinated gait. These deficits are overt by 14dpt and likely due to targeting Plp1<sup>+</sup> glia outside the gut, such as Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes (as described in another study which used a similar model to study demyelination in the central nervous system, PMID: 20851998). Given these CNS effects and that starvation is well known to affect Paneth cell phenotypes (PMIDs: 1167179, 21986443), we elected not to examine timepoints beyond 11dpt. Technological advances that enable more selective cell depletion will allow study of chronic effects of enteric glial loss in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors found transcriptional dysregulation related to Paneth cell biology in the colon, where Paneth cells are normally not present. Given the bulk RNA sequencing approach, the cellular identity in which this shift is taking place cannot be determined. However, it would be useful if the authors could speculate on which colonic cell type they reckon this is happening in.</p></disp-quote><p>Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added a paragraph to the Discussion addressing one plausible hypothesis to explain this observation. Paneth-like cells have been described in the large intestine and are known, particularly in humans, to express markers typical of Paneth cells, such as lysozyme and defensins (PMID: 27573849, 31753849). These cells could represent the source of the Paneth cell-like transcriptional signature observed in our model. Alternatively, ectopic expression of Paneth cell-associated genes in the colon has been documented in certain pathological conditions, such as colorectal cancer models (e.g., PMID: 15059925), where changes in the local microenvironment appear to trigger activation of Paneth cell genes. Similar, yet unidentified changes in our model could potentially underlie the transcriptional dysregulation related to Paneth cell biology observed here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, enteric glia depletion was found to affect Paneth cells structurally and functionally in the small intestine, where transcriptional changes were initially not identified. Only when performing GSEA with the in silico help of cell type-specific gene profiles, differences in Paneth cell transcriptional programs in the small intestine were uncovered. A comment on this discrepancy would be helpful, especially for the non-bioinformatician readers among us.</p></disp-quote><p>Standard differential gene expression analysis (DEG) of the effects of glial loss revealed significant differences only in the colon, and even then, only a handful of genes were changed. These changes were not accompanied by corresponding changes at the protein level, at least as detectable by IHC. In the small intestine, there were no significant differences by standard DEG thresholds. Unlike DEG, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), provides a significance value based on whether there is a higher than chance number of genes that are changing in a uniform direction without consideration for the significance of the magnitude of change. Therefore, the GSEA detected that a significant number of genes in the curated Paneth cell gene list exhibited a positive fold change difference in the bulk RNA sequencing data. This prompted us to examine Paneth cells and other epithelial cell types in more detail by IHC, functional and ultrastructural analyses, which all converged on the observation that Paneth cells were relatively selectively disrupted in the epithelium of glial depleted mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From looking at Figure 3B it is clear that Paneth cells are not the only epithelial cell type affected (after less stringent in silico analyses) by enteric glial cell depletion. Although the authors show that this does not translate into ultrastructural or numerical changes of most of these cell types, this makes one wonder how specific the enteric glia - Paneth cell link is. Besides possible indirect crosstalk (via neurons), it is not clear if enteric glia more closely associate with Paneth cells as compared to these other cell types. Immunofluorescence stainings of some of these cells in the Plp1-GFP mice would be informative here.</p></disp-quote><p>Enteric glia have long been reported to closely associate with crypts, the sites of residence for Paneth cells and intestinal stem cells (PMID: 7043279, 16423922). Consistent with these reports, our observations from Plp1-eGFP mice confirm that enteric glia often appose the entire base of small intestinal crypts (see Author response image 1 below). Given this reproducible observation, we did not pursue histological quantification to compare preferential glial apposition to specific epithelial cell types. Enteric glia have been reported to form close associations with enteroendocrine cells as well (PMID: 24587096), which is not surprising because these cells are highly innervated; however, our analyses did not reveal changes in the abundance and morphology of these cells or other epithelial cell types.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(A) Immunohistochemical staining of a small intestinal cross-section from a Vil1<sup>Cre</sup>Rosa26<sup>tdTomato/+</sup> Plp1<sup>eGFP</sup> transgenic mouse in which enteric glia are labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and intestinal epithelial cells are labeled with tdTomato.

Maybe they can have a look at putative cell-cell interactions by mapping ligand-receptor pairs in the scRNAseq datasets they used.</p></disp-quote><p>Beyond IL-22R, it is established that Paneth cells express receptors for secreted WNT proteins, which enteric glia have been shown to express (PMID: 34727519). This interaction could potentially be involved in glial regulation of Paneth cells, but mice lacking glia do not exhibit the same phenotypes as mouse models with disrupted WNT signaling. For example, animals lacking the WNT receptor Frizzled-5 in Paneth cells have mislocalization of Paneth cells to the villi (PMID: 15778706), which we do not readily observe in Plp1CreER-DTA mice. Furthermore, while mucosal enteric glia have been proposed as a source of WNT ligands, this role has been specifically attributed to GFAP+ cells, which may or may not be glia in the mucosa. Moreover, several other cell types in the mucosa around crypts have also been identified as significant sources of WNT ligands (PMID: 16083717, 22922422). We have now added these ideas to the Discussion.</p><p>Per the reviewer’s suggestion to use bioinformatics to explore other potential ligand-receptor pairings that might underlie glial regulation of Paneth cells, we conducted a CellPhoneDB analysis focused on these two cell types with a collaborator. This analysis highlighted a handful of potential ligand-receptor interactions, but none of these pathways could be clearly linked to the observed Paneth cell phenotype. Furthermore, virtually all the candidate interactions were not specific to glia, with the candidate ligands expressed by many other more abundant cell types in the mucosa. For these reasons, we decided not to include this analysis in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Previously the authors showed that enteric glia regulation of intestinal motility is sex-dependent (Rao et al 2017). While enteric glia depletion caused dysmotility in female mice, it did not affect motility in males. For this reason, most experiments in the current study were conducted in male mice only. However, for the experiments focusing on the effect of enteric glia depletion on hostmicrobiome interactions and intestinal microbiota composition both male and female mice were used. In Figure 8A male and female mice are distinctly depicted but this was not done for Figure 8C. Separate characterization of the microbiome of male and female mice would have helped to figure out how much intestinal dysmotility (in females) contributes to the effect on gut microbial composition. This is an important exercise to confirm that the effect on the microbiome is indeed a consequence of altered Paneth cell function, as suggested by the authors (in the results and discussion, and in the abstract).</p></disp-quote><p>In our microbiome analysis, we initially analyzed males and females separately but did not observe significant differences between the two sexes. Thus, we merged the data to increase the statistical power of the genotype comparisons. It was an oversight on our part to not label the datapoints by sex as we did for the other data in the manuscript. We have now revised the figures related to microbiome characterization (Fig. 5D-E and Supp. Fig. 8C) to indicate the sexes of the mice used. Stratifying the data by sex within-sample revealed no major sex-specific differences in microbiome diversity or enriched/depleted biomarkers in the core genotype-dependent observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this context, it would also be interesting to compare the bulk sequencing data after enteric glia depletion between female and male mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Our bulk sequencing analysis of the effects of glial loss was conducted in male mice only in order to assess the effects independent of colonic dysmotility, a phenotype observed only in female Plp1CreER-DTA animals (PMID: 28711628). Given that we found rather muted transcriptional changes in male mice, we chose not to perform subsequent transcriptional analyses in female mice, further reasoning that any changes identified would most likely be attributable to dysmotility rather than direct glial effects. Future studies focusing on sex differences in the small intestine, where motility in the Plp1CreER-DTA model is unaffected by glial loss, could provide additional insights, especially in light of the recently reported sex differences in the gene expression and activity levels of enteric glia in the myenteric plexus (PMID: 34593632, 38895433).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- Intro 2nd paragraph: please add to the sentence: &quot;They found no major defects in epithelial properties AT STEADY STATE (or during homeostasis).</p></disp-quote><p>Revised as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There seems to be a word missing in the 2nd sentence of paragraph 2 on page 4. &quot;... but xxx consistent...&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewed and there were no missing words.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the 2nd paragraph on page 8, when discussing GFAP expression in IBD patients, a reference is missing.

Two early studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s had previously suggested that enteric glia play a pivotal role in control of the intestinal epithelial barrier, as their ablation using mouse models resulted in severe and fatal intestinal inflammation. However, it was later identified that these inflammatory effects could have been an indirect product of the transgenic mouse models used, rather than due to the depletion of enteric glia. In previous studies from this lab, the authors had identified expression of PLP1 in enteric glia, and its use in CRE driver lines to label and ablate enteric glia.</p><p>In the current paper, the authors carefully examine the role of enteric glia by first identifying that PLP1-creERT2 is the most useful driver to direct enteric glial ablation, in terms of the number of glial cells targeted, their proximity to the intestinal epithelium, and the relevance for human studies (GFAP expression is rather limited in human samples in comparison). They examined gene expression changes in different regions of the intestine using bulk RNA-seq following ablation of enteric glia by driving expression of diphtheria toxin A (PLP1-creERT2;Rosa26-DTA). Alterations in gene expression were observed in different regions of the gut, with specific effects in different regions. Interestingly, while there were gene expression changes in the epithelium, there were limited changes to the proportions of different epithelial cell types identified using immunohistochemistry in control vs glial-ablated mice. The authors then focused on the investigation of Paneth cells in the ileum, identifying changes in the ultrastructural morphology and lysozyme activity. In addition, they identified alterations in gut microbiome diversity. As Paneth cells secrete antimicrobial peptides, the authors conclude that the changes in gut microbiome are due to enteric glia-mediated impacts on Paneth cell activity.</p><p>Overall, the study is excellent and delves into the different possible mechanisms of action, including the investigation of changes in enteric cholinergic neurons innervating the intestinal crypts. The use of different CRE drivers to target enteric glial cells has led to varying results in the past, and the authors should be commended on how they address this in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this positive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have a few minor comments:</p><p>Changes in bacterial diversity - the authors make a very compelling case that changes in the proportions of various intestinal microbiome species were impacted by the change in Paneth cell secretions resulting from the depletion of enteric glia. Another potential mechanism of action could be alterations in gut motility resulting from loss of enteric glia. It appears that faecal samples were collected from both male and female mice, and hence changes in colonic motility could be involved. This should be addressed in the Results and Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that GI dysmotility could influence microbial composition. To address this, we initially analyzed microbiome data separately for male and female mice, because only female Plp1CreER-Rosa26DTA exhibit dysmotility. We found no significant sex-specific differences in microbiome composition, however, which suggested to us that dysmotility was unlikely to be the primary driver of the observed microbial changes. Based on these findings, we opted to combine data from male and female mice in our final microbiome analysis. We have now revised the Results, Discussion, and Methods sections to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 2: it would be helpful to include some labels of landmarks on the tissues, and arrows pointing to immunoreactive cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added labels and arrows to images in Supplementary Figure 2 per the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4B: It's hard to tell the difference in ultrastructural morphology of the Paneth cells between Cre- and Cre+ mice in the EM images.

Enteric glial loss, however, causes dysregulation of Paneth cell gene expression that is associated with morphological disruption of Paneth cells, diminished lysozyme secretion, and altered gut microbial composition.</p><p>Overall, the authors need to first prove whether the Plp1CreER Rosa26DTA/+ mice system is viable.</p></disp-quote><p>In previous work, we discovered that the gene <italic>Plp1</italic> is broadly expressed by enteric glia and, within the mouse intestine, is quite specific to glial cells (PMID: 26119414). We characterized the Plp1CreER mouse line as a genetic tool in detail in this initial study. Then in a subsequent manuscript, we used Plp1CreER-DTA mice to genetically deplete enteric glia and study the consequences on epithelial barrier integrity, crypt cell proliferation, enteric neuronal health and gastrointestinal motility (PMID: 28711628). In this second study, we performed extensive validation of the Plp1CreER-DTA mouse model including detailed quantification of glial depletion in the small and large intestines across the myenteric, intramuscular and mucosa compartments by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of whole tissue segments to sample thousands of cells. We found that the majority of S100B<sup>+</sup>enteric glia were depleted within 5 days in both sexes, including more than 88% loss of mucosal glia, and that this loss was stable at 3 subsequent timepoints (7, 9 and 14 days post-tamoxifen induction of Cre activity). Glial loss was further confirmed by IHC for GFAP in the myenteric plexus, and by ultrastructural analysis of the small intestine to ensure cell depletion rather than simply loss of marker expression. Our group was the first to use this model to study enteric glia, and since then similar models and our key observations have been replicated by other groups (PMID: 33282743, 34550727). Thus, we consider this model to be well established.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, most experimental systems have been evaluated by immunohistochemistry, scRNAseq, and electron microscopy, but need quantitative statistical processing.</p></disp-quote><p>RNA-sequencing and microbiome analyses are inherently quantitative (Figures 1A-B, Supp. Figure 1, Figure 2, Supp. Figure 4A, Figure 3A-B, Supp. Figure 5, Figure 5, and Supp. Figure 8C). Virtually all our other observations are also supported by quantitative analysis including analysis of mucosal glial markers (Fig. 1C-D), validation of Paneth cell transcript expression in the colon (Supp. Fig. 4B), measurement of epithelial cell type composition (Figure 3C, D), assessment of crypt innervation (Supp. Fig. 7E), and measurement of bacteria-to-crypt distance (Supp. Fig. 8A-B). The only observation that was not quantified was that of morphological abnormalities of Paneth cells. Given the inherently low sampling rate of EM studies, we felt that functional assays (explant secretion assays, effects on microbial composition) would be more meaningful for interrogation of a potential Paneth cell phenotype and thus elected to focus our quantitative analyses on those functional assays rather than further histological measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the value of the paper would be enhanced if the significance of why the phenotype appeared in the large intestine rather than the small intestine when PLP1 is deficient for Paneth cells is clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see detailed response to Reviewer 1 that addresses this comment and the corresponding addition to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Supplementary Figure 2; Cannot be evaluated without quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplemental Figure 2 shows qualitative IHC observations that were highly reproducible across all the subjects indicated for each marker and align well with the quantitative transcriptional data from human subjects shown in Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1. The DAB staining in Supplemental Figure 2 could theoretically be quantified by staining intensity or counting cell number but we felt this would be arbitrary and difficult to achieve in a meaningful way with a single chromogen. The DAB reaction is associated with a non-linear relationship between amount of an antigen and staining intensity, especially at higher levels (PMID: 16978204, 19575836), because it is not a direct conjugate and relies upon an enzymatic reaction. The amplification step required for DAB staining using Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) introduces variability, particularly with cytoplasmic markers and in complex tissue structures like the plexuses, where proteins are distributed throughout the glial network. Counting cell number also would not lead to fair comparisons between markers because while SOX10 shows a clear nuclear signal suitable for quantification, the other markers are all membrane or cytoplasmic proteins, making accurate counting nearly impossible in dense ganglia. Finally, quantifying cell number in 5-micron paraffin sections which have major differences in sampling from one subject to another in terms of presence of ganglia and ganglia size, would also make this prone to inaccuracy. Given these limitations and the robust qualitative data we have shown that aligns completely with the quantitative transcriptional analyses, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 2A; Is Plp1CreER Rosa26DTA/+ mice system established correctly? S100B immunohistology picture is not clear. A similar study is needed for female Plp1CreER Rosa26DTA/+ mice. What is the justification for setting 5 dpt, 11 dpt? Any consideration of changes to organs other than the intestine? Wouldn't it be clearer to introduce Organoid technology?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the detailed response to first comment. The Plp1CreER- DTA mouse model is well-established and there are detailed experimental justifications for the 5 and 11dpt timepoints as well as the focus on male mice for RNA-sequencing analyses. As described in our previous work (PMID: 28711628), Plp1<sup>+</sup> cells throughout the animal would be affected, including Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, which is why we limit our analyses to the first 11dpt, when there are fewer confounding variables. The S100B immunohistology picture in Figure 2A was intended to be a schematic graphical representation of the paradigm of glial loss, not a data figure. Extensive validation of glial loss in this model was shown in our previous study. To improve clarity, we have now enlarged the picture for the reader.</p><p>Regarding the suggestion to use organoid technology, standard intestinal epithelial organoids do not incorporate any elements of the enteric nervous system (ENS), which is the focus of this study. Some groups have made heroic efforts to incorporate ENS components into intestinal organoids by introducing neural crest progenitor cells and grafting the hybrid organoids under the renal capsule in mice (example PMID: 27869805); but these studies are still limited, and it remains unclear how much the preparations reflect functional, natively innervated intestine. Our ex vivo explant assay preserves native ENS-epithelial interactions, providing a more effective model for studying the relationship between enteric glia and Paneth cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2B; Need an explanation for the 5 genes that were altered in the colon. Five genes should be evaluated by RT-qPCR. Why was there a lack of change in the duodenum and ileum?</p></disp-quote><p>While RT-qPCR validation of differentially expressed genes was once common practice, especially with microarray data, there is now robust evidence for strong correlations between RNA sequencing (RNAseq) results and RT-qPCR measurements of gene expression (PMID: 26208977, 28484260). Notably Rajkumar et al. (PMID: 26208977) demonstrated that RNAseq analyzed using DESeq2 (a method which we employed in our study), yields highly accurate results. They reported a 0% false positive rate and a 100% positive predictive value for DESeq2, rendering additional RT-qPCR validation redundant. We only performed RT-qPCR analysis of colonic <italic>Lyz1</italic> expression because our IHC analyses failed to show any ectopic expression of the protein in the colons of Cre<sup>+</sup> mice (Supp. Figure 4D) and we wished to validate the gene expression change seen by RNAseq in an independent cohort to be absolutely sure. Per the detailed response to Reviewer 1, we do not have a mechanistic explanation for why there is selective transcriptional induction of Paneth cell-related genes in the colon upon glial depletion. We have elaborated on this in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Supplementary Figure 3; Top 3 genes should be evaluated by RT-qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that none of the changes included in Supplementary Figure 3 for the duodenum or ileum reach the standard threshold for statistical significance and in view of the findings by Rajkumar, et al.

IHC for LYZ1 is typically the gold standard for assessment of Paneth cell granules by light microscopy. In our hands, however, we encountered persistent issues with IHC for this protein. While it very reproducibly detected Paneth cells with sufficient specificity to enable quantification of number of immunoreactive cells (as shown in Figure 3C), it did not enable quantification of granule morphology because it consistently exhibited diffuse staining throughout the cell (see Author response image 2 below). This appearance persisted regardless of extensive titration of fixation parameters (time, temperature, fixative supplier, 10% NBF vs 4% PFA), tissue preparation (fixed as intact tubes versus “swiss-rolls”), permeabilization conditions, operator, antibody used, and other variables. Upon subsequently surveying the literature, it seems that similar diffuse staining patterns for LYZ1 have been observed by numerous other groups and this may simply be an experimental limitation.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Representative IHC images showing LYZ1 staining optimization.</title><p>Ileal tissues from 8-10-week-old mice were prepared as either 'swiss-rolls' (A-D) or tubes (E, F) and fixed using different protocols: 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) from Epredia (#5710-LP) (A-B, E), 10% NBF from G-Biosciences (#786-1057) (C, D), or 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) from VWR (#100503-917) (F).

Diffuse cytoplasmic LYZ1 staining is observed within Paneth cells, regardless of conditions of tissue preparation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97144-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As an alternative approach to detecting Paneth cell granules, we tried UEA-I lectin staining. This labeling approach was sufficient to reveal qualitative differences in Paneth granule morphology in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, as shown in Fig. 4A. However, the transient nature of this lectin labeling made it very difficult to systematically quantify granule morphology in a blinded manner, as we did for our other analyses. Given these persistent challenges, we decided to present qualitative data on morphology by two orthogonal approaches (UEA-I staining by light microscopy and ultrastructure by EM) and focus on functional read-outs for quantitative analyses (explant secretion assays and microbiome analyses). In aggregate, we feel that these data provide robust and complementary evidence of the observed phenotype from independent experimental approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Figure 4D; Cannot be evaluated without quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment was likely made in error because there is no Figure 4D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Additional experiments on in vivo infection systems comparing Plp1CreER Rosa26DTA/+ mice and controls would be great.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in vivo infection experiments would be very interesting to pursue, particularly given the potential role of Paneth cells in innate immunity.
