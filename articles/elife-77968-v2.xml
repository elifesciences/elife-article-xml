Early life stressful experiences might increase the risk of developing pathological aggressive behavior in adulthood, though molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we provide prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus specific transcriptome profiles of peripubertal stress (PPS) exposed Balb/c adult male mice exhibiting escalated aggression and adult female mice resilient to such aberrant behavioral responses. We identify transthyretin (TTR), a well known thyroid hormone transporter, as a key regulator of PPS induced escalated aggressive behavior in males. Brain-region-specific long-term changes in <italic>Ttr</italic> gene expression and thyroid hormone (TH) availability were evident in PPS induced escalated aggressive male mice, circulating TH being unaltered. <italic>Ttr</italic> promoter methylation marks were also altered being hypermethylated in hypothalamus and hypomethylated in prefrontal cortex corroborating with its expression pattern. Further, <italic>Ttr</italic> knockdown in hypothalamus resulted in escalated aggressive behavior in males without PPS and also reduced TH levels and expression of TH-responsive genes (<italic>Nrgn</italic>, <italic>Trh,</italic> and <italic>Hr</italic>). Escalated aggressive behavior along with reduced <italic>Ttr</italic> gene expression and TH levels in hypothalamus was also evident in next generation F1 male progenies. Our findings reveal that stressful experiences during puberty might trigger lasting escalated aggression by modulating TTR expression in brain. TTR can serve as a potential target in reversal of escalated aggression and related psychopathologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>escalated aggression</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>transthyretin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Inspire Faculty Award DST/INSPIRE/04/2014/ 002261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Konar</surname><given-names>Arpita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant GAP0197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pillai</surname><given-names>Beena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001411</institution-id><institution>Indian Council of Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant IR-594/2019/RS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pillai</surname><given-names>Beena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hypothalamic TTR as a novel molecular player of stress-induced long-term impact on behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Escalated aggressive behavior with pathological signatures poses immense risk for violent and antisocial behavior and is a major challenge to human welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miczek et al., 2007</xref>). Aggression is a behavioral adaptation to threat and competition, but when it becomes excessive, uncontrollable and out of contextd it is considered as maladaptive and pathological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neves and Tudela, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Waltes et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Animal aggression is considered escalated and pathological if it displays short attack latency, prolonged attack duration, attacks targeted on inappropriate partners, and body parts prone to serious injury; attacks not signaled by threats; or ignorance of signals of opponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacq et al., 2020</xref>). In general, animal models of escalated aggression can largely explain abnormal aggressive behavior in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miczek et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is extremely important to understand the biological factors contributing to shift of normal adaptive aggression to escalated and pathological form.</p><p>Mounting epidemiological evidences link early life stressful experiences with deteriorating mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelson and Trainor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hunt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mitchell and Aamodt, 2005</xref>). In particular, stress exposures around puberty including childhood and adolescence including fear, maltreatment, physical and sexual abuse confers susceptibility to aggressive behavioral disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veenema, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tzanoulinou and Sandi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bounoua et al., 2020</xref>). Although, early life adversities are considered as one of the potential triggers for abnormal aggression, biological insights are obscure. More importantly, majority of research in the field of aggressive biology have focused on the adaptive form without really considering the escalated and pathological forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Boer, 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">MÃ¡rquez et al., 2013</xref> developed a novel animal model which showed the effect of peripubertal fearful exposures on male pathological aggression at adulthood in Wistar Han rats. They primarily focused on neural circuits of aggression and on a single gene <italic>Maoa</italic> in isolation.</p><p>Considering aggressive behavior as a multidimensional trait, we rationalized that unbiased genome wide investigation would decipher key molecular pathways that can be exploited further as prediction and intervention targets. We modeled peripubertal stress (PPS) induced escalated aggression in laboratory bred Balb/c mice and screened the male cohort showing extremes of behavioral changes. Female mice showed resilience towards PPS induced escalated aggressive behavior as also reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Konar et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed a sex-specific transcriptome analysis in vulnerable brain regions of hypothalamus (Hypo) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Hypothalamus is a key brain region for expression of aggressive behavior and neural circuit-specific manipulation experiments revealed that ventromedial hypothalamus is the crucial for inter-male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falkner et al., 2016</xref>). While Hypo is considered as the trigger center for aggression, PFC plays opposite regulatory role being involved in inhibition of threat provoked aggressive behavior. More importantly, direct neuronal projections from PFC to Hypo have been suggested to control both type and amplitude of aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biro et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we primarily focused on hypothalamic molecular culprits of escalated aggression and also included PFC in our study to understand inter-brain regional molecular regulation if any.</p><p>We prioritized <italic>Ttr</italic> gene given its (i) top rank in Hypo transcriptome analysis and unique sex specific diametrically opposite expression pattern in Hypo and PFC and (iii) long-term gene expression changes from early peripubertal age till adulthood. Brain-region-specific changes in <italic>Ttr</italic> gene expression and promoter methylation and thyroid hormone (TH) availability, one of the key functions of TTR were evident in PPS-induced escalated aggressive male mice. Further, targeted gene manipulation revealed causal role for hypothalamic <italic>Ttr</italic> in development of escalated aggressive behavior. However, causal relationship of <italic>Ttr</italic> regulated hypothalamic TH availability and escalated aggression is still to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening of escalated aggressive behavior</title><p>Adult animals exhibiting escalated aggressive behavior in response to PPS exposure were screened based on resident intruder (RI) behavioral scoring parameters.

stressful experiences induced escalated aggression and its sex differences we used RNA-sequencing to measure all polyA-containing transcripts in Hypo and PFC of adult control and PPS exposed male and

Now we refer to the adult PPS exposed escalated aggressive male mice group as âSEaggâ and adult PPS exposed non-aggressive female mice group as âSNaggâ. Experiment was performed in 3 individual mice considered as biological replicates for all the samples and tissues were collected 24 h after last RI session. Replicate concordance value of one female biological replicate was less than 0.8 and therefore we excluded the sample in further analyses. Heatmaps of differentially expressed genes (DEG)s were constructed from the global transcriptome analysis. A <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> containing list of DEGs in males and females has been included. In Hypo, 49 genes were differentially expressed amongst which 28 were down-regulated, 20 were up-regulated and 1 was expressed in SEagg males but not in control males.

TTR immunoreactive cells were observed in dorsomedial hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus and arcuate nucleus. Therefore, in later stereotaxy experiments, coordinates were chosen (Materials and methods) to cover all the above mentioned areas. Dorsomedial hypothalamus showed more TTR immunoreactive cells than the other sub-regions. In SEagg males, TTR protein fluorescence intensity was significantly reduced in Hypo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and increased in PFC as compared to Ctrl males. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). No primary TTR antibody negative control was used to determine specificity of the immunofluorescence experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Further studies on co-localization with specific molecular markers are required to identify the cell type of TTR protein in Hypo and PFC.</p><p>Next we investigated TTR protein fluorescence intensity in choroid plexus region, considered to be the main site of TTR protein synthesis in brain, though it did not show any difference between Ctrl and SEagg group.

Based on unbiased transcriptome screening, we identify novel role of TTR in long-term programming of escalated aggression induced by PPS. Our findings also indicate the possible involvement of TTR dependent brain TH availability in such abnormal behavioral response. However, further studies are necessitated to identify the definite molecular mechanism.</p><p>TTR is a 55 kDa protein that is synthesized in choroid plexus epithelial cells of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alshehri et al., 2015</xref>) until recently it was identified in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">ZawiÅlak et al., 2017</xref>) and astrocytes indicating wide expression of the protein in CNS. Interestingly, we observed TTR immunoreactivity in different cell types in Hypo and PFC. TTR expression in PFC was similar to brain endothelial cell marker proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). Our cell type specificity analysis using publicly available databases also revealed highest expression <italic>Ttr</italic> mRNA in endothelial cells followed by neurons, microglia and astrocytes in mouse brain. Additional experiments mainly colocalization with specific markers are required to confirm the cell types.</p><p>We observed long term impact of PPS on <italic>Ttr</italic> expression in brain-region and sex-specific diametrically opposite manner. Such a unique pattern of the only top ranking gene from our transcriptome data intrigued us to explore the functional outcomes. TTR is involved in the uptake of T4 from blood to CSF and local distribution of TH in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alshehri et al., 2015</xref>). TTR has also been assigned other functions including proteolysis of Neuropeptide Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nunes et al., 2006</xref>), neuroprotection and regeneration of damaged neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sousa et al., 2004</xref>). We focused on circulating and brain TH levels based on multiple reasons. Our transcriptome data showed significant expression change in TH signaling genes primarily <italic>Trh</italic> and <italic>Nrgn</italic> in Hypo. Several other genes in our list (PFC-<italic>Rasd2</italic>, <italic>Fosl2</italic>, <italic>Nr4a3</italic>, <italic>Inf2</italic>, <italic>Arl4d</italic>, <italic>Dcn</italic>, <italic>Pcp4l1</italic>, <italic>Drd2</italic>, <italic>Syndig1l</italic>, <italic>Hspa1a</italic>, <italic>Spock3</italic>; Hypo- <italic>Oxt</italic>, <italic>Cdhr1</italic>, <italic>Col23a1</italic>, <italic>Dgkk</italic>, <italic>Dkk3</italic>, <italic>Cck</italic>, <italic>Ptpro</italic>) showed overlap with literature available on T3 responsive genes in primary cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gil-IbÃ¡Ã±ez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Richard and Flamant, 2018</xref>). Also, TH action in developing brain have been considered as critical determinants of multiple neurological deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">PrÃ©au et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In clinical settings, TH abnormalities are diagnosed by serum parameters. However, we show that alterations in <italic>Ttr</italic> gene expression paralleled perturbation in T4 and T3 content in brain tissues of Hypo and PFC without affecting the circulating levels of the hormone. Determining the effective concentration of T4 and T3 in brain tissues is difficult owing to multiple factors driving their synthesis, transport across blood-brain and blood-CSF barrier, intracellular distribution and activation/inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schroeder and Privalsky, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BÃ¡rez-LÃ³pez and GuadaÃ±o-Ferraz, 2017</xref>). Therefore, future investigations on TH transporters, DIO2 and DIO3 enzymes are necessitated to determine the local TH availability in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mayerl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams and Bassett, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Any change in brain TH state has a direct influence on TH responsive genes. TH deficiency during postnatal brain development causes irreversible neurological manifestations through target gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vallortigara et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Nrgn</italic> is one such brain specific TH responsive gene that was also amongst the top ranking DEGs in our transcriptome data containing TRE elements in promoter and its transcription is dependent on TH in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Husson et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Nrgn</italic> regulates synaptic plasticity by activating calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) protein and spine density. We observed significant reduction in <italic>Nrgn</italic> transcript and NRGN protein levels in concordance with decrease in T4 and T3 levels in Hypo.</p><p>Until now we found a strong association between altered brain TTR expression and function with escalated aggressive behavior but causal relationship was yet to be established. Next, we showed that intra-hypothalamic <italic>Ttr</italic> gene knockdown evoked escalated aggression in unstressed males to a similar extent to that of PPS induced males. <italic>Ttr</italic> gene knockdown also led to decrease in Hypo T3 content and alteration in expression TH signaling genes, <italic>Nrgn</italic> and <italic>Trh. Ttr</italic> gene silencing also reduced hairless (<italic>Hr</italic>), a universal TH responsive gene that is studied to monitor the local TH status in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herwig et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Escalated aggressive behavior, reduced <italic>Ttr</italic> mRNA expression and T3 content in Hypo was also evident in F1 male progenies of SEagg males. Previous studies suggest that TH changes in neonatal brain can elicit neuroendocrine abnormalities in their F1 progenies. Also, developmental exposure of thyroxine disrupting chemicals can affect gene expression and behavior in later generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morte et al., 2018</xref>). These data indicated that behavioral and molecular consequences are dependent on TTR. However, it is not clear whether the decrease of TTR expression causes the escalated aggression via the regulation of hypothalamic TH availability or the effect of altered TTR expression on the aggression and TH availability are independent.</p><p><italic>Ttr</italic> promoter showed altered methylation pattern in Hypo and PFC of SEagg males. As DNA methylation is considered important for lasting influence of stressful experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vukojevic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gulmez Karaca et al., 2020</xref>), it might underlie long-term impact of PPS on <italic>Ttr</italic> expression and aggressive behavior. Further studies are required to determine the molecular pathways underlying involvement of TTR in aggressive behavior.</p><p>In conclusion, we delineate novel role of TTR in manifestation of early life stress induced escalated aggression. TTR signaling in brain can also serve as a valid molecular predictor as well as intervention target in excessive pathological aggression. Our findings have inherent limitations of investigations in animal models and therefore further studies are warranted in relevant human cohort to establish role of TTR in abnormal aggression and related psychopathologies. Our work also provides resource for investigating sexual dimorphism in behavioral disorders and deciphering susceptibility as well as protective pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-TTR (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# PA5-80196</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)<break/>IF (1:300)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-Nrgn (goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#ab99269</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-GAPDH (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Santa Cruz</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: sc32233</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-5-methyl cytosine (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Epigentek</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: A-1014â050</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MeDIP (1 Âµg per reaction)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">in vivo-jetPEI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Polyplus Transfection</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: 201â10 G</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfection reagent for in vivo delivery of nucleic acids</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2,4,5-Trimethylthiazole</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#:W332518</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">L-Thyroxine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#:T2376-100MG</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EliKine TM Thyroxine (T4) ELISA Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abbkine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: KET007</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EliKineTM Triiodothyronine (T3) ELISA Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abbkine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: KET006</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Ttr</italic> esiRNA (esiRNA targeting mouse <italic>Ttr)</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: EMU030721</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental procedures involving live animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics committee (IAEC) of CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IAEC Approval Number-IGIB/IAEC/3/15) that is registered under Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India (Registration No and Date- 9/1999/CPCSEA).

Each day the resident was introduced to a different intruder in the following manner: day 1-same sex and 10% less body weight; day 2-same sex and 10% more body weight; day 3 and day 5-anesthetized of same sex and similar body weight; day4 and day7-opposite sex and similar body weight; day 6-different strain of same sex and similar body weight.</p><p>The behavioral parameters including clinch attack, move towards, social exploration, ano-genital sniffing, rearing, lateral threat, upright posture, keep down, chase, non-social explore and rest or inactivity were quantified in terms of percentage (duration) of the total observation time. Attack latency or the time between introduction of the intruder and first clinch attack was also determined. The total duration of the clinch attack, offensive upright, keeping down and lateral threat were considered as the measure of total offensive behavior. Social exploration behavior included the sum of social explore, auto and social grooming and ano-genital sniffing. Phenotypic screening of animals was done based on conventional parameters as published in earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koolhaas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takahashi and Miczek, 2014</xref>) and described in details in result section of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Briefly, animals showing excessive aggression with pathological signs of very short attack latency, prolonged attack duration, attack on female and anesthetized intruder in all the days of RI test was referred to as escalated aggressive. The order of RI testing for control and PPS exposed adult animals was random. Behavioral scoring was done by an observer blind to animal identity and assignment of groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Breeding scheme for F1offspring</title><p>Control (without PPS exposure) and PPS exposed adult male mice showing escalated aggression was mated with control females (without PPS exposure). After mating, males were immediately removed from the cage so that they do not have any contact with their offspring and do not impact upon their rearing. F1 offspring originating from these pairings were housed in standard cages and subjected to RI test for aggression at their adulthood (P90).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RNA-sequencing</title><p>RNA was isolated from hypothalamus and PFC of male and female mice using Trizol reagent. One Âµg RNA (by Qubit measurement) was taken per sample and RNA sequencing libraries were made using Illumina Truseq Ribo-Gold Total RNA stranded kit as per manufacturerâs protocol. The libraries made were quality checked using Qubit and Bioanalyzer. The sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform in 150cycles paired end format. The raw fastq files were used to check for quality control using FastQC program. Trimmomatic was used to perform trimming using the default paired end parameters in the software. After trimming, quality check was performed again using FastQC and all reads were found to be above phred score 22 with no adapter contamination or over-represented sequences. The fastq files were aligned to Mouse Genome (mm10) using Tophat2 and the bam files were used to calculate differential expression using Cuffdiff2. Due to the stranded nature of the data, fr-firststrand parameter was used during analysis. The FDR corrected pvalue (also called as q-value) was used to check significance of differentially expressed genes. R-studio with ggplot package was used to generate plots while some plots were generated using Prism software. Raw and processed RNA seq datasets including raw transcriptomic data on the transcript levels in each biological replicate of control and experimental samples were deposited in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession number GSE199844. Replicates that passed the concordance test (<italic>R</italic>&gt;0.8) were included for analysis of differentially expressed genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from hypothalamus and PFC of mice and 2 Âµg of RNA from each group was reverse transcribed to cDNA synthesis. RT-PCR was carried out using SYBR Green master mix for detection in Light cycler LC 480 (Roche). All primers used for qRT-PCR are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.

Brains were removed, post-fixed, cryoprotected in PBS +15% sucrose for 2â3 hr followed by immersion in PBS +30% sucrose for 24 hr, and then sectioned coronally (7 Î¼m) on a cryotome. Free-floating sections were permeabilized with blocking buffer (PBS +3% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100) for 2 hours and then incubated with TTR primary antibody overnight at 4 Â°C. Slices were then washed 4Ã15 min with PBS, incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies for 2 hr, washed 4Ã15 min with PBS, mounted on microscope slides followed by counterstaining with DAPI and photomicrographs were captured by FLoid fluorescence microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Thyroid hormone measurement</title><p>Mouse blood samples were collected from heart to test serum levels of total tetraiodothyroxine (T4) and total tri-iodothyroxine (T3). Thyroid hormone content in brain regions was determined by dissecting hypothalamus and PFC and individually homogenizing them in artificial cerebral spinal fluid and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The resulting supernatant was collected and used for ELISA based determination of total T4 and T3 (EliKineTM Thyroxine (T4) ELISA Kit KET007 and EliKineTM Triiodothyronine (T3) ELISA Kit KET006).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Stereotaxic surgeries and gene manipulation</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with 40 mg/kg BW thiopentone i.p. and positioned on a robotic stereotaxic frame (Cat no. 51700, Stoelting Co., USA) with motorized stereo-drive (Cat no. 013.641, Neurostar, USA). As mentioned in earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2005</xref>), the dorsomedial, ventromedial and arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus were targeted bilaterally by using the stereotaxic coordinates of 1.5 mm posterior to the bregma, 0.5 mm lateral to midline, and 5.8 mm below the surface of the skull. For PFC, the specific coordinates for injection relative to bregma was mediolateral Â±0.35 mm, dorsoventral â2.1 mm, and rostrocaudal axes +2.2 mm. For brain targeted gene manipulation <italic>Ttr</italic> esiRNA (esiRNA targeting mouse <italic>Ttr</italic> - EMU030721, Sigma Aldrich)âjetPEI complex was infused into hypothalamus. Levothyroxine (LT4) was bilaterally administered into PFC.

Mice were allowed to recover individually from anesthesia and thereafter returned to their home cages. Post-operative cares were taken using analgesics and anti-biotics including meloxicam (5 mg/kg of b/w, i.m., Intas Pharmaceuticals, India) and gentamycin (5 mg/kg bw, i.m., Neon Laboratories, India) for 2â3 days. Body temperature was maintained during and after surgery in homoeothermic monitoring system (Harvard Apparatus, USA) following previous protocol. RI test for aggression was performed followed by molecular experiments after an additional 24 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation</title><p>DNA methylation was analyzed at the promoter region of <italic>Ttr</italic> by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) method as mentioned earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mohn et al., 2009</xref>).

Sample sizes, statistical methods and p values are mentioned in results and figure legends. In order to analyze RT-PCR data, the 2^-ÎÎCt value was used to calculate relative fold change in mRNA expression and plotted. For immunoblot analysis, the signal intensity (Integrated Density Value, IDV) of TTR and NRGN bands was measured by spot densitometry tool of AlphaEaseFC software (Alpha Innotech Corp, San Jose, CA, USA), normalized against the IDV of internal control GAPDH and plotted as relative density value. MeDIP data were plotted as fold enrichment normalized to IgG control. Data are presented as mean (Â± SD) and individual data points are depicted in figure panels, wherever possible. Three-way ANOVA with the factors of sex, brain region, and treatment and two-way ANOVA with the factors of treatment and brain region was used. Within sex or brain region effects were determined by two-way ANOVA. Bonferroni post hoc test was applied for multiple comparisons. Individual comparisons were also made using the unpaired Studentâs t test. Significance level was set to &lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental procedures involving live animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics committee (IAEC) of CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IAEC Approval Number-IGIB/IAEC/3/15) that is registered under Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India (Registration No and Date- 9/1999/CPCSEA).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Petr N Menshanov (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The role of the decreased hypothalamic T3 availability in the development of aggression is not causally established. In the current form of the paper, it is not clear whether the decrease of TTR expression causes the aggression via the regulation of hypothalamic T3 availability or the effect of altered TTR expression on the aggression and T3 availability are independent. Therefore, the authors should either focus on the role of TTR or they should provide additional evidence that lack of hypothalamic T3 is the cause of the development of aggression.</p><p>2) The studies on epigenetic mediated inheritance of the aggression phenotype are not well supported and should be removed. The data on methylation of the TTR promoter are an important contribution and should remain but should not be considered as a diagnostic for aggressive behavior or the basis for trans-generational inheritance.</p><p>3) Statistical analyses should be redone with factorial analyses to make the proper comparisons between sexes, stress condition and brain region.</p><p>4) RNA-Seq data should include greater in depth analyses.</p><p>5) The images of immunohistochemistry staining are not of sufficient quality and should be replaced.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Deiodinase 3 (Dio3) plays critical role in the regulation of hypothalamic T3 availability, therefore, the D3 expression should also be determined along the other TH regulated genes.</p><p>According to my knowledge, there is no reliable antibody against dio2. This fact highly questions the validity of the dio2 ELISA data. The only accepted method for the determination of DIO2 protein level is the DIO2 enzyme assay (PMID: 24001133).</p><p>The quality of the images illustrating immunocytochemistry is very weak. Better images would be necessary. In addition, it should be described in more details where the TTR-immunoreactive cells were observed in the hypothalamus. In addition, colocalization study should be performed at least with neuronal, glial and endothelial markers to determine what kind of cells express TTR in the hypothalamus.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions for improvement</p><p>1.1. In the present form submitted to GEO database, the transcriptomic data on the levels of individual transcripts are reported in aggregate per each experimental group, with no possibility to estimate variance between individual biological replicates. Reporting raw transcriptomic data on the transcript levels in each biological replicate will be beneficial for the readers interested in reanalyses of the data.</p><p>It is indispensable to report key elements of the transcriptomic analysis in full. Please update the GEO data with a single file on all levels of individual transcripts in each individual biological replicate.</p><p>1.2. The personal experience of the reviewer evidences that old Cufflink-Cuffdiff Tuxedo bioinformatic pipeline for RNA-Seqs (done after Tophat or STAR aligners), if applied properly, is highly sensitive to individual mRNA levels with minor shares. Nevertheless, in the present form of the description of bioinformatics pipeline in the &quot;Methods&quot; section, with missed basic options applied by the authors for Tophat, Cufflink, Cuffdiff utilits, it is hard to estimate the validity of the transcriptomic analyses done by the authors. Please consider improving the description of the bioinformatics methods applied.</p><p>1.3. Technical figures like volcano plots are important to control the quality of RNA-Seq, but are too uninformative to demonstrate the results of the experiment. Please consider illustrating the differences between PFC and HPT changes in DEGs on a single figure panel by depicting the parallel changes in the transcript levels identified in PFC (for example, x-axis) and HPT (for example, y-axis). At the same time, it is possible to move the volcano plots to the supplementary figures.</p><p>1.4. Preliminary analysis done by the reviewer by applying tissue cell deconvolution methods evidenced in favour of possible specific trends in cell numbers in the limbic brain regions studied. In particular, it cannot be excluded that the juvenile stress episodes suppressed microglia numbers in both the PFC and the HPT.</p><p>Please consider providing the data on tissue cell composition in RNA-Seq individual samples with respect to the experimental groups.</p><p>(For details, see Sutton et al. 2022 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022.28655-4 or other).</p><p>Such an analysis might be illustrative that stress itself is necessary but not sufficient to induce changes in the aggressive behaviours in affected male mice demonstrated excessive violence.</p><p>1.5. Please consider additional analyse of the data on the individual transcripts levels reported in the RNA-Seq analysis in a way similar to 2-way or 3-way (when appropriate) factorial ANOVA, to identify possible additive and non-additive patterns of changes in the levels of transcripts.</p><p>1.6. It will be also interesting to know on cell specificity of DEGs identified in PFC. Please consider checking the prevalence of individual DEGs with the help of Allen brain transcriptomic atlas (cited in Yao et al.,2021) or another one.</p><p>The above mentioned atlas can be assessed by the following link (https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq)</p><p>1.7. Please consider redrawing all figure panels depicted as traditional bars with the (Median, IQR, SD) box plots with individual data dots depicted. In particular, it is possible to achieve this at ease with the JASP freeware (https://jasp-stats.org/)</p><p>1.8. It is arguable to use GAPDH as a reference for qPCR assay in the experiments with stress exposures, since GAPDH levels might be affected and even programmed by stress experienced by animals.</p><p>Please consider providing a rationale on the applying of GAPDH as an internal standard for mRNA levels instead of Î²-actin or other mRNAs conventional for stress studies.</p><p>1.9. For future studies.</p><p>In the absence of cross-fostering experimental schedule for F1 experiments, it is hard to delineate the origins of epigenetic changes identified in the F1 descendants, whether these changes were transmitted directly or indirectly, via mother's specific behaviours on the descendants.</p><p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation</p><p>2.1. The present description of animal procedures in the &quot;Methods&quot; section does not provide enough details on the environments, in which the experimental mice were grown up. Please provide all details on animal housing procedures that might be stressful (social isolation events, social crowding events, numbers of animals per cell etc)</p><p>2.2. The description of several methods must be improved to clarify details critical for data comprehension.</p><p>For example,</p><p>Please indicate the details of screening tests done with subjects (females and anesthetized intruder) that were attacked by mice with pathological aggressive behaviours.</p><p>The experimental schedules must be reported in a clear way also. In particular, a brief statement must be done on how the distinct populations of &quot;adult control&quot; and &quot;PPS adult male&quot; mice screened by the Authors were originated from. A similar clarification must be done for female mice groups also.</p><p>2.3. The initial two paragraphs in the &quot;Introduction&quot; section do not provide the linear story tale on violence, &quot;escalated&quot; violence and a difference of these two concepts of aggression. The logic of this section must be improved.</p><p>2.3a. In the introduction, it looks like that the authors consider an aggression trait as a behavioural continuum between &quot;zero-level&quot; aggression to appropriate violence, and then to &quot;escalated&quot; aggressive behaviour. This point of view is arguable since it cannot be excluded that aggression is a multidimensional trait. Please consider revising and clarifying.</p><p>2.3b. It is possible to criticize &quot;escalated&quot; aggressive behaviour as unproductive. However, please do not make generalized negative statements on the nature of general violence in the Introduction and in the Discussion. Such statements might blackmail protective types of aggression critical for survival in mammals and humans.</p><p>2.4. Please avoid to made generalized statements that &quot;A can lead to B&quot;. Such statements with a strong modal verb &quot;can&quot; are highly misleading since the development of behavioural traits is not linear and depends on both genotype and environmental context often. Better to speak that &quot;A might lead to B&quot; under certain circumstances.</p><p>Several examples:</p><p>2.4a.&quot;Escalated aggressive behavior â¦ can lead to antisocial and criminal activities&quot; [P3-S1-LL1-2]. This is misleading for numerous animals and for specific types of aggressive behaviours in <italic>H. sapiens</italic>. Please consider revising.</p><p>2.4b. &quot;â¦pathological aggression has emerged as a consequence of early life adversitiesâ¦&quot; [P3-S2.LL9-10]. This statement is misleading, as it blames unrightfully all children affected by harsh life. Please consider revising.</p><p>2.4c. &quot;â¦we inferred that Ttr promoter methylation could serve as a predictor of â¦ behavioral deficits.&quot; [P24-S1-LL14-15] â Better to talk about &quot;possible behavioural deficits&quot;, not about &quot;behavioural deficits&quot;.</p><p>The above-mentioned list of examples is not exhaustive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Examination of some of the DEGs from the other pathways identified in the KEGG analysis would either strengthen the argument that changes are specific to the TH pathway or highlight that changes are more wide spread.</p><p>2) Some discussion of how a change in the amount of T3 and T4 could lead to aberrant aggression would enhance the manuscript.</p><p>3) Overall the sex difference, which is profound, is not given much attention. There are more DEGs identified in females subject to peripubertal stress than males, yet there is no change in aggressive behavior, so what does this tell us? Also, does testosterone play a role in the sex difference in both the transcriptome and the behavioral changes? If males were gonadectomized, would the same transcriptional profile be apparent and would the behavior also be there? Or would the two endpoints diverge, belying the noting that there is a casual connect between them.</p><p>4) The peri-pubertal stress was conducted on 7 random days from PN28 to PN42. The timing of puberty is different in males and females, being earlier in females. Where measures taken to determine the stage of puberty in each animal (i.e. vaginal opening, preputial separation)? Did the stress impact the timing of puberty?</p><p>5) The transgenerational assertions should either be dropped or the study carried out to the F2 generation.</p><p>6) How was the use of MeDIP specific to the promoter for Ttr?</p><p>7) What are the circulating androgen levels in the males from the various groups? Could the PP have altered the HPGA that then in turns alters behavior?</p><p>8) It does not seem appropriate to refer to &quot;donut shaped cells&quot;.</p><p>9) Figure 4J â appears mislabeled, has Hypo twice and no PFC.</p><p>10) Figure 4L-P â why aren't the individual points plotted for the mRNA and protein.</p><p>11) Whenever both brain areas are considered the statistics should be 2-way ANOVA with brain region and treatment as factors?</p><p>12) The word &quot;trauma&quot; in the context used here connotes an emotional interpretation of stressful or fearful events. We do not know if the mice are experiencing trauma, instead we know they are being subject to fearful and stress-inducing experiences. It is suggested that the word trauma be removed throughout and replaced with more precise terminology.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Pivotal role of TTR in early life stressful experiences induced escalated aggressive behavior&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Catherine Dulac (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined in detail below:</p><p>The following additional revisions are essential:</p><p>1) The conclusions on large sex differences between male and female hypothalamic transcriptomes are not supported by the data due to the problematic sample GSM5988437 (Female Hypo Experimental BiologicalReplicate1). This sample must be withdrawn from the analysis, and the male-female comparisons for hypothalamic transcriptomes must be re-estimated without this problematic sample. This will help to dismiss any spurious claims about the &quot;augmented&quot; male-female hypothalamic differences.</p><p>2) Data about the specificity of the TTR immunocytochemistry and D2 elisa would be absolutely necessary. The authors describe the changes of 2 TH transmitters and Dio2. Dio3 is at least an important regulator of TH availability in the brain as Dio2. So either data about Dio3 expression should be added or data about the expression of TH transporters and Dio2 should be removed.</p><p>3) Determination of the cell types expressing TTR should be very fast and easy with double-labeling immunocytochemistry and would increase the value of the paper, however, this is not absolutely necessary to support the conclusions of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript was highly improved, but there are some points that need further change.</p><p>The immunocytochemical images of Figure 3 were highly improved. On E, the TTR immunoreactivity seems to be neuronal, while the TTR seems to be present in perivascular localization suggesting endothelial or astrocytic expression. The cell type expressing TTR in the studied brain regions should be determined using double-labeling immunofluorescence.</p><p>The specificity of the TTR immunostaining should be proven.</p><p>It should be described which hypothalamic region is shown in the images.</p><p>The red immunofluorescent signal is visible inside the ventricle on F. This questions the specificity of the staining.</p><p>The length of the scale bars is hardly visible. In addition, while the magnification of the left and right panels are obviously different, the scale bars are the same on all images. This should be corrected.</p><p>As the balance of DIO2 and DIO3 determines the TH availability, in addition to the expression level of transporters and DIO2, the expression of DIO3 should be also presented.</p><p>As there is no specific DIO2 antibody, the validity of the DIO2 protein data is highly questionable. Therefore, data about the specificity of the assay should be provided.</p><p>Dio2 is negatively regulated by TH in most parts of the brain, but changes in TH level have no effect on Dio2 activity in the hypothalamus suggesting that the observed changes of Dio2 are not compensatory.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is still unclear whether Tophat, Cufflinks, Cuffmerge, and Cuffdiff tools were applied with the default settings or specific settings.</p><p>Please indicate clearly the settings applied for Tophat, Cuffdiff, and other bioinformatic tools used, within the &quot;RNA-sequencing&quot; subsection of the &quot;Materials and methods&quot; section.</p><p>2. Individual data provided for RNA-seq evidenced that Cuffdiff2 &quot;misbehaved&quot; during bioinformatics analysis while estimating FPKM levels for some abundant transcripts and filtering biological noise. As a result, Cuffdiff2 nullifies FPKM levels for some abundant transcripts like mitochondrial mt-Nd6 non-uniformly, only in specific samples. This issue should not be considered as a large problem, as Cuffdiff2's misbehaviour in such situations is already known.</p><p>To deal with this issue, the authors must include in the &quot;Discussion&quot; section a short sentence on this possible limitation of the study arising when comparing levels of highly abundant transcripts caused by Cuffdiff2 due to normalizations enacted.</p><p>3. The sample GSM5988437 (Female Hypo Experimental BiologicalReplicate1) failed to pass the Replicate concordance test (R=0.59-0.63), while all other replicates demonstrated R&gt;0.8. To understand the Replicate concordance test, please consult with the ENCODE guidelines on RNA-Seq (https://www.encodeproject.org/about/experiment-guidelines/).</p><p>Since all reads were found to be above phred score 22 with no adapter contamination or over-represented sequences P46-LL882.883. , the FPKM levels in the sample GSM5988437 (Female Hypo Experimental BiologicalReplicate1) were nullified somehow (by Cuffdiff2 or in another way) for a large number of transcripts with 1.to-10 FPKM levels, as compared to other samples.</p><p>This might result in a spurious identification of DEGs in the female hypothalami of exposed animals and in a spurious identification of sex differences between male and female hypothalamic DEGs (please see Supplementary File 1 with FPKMs, and the Figures 1D, 2A, and 2D).</p><p>To deal with these complications,</p><p>3a. The authors must repeat the concordance test for their FPKM estimates in the individual samples, providing the results of the concordance test in the supplement Table in accordance with the ENCODE guidelines.</p><p>3b. It is necessary to repeat a Cuffdiff analysis for hypothalamic RNA-seq samples without the affected replicate GSM5988437 (Female Hypo Experimental BiologicalReplicate1), to ensure unbiased data for the Figure 2A, Figure 2D, DEG lists and the &quot;Transcriptome analyses identify brain region-specific gene signaturesâ¦&quot; subsection.</p><p>3c. The subsection &quot;Transcriptome analyses identify brain region-specific gene signaturesâ¦&quot; must be improved after a Cuffdiff-mediated reanalysis of the RNA-Seq data.</p><p>4. ANOVA results gained by the authors are an important addon improving the text comprehensibility. Nevertheless, there is no need to incorporate ANOVA Tables into the manuscript text. Please move these Tables to Supplement.</p><p>5. Please identify units of measurements for X- and Y-axes on the subpanels of Figures1D and 2A.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Pivotal role of TTR in early life stressful experiences induced escalated aggressive behavior&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Catherine Dulac (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Thank you for the additional revisions to your manuscript. Upon further examination, it appears that some of the wording continues to be imprecise and is at times inappropriate in over-interpreting the significance of the findings to human behavior. Some specific suggestions are provided below but it would be useful to revisit the entire manuscript with an eye towards assuring there are no hidden biases and that are statements are both factually and grammatically correct.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1) The change in the title now makes it both awkward and inaccessible to the general reader. One suggestion is: &quot;Early life stressful experiences escalate adult mouse aggressive behavior via changes in transthyretin expression and function&quot; or some variation thereof.</p><p>2) There are many examples of statements regarding violence and criminality that are inappropriate or incorrectly attribute to causality. For instance, the second sentence of the Abstract states &quot;Early life stressful experiences triggers adulthood violence and criminality&quot;. This suggests that anyone that experiences early life stress will grow up to be a violent criminal. It is critically important not to make blanket statements that can be misinterpreted as sound science.</p><p>3) It is unclear how there can be an &quot;escalated aggressive phenotype&quot;, a phenotype cannot be escalated, perhaps instead state &quot;enhanced aggressive phenotype&quot; or &quot;resulted in escalated aggressive behavior&quot;.</p><p>4) Second sentence of the Introduction â &quot;Such aberrant behavioral patterns are also manifested in patients of multiple psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (2, 3) necessitating the identification of predisposing factors and early intervention strategies.&quot; â this seems strongly stigmatizing of individuals with mental illness, the vast majority of whom are not violent. It also is not important to the current findings and I would recommend removing such references to mental illness entirely.</p><p>5) Introduction â &quot;Brain region-specific long-term changes in Ttr gene expression and thyroid hormone (TH) availability was evident in PPS induced escalated aggressive male mice, circulating TH being unaltered&quot;. â should read &quot;were evident&quot;.</p><p>6) Introduction â &quot;â¦.it is extremely important to understand the biological culprits underlying brutal shift of normal adaptive aggression to escalated and pathological form.&quot; â the words &quot;culprits&quot; and &quot;brutal&quot; are emotionally laden terms that are inappropriate when discussing research findings.</p><p>7) Introduction â &quot;We selected the extreme phenotypes for better understanding of the behavior observed in human violent offenders and psychopathy&quot; â it is important to limit the conclusions of your study to what you observed which was changes in mouse behavior. Given the enormous complexity and multifactorial nature of violence in humans, it behooves you to not try and make direct connections between your studies and humans in the absence of any evidence that similar mechanisms are at play in human violent offenders.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77968.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The role of the decreased hypothalamic T3 availability in the development of aggression is not causally established.

In the present form submitted to GEO database, the transcriptomic data on the levels of individual transcripts are reported in aggregate per each experimental group, with no possibility to estimate variance between individual biological replicates.

The personal experience of the reviewer evidences that old Cufflink-Cuffdiff Tuxedo bioinformatic pipeline for RNA-Seqs (done after Tophat or STAR aligners), if applied properly, is highly sensitive to individual mRNA levels with minor shares. Nevertheless, in the present form of the description of bioinformatics pipeline in the &quot;Methods&quot; section, with missed basic options applied by the authors for Tophat, Cufflink, Cuffdiff utilits, it is hard to estimate the validity of the transcriptomic analyses done by the authors. Please consider improving the description of the bioinformatics methods applied.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, description of the bioinformatics methods applied in RNA seq data analyses has been improved and incorporated in Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.3. Technical figures like volcano plots are important to control the quality of RNA-Seq, but are too uninformative to demonstrate the results of the experiment. Please consider illustrating the differences between PFC and HPT changes in DEGs on a single figure panel by depicting the parallel changes in the transcript levels identified in PFC (for example, x-axis) and HPT (for example, y-axis). At the same time, it is possible to move the volcano plots to the supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested a single figure panel (Figure 1D) depicting the parallel changes in transcript levels (log2 Fold change) identified in PFC (x-axis) and Hypo (y-axis) has been incorporated and volcano plots has been moved to Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 (Male DEGs) and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 (Female DEGs) of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.4. Preliminary analysis done by the reviewer by applying tissue cell deconvolution methods evidenced in favour of possible specific trends in cell numbers in the limbic brain regions studied.

Please consider additional analyse of the data on the individual transcripts levels reported in the RNA-Seq analysis in a way similar to 2-way or 3-way (when appropriate) factorial ANOVA, to identify possible additive and non-additive patterns of changes in the levels of transcripts.</p></disp-quote><p>The RNA sequencing experiment was performed using three replicates for each condition. All these replicates were then used for analysis using the Tuxedo pipeline which uses Cuffdiff2 to determine differentially expressed genes.</p><p>Cuffdiff2 combines a Î² distribution model to account for the count uncertainty arising from the high sequencing depth while it uses a negative binomial distribution to take care of the over dispersion problem that may exist during sequencing. The algorithm counts the fragments aligned per kb of exon per million reads which is then used to calculate p value. Moreover, it performs a Benjamini-Hochberg correction on the p value to account for false-discovery rate. After the whole procedure, the corrected p value (also labelled as q value in the output) is a statistically trusted significance measure. Therefore, ANOVA may not be required on this value as it would not account for FDR. Further, it will not be able to account for biological noise which do not show up in the FPKM values of individual replicates. The noise is accounted for by analysis of raw alignment data which Cuffdiff2 performs. The algorithm is used widely in the field and currently has more than 3000 citations.</p><p>The authors completely agree with reviewers that ANOVA is essential when analyzing qRT-PCR data and therefore, it has been included in relevant graphs of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.6. It will be also interesting to know on cell specificity of DEGs identified in PFC.

In the introduction, it looks like that the authors consider an aggression trait as a behavioural continuum between &quot;zero-level&quot; aggression to appropriate violence, and then to &quot;escalated&quot; aggressive behaviour.
