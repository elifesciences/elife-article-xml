network that regulates many aspects of cell biology. Recently, we discovered crosstalk between AMPA/Kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and the Wnt-pathway during the initial Wnt3a-interaction at the cytonemes of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, we demonstrate that this crosstalk persists throughout the Wnt3a-response in ESCs. Both AMPA and Kainate receptors regulate early Wnt3a-recruitment, dynamics on the cell membrane, and orientation of the spindle towards a Wnt3a-source at mitosis. AMPA receptors specifically are required for segregating cell fate components during Wnt3a-mediated asymmetric cell division (ACD). Using Wnt-pathway component knockout lines, we determine that Wnt co-receptor Lrp6 has particular functionality over Lrp5 in cytoneme formation, and in facilitating ACD. Both Lrp5 and 6, alongside pathway effector β-catenin act in concert to mediate the positioning of the dynamic interaction with, and spindle orientation to, a localised Wnt3a-source. Wnt-iGluR crosstalk may prove pervasive throughout embryonic and adult stem cell signalling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Wnt signalling</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd><kwd>glutamate receptors</kwd><kwd>spindle orientation</kwd><kwd>cytonemes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (102513/Z/13/Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Habib</surname><given-names>Shukry J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (102513/Z/13/Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Habib</surname><given-names>Shukry J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Receptors for two distinct pathways are linked to choreograph the dynamic interaction of Wnt on the stem cell membrane, which leads to the control of asymmetric cell division.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell-to-cell communication is fundamental to multicellular life. Developmental signals critical for tissue patterning and formation are traditionally considered as diffuse signals that pervade the extracellular matrix. However, signals have often been found to be delivered to target cells or received from source cells via specialized signalling filopodia — cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Stem cells, both embryonic and adult, regulate tissue formation. Many stem cells rely on Wnts as signals for self-renewal and differentiation in the balance of cell fate determination during development, tissue homeostasis, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcin and Habib, 2017</xref>). Wnt ligands bind receptor Fzd, alongside co-receptors Lrp5 or Lrp6, ultimately leading to β-catenin-dependent transcription of target genes. In several systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertrand, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang and Niehrs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sugioka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walston et al., 2004</xref>), including mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habib et al., 2013</xref>), localised Wnts induce oriented asymmetric cell division (ACD).</p><p>As cultured single cells that retain the capacity to self-renew and differentiate to all adult lineages, ESCs are an ideal experimental system for studying cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martello and Smith, 2014</xref>). By combining ESCs and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) to generate 3D structures that resemble the developing embryo, we recently identified ESC-generated cytonemes that mediate the interaction with Wnt-secreting TSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Junyent et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junyent et al., 2020</xref>). To overcome the multiplicity of signals and the difficulty in visualising secreted Wnt ligands, we used Wnt3a tethered to microbeads, showing that ESC-cytonemes selectively recruit self-renewal-promoting Wnt3a ligands. Cytonemes interacting with localised Wnt3a signals engage not only Wnt-receptors, but also ionotropic AMPA/Kainate-type glutamate receptors (iGluRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Junyent et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junyent et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, rapid calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) transients are generated at the cytoneme, leading to Wnt3a reactivity: Wnt3a-bead recruitment to the cell body (soma), activating Wnt/β-catenin signalling and promoting asymmetric cell division (ACD) of markers of cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habib et al., 2013</xref>). iGluRs are primarily studied in excitatory glutamatergic synapses between neurons, however they are increasingly being found in other cell types, such as stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Genever et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morhenn et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skerry and Genever, 2001</xref>) and functioning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). AMPA- and Kainate-type iGluRs are tetrameric glutamate-sensitive (amongst other ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>) ion channels. AMPA/Kainate receptors require subunits GriA3 and GriA4, or GriK1 and GriK3 to function, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cull-Candy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>). Activation increases their ion permeability, inducing rapid ion influxes critical to signal transmission.</p><p>However, it remained unknown how the interconnected roles of Wnt-pathway and AMPA/Kainate receptor components influence highly dynamic Wnt3a interactions, and the subsequent Wnt3a-mediated ACD of ESCs.</p><p>Here, we resolve the dynamics of localised Wnt3a ligand (Wnt3a-bead) recruitment by single ESCs into three stages: initial cytoneme-mediated interactions; Wnt3a-bead interaction with the cell membrane; and the subsequent effects of the Wnt3a-bead recruitment on spindle orientation and cell fate determination. We generated ESCs knocked-out (KO) for the AMPA- and Kainate-type iGluRs by double knock-out (dKO) of critical protein subunits (AMPA: GriA3/4dKO; Kainate: GriK1/3dKO). Multiple clonal cell lines were investigated alongside pharmacological inhibition, both previously- and newly-generated mutants for Wnt co-receptors (Lrp5KO, Lrp6KO and Lrp5/6dKO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junyent et al., 2020</xref>, and inducible β-catenin KO ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raggioli et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We show that while Lrp6, β-catenin and AMPA/Kainate receptors are required for the population-wide cytoneme-mediated uptake of Wnt3a-beads, neither AMPA nor Kainate receptors are important to the formation of cytonemes themselves. Lrp5, conversely, has an inhibitory role in regulating cytoneme generation in single ESCs and Wnt3a-bead accumulation at cell-population level. In WT ESCs, Wnt3a ligands are recruited from initial cytoneme interaction site at the cell periphery, towards the centre of the cell soma, a process which requires Lrp5, Lrp6, β-catenin, AMPA, and Kainate receptors. Upon progression to mitosis, WT ESCs orient the spindle towards Wnt3a-beads but not inert (chemically inactivated) iWnt3a-beads. Cells lacking Lrp5, Lrp6, β-catenin, AMPA, or Kainate receptors have significantly impaired ability to orient the spindle towards the Wnt3a signal source.</p><p>WT ESCs divide asymmetrically in response to a Wnt3a-bead, producing a self-renewed proximal ESC cell and a distal cell that is prone to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habib et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, we demonstrate that Lrp5 is not required for Wnt3a-mediated ACD, while Lrp6 and β-catenin are crucial. Importantly, we distinguish that AMPA receptors, but not Kainate receptors, are critical in the cell fate determination of Wnt3a-mediated ACD in ESCs.</p><p>Taken together, we show that AMPA/Kainate-type iGluR activity is incorporated throughout the interaction of ESCs with localised Wnt3a signals. We dissect the dynamic interaction of Wnt3a-ligand with ESC, from initial uptake to cellular division, showing that its efficient regulation requires Wnt co-receptors and downstream β-catenin in concert with AMPA/Kainate receptor activity. Our multiple clone approach to component KOs suggests that the downstream cellular responses to localised Wnt3a of spindle orientation and asymmetric cell division are impervious to clonal variation in the initial dynamics of the Wnt3a-interaction. Through this, we specify novel differences between the roles of Lrp5 and 6, and between AMPA- and Kainate-type iGluRs in the response to localised Wnt3a.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wnt co-receptors and β-catenin regulate Wnt3a-bead accumulation by modifying the cytonemes of ESCs</title><p>We aimed to investigate how components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) affect the cellular dynamics of ESCs and their capacity to respond to localised Wnt3a ligands.

Similar to our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junyent et al., 2020</xref>), in the presence of solubilised Wnt3a ligands 49.07% of wild-type (WT) cells express eGFP, while only a basal level of pathway activation is observed in these cells in the absence of Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Lrp5/6dKO and βKO ESCs cannot activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in response to solubilised Wnt3a addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

Cytonemes of single ESCs lacking Lrp6 (Lrp6KO, Lrp5/6dKO) exhibit reduced reactivity (decreased Wnt3a-bead uptake following initial contact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junyent et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, Lrp6KO and Lrp5/6dKO showed long-term impaired Wnt3a-bead accumulation at the population level, remaining at ~33% cells with beads over the course of 12 hr. This resembled the interaction of WT cells with iWnt3a-beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D and F</xref>). While cells lacking β-catenin (βKO) retain the capacity to efficiently recruit Wnt3a signals in single-cell–single-bead interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junyent et al., 2020</xref>), they had significantly impaired long-term Wnt3a-bead accumulation at the population level, reaching a maximum mean of 32.7% cells with beads after 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).</p><p>Together with cytoneme formation, cell motility provides a mechanism to encounter and interact with the local environment. To understand whether cytoneme formation or Wnt3a-bead accumulation is coupled to cellular motility, we calculated the Mean Squared Displacement per minute (MSD), the average movement per minute, of single cells. Cell motility in WT ESCs is minimal, with a median MSD of 1.08 μm<sup>2</sup>/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). No significant differences to WT were observed between receptor or β-catenin KO ESCs, with the median MSD for each cell type falling between 0.74 and 1.36 μm<sup>2</sup>/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, we observed that intrinsic Wnt/β-catenin components control the generation and function of cytonemes without affecting overall cellular motility. Single-cell effects, such as shortening of the cytonemes (in βKO ESCs) or changes in the functionality of the cytonemes (Lrp6KO, Lrp5/6dKO ESCs, or WT ESCs contacting iWnt3a-beads) are reflected in population-level changes in the rate of Wnt3a signal accumulation over a prolonged period.</p><p>Despite these differences, it is important to note that, in all conditions, some cells do take up and retain Wnt3a-beads, allowing further analysis of the interaction with localised Wnt3a.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Wnt3a-bead positioning at the membrane is controlled by Wnt co-receptors and β-catenin</title><p>Cytoneme-mediated Wnt3a recruitment is the first stage in the process of signal reception, followed by a period of dynamic cell-signal interaction at the membrane of ESCs.

In these conditions the bead is stabilised after 90 min in mean positions ranging from 0.62 to 0.70 for Lrp6KO and Lrp5/6dKO, to ~0.70 for βKO ESCs. Lrp5KO ESCs position the Wnt3a-beads at approximately 0.6 after 120 min, further from the centre of the cell than WT ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), with clonal differences in the initial positioning.</p><p>The dynamics of Wnt3a-cell interaction are also defined by the speed of Wnt3a-bead movement relative to the cell. Thus, we also calculated the MSD of the bead relative to the centre of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). iWnt3a-beads held by WT ESCs have a higher rate of movement than Wnt3a-beads, with a median MSD of 4.02 μm<sup>2</sup>/min versus 3.08 μm<sup>2</sup>/min for Wnt3a-beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

GriK1/3dKO impairs Wnt3a-bead recruitment without affecting the number or length of the cytonemes, or the rate of cytoneme generation in the population. AMPA-type receptors (involving GriA3/4) play lesser roles in ensuring Wnt3a-bead recruitment. Yet, both AMPA and Kainate iGluRs are important to correctly position the bead at the cell membrane, and to align the mitotic spindle towards the Wnt3a signal. Nevertheless, precise spindle orientation is also not required for Wnt3a-oriented ACD in these cells: Kainate receptors are dispensable for ACD but lack of GriA3/4 leads to reduced asymmetric cell fate marker segregation.</p><p>Together with our analysis of Wnt/β-catenin pathway KO ESCs, our results suggests that a dynamic crosstalk between AMPA/Kainate receptor signalling and Lrp6 is not only involved in signal recognition and response, as previously shown, but is important to regulate the spatial organisation and specification of dividing ESCs by Wnt3a.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cell fate and spatial positioning occur in concert to achieve proper tissue organisation.

Additionally, components of the Wnt pathway regulate the length and number of cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junyent et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, we show in this study that knockout of AMPA or Kainate receptors does not affect cytoneme formation.</p><p>The Wnt co-receptors Lrp5 and Lrp6 have mostly been studied in the context of β-catenin-dependent signalling, where they have overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Houston and Wylie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tamai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wehrli et al., 2000</xref>), albeit to different levels of efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holmen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we demonstrate differing roles between them: endogenous expression of Lrp6 alone in ESCs (in Lrp5KO) results in an increased rate of cytoneme formation over WT ESCs, while cells lacking Lrp6 (Lrp6KO and Lrp5/6dKO) have a reduced rate of cytoneme formation, suggesting a distinct role for Lrp6 in cytoskeleton regulation.</p><p>Both Lrp5 and Lrp6 contain cytoplasmic domains that can bind to regulators of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krause et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>), however this region of Lrp5 has just 37% identity to Lrp6, compared to 69% overall sequence identity between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>). We speculate that such differences might contribute to their differential roles in cytoneme formation/elongation: Lrp5 may compete with Lrp6 for the interaction of Wnt-pathway components or cytoskeletal regulators. Hence, improved Lrp6-cytoskeleton interactions may facilitate the increased rate of cytoneme formation and initial Wnt3a-bead recruitment observed in Lrp5KO ESCs.</p><p>WT ESCs use cytonemes to efficiently recruit Wnt3a-beads, and subsequently position them near the centre of the cell. iWnt3a-beads cannot be recruited with the same efficiency. Additionally, iWnt3a-beads are maintained nearer the periphery of the cell, with shorter and less stable interactions. AMPA/Kainate receptor activity is involved throughout the Wnt3a-interaction. AMPA or Kainate receptor KO ESCs, similarly to those lacking Lrp6 or β-catenin, are able to recruit Wnt3a-beads via cytonemes, but over 12 hr are inefficient in their population-wide accumulation of Wnt3a-signal compared to WT or Lrp5KO ESCs.</p><p>Beyond the initial interaction between cell and Wnt3a-ligand, a role for AMPA/Kainate receptors lies in controlling the dynamics of Wnt3a on the membrane. Unlike WT ESCs, neither AMPA nor Kainate receptor KO cells are able to relocate the Wnt3a-bead from the cytoneme-periphery and retain it near the centre of the cell. Pharmacological inhibition of both AMPA and Kainate receptors together by CNQX resulted in a similar phenotype with an enhanced effect. The KO of Wnt-pathway components Lrp5, Lrp6 or β-catenin also reduces the ability to position a Wnt3a-bead on the membrane near the centre of the cell.</p><p>Following ligand-receptor binding, Wnt-pathway component polarisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capelluto et al., 2002</xref>) and oligomerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cong et al., 2004</xref>) are suggested to play roles in the enhancement or modulation of Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>). Here, the spatial stabilisation and colocalisation of upstream and downstream pathway components at a ‘signalling hub’ may be critical for efficient signal transmission. In fact, we previously demonstrated colocalisation of Lrp6 and AMPA/Kainate receptors during ESC interaction with a Wnt3a-bead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Junyent et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Membrane receptors, including glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2006</xref>), have been demonstrated to flow from membrane protrusions towards the centre of the cell. This motion can be promoted by directed movement of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2010</xref>) and its efficiency can be governed by the activation of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hartman et al., 2009</xref>). Areas of relative membrane concavity, such as the cell centre away from the periphery, have also been shown to enhance membrane receptor interactions with intracellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rangamani et al., 2013</xref>). This process may be required for more efficient signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmick and Bastiaens, 2014</xref>). Therefore, the control of the Wnt3a-bead positioning in WT ESCs may facilitate efficient protein interactions required for signal transduction, enhancing downstream pathway activation.</p><p>After Wnt3a-bead recruitment and upon progression to mitosis, WT ESCs orientate the spindle towards the source of localised Wnt3a at anaphase. Perturbation of the AMPA/Kainate receptors or Wnt/β-catenin pathway components resulted in significant impairment of the alignment of the spindle to localised Wnt3a, suggesting that both pathways function in concert during this process.</p><p>Interestingly, AMPA receptors are involved in Wnt3a-mediated ACD. While Kainate receptor KO had no significant effect, both AMPA receptor KO and AMPA receptor–specific inhibition by NBQX significantly compromised Wnt3a-mediated ACD. Similarly, Wnt3a-mediated ACD is impaired when ESCs lack Lrp6 or β-catenin. Lrp5KO ESCs, however, much like with Kainate receptor KO, remain able to asymmetrically segregate pluripotency markers to the proximal cell, despite the lack of precise alignment of the spindle towards a Wnt3a-bead at anaphase. Therefore, a robust spindle orientation towards a Wnt3a-bead is not required for asymmetric fate outcome. Our data further demonstrates a differential requirement for Lrp5 and Lrp6 in ESCs, beyond the rate of cytoneme formation, in the regulation of cell fate. Interestingly, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblast can tolerate certain degrees of spindle misorientation due to disruption in internal polarity cues during early stages of cell division.

Further, glutamate acts as a nutrient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hottes et al., 2004</xref>) and chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Felzenberg et al., 1996</xref>) to the bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus.</italic> This bacterium undergoes ACD to replicate its ‘stalked’ form, and to generate a motile ‘swarmer’ cell.

Cells from each condition that attached and generated cytonemes were selected. For each cell, the number and length of their cytonemes was measured from the cell centre, 10 times in timepoints separated by 10 min. The distance between the cell centre and the membrane was also measured in these timepoints. The average number of cytonemes, as well as the maximum length for any cytoneme was calculated, and the average cell centre to cell membrane distance was subtracted from the values. The normalised values are reported in the figure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image analysis: percentage of cells with cytonemes or Wnt3a-beads over time</title><p>Brightfield videos of ESCs and Wnt3a-beads at 1 min resolution were also used to measure the percentage of cells presenting cytonemes or contacting Wnt3a-beads. Cytoneme generation was analysed every hour for the first 4 hr of each video (timepoints 0–4 hr), while Wnt3a-bead contact was analysed for the totality of the video (timepoints 0–12 hr). Several positions were analysed for each independent video, on Fiji (ImageJ), to count the total number of cells in the frame, the number of cells with cytonemes and/or the number of cells in contact with Wnt3a-beads. Cell counts in the different positions of each video were summed to avoid position-specific differences, and the percentage values were calculated per time-point, as presented in the figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image analysis: Wnt3a-bead position and movement in the cell and cell movement</title><p>Single ESCs that recruited a Wnt3a-bead with a cytoneme and retained contact with it for ≥180 min were selected to measure Wnt3a-bead position and movement on the membrane.

Sample sizes (N) were selected such that the power of the statistical analysis performed was sufficient, in accordance with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habib et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junyent et al., 2020</xref>). When indicated in the figure legends, the cells analysed were pooled approximately evenly from at least three independent experiments, and analysis were performed on the pooled data. Outliers were considered as individual data points significantly outside the range of possible/meaningful values for each assay and were excluded from subsequent analysis. For all figures, symbols indicate statistical significance as follows: *p<italic>&lt;0.05</italic>, **p<italic>&lt;0.01</italic>, ***p<italic>&lt;0.001,</italic> ****p<italic>&lt;0.0001.</italic> Non-significance was set as p&gt;0.05. All numerical source data, as well as statistical analysis results including adjusted p-values can be consulted in the source data file for each figure.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (102513/Z/13/Z) to SJH. We acknowledge financial support from the Department of Health via the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre award to the Guy’s and St Thomas National Health Service Foundation Trust in partnership with King’s College London and the King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

and LRP6, its downstream effector b-catenin as well as the ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) AMPA and Kainate receptors in the dynamic process of Wnt-ligand recruitment and retention via specialized cytonemes in embryonic stem cells and their role in oriented asymmetric cell division (ACD) using microbead-tethered Wnt ligands. Understanding the mechanism of how Wnts affect cell fate choice is of great interest in light of the well-established role of Wnt signaling in many aspects of cell biology including embryogenesis and the increasing interest in generating synthetic organs on a chip. Intriguingly, the crosstalk between Wnt and glutamate receptors in ACD in ESCs and thus the link between the sensing of external chemo-attractants and polarization and compartmentalization of cell fate components suggest that these processes are evolutionary conserved. The authors have included a tremendous amount of additional novel data including analysis of ESC lines with knock-outs of the Kainate subunits GriK1 and GriK3, the AMPA subunits GriA3 and GriA4 as well as of additional knock-out clones for LRP5, LRP6 and LRP5/6 in the revised manuscript, which support and advance their original findings.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

Understanding the mechanism of how Wnts affect cell fate choice is of great interest in light of the well established role of Wnt signaling in many aspects of cell biology including embryogenesis and the increasing interest in generating synthetic organs on a chip. Although this manuscript describes several novel findings, the reviewers have raised the concern that some data are very similar to those published by the same group in PNAS earlier this year, and that the biological relevance of the findings is not clear. A major revision of the manuscript focusing on the novel data, a clear demonstration of the link between Wnt-regulated cytoneme formation and ACD and additional functional data would significantly improve the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Junyent et al. is a follow-up study of a paper by the same group recently published in PNAS. The PNAS manuscript showed that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) use specialized cytonemes to interact/pair with trophoblast stem cells (TSCs), which is the basis for spatial organization and specification of embryonic tissues. They further described cytoneme selectivity to self-renewing Wnt signals and clarified the initial mechanism, which is Lrp6-dependent and requires activity of AMPA/Kinate receptors (ionotropic glutamate receptors, iGluRs).</p><p>The current manuscript goes beyond this to study the dynamics of cytoneme formation and retention of the Wnt ligand on the membrane, which mediates asymmetric cell division. They dissect the individual roles of Lrp5, Lrp6 and iGluR activity in these processes. Here they reveal a novel function of Lrp5 in limiting the rate of cytoneme formation and also in ligand retention. Moreover, they show that accurate spindle orientation is not required for cell fate decisions. Although Lrp5KO results in a misoriented spindle, as long as the Wnt is retained on one side of the cell and can activate Wnt/b-catenin signalling, ACD occurs. Furthermore, as far as I'm aware, the cross-talk between iGluR and Wnt signalling in Wnt ligand retention and oriented ACD, and thus cell fate decision has not been studied before.</p><p>In general, the experiments seem well performed and controlled.</p><p>The authors have dissected the role of the Wnt pathway components and iGluRs in cytoneme formation and also in ACD/cell fate. What is not clear is whether the 2 processes are interlinked. Can the authors establish this relationship?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;Wnt-and Glutamate-receptors orchestrate stem cell dynamics and asymmetric cell division&quot; Junyent et al. report a live cell imaging based approach to delineate the contribution of Lrp5, Lrp6, β catenin and iGluR in Wnt mediated asymmetric cell division. Experiments reported in this manuscript appear technically sound and experiments in Figures 4 and 5 provide interesting aspects about Wnt mediated asymmetric cell division in stem cells. However, I have some concerns that substantially diminish my enthusiasm for this paper and feel that the advance in our understanding of asymmetric cell division in stem cells provided by this manuscript is quite limited:</p><p>1. My main point of criticism is that it is not made clear which aspects and conclusions of this manuscript are substantially novel over the PNAS paper published earlier this year by the same group (Junyent et al., 2020 PNAS). Specifically, data in Figures 1 and 2 report data very similar to Figure 4 of the PNAS manuscript. The individual contributions and differential roles of Lrp5 and Lrp6, the involvement of β-catenin and the effects of CNQX treatment have also been reported in the PNAS paper. This manuscript under review feels like an annex to the PNAS paper rather than a stand-alone story. The authors should take care not to generate the appearance of publishing duplicate findings and focus only on novel data and novel key conclusions.</p><p>2. Figure 5 shows that the previously reported deficiency in establishing asymmetric cell division in Lrp5, Lrp6 and β-catenin KOs and CNQX treated cells has direct consequences on the distribution of Nanog between daughter cells. One aspect that is surprising tough is the asymmetric distribution of Rex1. Rex1 is to my knowledge a non-functional component of the pluripotency circuit (unlike Nanog) and therefore a rather surprising choice for experimentally addressing its asymmetric distribution. I am wondering what could be the developmental rational for such an asymmetric distribution of what seems purely a naïve pluripotency marker, rather than a constituent of the naïve network. Rex1 staining appears largely cytoplasmic in the proximal and distributed panels in Figure 5A, which is surprising for a transcription factor. This should be clarified/commented on. Have the authors assessed the distribution of more functional components of the naive GRN?</p><p>3. Experiments on KO ESCs without performing rescues (by restoration of the endogenous locus or by expression of the missing gene from a transgene) carry the risk of studying artefacts or clonal effects. Regardless of whether KO ESCs show the expected effect or not, these experiments are essential. Alternatively, multiple KOs, generated using different gRNAs can be used to ascertain causative relationships between genotype and phenotype. Along these lines, WT cells used in this study (W4) are not the proper control for β catenin inducible KO ESCs. Parental cells before 4OHT treatment must be used as control.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript 'Wnt- and Glutamate-receptors orchestrate stem cell dynamics and asymmetric cell division' by Junyent et al. presents a comprehensive analysis on the role of WNT co-receptors Lrp5 and Lrp6, WNT signalling mediator b-catenin, and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In particular, the authors made use of a previously established approach based on microbead-tethered WNTs to expose ESCs to localised WNT3a to study the dynamics of cytoneme formation, WNT3a bead recruitment and stabilisation, and WNT-oriented asymmetric cell division in live-imaging experiments.</p><p>Generally, the manuscript is well written and the data is appropriately presented. The manuscript describes a number of observations on the kinetics of WNT-bead interactions in in LRP5, LRP6, LRP5/6dKO and b-catenin KO ESCs as well as ESCs treated with iGluR inhibitor CNQX. However, I am not sure about how conclusive the data is in terms of biological relevance as the only functional assay is the analysis of expression of two pluripotency markers after asymmetric cell division. For example, WT ESCs undergo asymmetric cell division (ACD) predominantly oriented towards the WNT3a beads. In contrast, spindle orientation in ESCs without LRP5, b-catenin or iGluRs activity appears randomized. However, this randomized spindle orientation does not have an impact on the asymmetric distribution of pluripotency markers in LRP5 KO ESCs but in ESCs without iGluRs activity.</p><p>This manuscript is a follow up study to the group's recent paper published in PNAS (Junyent et al. 2020). My concern is that some data seems to be redundant to the results presented in the PNAS paper. This manuscript describes WNT3a responsiveness, number and length of cytonemes, WNT3A-bead interactions in LRP5, LRP6, LRP5/6dKO and b-catenin KO ESC lines. As far as I can see, this was already shown in the PNAS paper. Similar videos submitted for this manuscript showing protrusions in each of the KO cell lines were published alongside the PNAS paper. Having said that, I appreciate that this manuscript provides additional insight and a more comprehensive analysis.</p><p>Another concern is technical: The numbers in the source data do not always match the numbers presented in the plots or mentioned in the text. Generally, these are minor differences (see specific comments), but nevertheless need to be carefully revised. Also, the source data for Figure 5 includes data on Dsh2 KO cells, which is not included in this manuscript.</p><p>1. The manuscript implies that KO ESC lines were generated for this study (e.g. p1 line 18: 'Through live imaging and gene editing, we show…'; p.5 line 6-: '…we knocked-out (KO) the co-receptors…as previously described.'). However, as far as I can see, these cell lines were generated for the PNAS study (Junyent et al. 2020) and re-used for this study, which needs to be more clearly phrased.</p><p>2. Figure 1B,C: Were the betaKO cells treated for 3 days with 4-HT before WNT3a addition?</p><p>3. Figure 1C: Numbers in source file do not exactly match some numbers in plot or text: E.g. LRP5KO +WNT3a – Source file: 26.967; Plot: 26.82; Text: 26.66.</p><p>4. p5 lines 28-29: '…, cell lines were cultured as single cells at low density…' This sounds equivocal, since single ESCs do proliferate and form colonies.</p><p>5. p5 lines 23-29: You describe that the KO cell lines can be maintained in 2i conditions, but the experiments are performed in serum conditions w/o 2i. Therefore, I was wondering, whether the KO cell lines can be maintained in serum conditions?</p><p>6. Fig 1D, E and videos shows protrusions of ESCs: I was wondering, whether the coating of the dish affects cytoneme formation (I believe your Methods section does not indicate, which coating you used)?</p><p>7. Length of cytonemes: Since there are references to a figure and videos, I first thought that this is newly generated data for this manuscript. But it seems that this is data from the PNAS paper. Therefore, I suggest to keep the description of the results very brief or move it to the introduction.</p><p>8. Videos: I was able to watch all but one (LRP5KO ESC.avi) of the video files. Not sure whether this is related to my hardware but the other videos worked w/o issues.</p><p>9. Figure 1F: How did you treat dividing cells in your quantifications? Also: Figure legend indicates n≥3 experiments; N≥50 cells each. However, the source data shows measurements for each condition/genotype for 50 or less than 50 cells (so it is not equal or greater than 50). Could you please clarify whether the plot is based on three biological independent replicates?</p><p>10. Figure 2: As mentioned above – how did you treat dividing cells in your quantifications?</p><p>11. p.7 line 8: WT cells show a rise (cells with beads) from 20.68% to 50.60% in the first 4 hours. The value 50.6% corresponds to the 3h timepoint in the source data (and not 4h, which is 56.7%).</p><p>12. Figure 2D: source data shows values for 50 or more cells per condition/genotype except for CNQX treated cells (n=46) – please modify your figure legend accordingly.</p><p>13. Since all imaging measurements are central to this study, I suggest to include a more comprehensive description in the Methods section describing how this was done. If you developed macros for Fiji, these should be included.</p><p>14. Figure 3E: Again, less than 50 data points in the source data (49). Please change figure legend accordingly.</p><p>15. p.8 line11 – header: Lrp5 and Lrp6 have 'vital' roles in the positioning of Wnt3a beads: The data does not show that the observed effects on bead recruitment and retention is biologically relevant (ie vital)</p><p>16. Figure 4: Numbers in source data do not always match with numbers in plots. E.g. WT+iWnt3a: 102 values in total. Plot depicts: n=105. Total number used for calculations for Chi-square test: 101. Another example: WT+Wnt3a beads: total number of values in source data: 100; Plot depicts: n=101; Total number used for calculations for Chi-square test: 102 etc. Please revise this plot and recalculate statistical tests.</p><p>17. Referencing of figures in the text should be in consecutive order (which is not the case for Figure 5)</p><p>18. Figure 5: Rex1 is a transcription factor, which is localised in the nucleus. However, in Figure 5A it looks like Rex1 is localised in the cytoplasm of cells?</p><p>Also, in serum conditions, pluripotency marker expression is heterogeneous. Therefore, I would be interested to see this analysis with the control that you used in all previous experiments, i.e. WT+iWNT3a-beads.</p><p>The analysis in Figure 5 does not determine, whether the symmetric or asymmetric distribution of pluripotency markers is preceded by a WNT3a-bead oriented asymmetric division. Therefore, I believe that it is not valid to draw the conclusion that if ESCs show proximal distribution of pluripotency markers, that they underwent WNT-oriented ACD.</p><p>I wonder whether KO ESCs or ESCs treated with CNQX show impaired exit from pluripotency and differentiation towards a particular cell lineages?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Wnt-and Glutamate-receptors orchestrate stem cell dynamics and asymmetric cell division&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

In vivo, Wnt proteins are often locally secreted and presented to only one side of the responsive cell.</p><p>Our data demonstrates that cytonemes are the mechanism that ESCs use to recruit the localised Wnt ligands. Therefore, without recruitment, the subsequent processes of Wnt-oriented ACD cannot occur.</p><p>Our data suggests that Wnt-pathway components are involved in the formation of cytonemes prior to Wnt-contact, whereas the subsequent Wnt-recruitment and dynamics on the membrane are complex interactions between the AMPA/Kainate receptors, the Wnt-pathway, and the cytoskeleton. This dynamic process links initial cytoneme formation to the spatial control of Wnt3a ligands during orientated ACD, which is orchestrated by the activity of both AMPA/Kainate receptor and Wnt pathways. We have expanded the Discussion section to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;Wnt-and Glutamate-receptors orchestrate stem cell dynamics and asymmetric cell division&quot; Junyent et al. report a live cell imaging based approach to delineate the contribution of Lrp5, Lrp6, β catenin and iGluR in Wnt mediated asymmetric cell division. Experiments reported in this manuscript appear technically sound and experiments in Figures 4 and 5 provide interesting aspects about Wnt mediated asymmetric cell division in stem cells. However, I have some concerns that substantially diminish my enthusiasm for this paper and feel that the advance in our understanding of asymmetric cell division in stem cells provided by this manuscript is quite limited:</p><p>1. My main point of criticism is that it is not made clear which aspects and conclusions of this manuscript are substantially novel over the PNAS paper published earlier this year by the same group (Junyent et al., 2020 PNAS). Specifically, data in Figures 1 and 2 report data very similar to Figure 4 of the PNAS manuscript. The individual contributions and differential roles of Lrp5 and Lrp6, the involvement of β-catenin and the effects of CNQX treatment have also been reported in the PNAS paper. This manuscript under review feels like an annex to the PNAS paper rather than a stand-alone story. The authors should take care not to generate the appearance of publishing duplicate findings and focus only on novel data and novel key conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for this comment and appreciate the concern. In the revised manuscript, we provide additional new data and have reorganised the manuscript to highlight the difference between the novel data of our current manuscript and the published findings in PNAS.</p><p>Validation of the Wnt-pathway activation of cell lines, including additional clones by soluble Wnt ligands is carried out in the same way as, but importantly is independent from, previously published data (Junyent et al. 2020). We agree that such data should take a more minor position, and as such this is clearly reflected in the new version of the text.</p><p>Figure 2 onwards presents novel data exploring the kinetics of cytonemes and the dynamics of Wnt to cell interactions.</p><p>Clone #1 for KO ESCs lacking Wnt-pathway components were featured in our previous publication only in terms of the characteristics and Wnt-reactivity at the individual cytoneme level.</p><p>Incorporating suggestions raised at the initial review stage, the new manuscript includes additional KOs for the AMPA and Kainate receptors, and a second cell line for all clonal KO ESCs to address the effects of clonal variation. For each of these cell lines, we have analysed from the pre-Wnt-contact stage of cytoneme formation, through Wnt-membrane dynamics, to the later effects on cell division and cell fate. Previous data in the PNAS paper focused on the initial cell-Wnt interaction. Therefore, the two manuscripts explore contiguous, but independent, biological questions.</p><p>The AMPA and Kainate receptor KO cell lines have allowed the dissection of their respective roles throughout Wnt-interaction, and not just at the moment of Wnt3a-bead contact, as in the PNAS paper. We have identified clear differences in their function, particularly in cell fate determination at Wnt-mediated ACD. This, alongside AMPA-specific pharmacological inhibition raises the standard of the study above that of solely CNQX-mediated inhibition of AMPA/Kainate receptors together.</p><p>Similarly, the differential roles of Lrp5 and Lrp6 in Wnt interaction were only investigated at a single timepoint in the PNAS paper. Here, we have characterised differences throughout the time course of Wnt-interaction. Of particular note are the findings that Lrp5 KO enhances cytoneme formation higher than that of wildtype, and that Lrp6, but not Lrp5, is required for asymmetric partitioning of cell fate determinants and markers.</p><p>Clarification of these novel findings and reducing the involvement of previously published data in the updated manuscript has significantly enhanced the new findings of the manuscript and the understanding of Wnt-ESC interaction, dynamics and ACD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 5 shows that the previously reported deficiency in establishing asymmetric cell division in Lrp5, Lrp6 and β-catenin KOs and CNQX treated cells has direct consequences on the distribution of Nanog between daughter cells.</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note that the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway components and AMPA/Kainate receptors in spindle orientation and asymmetric cell division (ACD) of ESCs is shown for the first time in this manuscript. We have further clarified this distinction in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One aspect that is surprising tough is the asymmetric distribution of Rex1. Rex1 is to my knowledge a non-functional component of the pluripotency circuit (unlike Nanog) and therefore a rather surprising choice for experimentally addressing its asymmetric distribution. I am wondering what could be the developmental rational for such an asymmetric distribution of what seems purely a naïve pluripotency marker, rather than a constituent of the naïve network. Rex1 staining appears largely cytoplasmic in the proximal and distributed panels in Figure 5A, which is surprising for a transcription factor. This should be clarified/commented on. Have the authors assessed the distribution of more functional components of the naive GRN?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment, and we present the following information to explain the use of Rex1 analysis. Briefly, our previous work (Habib et al., 2013) has demonstrated the ACD of several pluripotency markers, including Nanog, Rex1, Sox2 and Stella, by both live-imaging and protein immunostaining. This work suggested Nanog and Rex1 as robust markers for ACD, while other core pluripotency markers such as OCT4, which is also expressed in epiblast stem cells, is distributed similarly between both Wnt-daughter cells.</p><p>Furthermore, Rex1 is widely used as a sensitive reporter for the exit from naïve pluripotency for example in Kalkan et al., 2017, PMID: 28174249, Wray et al., 2011, PMID: 21685889, or Tischler et al., 2019, PMID: 30257965. Rex1, while indeed a transcription factor, can be found in nuclear, perinuclear, and cytoplasmic localizations (e.g. PMID: 22897771, PMID: 21530438) depending on the timepoint.</p><p>The asymmetric distribution of both Nanog and Rex1 together have influenced our conclusions of the asymmetric distribution of cell fate markers, and hence Wnt-induced ACD. Additionally, following the reviewer advice and to supplement our data, we have included analysis of Sox2 asymmetry in the updated manuscript, which corroborates the findings with Rex1 and Nanog.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Experiments on KO ESCs without performing rescues (by restoration of the endogenous locus or by expression of the missing gene from a transgene) carry the risk of studying artefacts or clonal effects. Regardless of whether KO ESCs show the expected effect or not, these experiments are essential. Alternatively, multiple KOs, generated using different gRNAs can be used to ascertain causative relationships between genotype and phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern. Following their advice, and in order to determine KO effects from clonal effects in all of our cell lines, we have newly generated an additional second clone for Lrp5KO, Lrp6KO, Lrp5/6dKO, GriA3/4dKO and GriK1/3dKO. We present their results alongside clone #1 throughout. Through this methodology, we found that initial clonal variability is present in cytoneme formation and early Wnt dynamics, however the clonal behaviours converge in the downstream effect of spindle orientation and the outcome of Wnt-mediated ACD.</p><p>Rescue experiments, by overexpression of target protein can have significant issues with artefacts that preclude their use in delicate studies of pathway activity. Not least due to aggregation, a common outcome in overexpression, which can lead to aberrant pathway activation, even in the absence of Wnt ligands (e.g PMID: 27840971, PMID: 11029007). However, in the revised manuscript, we have also included a rescue experiment to further crystallise the roles of Lrp6. Here, we overexpress Lrp6 in a Wnt coreceptor null (Lrp5/6dKO) cell line. This phenocopies Lrp6-only expression (as in Lrp5KO), recovering ACD but not spindle-orientation, and therefore further confirms our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along these lines, WT cells used in this study (W4) are not the proper control for β catenin inducible KO ESCs. Parental cells before 4OHT treatment must be used as control.</p></disp-quote><p>The parental cell line of the conditional β-catenin KO (β-catenin<sup>fl/-</sup>) is derived from W4, the same cell type used for wildtype and all KO cells. Additionally, β-catenin<sup>fl/-</sup> expresses the same levels of pluripotency markers, has a proliferation rate and low apoptosis, similar to WT W4 ESCs (Junyent S., et al. 2020 Figure S7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript 'Wnt- and Glutamate-receptors orchestrate stem cell dynamics and asymmetric cell division' by Junyent et al. presents a comprehensive analysis on the role of WNT co-receptors Lrp5 and Lrp6, WNT signalling mediator b-catenin, and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In particular, the authors made use of a previously established approach based on microbead-tethered WNTs to expose ESCs to localised WNT3a to study the dynamics of cytoneme formation, WNT3a bead recruitment and stabilisation, and WNT-oriented asymmetric cell division in live-imaging experiments.</p><p>Generally, the manuscript is well written and the data is appropriately presented. The manuscript describes a number of observations on the kinetics of WNT-bead interactions in in LRP5, LRP6, LRP5/6dKO and b-catenin KO ESCs as well as ESCs treated with iGluR inhibitor CNQX. However, I am not sure about how conclusive the data is in terms of biological relevance as the only functional assay is the analysis of expression of two pluripotency markers after asymmetric cell division. For example, WT ESCs undergo asymmetric cell division (ACD) predominantly oriented towards the WNT3a beads. In contrast, spindle orientation in ESCs without LRP5, b-catenin or iGluRs activity appears randomized. However, this randomized spindle orientation does not have an impact on the asymmetric distribution of pluripotency markers in LRP5 KO ESCs but in ESCs without iGluRs activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their attention to a particularly interesting and novel finding of our manuscript – that accurate spindle orientation towards Wnt3a-bead is not necessary for asymmetric cell division as long the mother cell is still in contact with the localised Wnt, such as in the Lrp5KO. We have further highlighted this point in the revised manuscript to clarify the biological relevance. Importantly, In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, for example, the neuroblast can tolerate certain degrees of spindle misorientation due to disruption in internal polarity cues during early stages of cell division. The cells have mechanisms to overcome this initial misorientation and retain the prospective cell fate of the daughter cells (e.g., PMID: 11117748, PMID: 10591217, PMID: 8779714, PMID: 7566172, PMID: 10591217).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript is a follow up study to the group's recent paper published in PNAS (Junyent et al. 2020). My concern is that some data seems to be redundant to the results presented in the PNAS paper. This manuscript describes WNT3a responsiveness, number and length of cytonemes, WNT3A-bead interactions in LRP5, LRP6, LRP5/6dKO and b-catenin KO ESC lines. As far as I can see, this was already shown in the PNAS paper. Similar videos submitted for this manuscript showing protrusions in each of the KO cell lines were published alongside the PNAS paper. Having said that, I appreciate that this manuscript provides additional insight and a more comprehensive analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments, and we are pleased that they find additional insight and more comprehensive analysis in this manuscript over previous findings.</p><p>Data previously published in PNAS forms an important part of the background and context for the experiments in this manuscript. This data is clearly referenced, and now, following the advice of the reviewer, we have reduced the emphasis on this information and present it more concisely.</p><p>The dynamic study of Wnt is typically made difficult by technical factors such as the tagging of endogenous protein. Our system overcomes these limitations and permits the investigation of Wnt-interaction in its entirety, and as a result highlights key sub-processes that lead to the Wnt-mediated final outcome of ACD. This concept is relatively little-understood, and as such our manuscript has a key novelty in the dissection of the interaction of cells with Wnt-ligands.</p><p>For the revised manuscript, we also add additional novel data and additional clonal analysis that have further delineated the mechanism of Wnt-stem cell dynamics and ACD. We obtained knock outs of the Kainate subunits GriK1 and GriK3, which are necessary for Kainate-type receptor formation (Lerma and Marques, 2013, PMID: 24139035), and are expressed by ESCs (Junyent et al., 2020). Additionally, we knocked out the AMPA subunits GriA3 and GriA4, which are also expressed by ESCs (Junyent et al., 2020) and can form Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductive AMPA receptors (Gull-Candy, 2006, PMID: 16713244). We have included these novel cell lines throughout our study, alongside Wnt-pathway mutants, and have established that both AMPA and Kainate receptors, while not involved in cytoneme formation, are involved in the Wnt-cell interaction at the membrane, and during spindle orientation. Particularly, AMPA-receptors, but not Kainate receptors, facilitate Wnt-mediated ACD. We strongly believe that this additional data significantly improves our understanding of Wnt-ESC dynamics and ACD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another concern is technical: The numbers in the source data do not always match the numbers presented in the plots or mentioned in the text. Generally, these are minor differences (see specific comments), but nevertheless need to be carefully revised. Also, the source data for Figure 5 includes data on Dsh2 KO cells, which is not included in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to specially thank the reviewer for the careful revision and data check.

Our live-imaging experiments are indeed performed in Serum w/o 2i, but only last up to 12 hours, which is too short a period to promote differentiation. Even under differentiation-specific conditions, ESCs require between 2-3 days to show markers of differentiation.

Please clarify the relationship between Wnt-mediated cytoneme formation and ACD/cell fate, and the novelty of the data presented in this manuscript and those published in your previous PNAS paper.

We have analysed these cells at the level of cytoneme formation and throughout the Wnt3a-interaction, showing that both AMPA and Kainate receptors play roles in the dynamic interaction between stem cells and Wnt3a. At ACD, we determine that AMPA and Kainate receptors play disparate roles in cell fate determination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
