Conventional methods involve surgical correction, short-term stabilization, and long-term bone grafting, which may include problematic allografts and limited autografts. While bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) has been used for bone regeneration, it can cause bone overgrowth and life-threatening inflammation. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapies, though promising, are not Food and Drug Administration approved and are resource intensive. Thus, there is a need for effective, affordable, and less side-effect-prone bone regenerative therapies. Previous research demonstrated that JAGGED1 induces osteoblast commitment in murine cranial neural crest cells through a NOTCH-dependent non-canonical pathway involving JAK2–STAT5. We hypothesize that delivery of JAGGED1 and induction of its downstream NOTCH non-canonical signaling in pediatric human osteoblasts constitutes an effective bone regenerative treatment. Delivering pediatric human bone-derived osteoblast-like cells to an in vivo murine bone loss model of a critically sized cranial defect, we identified that JAGGED1 promotes human pediatric osteoblast commitment and bone formation through p70 S6K phosphorylation. This approach highlights the potential of JAGGED1 and its downstream activators as innovative treatments for pediatric CF bone loss.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>JAGGED1</kwd><kwd>bone regeneration</kwd><kwd>craniofacial bone loss</kwd><kwd>non-canonical JAG1–NOTCH pathways</kwd><kwd>tissue regenerative therapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01DE031271-01-A11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Andres</given-names></name><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Levi</given-names></name><name><surname>Goudy</surname><given-names>Steven L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE026762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goudy</surname><given-names>Steven L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR062920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Andres</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR062368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Andres</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Innovative JAGGED1-based therapies show promise for pediatric craniofacial bone loss, potentially overcoming limitations of current treatments with more effective and accessible solutions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Craniofacial (CF) injuries comprise more than 25% of injuries reported to the National Trauma Data Bank in the US every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nardi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). Left untreated, CF injuries can severely impair critical daily functions related to breathing, speech, eating, and swallowing, thus requiring urgent repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Current methods to repair CF bone loss include the direct implantation of either allografts or autografts, and/or subsequent revision surgeries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grover et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts and Rosenbaum, 2012</xref>). Although generally successful, these conventional treatments present several limitations. Bone donor sites include rib, fibula, iliac crest, scapula, distal tibia, and medial femoral condyle. All these donor sites have limited availability and are not anatomically like the bone they replace; osteotomies are required to shape them so that they resemble the shape of the CF bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kakabadze et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chim et al., 2010</xref>). The allograft survival rate following an iliac graft procedure is 96.1% and the risk of infection ranges from 5% to 33% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts and Rosenbaum, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaushu et al., 2010</xref>). For maxillary or mandibular bone replacement, the iliac crest is the preferred graft source due to its robust corticocancellous anatomy. Risks associated with iliac crest grafting include significant pain at the donor site, nerve injury, decreased load bearing on the ipsilateral leg, and increased risk of hip fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahlin and Johansson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumhauer et al., 2014</xref>). Due to the limited supply of bone, revision bone graft surgeries are often required and are expensive ($35,000–$52,000 per patient) and cause great discomfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laurie et al., 1984</xref>). These and other complications undermine the patient’s quality of life in addition to the social stigma resulting from the facial deformity, which can also lead to psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Sousa, 2010</xref>).</p><p>CF bone development primarily occurs through intramembranous ossification, a process where pre-osteoblasts mineralize directly, without a cartilage intermediate, making it distinct from long bone development (endochondral ossification) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shah et al., 2021</xref>). Intramembranous ossification recruits cranial neural crest (CNC) cells as osteoblast precursors during CF bone development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shah et al., 2021</xref>). Extensive efforts have been made toward using parathyroid hormone (PTH (1-34)), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1, or transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGFβ2) as alternatives to bone regenerative treatments in preclinical models but resulted in limited success as an in vivo treatment option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rowshan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elsalanty and Genecov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nosho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takayama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanese et al., 2013</xref>). Platelet-rich plasma supplemented with various biological growth factors such as VEGF, FGF, and TGFβ2 have also been used to enhance wound healing, chemotaxis, angiogenesis, proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells, and osteoblasts. Many of these studies demonstrated potential improvement in bone healing; however, these strategies face significant translational barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanese et al., 2013</xref>). Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved bone regenerative strategy along with the delivery of stem cells. BMP2 is used to reconstruct spine and maxillary bone in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zuk, 2008</xref>). BMP2 treatment can lead to ectopic bone growth, hypertrophy and life-threatening side effects (e.g., uncontrolled inflammation), which may accelerate bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tannoury and An, 2014</xref>). The use of BMP2 for the treatment of pediatric cases of CF trauma is not FDA approved due to concerns of severe swelling of the face and airways. Although generally considered safer, stem cell-based treatments are time consuming, have heterogenous results and add to the high expense of repairing CF bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zuk, 2008</xref>). Thus, there is a critical need for novel bone regenerative therapies to treat CF bone loss that have minimal side effects, are readily accessible, and affordable<italic>.</italic></p><p>The NOTCH signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes, including determination of cell fate, and has been explored as a potential target for regeneration of long bone injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zanotti and Canalis, 2012</xref>). NOTCH signaling occurs via cell-to-cell binding of a NOTCH ligand (e.g., JAG1) to a NOTCH receptor. Internalization of the NOTCH intracellular domain leads to the expression of canonical NOTCH genes <italic>HES1</italic> and <italic>HEY1</italic>, which are known to have both osteo-inductive and osteo-inhibitory roles, thus obfuscating the effectiveness of NOTCH-based bone regenerative therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nobta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Regan and Long, 2013</xref>). However, we and others have demonstrated that JAG1 exhibits osteo-inductive properties<italic>,</italic> as demonstrated by induction of pre-osteoblast genes like <italic>Runx2</italic> in murine CNC cells, even when the canonical NOTCH pathway is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamalakar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Youngstrom et al., 2017</xref>). Our recent publications further identified a JAG1–JAK2 non-canonical signaling pathway that promotes murine CNC commitment to osteoblast differentiation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamalakar et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>This unexpected finding raises critical questions about the role of non-canonical JAG1 signaling during human CF regeneration. In this study, we postulate that (1) JAG1 can induce osteoblast differentiation and mineralization of pediatric human bone-derived osteoblast-like (HBO) cells, and (2) the delivery of JAG1 non-canonical signaling constitutes an effective treatment for inducing bone regeneration in a pediatric, preclinical CF bone loss model. Consequently, we evaluated (1) the ability of JAG1 to regenerate bone in a pediatric critically sized CF defect murine model when delivered in a synthetic hydrogel coupled with pediatric HBO cells, and (2) characterized the downstream JAGGED1 non-canonical signaling mechanisms. Our results reveal potential treatment options in the form of JAG1 and/or its downstream targets to induce bone regeneration in CF bone loss injuries and provide alternative treatment options for CF defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>JAG1 induces mineralization of pediatric human bone-derived osteoblast-like cells</title><p>To test whether JAG1 induces osteoblast commitment and differentiation in human osteoblast-like primary cells, we derived human bone osteoblast-like (HBO) cell lines (HBO1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) from seven healthy pediatric human bone samples, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lockyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). HBO cells were then treated with Fc-Dynabeads (Fc-bds) (5.7 μM) as a negative control, since JAG1 is a chimeric recombinant protein with an Fc-portion, and JAG1-Dynabeads (JAG1-bds) (5.7 μM), in the presence of osteogenic media. On day 21, the cells were stained for mineralization using Alizarin Red S stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). We observed significantly increased mineralization in JAG1-bds-treated samples compared to growth media-, osteogenic media-, and Fc-bds-treated (p = 0.0107) cells. Additionally, PCR analysis of HBO1 cells from a repeat experiment collected at days 7, 14, and 21 showed significantly increased expression of osteogenic genes with JAG1-bds stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>ALPL</italic> was significantly expressed at day 7, with a 3.5-fold increase (p = 0.0004) compared to HBO1 cells grown in growth media.

Interestingly, while some mineralization is observed in the osteogenic media and Fc-bds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) conditions, there were no significant increases in osteogenic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We recently reported that JAG1 can induce murine CNC cell osteoblast commitment and repair cranial bone defects in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamalakar et al., 2021</xref>). To establish a more translatable use of JAG1 in treating CF bone loss, we assessed whether JAG1 can stimulate human cells (pediatric HBO) to facilitate bone regeneration in NOD-SCID mice, to prevent graft rejection of the HBO cells. JAG1-Dynabead-PEG-4MAL hydrogels also encapsulating pediatric HBO cells obtained from three separate donors were implanted in critically sized parietal bone defects (4 mm) in NOD-SCID mice (<italic>n</italic> = 4–6 per donor, 13–15 total) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The volume of bone regenerated by the JAG1-PEG-4MAL-pediatric HBO hydrogel with or without DAPT, an inhibitor of NOTCH canonical signaling, was measured using micro computed tomography (μCT), and compared to HBO cells alone, Fc-bds (20 μM) + BMP2 (2.5 μM) treatments. To maintain continuous osteogenic induction, additional JAG1-PEG-4MAL-pediatric HBO cells and control hydrogels were injected into the defects transcutaneously at week 4. After 8 weeks, we quantified differences in bone volume (BV) within the cranial defect using μCT analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). We observed that there was minimal bone regenerated in mice treated with cells alone. As expected, BMP2 significantly increased regenerated BV (p = 0.0002) compared to the cells alone group. The BV regenerated by JAG1-bds in the absence (fold change: 1.5) and presence of DAPT (fold change:1.6) was significantly higher compared to the cells alone treatment group (p = 0.0092 and 0.0021, respectively). There was no sex-based difference in regenerated BV. An initial pilot study also demonstrated no difference in bone regeneration between an Empty Defect model (no HBO cells) and a Cells Alone group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, paraffin sections of mouse skulls were stained with Masson trichrome stain, as described in methods under histology. Qualitative assessments of the stained sections revealed increased collagen (blue color) in samples obtained from mice treated with BMP2, as expected, and with JAG1-bds and JAG1-bds + DAPT compared to the mice treated with cells alone. To validate the results observed in the samples stained with Masson trichrome, we performed immunohistochemical 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining with additional sections from the same mice using rabbit IgG monoclonal anti-COL1A1 antibody. These results corroborate what was revealed with the Masson trichrome staining, that mice treated with cells alone had less collagen production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Comparison of the JAG1-bds and JAG1-bds + DAPT conditions revealed clusters of genes that were up- or downregulated by JAG1 stimulation and remained with inhibition of NOTCH, that is, defining the non-canonical pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Serum-starved pediatric HBO cells were subsequently treated with JAG1-bds (5.7 μM) with or without DAPT (15 μM), to block the NOTCH canonical pathway, as a time course stimulation for 5, 10, 15, and 30 min. Phosphorylation levels for signaling molecules were assessed via Luminex-based multiplex assays. We observed significantly increased phosphorylation of multiple signaling molecules, including STAT5, AKT, P38, JNK, RELA, and p70 S6K in JAG1-bds-treated cells, even in the presence of DAPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We have previously shown that JAG1 induced the phosphorylation of STAT5 during CNC cell differentiation to osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamalakar et al., 2021</xref>). Prior studies emphasize the importance of non-canonical signaling, crosstalk between NOTCH, and other cellular signaling mechanisms. For example, the WNT pathway cross-talks with the NOTCH canonical pathway during vascular morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caliceti et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, previous reports have shown that STAT5 is essential for AKT–p70 S6K activity during lymphocyte proliferation in patients with leukemias and lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lockyer et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, the P38 pathway has been shown to activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)–p70 S6K pathway during oxidative stress in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells which culminates in upregulation of antioxidative enzymes that assist in reactive oxygen species removal and thereafter increase cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutiérrez-Uzquiza et al., 2012</xref>). Also shown previously, JNK phosphorylates p70 S6K to induce osteoblast proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3 cells, and can crosstalk in other physiological systems, for example, during hepatocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouxsein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Love et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>).

We observe in our results that many of the pathways activated by JAG1 in the pediatric HBO cells lead to the phosphorylation of p70 S6K, downstream. These findings implicating phospho-protein signaling pathways, especially NF-κB and AKT (downstream of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)) are consistent with our transcriptional profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and collectively implicate p70 S6K as a potential downstream contributor to JAG1-induced, pediatric HBO cell-mediated bone regeneration.

HBO cells were treated with growth media alone, osteogenic media alone, or Fc-bds (5.7 μM) as negative controls, and JAG1-bds (5.7 μM) with or without S6K-18, an inhibitor of phosphorylated p70 S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2011</xref>), in the presence of osteogenic media.

S6K-18-treated samples showed partial inhibition of 50.2% of the JAG1-bds-induced mineralization (p = 0.0015) and not 100%, possibly because the NOTCH canonical pathway was not inhibited in these samples.

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the fold change of BV regenerated by JAG1-bds in the presence of DAPT (fold change: 1.6, normalized to cells alone treatment) was comparable to JAG1-bds alone treatment (fold change: 1.5, p = 0.9583), and was significantly higher compared to the cells alone treatment group (p = 0.0038). The inhibition of NOTCH canonical signaling in mesenchymal stem cells using DAPT has been shown previously to enhance osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2019</xref>). A rheumatoid Arthritis C57BL/6 SCID mouse model carrying a human <italic>TNF</italic> transgene when treated with intermittent doses of DAPT showed improved bone regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). This supports our current results that JAG1 induces bone regeneration independently of NOTCH canonical signaling in the HBO cells. However, structural and mechanical properties of the bone will require characterization in the future using biomechanical testing.</p><p>As shown in our previous publications, JAG1-induced osteoblast commitment of murine CNC cells via a NOTCH non-canonical pathway. In our current data, it is observed that JAG1-induced HBO cells to regenerate bone and repair cranial defects even in the presence of a NOTCH canonical pathway inhibitor (DAPT), which suggests that JAG1-induced pediatric HBO cell-facilitated bone regeneration occurs via a NOTCH non-canonical pathway. Therefore, to identify the NOTCH non-canonical pathway targets that are activated by JAG1-bds in HBO cells, we isolated RNA from the JAG1-bds-treated HBO cells, subjected it to RNA sequencing and performed pathway analyses on the data obtained. The data showed that a total of 448 genes were upregulated, and 435 genes were downregulated in JAG1-bds and JAG1-bds + DAPT groups compared to no treatment and thus these genes participate in the non-canonical NOTCH signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Some of the genes that are upregulated as part of the non-canonical NOTCH pathway are known to be involved in osteoblast commitment (<italic>RUNX2</italic>), matrix remodeling (<italic>MMP3</italic>), and diverse cytokines and chemokines (<italic>CCL5</italic> and <italic>CXCL1</italic>). RUNX2 is commonly known to be expressed by osteoblasts as a sign of their recruitment into the lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Komori, 2010</xref>). MMP3 is also abundantly expressed by osteoblasts and is an important regulator of bone remodeling. MMP3 is an enzyme that is essential in the processing of collagen on bone surface, which in turn is necessary for osteoclast recruitment and bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jehan et al., 2022</xref>). Chemokine CCL5 is abundantly expressed by osteoblasts, and it is also involved in recruitment of osteoblast progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brylka and Schinke, 2019</xref>). PTH/parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) induces the differentiation of osteoblasts, and it has been shown that CXCL1 serves as an intermediate during this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Onan et al., 2009</xref>). GO analysis of the upregulated genes in the non-canonical pathway revealed significant enrichment of GO terms associated with <italic>RUNX2</italic>, cytokine signaling, and cell cycle as described earlier are involved in osteoblastic cell proliferation, recruitment, and differentiation leading to bone remodeling. <italic>RELA</italic> was also upregulated, and it is known to be a radiation-induced pro-survival factor in human osteoblastic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>). More interestingly, the PIP3 activating AKT signaling pathway was upregulated by JAG1-bds treatment, suggesting that JAG1 can activate NOTCH non-canonical signals via the AKT pathway. Collectively, these data reveal that JAG1 has a profound NOTCH non-canonical effect on HBO cells that stimulates HBO cell-osteoblast commitment and differentiation, and HBO-cell-induced bone formation.</p><p>We also obtained lysates from HBO cells treated with JAG1-bds in the presence and absence of DAPT and subjected them to Luminex-based multiplex assays. The Luminex-based assays demonstrated that JAG1 induces the phosphorylation of various signaling targets, including STAT5, AKT, P38, JNK, RELA, and p70 S6K, between 15 and 30 min, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. As discussed earlier, prior studies emphasize the importance of non-canonical signaling, crosstalk between NOTCH, and other cellular signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caliceti et al., 2014</xref>). These studies show that STAT5 is essential for AKT–p70 S6K activity during lymphocyte proliferation in patients with leukemias and lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lockyer et al., 2007</xref>), and that AKT–mTOR–p70 S6K, ERK, and NF-κB were involved together in proliferation of osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miwa et al., 2012</xref>). JNK was previously found to phosphorylate p70 S6K to induce osteoblast proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iijima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Svegliati-Baroni et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Żurek et al., 2019</xref>), and that the P38 pathway has been shown to activate the mTOR–p70 S6K pathway during oxidative stress in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutiérrez-Uzquiza et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, our results and the results of others demonstrate that the p70 S6K pathway may be a node at which osteoblast induction occurs in HBO cells, making it a potential major contributor to bone regeneration caused by JAG1-induced HBO cells. To test this hypothesis, we proceeded to confirm that p70 S6K is an essential target of the JAG1-induced NOTCH non-canonical signaling in HBO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). p70 S6K is an enzyme that phosphorylates the S6 ribosomal protein to initiate protein synthesis which supports growth, proliferation, differentiation, and glucose homeostasis of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ruvinsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruvinsky and Meyuhas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruvinsky et al., 2009</xref>). We found that JAG1-induced mineralization in HBO cells was predominantly (50.2%) inhibited by S6K-18, an inhibitor of the phosphorylation of p70 S6K, recognizing that other non-canonical signaling pathways are also important in bone regeneration (e.g., p38, AKT). However, inhibition of JAG1-induced mineralization caused by S6K-18 treatment alone was significant compared to that induced by JAG1-bds alone (p = 0.015), suggesting that the phosphorylation of p70 S6K is a significant contributor of osteoblast induction in JAG1-stimulated HBO cells. Thus, p70 S6K is an important downstream target of JAG1-NOTCH in JAG1-stimulated HBO cells.</p><p>Studying the mechanisms by which JAG1 induces osteoblast commitment and bone formation will enable new treatment avenues that involve the delivery of not only tethered JAG1 but also the JAG1-NOTCH non-canonical signaling intermediates themselves or their activators as powerful treatment options to induce bone regeneration in CF bone loss injuries. High-throughput screening for existent, FDA-approved drugs, compounds, and small molecules can be used to identify pharmacological activators of p70 S6K, as future directions of this study. Additionally, further investigation of RELA and the other downstream signaling targets identified in our Luminex-based assays are currently in the planning stages. These findings can provide powerful treatment options to induce bone regeneration in CF bone loss injuries and avoid the limitations with currently available therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>HBO cell isolation</title><p>HBO cell lines were derived from healthy fibulas of seven pediatric subjects under appropriate Institutional Review Board approval.

In fact, using the mouse-calvarial critical defect model, the authors have clearly shown the anabolic regenerative effect of JAG1 in via non-canonical pathways. Exploring the molecular mechanisms, the authors have shown that non-canonically JAG1 is regulating multiple pathways including STAT5, AKT, P38, JNK, NF-ĸB, and p70 S6K, which together possibly culminate to the activation of p70 S6K. In summary these findings have significant implications in designing new approaches for bone regenerative research.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92925.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kamalakar</surname><given-names>Archana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tobin</surname><given-names>Brendan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kaimari</surname><given-names>Sundus</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>M Hope</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Toma</surname><given-names>Afra I</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cha</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chihab</surname><given-names>Samir</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Moriarity</surname><given-names>Irica</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gautam</surname><given-names>Surabhi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bhattaram</surname><given-names>Pallavi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Abramowicz</surname><given-names>Shelly</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Drissi</surname><given-names>Hicham</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Andres</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Levi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Goudy</surname><given-names>Steven L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Emory University, Atlanta</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) Regarding the cell studies of human pediatric bone-derived osteoblast-like cells (HBO), the authors should provide a rationale for their selection of specific cell lines (15,16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24) in this study. As for animal studies, could the authors clarify which cell lines were utilized in the murine in vivo experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to address this. To reduce confusion, we have numbered the patient primary cell lines used in these studies sequentially from 1 – 7. Additionally, we have added “HBO cell lines used for experiments were selected based on the ability of the primary cell line to proliferate and mineralize in culture” to the Methods section.</p><p>In vivo experiments: “HBO cell lines 2, 6 and 7 from separate individuals were selected for these experiments based on similar growth and passage characteristics.” This statement is included in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In this study, the authors performed the murine in vivo experiments using both male and female mice. Could the author clarify if any difference was observed between male and female mice in the findings? This information would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added the following to the Results section: “There was no sex-based difference in regenerated bone volume.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although the histological results showed an elevated collagen expression in mice treated with BMP2, JAG1, and JAG1 + DAPT compared to those treated with the cells alone, the differences among groups were subtle. The authors should consider the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for collagen 1 on the samples, allowing for a quantitative assessment of collagen 1 expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. The differences between BMP2, JAG1, and JAG1 + DAPT are indeed subtle. We have added Supplementary Figure 5, showing collagen staining of sections from the same FFPE blocks that were sectioned and stained with Masson Trichrome in Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>(4) Please specify which cell lines are represented in the staining results shown in Fig.1A and Fig. 5A, respectively.</p></disp-quote><p>In Fig 1A the representative images are of HBO2. Fig 5A representative images are of HBO7. We have added this information to the figure legends for these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) There appears to be a discrepancy in the specified size of the critical defect. The manuscript states that the size is 4mm, while Supplemental Figure 3 indicates 3.5mm.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this catch! Yes, it should be 4mm. This has been corrected in Supplementary Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The scale bar for Figure 2 C is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Scale bars have been added which also gave us an opportunity to brighten the images equally, allowing for better distinction between the different colors of the Masson Trichrome staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In the methodological section 2.5 for JAG1 delivery, it would be helpful if the authors could review the initial dosage of JAG1 delivery to confirm if HBO cells were included or not, given that the MicroCT results indicate that all groups incorporated HBO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. In response to another question, we have added Supplementary Figure 4 which includes an “Empty Defect” condition with no HBO cells, making the original method statement accurate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In the current study, using in vitro and in vivo models the authors clearly show that JAG1 can enhance osteogenesis and thus can be helpful in designing new therapeutic approaches in the field of bone regenerative research. The in vivo mouse CF model is very convincing and shows that JAG1 promotes osteogenesis via non-canonical signaling. Mechanistically it seems that JAG1 activates STAT5, AKT, P38, JNK, NF-ĸB, and p70 S6K. However, additional evidence is needed to convincingly conclude that all the non-canonical pathways activated via JAG1 converge at p70 S6K activation. The following concerns need to be addressed.</p><p>(1) In Fig 1A: Even though the Jag1-Fc shows a very significant increase in HBO mineralization, there are no significant increases in cells in osteogenic media when compared to control growth media. Even though the different conditions were subjected to RNAseq analysis in the later figures, qPCR analysis of some osteogenic genes in Figure 1 might be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to explore this question further. We conducted mineralization experiments in triplicate and performed qRT-PCR, assessing for gene expression of 5 osteogenic genes: ALPL, BGLAP (osteocalcin), COL1A1, RUNX2, and SP7. Results are shown in Figure 1C and this text was added to Results: “Additionally, PCR analysis of HBO1 cells from a repeat experiment collected at days 7, 14, and 21 showed significantly increased expression of osteogenic genes with JAG1-bds stimulation (Figure 1C). ALPL was significantly expressed at Day 7, with a 3.5-fold increase (p=0.0004) compared to HBO1 cells grown in growth media. In contrast, significant expression levels of COL1A1 and BGLAP were observed at 14 days, with a 5.1-fold increase (p=0.0021) of COL1A1 and a 12.3-fold increase (0.0002) of BGLAP when compared to growth media conditions. Interestingly, while some mineralization is observed in the osteogenic media and Fc-bds</p><p>(Figure 1A) conditions, there were no significant increases in osteogenic gene expression (Figure 1C). Expression of RUNX2 and SP7 was not significantly altered across all conditions and time points (not shown).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Fig 2: even though not needed in respect to the hypothesis, was there any Control group without any cells or JAG1 beads? What were the changes in between that group and cells cells-only group?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not observed differences between the “Empty Defect” group and the “Cells alone” group.</p><p>We have addressed the reviewer’s comments by adding this comparison in Supplementary Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Transcriptional profiling and ELISA (Fig 3 and 4) show upregulation of NF-ĸB signaling in response to JAG1. In the discussion, the authors have referenced a previous study showing NF-ĸB as prosurvival in human OB cells. However, based on many published reports, NF-ĸB activation has been shown to inhibit OB function. Does JAG1 regulate HBO cell survival via NF-ĸB activation?</p><p>Experimenting using NF-ĸB inhibitor can be helpful to show that JAG1 mediates NF-ĸB activation is anabolic in this experimental setup.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We are eager to explore this new direction for our research in a subsequent study. We have added this to our future directions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Fig 5:</p><p>(A) Condition showing JAG1+ DAPT is needed to compare between JAG1 canonical and noncanonical signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have added Supplementary Figure 6, which includes a dose response experiment for JAG1 + DAPT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(B) S6K18 alone seems to be increasing OB mineralization. Is that statistically significant?</p></disp-quote><p>No, and we have added the statistical analysis for S6K-18 to Figure 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(C) Fc alone condition seems to have a very significant increase in OB mineralization. Does Fc alone upregulate OB function?</p></disp-quote><p>We do see some upregulation of mineralization with Fc in vitro, which we also observed in our previous studies with mouse neural crest cells, but we have not found it to be osteogenic in vivo. We have added a statement to this effect, with references. Additionally, osteogenic gene expression was not upregulated in our in vitro mineralization experiments with Fc. See Revised Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(D) Although overall quantification shows that S6K18 partially inhibits HBO mineralization, the representative images do not represent the quantification. Transcriptional analysis (qPCR) is required to validate these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed qRT-PCR on cells from a repeat mineralization assay, collecting cells at 9, 14, and 21 days. We have added the following to the Results:” While inhibition of NOTCH and p70 S6K decreased mineralization in our mineralization assay, there are no statistically significant changes in gene expression for ALPL, COL1A1, or BGLAP (Supplementary Figure 7). These results suggest that the HBO cells phenotypes are maturing into osteocytes and that inhibiting p70 S6K hinders the cellular ability to mineralize but not the cell phenotype progression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Finally, to convincingly conclude the data from Fig 5, the mouse CF model can be helpful to support the authors' claim that JAG1 acts via p70 S6K.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We have modified our conclusions to reflect that p70 S6K is one of the non-canonical pathways that JAG1 may be activating in bone regeneration.</p><p>Thank you very much for your consideration of our revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
