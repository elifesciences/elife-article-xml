pattern the emerging germ layers. Understanding how these different responses are regulated is a central question for developmental biology. In this study, we used mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation to uncover a new mechanism for PI3K signalling that is required for endoderm specification. We found that PI3K signalling promotes the transition from naïve endoderm precursors into committed anterior endoderm. PI3K promoted commitment via an atypical activity that delimited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Akt1 transduced this activity via modifications to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and appropriate ECM could itself induce anterior endodermal identity in the absence of PI3K signalling. PI3K/Akt1-modified ECM contained low levels of Fibronectin (Fn1) and we found that Fn1 dose was key to specifying anterior endodermal identity in vivo and in vitro. Thus, localized PI3K activity affects ECM composition and ECM in turn patterns the endoderm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00806.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00806.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00806.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>From conception to birth, a single fertilised egg will multiply into trillions of cells, with each cell becoming one of the 200 or so different types of cell that are found in the human body. The development of an embryo is complex and dynamic, with cells giving up their ability to become any cell type and committing to becoming a specific cell type within a given tissue. At the same time, different groups of cells migrate to the appropriate locations within the developing embryo. Although it is challenging to decipher the roles of the individual signalling pathways that control an embryo’s development, several important components have been found.</p><p>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a protein that regulates the formation of the endoderm: this is the innermost of the three layers of cells that form in the early embryo, and it gives rise to internal organs such as the gut, liver and pancreas. As well as ‘telling’ cells to become the front part, or anterior, of the endoderm, FGF also controls the migration of these cells within the embryo. However, uncoupling these two roles has been a major challenge, and the molecular mechanisms behind them are unclear.</p><p>Now, Villegas et al. have discovered that FGF activates a signalling cascade involving two enzymes called PI3K and Akt1. In lab-grown embryonic stem cells—cells that can be coaxed to become any of the cell types formed during development—this signalling cascade is essential for FGF to trigger differentiation of the cell types found in the anterior endoderm. The PI3K/Akt1 signalling cascade achieves this by reducing the level of a protein called fibronectin in the ‘extracellular matrix’ that surrounds the cells. This low level of fibronectin will in turn induce cells to stick together in an organized layer; and this rearrangement of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions appears linked to triggering the differentiation of anterior endoderm cell types.</p><p>Villegas et al. showed that the PI3K/Akt1 pathway was also essential for endoderm formation in living mouse embryos. As a normal embryo develops, the anterior endoderm cells move into a ‘groove’ at the front the embryo, where the level of fibronectin is lower than it is at the posterior end of the embryo.</p><p>These findings highlight the importance of the extracellular matrix in the regulation of embryonic development, and should assist in the effort to turn lab-grown stem cells into the useful cell types found in internal organs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00806.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00806.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>Fibronectin</kwd><kwd>PI3K/Akt1</kwd><kwd>endoderm</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>foregut</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0701428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villegas</surname><given-names>S Nahuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation, Section for Basic Stem Cell Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rothová</surname><given-names>Michaela</given-names></name><name><surname>Villegas</surname><given-names>S Nahuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/D019621/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Bihan</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name><name><surname>Barrios-Llerena</surname><given-names>Martin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5RO1HL103920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Astrof</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Heart Association Innovative Research Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12IRG9130012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Astrof</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-DK084391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name><name><surname>Pulina</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A signalling cascade involving PI3K/Akt1 remodels the extra-cellular matrix to achieve atypical cellular responses and control cell fate specification within the embryonic endoderm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding the mechanisms regulating axis formation in vertebrate development has been one of the central questions in modern developmental biology. It involves the activity of a number of conserved signal transduction pathways. However, the complex set of morphological rearrangements that occur during gastrulation make it difficult to uncouple the role of specific signals in mediating cell migration from those acting directly on cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Villegas et al., 2010</xref>). Embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation offers a tractable in vitro model, which can be used to complement the analysis of embryos. ESCs are karyotypically normal, self-renewing and pluripotent cell lines derived from the mammalian blastocyst that can be driven to differentiate toward all the three germ layers. Adherent ESC differentiation models, therefore, allow direct access to mechanisms regulating cell fate decisions in a stable defined environment. The inductive activity of specific signalling pathways can be tested on isolated progenitor populations, allowing the deciphering of specific target cells and paracrine interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murry and Keller, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The specification of visceral organs is intricately linked to the establishment of positional identity and begins with the formation of the endoderm germ layer. Endoderm progenitors will give rise to the entire digestive track in addition to thymus, thyroid, liver, pancreas, lungs, gallbladder as well as the extra-embryonic component of the visceral yolk sac. Therefore, understanding the basis for endoderm induction is the first step in attempting directed differentiation to organ cell types. In mammals, endoderm induction occurs in two waves. The first occurs at implantation and leads to the formation of the extra-embryonic visceral endoderm and the second occurs during gastrulation. During gastrulation, the precursors of the definitive endoderm emerge from the anterior region of a transient embryonic processing centre known as the primitive streak (PS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zorn and Wells, 2009</xref>). These precursors will either push away, or intercalate into, the visceral endoderm that surrounds the embryo proper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burtscher and Lickert, 2009</xref>). The first endoderm to emerge from the PS region is the anterior definitive endoderm (ADE) or prospective foregut. These cells move forward along the midline of the embryo to convey anterior information to the emerging neural axis and eventually give rise to the liver, pancreas and other derivatives of the foregut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zorn and Wells, 2009</xref>). ADE induction is dependent on a network of specific transcription factors downstream of Wnt and high levels of Nodal related TGF-beta signalling. However, as this emerging endodermal signalling centre moves forward during gastrulation, it starts to express antagonists of both these signals, protecting the anterior neural ectoderm from the mesoderm inducing properties of these pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tam and Loebel, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In addition to Nodal and Wnt signalling, we have recently uncovered an additional requirement for Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signalling in endoderm and ADE specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morrison et al., 2008</xref>). FGF signalling is also required to induce the morphological rearrangements that are normally associated with gastrulation and endoderm migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamaguchi et al., 1994</xref>), including the induction of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that enables the beginning of cell migration. EMT and cell migration are also regulated by the substrate upon which cells adhere, the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hynes, 2009</xref>). For example, PS formation can be inhibited on the anterior side of the embryo as a consequence of the visceral endoderm depositing ECM components that block cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Egea et al., 2008</xref>) and FGF signalling has been linked to visceral endoderm-dependent deposition of basement membrane components in ESC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Villegas et al., 2010</xref>). However, while these studies link FGF signalling to ECM composition and cell migration, they do not address how ECM could be involved in patterning the embryonic axis or induction of specific cell types during ESC differentiation.</p><p>In this study, we resolve the ability of FGF signalling to induce both endoderm and morphogenetic movements. We uncoupled the signalling downstream of the FGF receptor using an in vitro mESC based model for endoderm induction. We found that endodermal patterning by FGF was dependent on a PI3K/Akt1 activity that temporally restricts EMT. This unexpected PI3K/Akt1 activity, which we show is required both in vivo and in vitro, is transduced via a modification to ECM composition, which in itself, promotes cell type specification. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we further identified ECM components and found that Fibronectin (Fn1) levels were an essential determinant of the ECM-dependent endoderm patterning activity. Taken together, our findings link anterior-posterior (A–P) patterning of the endoderm to EMT and uncover a novel ECM-based mechanism for the activity of PI3K/Akt1 signalling during germ layer specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A specific requirement for PI3K during anterior induction within the endoderm</title><p>To address the basis of the requirement for FGF during endoderm differentiation and anterior specification, we applied several small molecule inhibitors to a defined adherent mESC endoderm differentiation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Livigni et al., 2009</xref>). Differentiation conditions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and the medium used is defined in ‘Materials and methods’ section. We used BMP4 together with modest doses of the Nodal-like TGF-beta Activin A, to promote the differentiation of mESCs to epiblast-like cells, followed by the further differentiation of epiblast towards PS and endoderm in the presence of FGF and Activin A. Through the use of this staged differentiation protocol we have been able to generate committed ADE from ESCs more efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morrison et al., 2008</xref>). We monitored the formation of ADE, anterior primitive streak (APS) and endoderm in general, using either single or combinatorial fluorescent reporter ESC lines generated by gene targeting. These included the fluorescent reporter gene RedStar under the transcriptional control of the early anterior endoderm marker <italic>Hhex</italic> (HRS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and a GFP under the control of the <italic>Goosecoid</italic> (<italic>Gsc</italic>) locus, a marker of PS and APS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). For additional resolution of ESC differentiation to endoderm we used the cell surface marker, Cxcr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morrison et al., 2008</xref>). ADE was identified as either double positive for Hhex and Cxcr4 (H<sup>+</sup>C<sup>+</sup>) or Hhex and Gsc (H<sup>+</sup>Gsc<sup>+</sup>). Differentiation of these reporter lines was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (q-RT-PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which confirmed that these cells pass through the in vitro equivalents of specific developmental stages, including PS, APS (or mesendoderm), and ADE, thereby recapitulating in vivo development. Based on these data, we designated the specification phase leading up to PS specification as phase 1 and the stage of subsequent mesoderm and endoderm segregation as phase 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The transition between phase 1 and 2 is marked by the appearance of Gsc-GFP cells during day 3.0–3.5 of ESC differentiation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00806.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of PI3K signalling disrupts Hhex positive ADE specification, but does not interfere with mesendoderm induction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of ESC differentiation towards ADE.

However, while inhibition of different MAPKs (with PD032, SP and SB) also resulted in a dramatic reduction in mesendodermal and pan-endodermal, Hhex<sup>−</sup>Cxcr4<sup>+</sup> (H<sup>−</sup>C<sup>+</sup>) populations, only PI3K inhibition with LY had a specific effect on induction of ADE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

Thus, all these kinases were required broadly for ESC differentiation towards mesoderm and endoderm, but only PI3K appeared specific to the transition between mesendoderm and committed ADE. To confirm that these signalling requirements were specific to phase 2, we also examined the effects of these inhibitors in phase 1. Inhibition of either JNK or PI3K was highly toxic, leading to extensive cell death, even at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Inhibition of MEK resulted in ESC-like colonies that maintained <italic>Nanog</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,E</xref>) consistent with a requirement for MEK signalling during early ESC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kunath et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stavridis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ying et al., 2008</xref>).

Thus, the induction of ADE was dependent on the action of PI3K early during phase 2. During this phase of differentiation two populations of Gsc-GFP expressing cells (Gsc<sup>low</sup> and Gsc<sup>high</sup>) become apparent. We found that Hhex<sup>+</sup> ADE cells were always Gsc<sup>high</sup> suggesting they arose specifically from the earlier Gsc<sup>high</sup>Hhex<sup>−</sup> population. We also found that this Gsc<sup>high</sup> population was diminished in the presence of LY while the Gsc<sup>low</sup> population was considerably expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Thus, PI3K was required in early PS precursors to generate Gsc<sup>high</sup> cells that can later give rise to Hhex<sup>+</sup> ADE. When LY-treated cells were released from the PI3K block and cultured for an additional 3 days in phase 2 differentiation conditions, we observed a complete recovery of Hhex induction, suggesting that in the absence of PI3K cells fail to progress in differentiation, but they were maintained in a less differentiated endodermal naïve state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We therefore tested the hypothesis that the ADE inducing activity downstream of Akt1 might be the result of specific Akt1-dependent ECM proteins. We reasoned that if the role of Akt1 in anterior patterning is conducted by the production of a specific ECM, then if we expose differentiating cells to the action of an ECM generated under normal conditions, pAkt1 would no longer be necessary for ADE induction. To do so, we prepared ECM from untreated differentiating ESC cultures (ECM1) or from cultures treated with LY (ECM2). These ECM preparations were then tested for their ability to induce or rescue endoderm differentiation in the presence of LY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). HRS-Gsc-GFP cells were differentiated to the APS GFP<sup>+</sup> stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), collected, re-plated onto the different matrices or gelatine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and differentiated in the presence or absence of LY. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows that ECM1, but not ECM2, could support ADE differentiation in the presence of LY. Moreover, ECM1 not only restored anterior induction, but the combination of LY and ECM1 enhanced anterior endoderm specification, such that these cultures were almost 60% ADE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data suggest that the capacity of LY to enhance Sox17<sup>+</sup>Foxa2<sup>+</sup> expression was harnessed by ECM1, which was able to convert the Sox17<sup>+</sup>Foxa2<sup>+</sup> naïve population into Hhex<sup>+</sup> prospective foregut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

These cellular movements, the ECM that cells move on and the signals they are exposed to during their migration all contribute to the patterning of the embryonic endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>). The non-canonical ECM-dependent pathway downstream of PI3K described here provides an explanation for the diversity of cellular responses that can be achieved through the activation of pAkt1. PI3K/Akt1 signalling has been extensively associated with the induction of EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larue and Bellacosa, 2005</xref>) rather than its suppression. However, in the context described here, Akt1 modifies the ECM to drive cell–cell contact and either induce or preserve epithelial identity. Thus, high levels of PI3K activity ensure that Fn1 levels remain low and that EMT is suppressed. The involvement of an ECM intermediate also provides context for an endoderm specific role for FGF signalling. FGF receptor activation is essential for ESC differentiation towards multiple lineages and leads to Grb2 and SHP2 recruitment, activating both PI3K and MAPK signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kouhara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Villegas et al., 2010</xref>).

In this context, Akt1 activation supports human ESC self-renewal by inhibiting Raf/Mek/Erk and canonical Wnt signalling, which in turn may also promote EMT, although it is not clear whether this route takes place in vivo during early endoderm differentiation or how comparable the mouse and human ESC differentiation models are. Accordingly, the transient reduction in pAkt1 we observed at the beginning of differentiation may be coupled to early activation of the ERK and Wnt pathways as cells become prepared for mesoderm and endoderm induction. However, prior to the appearance of endoderm gene expression, differentiating ESCs contained high levels of pAkt1 and this appeared essential for the deposition of the correct, Fn1<sup>low</sup> regionalized ECM. That cells rapidly down-regulate Snai1 upon re-plating suggests that the ECM-dependent pathway described here allows rapid modifications to differentiation as cells become exposed to a new environment.</p><p>The basement membrane produced during endoderm differentiation is complex and proteomic analysis supports the association of the ECM with functional cell membrane components in a matrisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hynes and Naba, 2011</xref>). How do these elements impact on the key signalling events regulating lineage specification? Several elements of this matrisome are directly involved in Fn1 signalling and exogenous Fn1 can alter ECM activity. Genetic studies indicate that Fn1-integrin interactions are essential for axial extension of the mesendoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davidson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsden and DeSimone, 2003</xref>). However, Fn1 is not required for gastrulation and specific endodermal patterning defects have not been previously reported. The <italic>Fn1</italic> and <italic>Itga5</italic> null mutants are both embryonic lethal and die by E10.5 due to cardiovascular problems, posterior truncations, and kinking of the neural tube among others defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">George et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 1993</xref>). We observed higher levels of Fn1 in the posterior region of gastrulation stage embryos and the region where the nascent foregut moves into was uniquely low in Fn1. In Fn1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos, the region of Cer1 positive ADE is expanded, suggesting that the deposition of Fn1 may help to restrict the prospective foregut domain as it migrates up from the distal end of the embryo. Consistent with this observation, the foregut did not fold into a tube and remained as a flat field of expanded Foxa2<sup>+</sup> cells in Fn1<sup>−/−</sup> embryos, indicating that the regulation of Fn1 deposition helps delineate and form the prospective foregut. We also observed a similar inverse correlation between the expression of Sox17 and Cer1, indicating that Sox17 is expressed at higher levels in Fn1 rich regions of the endoderm. This is consistent with our in vivo and in vitro data, which show significantly higher levels of Sox17 expression in naïve endoderm that was generated in response to inhibition of PI3K.</p><p>In addition to Fn1, we identified additional potential determinants that could interact with Fn1 in modulating ECM activity. Two out of the three main Heparan Sulphate-bearing species, Perlecan and Col18a1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Halfter et al., 1998</xref>) were expressed at high levels in ECM1. <italic>Knock down</italic> of these two HSPG’s have been shown to impair endoderm differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Higuchi et al., 2010</xref>). Potentially, this HSPG-bearing ECM could be acting in conjunction with low levels of Fn1 to modulate growth factor bioavailability, and operate as a platform for cytokine signalling. As the cytokines we added exogenously to the cultures were not found in either ECMs, we think it is unlikely that this explains the full activity of these ECMs in vitro<italic>.</italic> However, we did find that ECM1 contained Nodal and Lefty1, whereas ECM2 contained Fgf8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data SD3-data">Figure 7—source data 2,3</xref>). It has been suggested that specific modifications in the ECM are required for Nodal transport within the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marjoram and Wright, 2011</xref>). Moreover, the inclusion of Nodal, Lefty1 and Fgf8 within these matrices fits with the locus of their extracellular activity in vivo. Our observation that these cytokines appear specifically embedded in the ECM suggests that the mechanism by which these proteins function in vivo involves association with ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hynes, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Despite widespread attempts to use ESC differentiation towards endodermal derivatives, the production of fully functional differentiated cell types has not been particularly successful. Part of the explanation for this lack of success may lie in the inability to pattern the correct intermediates. The observation that inhibition of PI3K leads to enhanced Sox17 and Foxa2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McLean et al., 2007</xref>) has been used in ESC differentiation protocols to generate endoderm derivatives. Our data suggest that these cells are less efficient in further differentiation to derivatives of the ventral foregut such as pancreatic or hepatic progenitors. Based on both molecular and functional analysis of these endoderm cells they appear to be naïve endoderm, similar to the mesenchymal cell type that emerges from the primitive streak and intercalates into the visceral endoderm layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burtscher and Lickert, 2009</xref>) to form the hindgut. These Sox17<sup>high</sup> mesenchyme-like cells that arise from the primitive streak region of the embryo exist only transiently in vivo, and while we show that prolonged and enhanced induction of this state in vitro may be reversed by reintroducing cells back into normal differentiation, the direct onward differentiation of these cells may have deleterious effects on their capacity to form functional cell types in vitro. Interestingly, while these cells become epithelialized as they intercalate in the visceral endoderm, their levels of Sox17 remain high throughout gastrulation, suggesting that a naïve endoderm state could extend beyond the initial EMT event.</p><p>As ECM1 is able to pattern differentiating cells to anterior fate, it suggests that it may be possible to use it in combination with the LY-dependent enhancement of naïve endoderm to efficiently generate high levels of foregut in vitro. Our finding that ECM is an essential downstream signalling response required for generation of positional identity in vitro indicates that the presence of appropriate ECM may be as important as the dose and identity of the cytokines used in directing context dependent signalling responses during ESC differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse ESC cultures and ADE differentiation in adherent monolayer were performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Livigni et al.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by 3 reviewers, one of whom is Senior editor Janet Rossant.</p><p>The Senior editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that this paper adds significant new information to our understanding of early endoderm patterning in ES cells and the embryo. They have some areas of concern that would need to be addressed before the paper can be accepted for publication, as listed below. The two most important relate to the alternate fates adopted after Ly treatment and a further elucidation of the relationship between the phenotype of Fn<sup>-/-</sup> embryos and the effects described here on endoderm patterning.</p><p>1) It is stated that treatment with LY produces cells that are either more posterior endoderm-like, or more like undetermined early endoderm.

It is an important point, because it could be that LY treatment just blocks further differentiation of all endoderm, rather than specifically blocking anterior endoderm formation. A more careful analysis of the alternative fates adopted would be useful.</p><p>2) It is also stated that high levels of LY caused cell death, which is perhaps not unexpected given the fact that Akt signaling is often associated with cell survival. How do the authors distinguish between effects on cell differentiation and cell survival in their system, in both ES cells and embryos? Is there significant cell death in ES cells and embryos treated with the dose of LY that seems to block ADE formation?</p><p>3) The data presented on the Fn<sup>-/-</sup> embryos is intriguing but limited. They show expansion of the Cer1-expressing domain, consistent with their hypothesis that low levels of Fn are associated with ADE formation. However, they do not follow this further to determine whether there is any effect on actual foregut formation.</p><p>4) The phenotypes of Fn<sup>-/-</sup> embryos have been reported to be very variable dependent on genetic background, and so it is important to understand the overall phenotype seen in their particular mutant strain.</p><p>5) In the discussion, they state that there is no gastrulation phenotype in Fn mutants, and yet they are actually reporting such a phenotype with the Cer1 expansion. Clearly a further analysis of the effect of the Fn mutation on gastrulation, mesoderm and endoderm formation is called for.</p><p>6) Despite their emphasis in the results on FN being the key determinant of the patterning of the endoderm, in the discussion they seem less sure and talk about the complexities of the ECM differences. This part needs some clarification.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00806.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is stated that treatment with LY produces cells that are either more posterior endoderm-like, or more like undetermined early endoderm.

A more careful analysis of the alternative fates adopted would be useful</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for asking us to clarify this and we have added additional data to address this point.</p><p>• We have added additional molecular analysis on differentiating cultures to show that the markers expressed by LY-treated cells represent early naïve endoderm similar to that induced in the primitive streak of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref>). Based on this, and our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), these cells expressed neither anterior (<italic>Cer1, Hex, Lefty, Sfrp5 and Fzd5</italic>) posterior (<italic>Cdx2</italic>), or visceral (<italic>HNF4a, Dab2</italic>) endoderm markers. They expressed high levels of the endodermal markers Sox17 and FoxA2, alongside primitive streak markers <italic>MixL1</italic> and <italic>Cdh2</italic>. These cells also express high levels of the mesenchymal marker <italic>Snai1</italic>, but did not express the mesoderm markers Mesp1, Mesp2, Isl1, Gata1, Meox1 and Meox2. While LY treatment led to an increase in primitive streak markers, the primitive streak cells in these cultures (81% of cells were Gsc positive primitive streak – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1D,E</xref>) were almost all endoderm (91% Sox17 positive).</p><p>• We have also added additional functional data to assess whether these naïve cells could still progress in differentiation after the PI3K block was removed. In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> we show that these cells can return to normal ADE differentiation and with an equivalent amount of extra time, will “catch up,” with normal cultures.</p><p>• We also tested whether the LY treated “naïve” endoderm could efficiently differentiate towards pancreatic and hepatic endoderm (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1F</xref>). In both cases the Sox17 positive naïve endoderm was less efficient in downstream differentiation. However, when these cells were returned to normal ADE culture to enable them to “catch up” prior to further differentiation, these cells could efficiently differentiate towards HNF4a/AFP positive hepatic endoderm (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>• We also subjected the cultures to intestinal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spence et al., 2011</xref>), but we were not able to generate intestine spheres from either ADE or LY-treated cells. This may indicate that specific posterior pre-patterning of naïve endoderm is required.</p><p>• Taken together, this new set of experiments suggest that the cells produced by PI3K/Akt1 inhibition are non-regionalized endoderm (naïve) that retain the ability to give rise to specific endodermal domains. All this new analysis is described and discussed in the new manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) It is also stated that high levels of LY caused cell death, which is perhaps not unexpected given the fact that Akt signaling is often associated with cell survival. How do the authors distinguish between effects on cell differentiation and cell survival in their system, in both ES cells and embryos? Is there significant cell death in ES cells and embryos treated with the dose of LY that seems to block ADE formation</italic>?</p><p>Again, we thank the reviewers for asking us to clarify this point as it prompted us to generate additional new data that adds to the paper. These data are discussed in the Results section.</p><p>• We agree that cell death caused by high levels of LY is expected due to the role of PI3K/Akt1 signaling in cell survival. For this reason we only used low and medium doses of LY in this study (low = 10 µM, medium = 20 µM).</p><p>• We have now included data assessing cell death analysis in differentiating cultures. We used Annexin V staining of Gsc positive and negative populations to determine whether the LY doses used in our experiments (20 µM LY) had a specific effect on cell death. High dose (50 µM) was used as control (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Interestingly, we found enhanced cell death in the Gsc negative population of undifferentiated cells at day 3, while enhanced cell death in differentiating Gsc positive populations was not detected. From day 4 onwards neither population was significantly affected. To test if the enhanced cell death observed at day 3 on Gsc negative cells had a role in the LY-induced block to anterior differentiation, we suppressed cell death by the addition of Z-VAD-FMK (10 µM), a specific Caspase inhibitor. However, Z-VAD-FMK failed to rescue the block to ADE specification generated by LY. Based on this new data we can conclude that blocking PI3K signaling is not mediating differentiation via selective apoptosis.</p><p>• Although cell death was not specifically assessed in LY-treated embryos, we believe our in vitro data is sufficient to demonstrate that LY was not leading to the death of ADE progenitors. However, DAPI nuclear counterstaining also allowed us to evaluate the level of apoptotic cell bodies present in the embryos. These apoptotic cell bodies are easily identifiable by microscopy. We observed no differences in the number of apoptotic cell bodies in LY-treated and not treated cultured embryos.</p><p><italic>3) The data presented on the Fn</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> <italic>embryos is intriguing but limited. They show expansion of the Cer1-expressing domain, consistent with their hypothesis that low levels of Fn are associated with ADE formation. However, they do not follow this further to determine whether there is any effect on actual foregut formation</italic>.</p><p>• While no foregut phenotype has been reported previously for <italic>Fn1</italic> or <italic>Itga5</italic> mutants, we want to thank the reviewers for pushing us to examine the phenotype more extensively. We have added additional data based on this comment, describing a later phenotype in the foregut of <italic>Fn1</italic> and <italic>Itga5</italic> mutants (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8–figure supplement 3</xref>). In embryos mutant for either <italic>Fn1</italic> or <italic>Itga5</italic> the foregut does not fold into a tube and remains as a flat field of Foxa2<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8–figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>• We have now added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8–figure supplement 3B</xref>), that shows that Foxa2 positive region of the foregut is expanded from head fold to early somite stages. In these mutants this expansion is coupled to a failure in gut folding and the formation of the anterior intestinal portal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Text on these results can be found in the last paragraph of the Results section.</p><p>• While we appreciate the reviewers are interested in later foregut phenotype, this is complicated by the severe morphological defects in the global <italic>Fn1-null</italic> and <italic>Itga5-null</italic> mutants at later stages of development (George et al., 1997, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">George et al., 1993</xref>, Georges-Labouesse et al., 1996, Goh et al., 1997, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 1993</xref>). We are interested in the role of <italic>Fn1</italic> and Itga5 in endoderm morphogenesis, but this will require conditional mutagenesis, that, although very interesting, is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The phenotypes of Fn</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> <italic>embryos have been reported to be very variable dependent on genetic background, and so it is important to understand the overall phenotype seen in their particular mutant strain</italic>.</p><p>The phenotype of <italic>Fn1-null</italic> embryos varies depending on the genetic background; it is more severe on <italic>129S4</italic> than on <italic>C57BL/6J</italic> background (George et al., 1997). However, we have observed the expansion of Cer1 and the prospective foregut domain on all genetic backgrounds tested; <italic>C57BL/6J</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8–figure supplement 2A, B</xref>) <italic>129S4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8–figure supplement 3A</xref>) and a <italic>C57/129</italic> hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Expansion of Cer1 and Foxa2 in <italic>Itga5</italic> mutants was done on a <italic>129S4</italic> background. The issue is now mentioned in the Results section.</p><p><italic>5) In the discussion, they state that there is no gastrulation phenotype in Fn mutants, and yet they are actually reporting such a phenotype with the Cer1 expansion. Clearly a further analysis of the effect of the Fn mutation on gastrulation, mesoderm and endoderm formation is called for</italic>.</p><p>• We agree that more extensive analysis of the endoderm was warranted. In particular we assessed the expression of Sox17 as we had observed that Sox17 was expressed at higher levels in naïve endoderm produced in response to block PI3K signaling in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Strikingly we observed that Sox17 expression in vivo mirrored <italic>Fn1</italic> and was reduced in the Cer1 prospective foregut as it moved away from the distal tip. In the <italic>Fn1</italic> mutants, Sox17 levels were reduced in the population of cells ectopically expressing Cer1, consistent with a model that high Sox17 levels were supported by PI3K/Fn1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8–figure supplement 3C</xref>). We have also added additional data on Foxa2 (see above). The description of the phenotype is now expanded and covered in the Results.</p><p>• In both the <italic>Fn1</italic> and <italic>Itga5</italic> mutants, there are mesoderm defects, in the notochord and somites. However, there appears little change in the specification of mesoderm, including the expression of <italic>Brachyury (T), Sonic Hedgehog, Notch-I, BMP4</italic> and <italic>Mox-I</italic> (Georges-Labousse et al., 1996, Goh et al., 1997, Pulina et al., 2011). We enclose a figure for the reviewers, demonstrating normal expression of <italic>Brachyury (T)</italic> and <italic>Sonic Hedgehog</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>), but pointing to a problem with axis elongation. As similar observations have been published previously, we have not included this in the paper, but are willing to add this data if requested.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Dorsal view of WT and <italic>Fn1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> E8.0 embryos after in situ hybridization showing RNA expression for mesoderm markers <italic>Brachyury (T)</italic> and <italic>Sonic Hedgehog</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00806-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>• The phenotype of the <italic>Fn1-null</italic> and <italic>Itga5-null</italic> mutants can be summarized as follows. Morphological abnormalities in <italic>Fn1-null</italic> and <italic>Itga5-null</italic> mutants are obvious by E8.0. However, why these mutants appear abnormal is not well understood. These mutants have an obvious axis extension problem and thus appear smaller than their wild-type or heterozygous littermates at E8.0-E9.5 (Georges-Labouesse et al., 1996, Goh et al., 1997). In addition to the mesoderm, we and others have also shown that dorso-ventral and anterior-posterior neural patterning is normal in these mutants, and they produce neural crest derivatives (Goh et al., 1997, Mittal et al., 2010, Pulina et al., 2011). A general conclusion from all these studies has been that Fn1 and Itga5 are not required for migration, specification and differentiation of various mesodermal lineages (Georges-Labouesse et al., 1996, Goh et al., 1997).</p><p>• Thus while our study highlights the importance of exploring the earlier phenotypes in these mutants more carefully, a meaningful study would require extensive analysis of both stages and markers, which is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) Despite their emphasis in the results on FN being the key determinant of the patterning of the endorderm, in the discussion they seem less sure and talk about the complexities of the ECM differences. This part needes some clarification</italic>.</p><p>We have further extended and hopefully clarified this point in the discussion by suggesting that the other determinants could modulate the effect of Fn1. We hope it is now clear that we were tryinig to highlight that there may be another ECM molecules acting in concert with Fn1, and that we see evidence of this in our mass spec dataset. This is a subject of contuing work on our group. For instance, HSPG’s and Fn1 are intricately related, and HSPG’s has been shown to affect to Fn1 structure reviewed in (Symes et al., 2010).</p><p>References</p><p>Burtscher I, Lickert H. 2009.
