PARP-7 is a critical regulator of the innate immune response. What remains unclear is the mechanism by which PARP-7 regulates this process, namely because the protein targets of PARP-7 mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) are largely unknown. Here, we combine chemical genetics, proximity labeling, and proteome-wide amino acid ADP-ribosylation site profiling for identifying the direct targets and sites of PARP-7-mediated MARylation in a cellular context. We found that the inactive PARP family member, PARP-13—a critical regulator of the antiviral innate immune response—is a major target of PARP-7. PARP-13 is preferentially MARylated on cysteine residues in its RNA binding zinc finger domain. Proteome-wide ADP-ribosylation analysis reveals cysteine as a major MARylation acceptor of PARP-7. This study provides insight into PARP-7 targeting and MARylation site preference.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ADP-ribosylation</kwd><kwd>PARPs</kwd><kwd>click chemistry</kwd><kwd>chemical genetics</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>proximity labeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH 2R01NS088629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R01NS088629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combined chemical genetics, proximity labeling, and ADP-ribose site mapping approach shows that PARP-7 mono-ADP-ribosylates immune-relevant proteins on cysteine amino acids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs) are a family of 17 proteins, many of which have emerged as critical regulators of cytokine signaling and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fehr et al., 2020</xref>). Most PARP family members catalyze the transfer of a single unit of ADP-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) to amino acids on protein targets, a reversible post-translational modification (PTM) known as mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daugherty et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike other well-studied PTMs, such as phosphorylation or ubiquitylation, how PARP-mediated MARylation regulates protein function is still poorly understood.</p><p>Multiple independent lines of evidence point to PARP-7 playing a critical role in the innate immune signaling pathway, particularly as a negative regulator of the type I interferon antiviral response. Knockout of PARP-7 enhances nucleic acid sensor agonist- or virus-induced interferon-beta (IFN-β) expression in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kozaki et al., 2017</xref>). Given the antiviral functions of IFN-β, increases in IFN-β are expected to suppress viral replication. Consistent with this notion, viral titers after infection with several single-strand RNA viruses, including influenza, vesicular stomatitis virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, and mouse hepatitis virus (a murine coronavirus), are lower in PARP-7 knockout or knockdown cells compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2020</xref>). These results show that PARP-7 facilitates viral replication, in part, by shutting down IFN-β production. How PARP-7-mediated MARylation regulates IFN-β production, and perhaps other aspects of innate immune signaling, is unknown. This is largely because few direct MARylation targets of PARP-7 are known.</p><p>A unique feature of MARylation compared to other PTMs is that chemically diverse amino acids can act as ADP-ribose (ADPr) acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen and Chang, 2018</xref>). Historically, the chemical nature of the amino acid-MAR bonds in proteins was examined by chemical stability studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Payne et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cervantes-Laurean et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsia et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krantz and Lee, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McDonald and Moss, 1994</xref>). This led to the notion that the major ADPr acceptor residues are the acidic amino acids, glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp), as well as the basic amino acid arginine (Arg). More recently, however, mass spectrometry-based proteomics has revealed that in addition to Glu/Asp and Arg, serine (Ser), tyrosine (Tyr), histidine (His), and cysteine (Cys) can also act as ADPr acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Buch-larsen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leslie Pedrioli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palazzo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>). While many residues can act as ADPr acceptors, a major outstanding question in the field is whether or not individual PARP family members demonstrate selectivity toward ADP-ribosylation of specific residues in protein targets. Identifying the MARylated residues in protein targets is essential for understanding how ADPr modifications regulate protein function.</p><p>In this study, we combine chemical genetics, proximity labeling, and proteome-wide amino acid ADPr site profiling for identifying the direct targets and sites of PARP-7-mediated MARylation. Our study reveals that PARP-7 MARylates proteins in innate immune signaling and viral regulation. Additionally, we show that Cys MARylation in cells is more stable than Glu/Asp MARylation, suggesting that the site of MARylation in protein targets governs signal duration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimization of a chemical genetic strategy for identifying the direct targets of PARP-7</title><p>Identifying the protein targets of PARP-7 is a critical first step toward unraveling its function in cells. In previous work we have developed an engineered enzyme—modified substrate strategy for identifying relevant targets of individual PARP family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carter-O'Connell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carter-O'Connell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter-O'Connell and Cohen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carter-O'Connell et al., 2018</xref>). This chemical genetic (CG) method uses engineered PARPs and an orthogonal NAD<sup>+</sup> analogue that contains a clickable handle (e.g. an alkyne) that is located at the N-6 position of the adenine ring (5-Bn-6-a-NAD<sup>+</sup>). We showed that 5-Bn-6-a-NAD<sup>+</sup> is an excellent substrate for engineered PARPs in which a hydrophobic amino acid (isoleucine or leucine) at the floor position (so named because it sits at the floor of the nicotinamide subsite in the NAD<sup>+</sup> binding pocket) is mutated to a glycine. Importantly, 5-Bn-6-a-NAD<sup>+</sup> is not used by wild-type (WT) PARPs and in this way is orthogonal to native NAD<sup>+</sup>. While 5-Bn-6-a-NAD<sup>+</sup> is a very good substrate for many floor position engineered PARPs (e.g. L1782G, LG-PARP-14), we found that it is a poor substrate for several other floor position PARP mutants, including PARP-7. We therefore sought a new orthogonal NAD<sup>+</sup> analogue that would serve as an efficient substrate for floor position engineered PARP-7, I631G PARP-7 (IG-PARP-7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A chemical genetic strategy for identifying the direct MARylation targets of PARP-7.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of chemical genetic approach for identifying direct targets of PARP-7.

Recently, Pascal and colleagues reported a crystal structure of a non-hydrolyzable analogue of NAD<sup>+</sup>, benzamide adenine dinucleotide (BAD), bound to PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langelier et al., 2018</xref>). This is the first crystal structure of a PARP bound to an NAD<sup>+</sup> biomimetic and it shows how the adenine ring of NAD<sup>+</sup> binds in the NAD<sup>+</sup>-binding pocket. Based on this structure, it is evident that the C-2 position of the adenine ring of BAD is more solvent exposed than the N-6 position of the adenine ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Indeed, work from Marx and colleagues showed that C-2 modified NAD<sup>+</sup> analogues were better PARP1 substrates than N-6 modified NAD<sup>+</sup> analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wallrodt et al., 2017</xref>). Given the high degree of conservation in the NAD<sup>+</sup>-binding pocket between PARP family members, we hypothesized that placing the clickable handle at the C-2 rather the N-6 position of 5-Bn-NAD<sup>+</sup> would yield a better substrate for IG-PARP-7. We therefore designed and synthesized 5-Bn-2-e-NAD<sup>+</sup>, which has an ethynyl group at the C-2 position for Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen chemistry with an azide reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and Methods Supplement).</p><p>Compared to 5-Bn-6-a-NAD<sup>+</sup>, we found that 5-Bn-2-e-NAD<sup>+</sup> is a much better substrate for GFP-IG-PARP-7 as evidenced by the greater labeling (biotin signal following click conjugation to biotin-azide) of GFP-tagged IG-PARP-7 (GFP-IG-PARP-7) (auto-MARylation) as well as the labeling of many other discrete bands (trans-MARylation) in HEK 293 T cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Importantly, we did not detect labeling of GFP-WT-PARP-7, indicating that 5-Bn-2-e-NAD<sup>+</sup> is not a substrate for GFP-WT-PARP-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to identify the targets of PARP-7 using GFP-IG-PARP-7 and its optimized substrate, 5-Bn-2-e-NAD<sup>+</sup>. Following incubation of HEK 293T lysates with 5-Bn-2-e-NAD<sup>+</sup> and subsequent conjugation with biotin-azide, we enriched biotinylated proteins (e.g. MARylation targets) using NeutrAvidin agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

In the BioID approach, a protein of interest is fused to a promiscuous biotin ligase (BirA*) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roux et al., 2013</xref>). Upon addition of biotin to cultured cells, BirA* uses biotin as a substrate to generate a lysine-reactive adenylate-biotin that reacts with proteins proximal to the fusion protein. In this way, intracellular interactors can be identified. We generated a WT PARP-7 chimeric construct in which a Myc-tagged promiscuous biotin ligase (BirA*) was fused to the N-terminus of PARP-7 (Myc-BirA*-WT-PARP-7). We observed robust biotinylation of proteins across the full molecular weight range in HEK 293 T cells expressing Myc-BirA*-WT-PARP-7, but not GFP-WT-PARP-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

We focused our attention on PARP-13 (also known as ZAP and ZC3HAV1) as it was a top candidate in both proteomics datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and because it is a well-known RNA binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Todorova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2004</xref>). PARP-13 is unique among PARP family members for two main reasons: i. it exists as two major isoforms, the full-length protein known as PARP-13.1 (ZAPL) and a truncated variant known as PARP-13.2 (ZAPS) that is devoid of the catalytic domain, and ii. despite having the catalytic domain, PARP-13.1 is catalytically inactive. PARP-13.1 is constitutively expressed in most cells and PARP-13.2 is induced by interferons (e.g. IFN-β) as well as viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwerk et al., 2019</xref>). In HEK 293 T cells, PARP-13.1 and PARP-13.2 are expressed, but PARP-13.1 is the major isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, we confirmed that PARP-13.1 is the major endogenous isoform that interacts with Myc-BirA*-PARP-7 in HEK 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Similar to PARP-7, both isoforms of PARP-13 are important regulators of innate immunity and the response to viral infection.

For these experiments, we took a pharmacological approach. Recently a phthalazinone-based piperazine compound, AZ12629495, was reported in the patent literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Limited and Park, 2009</xref>). AZ12629495 was shown to inhibit PARP-7 as well as PARP-1 and PARP-2 with nanomolar potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Limited and Park, 2009</xref>). This was confirmed in another study, but family-wide analysis was not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). We synthesized a close analog of AZ12629495, referred to here as Phthal01 (Methods Supplement), and profiled it across the PARP family using an in vitro plate assay for screening PARP inhibitors developed in our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirby et al., 2018</xref>).We found that Phthal01 is most potent against PARP-7 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 14 nM), followed closely by PARP1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 21 nM), and PARP2 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 28 nM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

We then evaluated the effects of Phthal01 against PARP-7 in HEK 293 T cells by western blot analysis using an ADPr-specific antibody.

MycX2-PARP-13.2 overexpressing cells, or iii. GFP-PARP-7 and MycX2-PARP-13.2 overexpressing cells. We identified a total of 1712 ADPr sites with a localization probability of &gt;90% in all three conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). There is a low degree of variance between biological replicates, especially for the GFP-PARP-7 alone and the MycX2-PARP-13.2 alone conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, there was a greater degree of overlap between the GFP-PARP-7 alone condition and the GFP-PARP-7/ MycX2-PARP-13.2 condition compared to the MycX2-PARP-13.2 condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In this condition, other amino acid-ADPr sites are identified, most prominently on Arg and Tyr; however, the intensities for Arg-ADPr and Tyr-ADPr are at least an order of magnitude lower than the intensities found for Cys-ADPr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Cys MARylation in PARP-13.2 is dependent on the co-expression of PARP-7 since we only detect Ser-ADPr (three sites) and Arg-ADPr (one site) in the PARP-13.2 alone condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

One Cys, Cys39, was identified in a previous MS method using standard HCD fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomez et al., 2018</xref>). Two Cys-ADPr sites (Cys543 and Cys552) reside in the catalytic domain of PARP-7. At much lower intensities, we found several Tyr-ADPr, His-ADPr, and Arg-ADPr sites in PARP-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These lower intensity ADPr-sites could be sites of auto-MARylation or could be sites of trans-MARylation by other PARP family members. Regardless, it is clear that the major auto-MARylation sites in PARP-7 are Cys residues.</p><p>Using EThcD fragmentation, we confidently identified Cys residues as major PARP-7-mediated MARylation sites in PARP-13. Nevertheless, we sought to confirm the MS results using mutagenesis studies. We focused on the Cys residues in the ZnF domains since we found that they are the major sites of Cys MARylation in PARP-13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In HEK 293 T cells expressing both GFP-PARP-7 and MycX2-PARP-13.2, we found that mutation of all of the Cys residues to alanine (Ala) residues in the ZnF domains of PARP-13.2 (CtoA ZnF all) substantially reduces PARP-13.2 MARylation compared to WT PARP-13.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). Mutation of the Cys residues to Ala residues in either ZnF domains 1–2 (CtoA ZnF 1–2) or 3–4 (CtoA ZnF 3–4) modestly reduces PARP-13.2 MARylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). The reduction in PARP-7-mediated MARylation of PARP-13.2 in the Cys mutants is not due to a loss in the interaction between PARP-13 and PARP-7 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5—figure supplement 8</xref>). Together these data support that the primary sites of MARylation by PARP-7 on PARP-13.2 are the ZnF Cys residues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Proteome-wide analysis reveals Cys residues as major ADPr acceptors in PARP-7 targets</title><p>Having validated Cys as the major PARP-7-mediated MARylation site in PARP-13, we broadened our analysis across the proteome in HEK 293 T cells and focused on amino acid-ADPr sites that were either unique or enriched (at least 5-fold) in the GFP-PARP-7 alone condition compared to the MycX2-PARP-13.2 alone condition. We reasoned that these amino acid-ADPr sites are likely targets of PARP-7. Using the above criteria, we identified a total of 939 unique amino acid-ADPr sites on a total of 490 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) as putative PARP-7 targets.

While we did not observe a strong preference for a particular amino acid at the −1 position, we did find a preference for a proline (Pro), followed by an Arg, in the +two position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). This analysis suggests that the proximal sequence surrounding the Cys-ADPr site is not a strong determinant for MARylation targeting by PARP-7.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have successfully adapted our chemical genetic strategy for identifying the direct targets of PARP-7. This involved changing the position of the alkyne clickable handle from the N-6-position (5-Bn-6-a-NAD<sup>+</sup>) to the 2-positon (5-Bn-2-e-NAD<sup>+</sup>) of the adenosine ring in our modified NAD<sup>+</sup> analogs. 5-Bn-2-e-NAD<sup>+</sup> is a much better substrate for IG-PARP-7 compared to 5-Bn-6-a-NAD<sup>+</sup>.

The 5-Bn-2-e-NAD<sup>+</sup>—IG-PARP-12 pair will enable us, in future studies, to identify the direct targets of PARP12.</p><p>Combining our chemical genetics approach with a proximity labeling approach (BioID), we generated a list of PARP-7 MARylation targets and interactors with known roles in innate immune signaling. These results align with previous literature that demonstrate a critical role for PARP-7 as a negative regulator of interferon signaling during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kozaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2020</xref>). Particularly interesting is the enrichment of RNA binding and RNA regulatory proteins with known roles in viral regulation. Indeed, we found that the antiviral RNA-binding protein PARP-13 is a major MARylation target of PARP-7 in cells. In a co-submitted study, Kraus and colleagues also identified PARP-13 as PARP-7 target using a distinct, but complementary chemical genetic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palavalli Parsons et al., 2021</xref>). Chemical sensitivity studies using HgCl<sub>2</sub> and MS-based site identification studies show that PARP-7 predominately MARylates PARP-13 on several Cys residues, most prominently in the ZnF domains of both PARP-13 isoforms, PARP-13.1 and PARP-13.2.</p><p>How might Cys MARylation regulate PARP-13 function? The most well-characterized function for PARP-13 is as an antiviral restriction factor. PARP-13 inhibits the replication of many types of RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fehr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daugherty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Todorova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayakawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacDonald et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Müller et al., 2007</xref>). Recent studies show that PARP-13.1 and PARP-13.2 have distinct roles in innate antiviral immune response: PARP-13.2 binds and degrades host mRNAs (e.g. <italic>IFN-β</italic>), thereby negatively regulating the interferon response, whereas PARP-13.1 targets viral RNA and is the major antiviral effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwerk et al., 2019</xref>). The ZnF domains of PARP-13.1 and PARP-13.2 are required for binding to both host and viral mRNAs. Since the Cys residues in the ZnF domains of PARP-13 are important for Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordination, it is possible that MARylation of these Cys residues alters or disrupts RNA binding. The ZnF domains of PARP-13.2 are also involved in PPIs relevant to innate immune signaling. PARP-13.2 stimulates the interferon response in response to influenza A viral infection via direct activation of the cytosolic nucleic acid sensor RNA helicase RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayakawa et al., 2011</xref>). PARP-13.2 interacts with RIG-I and stimulates its oligomerization and ATPase activity, leading to interferon induction. This interaction is dependent on the ZnF domains of PARP-13.2, hence Cys MARylation of PARP-13.2 by PARP-7 could potentially disrupt the interaction between PARP-13.2 and RIG-I. Future studies will be focused on understanding how PARP-7-mediated Cys MARylation of PARP-13.1 and/or PARP-13.2 regulate their antiviral and immune regulatory roles.</p><p>Beyond PARP-7-mediated Cys MARylation of PARP-13, PARP-13 is also modified by other PARP family members at different amino acid acceptors. In a previous chemical genetic study, we found that PARP14 MARylates PARP-13 on several Glu/Asp residues in the C-terminus of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carter-O'Connell et al., 2018</xref>). Another study showed that PARP-13.1 and PARP-13.2 can be poly-ADP-ribosylated (PARylated) in response to cell stress, although the PARP that mediates PARylation of PARP-13.1/2 was not identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leung et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, in this study, we find that in the absence of PARP-7, PARP-13.2 is ADP-ribosylated on several serines. Serines are known sites of PARylation by PARP1 and PARP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palazzo et al., 2018</xref>); therefore, PARylation of PARP-13 could be catalyzed by PARP1/2. Trans-M/PARylation of PARP-13 by other PARP family members suggests that PARP-13 is an important integrator of active PARP signaling. An intriguing idea is that M/PARylation at distinct amino acid acceptors elicits different downstream effects.</p><p>Proteome-wide ADPr site profiling suggests that many targets of PARP-7 are MARylated predominately on Cys residues. Cys MARylation was originally described for the bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase Pertussis toxin (PTX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mangmool and Kurose, 2011</xref>). PTX MARylates a Cys in the carboxyl terminus of the alpha submit of the G proteins, G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mangmool and Kurose, 2011</xref>). Studies dating back 30 years ago described endogenous Cys MARylation, similar to PTX-dependent MARylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanuma, 1988</xref>) but the enzyme(s) that catalyzes Cys MARylation were not identified. In this study, we provide strong evidence that PARP-7 catalyzes Cys MARylation. Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that PARP-7 auto-MARylates predominately on a Cys residue (Cys39) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomez et al., 2018</xref>). How PARP-7 preferentially targets Cys versus other potential amino acid acceptors is currently unknown. Recent studies on the amino acid selectivity of PARP1/2-mediated PARylation provides some clues: for example, a recent crystal structure of the histone PARylation factor (HPF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>)—PARP2 complex shows that HPF1 interacts directly with the NAD<sup>+</sup>-binding site of PARP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suskiewicz et al., 2020</xref>), and demonstrates that HPF1 can act as an auxiliary factor to influence amino acid target preference. In the absence of HPF1, PARP1 predominately PARylates on Glu/Asp residues; however, in the presence of HPF1, PARP1 predominately PARylates on Ser residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palazzo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisemann et al., 2019</xref>). Perhaps this is similarly the case for PARP-7, and future studies may focus on identifying potential auxiliary factors for PARP-7.</p><p>Curiously, inhibition of PARP-7 catalytic activity by Phthal01 increased endogenous PARP-7 protein levels. This is consistent with previous studies showing that a catalytically inactive PARP-7 mutant is expressed at higher levels than WT-PARP-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomez et al., 2018</xref>). Although endogenous PARP-13.1 levels were not impacted by Phthal01, it is possible that PARP-7 regulates the stability of PARP-13.2 in a context-specific manner, for example, during viral infection. Future studies will focus on determining the mechanism by which inhibition of PARP-7 catalytic activity regulates PARP-7 protein levels, and if PARP-13.2 protein levels (or other PARP-7 targets) are regulated by PARP-7 trans-MARylation.</p><p>Until recently, PARP drug discovery efforts over the past 20 years have focused exclusively on PARP1/2 and its role in the DNA damage response. The role of PARP-7 in the innate immune response has stimulated interests in PARP-7 as an immunomodulatory agent for cancer treatment. Currently, there is the first PARP-7 inhibitor (RBN-2397) in Phase I clinical trials for solid tumor cancers (NCT04053673). This is the first clinical trial for an inhibitor of a MARylating PARP and represents and exciting new direction in the PARP field. The PARP-7 targets and ADPr sites identified in this study as well as the Parsons et al. study will guide future studies examining the mechanism by which PARP-7 regulates antitumor immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">Anti-ADP-ribose, E6F6A (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Cell signaling technology</td><td valign="bottom">83732: RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2749858">AB_2749858</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">WB(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">Anti-GFP, PABG1 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Chromotek</td><td valign="bottom">PABG1-100;

Poly-ADP-ribosylation was reduced to mono-ADP-ribosylation by incubation of samples with recombinant PARG (a kind gift from Prof. Michael O. Hottiger) at a concentration of 1:10,000 (w/w), at room temperature, overnight and with gentle sample agitation. After overnight incubation with PARG, samples were cleared from mild precipitation by centrifugation in a swing-out centrifuge at 4°C, for 60 min at 4250 g.

After each second washing step, tubes were changed in order to minimize non-specific carryover of contaminants. After washing, ADP-ribosylated peptides were eluted off the beads using two bead volumes of ice-cold elution buffer (0.15% TFA). The elution was performed by gentle addition of the elution buffer, gentle mixing of the beads with the buffer every 5 min, and otherwise allowing the beads to stand undisturbed on ice for 20 min.

Dried purified ADP-ribosylated peptides were dissolved by addition of 10 μl 0.1% formic acid, and stored at −20°C until MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>EThcD MS data acquisition</title><p>All MS samples were measured using a Fusion Lumos Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo). Samples were analyzed on 15 cm long analytical column, packed in-house using ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 µm beads (Dr. Maisch), with an internal diameter of 75 μm. On-line reversed-phase liquid chromatography to separate peptides was performed using an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo). The analytical column was heated to 40°C using a column oven, and peptides were eluted from the column using a gradient of Buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and Buffer B (80% can in 0.1% formic acid). For the main samples (F1), the gradient ranged from 3% buffer B to 40% buffer B over 62 min, followed by a washing block of 18 min. For the flow-through samples (F0), the gradient ranged from 5% buffer B to 30% buffer B over 35 min, followed by a washing block of 15 min. Electrospray ionization (ESI) was achieved using a Nanospray Flex Ion Source (Thermo). Spray voltage was set to 2 kV, capillary temperature to 275°C, and RF level to 30%. For F1 samples, full scans were performed at a resolution of 60,000, with a scan range of 300–1750 m/z, a maximum injection time of 60 ms, and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 600,000 charges. Precursors were isolated with a width of 1.3 m/z, with an AGC target of 200,000 charges, and precursor fragmentation was accomplished using electron transfer disassociation with supplemental higher collisional disassociation (EThcD) with a supplemental activation energy of 20. Precursors with charge state 3–5 were isolated for MS/MS analysis, and prioritized from charge 3 (highest) to charge 5 (lowest), using the decision tree algorithm. Selected precursors were excluded from repeated sequencing by setting a dynamic exclusion of 60 s. MS/MS spectra were measured in the Orbitrap, with a loop count setting of 5, a maximum precursor injection time of 120 ms, and a scan resolution of 60,000. The F0 samples were measured as described above with the following exceptions. Full scans were performed at a resolution of 120,000, with a maximum injection time of 250 ms, and MS/MS spectra were measured at a resolution of 60,000, with a maximum precursor injection time of 500 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>EThCD data analysis</title><p>All raw data analysis was performed using MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.30) supported by the Andromeda search engine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rappsilber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) Default MaxQuant settings were used, with the following exceptions. Methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and ADP-ribosylation on C, D, E, H, K, R, S, T, and Y, were included as variable modifications. Up to six missed cleavages were allowed, and a maximum allowance of 4 variable modifications per peptide was used. Second peptide search was enabled (default), and matching between runs was enabled with a match time window of 0.7 min and an alignment time window of 20 min. Mass tolerance for precursors was set to 20 ppm in the first MS/MS search and 4.5 ppm in the main MS/MS search after mass recalibration. For fragment ion masses, a tolerance of 20 ppm was used. Modified peptides were filtered to have an Andromeda score of &gt;40 (default), and a delta score of &gt;20. Data was automatically filtered by posterior error probability to achieve a false discovery rate of &lt;1% (default), at the peptide-spectrum match, the protein assignment, and the site-specific levels.</p><p>In addition to the FDR control applied by MaxQuant, the data was manually filtered using the Perseus software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>) in order to ensure proper identification and localization of ADP-ribosylation. As default MaxQuant intensity assignments to modification sites also include non-localized or poorly localized evidences, intensities were manually mapped back to the sites table based on localized PSMs only (&gt;0.90 best-case,&gt;0.75 for further evidences). The iceLogo web application was used for sequence motif analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colaert et al., 2009</xref>), and for sequence comparisons, background sequences were extracted from the same proteins and flanking the same amino acid residue type using an in-house Python script.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Chemical synthesis</title><p>For the synthesis of 5-Bn-2-e-NAD<sup>+</sup> and Phthal01 see <italic>Supplementary files</italic>.

The authors have created a new variant of the chemical genetics approach for identifying PARP7, which will also be potentially useful for PARP12 (although data not shown). In addition, they used a proximity ligation (BioID) method to identify PARP7 interactors. Using these two methods, they identified PARP13 as a high-ranking target, which was then confirmed by (1) a new inhibitor (Phthal01) that has a preference for PARP7, and (2) identifying the ADP-ribosylation site of PARP13 upon overexpressing of PARP7. Lastly, the proteomics analyses also provided further confirmation of the specificity of PARP7 towards cysteine, which was indirectly inferred by the sensitivity of HgCl2 prior to this study. The study was well-executed and provides an important and comprehensive resource of PARP7 substrates and ADP-ribosylation sites. Given the growing interest in PARP7 as an important player in the antiviral immune response, this study is timely and relevant. However, confidence in the biological relevance of the presented results could be significantly expanded with a few key experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Biological role of Cys-ADP-ribosylation of PARP13: This study has a lot of technical strengths. However, it is unclear about the biological effect of PARP7-mediated Cys MARylation on PARP13. For example, given the zinc finger is critical for RNA-binding, would the MARylation abrogate the RNA-binding ability? in vitro purified proteins would allow the authors to test the effect of PARP7-mediated MARylation on PARP13 RNA binding, which is important for viral response.</p><p>2) Endogenous interaction between PARP13 and PARP7: Another limitation of the current study is that the identification of the PARP13 as PARP-7 target was mainly through overexpression study. Therefore, it is critical for the authors to demonstrate that the modification on PARP13 is due to endogenous interaction and catalytic activity.</p><p>Do endogenous PARP13 and PARP7 physically interact in untreated, or virally-challenged, WT cells, and is PARP13 ADP-ribosylated in this context? Would this interaction hold true for both isoforms? E.g., Pulldown of endogenous PARP7/PARP13 followed by western blot with PARP13/PARP7, pulldown of PARP13 followed by western blot with anti-PAN antibody, and pulldown of PAN-ADPr proteins followed by anti-PARP13 western blot in the context of WT and Pthal01 treated cells would gain confidence in the manuscript's overall conclusions. Endogenous ADP-ribosylation of PARP13 cannot be detected according to Figure 3B (only upon PARP7 overexpression). A pull-down of PARP13 as a way of enriching the protein could be used to test whether PARP13 shows endogenous ADP-ribosylation in a PARP-7 dependent manner.</p><p>Can the author exclude the possibility that the ADP-ribosylation of PARP13 is an indirect effect of the expression instead of its catalytic activity? Would the PARP13 ADP-ribosylation occur in the presence of PARP7 catalytically dead mutant?</p><p>Can the author comment on whether PARP13 is a bona fide, endogenous PARP7-target during viral infections of WT cells? What would the authors predict how the cells respond to viral infections upon PARP7 overexpression or treatment with Pthal01?</p><p>3) Half-life analyses: It was estimated that the half-life of PARP-10 is ~15 min and that of PARP13.2 is 189 min. Based on these analyses, the authors inferred that Cys-ADPr bond is more stable in cells than Glu/Asp-ADPr-bond. However, the analyses were performed at different concentrations of Phthal01. Would the higher concentration of Phthal01 affect the half-life measured on PARP13.2?</p><p>Moreover, could the observed loss of signal not only be dependent on the rate of removal, but may also be influenced by the amount of the respective PARPs ADPr at the start of Phthal01 treatment. If, under these settings, PARP7-mediated ADPr is much more abundant than PARP10-mediated ADPr, PARP7 ADPr could be longer-lived while having the same removal kinetics as PARP10 ADPr. Given that the authors are making a claim on the underlying kinetics this possible confounder should be addressed.</p><p>Lastly, the authors should clarify whether the difference in stability is due to the chemical or enzymatic stability of the two ADPr bonds. To measure the chemical stability, the authors could, for example, lyse the cells in denaturing conditions by keeping the pH at physiological levels and monitor the ADPr levels at different times similarly to the experiment in Figure 4D-E.</p><p>4) ZnF Cys mutations on protein stability: A couple of data regarding PARP13 stability need clarification: a) Figure 4D: Treatment with Phthal01 not only reduces PARP7 and PARP13.2 MARylation but also increases their protein levels, suggesting that MARylation has a negative effect on protein stability. b) Figure 5D: PARP7 overexpression reduces PARP13.2 protein levels. Cys to Ala mutations in PARP13 ZnF also reduce PARP13.2 protein levels compared to WT, especially when all four Cys were mutated. Reduction in Cys MARylation upon Cys mutation can be due to reduction in protein stability. Cys are structural elements of ZnF clusters and their mutation (to Ala) leads to loss of protein stability. Given that Cys within Zn fingers of PARP13 are MARylated, the modification could also lead to disruption of Zn clusters and partial (or complete) denaturation. This possibility could be tested with in vitro purified proteins (PARP7 and PARP13) using CD spectroscopy to validate the effect of Cys mutations and PARP7-mediated MARylation on PARP13 secondary structure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60480.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Biological role of Cys-ADP-ribosylation of PARP13: This study has a lot of technical strengths.

We agree that understanding the biological function for PARP-7 mediated Cys MARylation of PARP-13 is important. We asked if PARP-7 mediated MARylation of PARP-13 impacts the ability of PARP-13 to bind to a host mRNA, an experiment that we could perform in our lab. This experiment is based on a recent manuscript that showed that PARP-13.2 (ZAP-S) binds to Interferon Λ 3 (IFNL3) and mediates its degradation (Schwerk et al., 2019). In their manuscript, they developed a biotinylated RNA probe for Interferon Λ 3 (IFNL3) and incubated this probe with mammalian cell lysates. Using tandem mass spectrometry, they identified PARP-13.2 as an interacting protein by mass spectrometry.</p><p>We expressed PARP-7 in HEK 293T cells (conditions in which we found that PARP-7 MARylates endogenous PARP-7 on Cys—predominately on zinc finger Cys—by mass spectrometry) and treated with either Phthal01 (to inhibit PARP-7) or veliparib (PARP-1/2 inhibitor; control since Phthal01 inhibits PARP-1/2 at the tested concentration) overnight. We harvested cells and incubated lysates derived from the aforementioned cell-treatment conditions with the biotinylated IFNL3 RNA probe followed by streptavidin enrichment. While we did find that PARP-13 isoforms were enriched with the biotinylated IFNL3 RNA probe, expression of PARP-7 nor inhibition of its catalytic activity affected PARP-13 binding to IFNL3 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, two replicates). Similar results were obtained when we co-expressed PARP-7 with PARP-13-2 (data not shown).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60480-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>These results suggest that PARP-7 mediated MARylation of PARP-13 isoforms doesn’t affect their ability to bind IFNL3 RNA. One caveat is that it is possible that there is low stoichiometry of PARP-13 MARylation by PARP-7 under these conditions (unfortunately we do not have a way to quantitively assess MARylation of PARP-13). Another possibility is that IFNL3 RNA does not bind to the N-terminal zinc finger but to a different region of PARP-13 in the Schwerk et al. paper they did not explicitly show that IFNL3 RNA binds to the N-terminal zinc finger domain. Lastly, it is possible that context (e.g. viral infection) is important for the ability of PARP-7 to regulate PARP-13 binding to RNA, perhaps due to other interaction partners or other post-translational modifications. Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to evaluate the effects of PARP-7 on PARP-13 binding to RNA during viral infection; however, in future studies we plan to examine this with collaborators. We also will determine if perhaps PARP-7 disrupts viral RNA binding but not host RNA binding to PARP-13. For these experiments we will need to develop and validate biotinylated viral RNA probes, which we feel is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Endogenous interaction between PARP13 and PARP7: Another limitation of the current study is that the identification of the PARP13 as PARP-7 target was mainly through overexpression study.

To demonstrate that endogenous PARP-7 and PARP-13 interact in cells, we attempted co-IP experiments. For these experiments we collaborated with Dr Jason Matthews, who has developed a PARP-7 specific antibody (validated in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 using PARP-7 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts; comparison with commercially available PARP-7 antibody is shown). Unfortunately, the expression of PARP-7 under basal conditions was undetectable in HEK 293T or A549 cells. Therefore we could not perform co-IP experiments looking at endogenous PARP-7— PARP-13 interactions. It is possible that viral infection will induce PARP-7 expression (and activity) to a level that we can detect by Western blot, and in future studies with collaborators we will explore these conditions for co-IP experiments.</p><p>To further substantiate PARP-13 as a substrate of PARP-7 we expressed (in <italic>E. coli</italic>) and purified GST-tagged full-length PARP-7 and full-length His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-PARP-13.2. We found that PARP-7 trans-MARylates PARP-13.2 (in addition to auto-MARylation) in vitro in a time dependent manner (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). By contrast full-length His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO PARP-10 strongly auto-MARylates but only weakly trans-MARylates PARP-13.2 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). This is consistent with our cell-based experiments in which GFP-PARP-7, but not GFP-PARP10, trans-MARylates PARP-13.2 (Figure 4). Together these results further support the notion that PARP-13.2 is a bona fide target of PARP-7.</p><p>Having purified full-length, recombinant PARP-7 and PARP-13.2, we determined if (i) they interact in vitro and (ii) if the interaction is dependent on PARP-7 catalytic activity. Consistent with the BioID studies, we found that GST-PARP-7 and His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-PARP-13.2 interact in vitro as determined by GST-pulldown experiments. Neither addition of NAD<sup>+</sup> nor inhibition of PARP-7 catalytic activity with Phthal01 altered the interaction between PARP-7 and PARP-13.2 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). These results show that the interaction between PARP-7 and PARP-13.2 is independent of PARP-7 catalytic activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the author exclude the possibility that the ADP-ribosylation of PARP13 is an indirect effect of the expression instead of its catalytic activity? Would the PARP13 ADP-ribosylation occur in the presence of PARP7 catalytically dead mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that our results showing that Phthal01 (1 μM; inhibits PARP-7, PARP-1, and PARP-2 at this concentration in cells), but not veliparib (1 μM; inhibits PARP-1 and PARP-2 at this concentration in cells) inhibits PARP-7 mediated trans-MARylation of PARP-13.2 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F) in cells strongly supports the notion that the catalytic activity of PARP-7 is required for PARP-7-meidated MARylation of PARP-13.2 in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the author comment on whether PARP13 is a bona fide, endogenous PARP7-target during viral infections of WT cells? What would the authors predict how the cells respond to viral infections upon PARP7 overexpression or treatment with Pthal01?</p></disp-quote><p>These are great questions. As stated above, in future studies with virology lab collaborators we will examine whether PARP-13.1 and/or PARP-13.2 are trans-MARylation targets of PARP-7 during viral infection. Intriguingly, PARP-7 appears to play an anti-viral against some viruses (e.g. Sindbis virus) (Kozaki et al., 2017), and a pro-viral against other viruses (e.g. influenza A virus) (Yamada et al., 2016). Additionally, a recent showed that PARP-13.1 and PARP-13.2 have distinct roles in antiviral innate immunity: PARP-13.1 targets viral (e.g. Sindbis) RNA and inhibits viral replication, whereas PARP-13.2 targets host interferon RNA and suppresses interferon signaling degradation (Schwerk et al., 2019). Given the varied responses of PARP-7 to viral infection and the distinct roles for PARP-13.1 and PARP-13.2 during viral infection, it is difficult to know how cells will respond to viral infection in the context of PARP-7 overexpression or inhibition of its catalytic activity. Since PARP-13.1 and PARP-13.2 are both trans-MARylation targets of PARP-7, it is possible that PARP-7 could regulate both PARP-13.1 and PARP-13.2 during viral infection (which might also depend on virus type).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Half-life analyses: It was estimated that the half-life of PARP-10 is ~15 min and that of PARP13.2 is 189 min. Based on these analyses, the authors inferred that Cys-ADPr bond is more stable in cells than Glu/Asp-ADPr-bond. However, the analyses were performed at different concentrations of Phthal01. Would the higher concentration of Phthal01 affect the half-life measured on PARP13.2?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not think higher concentrations of Phthal01 would impact PARP-13.2 MARylation half-life measurements since 1μM Phthal01 was sufficient to completely inhibit PARP-7 in cells. Ideally, we would perform the experiment using a structurally distinct PARP-7 inhibitor. We are hopeful that one will become commercially available soon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, could the observed loss of signal not only be dependent on the rate of removal, but may also be influenced by the amount of the respective PARPs ADPr at the start of Phthal01 treatment. If, under these settings, PARP7-mediated ADPr is much more abundant than PARP10-mediated ADPr, PARP7 ADPr could be longer-lived while having the same removal kinetics as PARP10 ADPr. Given that the authors are making a claim on the underlying kinetics this possible confounder should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important consideration. We do not believe this is a concern, however, since the signal for PARP-7 mediated PARP-13.2 MARylation is similar to or lower than the signal for PARP10 MARylation (see for example Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the authors should clarify whether the difference in stability is due to the chemical or enzymatic stability of the two ADPr bonds. To measure the chemical stability, the authors could, for example, lyse the cells in denaturing conditions by keeping the pH at physiological levels and monitor the ADPr levels at different times similarly to the experiment in Figure 4D-E.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important issue that needs to be addressed. We prepared lysates under denaturing conditions (2% SDS, 95°C, pH 7.4) from HEK 293T cells expressing either PARP-10 or PARP-7 together with PARP-13.2. Samples were allowed to sit at room temperature and aliquots were removed at different time points and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected Western blot using antibodies against ADPr, GFP, and actin. We find that the MARylated PARP-10, PARP-7, and PARP-13.2 are stable for at least 24 hours (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). This results supports to the notion that the differences in the cellular half-life for MARylated PARP-10 versus MARylated PARP-13.2 reflect differences in the enzymatic stability of Glu/Asp-ADPr versus Cys-ADPr.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) ZnF Cys mutations on protein stability: A couple of data regarding PARP13 stability need clarification: a) Figure 4D: Treatment with Phthal01 not only reduces PARP7 and PARP13.2 MARylation but also increases their protein levels, suggesting that MARylation has a negative effect on protein stability.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting observation. We sought to further examine the effects of Phthal01 on endogenous PARP-7 and PARP-13. Using the novel PARP-7 specific antibody (described above), we found that Phthal01 substantially increased the levels of endogenous PARP-7 in A549 cells and MEFs (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B), consistent with results obtained using GFP-PARP-7. This is an interesting finding and suggests that PARP-7 catalytic activity regulates its stability. Under these conditions, however the levels of endogenous PARP-13.1 or PARP-13.2 did not change (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). This suggest that PARP-7 mediated MARylation of PARP-13 does not impact its stability; however, it is also possible that the effects of PARP-7 on PARP-13 are context dependent (for example, during viral infection). We will explore the latter possibility in future studies. We will also explore the mechanism by which Phthal01 stabilizes PARP-7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 5D: PARP7 overexpression reduces PARP13.2 protein levels. Cys to Ala mutations in PARP13 ZnF also reduce PARP13.2 protein levels compared to WT, especially when all four Cys were mutated. Reduction in Cys MARylation upon Cys mutation can be due to reduction in protein stability. Cys are structural elements of ZnF clusters and their mutation (to Ala) leads to loss of protein stability. Given that Cys within Zn fingers of PARP13 are MARylated, the modification could also lead to disruption of Zn clusters and partial (or complete) denaturation. This possibility could be tested with in vitro purified proteins (PARP7 and PARP13) using CD spectroscopy to validate the effect of Cys mutations and PARP7-mediated MARylation on PARP13 secondary structure.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point raised by the reviewer and something that we’ve contemplated. We do not have access to CD spectroscopy, but we could collaborate with a colleague in the future. Additionally, we need to optimize the expression and purification of bacterially expressed PARP-13.2 to obtain enough PARP-13.2 of sufficient purity for CD spectroscopy experiments. Lastly, we need to optimize a protocol for isolating unmodified versus MARylated PARP-13.2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
