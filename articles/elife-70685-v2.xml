as in the postnatal brain, but its role for neurophysiology and behavior at distinct postnatal periods is still unclear. In this work, we explored the neurogenic, behavioral, and functional impact of a constitutive and heterozygous AP2γ deletion in mice from early postnatal development until adulthood. AP2γ deficiency promotes downregulation of hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenesis, altering the ontogeny of emotional and memory behaviors associated with hippocampus formation. The impairments induced by AP2γ constitutive deletion since early development leads to an anxious-like phenotype and memory impairments as early as the juvenile phase. These behavioral impairments either persist from the juvenile phase to adulthood or emerge in adult mice with deficits in behavioral flexibility and object location recognition. Collectively, we observed a progressive and cumulative impact of constitutive AP2γ deficiency on the hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenic process, as well as alterations on limbic-cortical connectivity, together with functional behavioral impairments. The results herein presented demonstrate the modulatory role exerted by the AP2γ transcription factor and the relevance of hippocampal neurogenesis in the development of emotional states and memory processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampal neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>ap2gamma</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>spectral

into neurons, and integrated into the preexisting neural networks in restricted regions of the postnatal mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dennis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kempermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tobin et al., 2019</xref>). One of these so-called neurogenic niches is the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Here, neural stem cells (NSC) give rise to mature neural cells including glutamatergic granular neurons in a finely tuned process with many developmental steps sensitive to different regulatory influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kempermann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tobin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Toda et al., 2019</xref>). The last years have seen an increase in the number of studies on the functional specificity of hippocampal neurogenesis during development (DHN) and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). The ontogenetic interpretation of hippocampal neurogenesis assigns different functional relevance to DHN as the neurogenic process that establishes the basic repertoire of adaptable behaviors and AHN as the neurogenic process that underpins the adult brain’s ability to adapt functional behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrous et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Masachs et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tronel et al., 2015</xref>). This functional dissociation between these two stages of hippocampal neurogenesis allows us to understand how influences in the neurogenic process at different phases can lead to distinct impairments in emotional states and cognitive functions.</p><p>Postnatal hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenesis exhibits a regulatory transcriptional sequence (Sox2→ Pax6→ Ngn2→ AP2γ→ Tbr2→ NeuroD→ Tbr1) that recapitulates the hallmarks of the embryonic glutamatergic neurogenic process in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hochgerner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nacher et al., 2005</xref>). Transcriptional factors as Pax6, Ngn2, Tbr2, NeuroD, and Tbr1 have several and distinct roles in proliferation, cell kinetics, fate specification, and axonal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Englund et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Götz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hevner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hevner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hochgerner et al., 2018</xref>). Despite several efforts to understand the complex transcriptional network orchestration involved in the regulation of neurogenesis, both in early developmental stages and during adulthood, these are still to be fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Englund et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hsieh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Waclaw et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, the transcription factor activating protein two gamma (AP2γ, also known as Tcfap2c or Tfap2c) was described to be an important regulator of glutamatergic neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, being involved in the regulation of transient amplifying progenitors (TAPs) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hochgerner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>). AP2γ belongs to the AP2 family of transcription factors that is highly involved in several systems and biological processes, such as cell proliferation, adhesion, developmental morphogenesis, tumor progression, and cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eckert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hilger-Eversheim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thewes et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, AP2γ is functionally relevant during embryonic neocortical development, playing detrimental roles in early mammalian extraembryonic development and organogenesis, being one of the molecular components regulating the number of upper layer neurons during ontogeny and phylogeny in the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pinto et al., 2009</xref>). AP2γ is critical for the specification of glutamatergic neocortical neurons and their progenitors, acting as a downstream target of Pax6 and being involved in the regulation of Tbr2 and NeuroD basal progenitors’ determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pinto et al., 2009</xref>). Strikingly, in humans, defects in the AP2γ gene were reported in patients with severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geneviève et al., 2005</xref>), and to be involved in the mammary, ovarian and testicular carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hoei-Hansen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Odegaard et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>AP2γ deletion during embryonic development results in a specific reduction of upper layer neurons in the occipital cerebral cortex, while its overexpression increases region- and time-specific generation of neurons from cortical layers II/III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pinto et al., 2009</xref>). AP2γ expression persists in the adult hippocampus, particularly in a sub-population of TAPs acting as a positive regulator of the cell fate modulators, Tbr2 and NeuroD, and therefore as a promoter of proliferation and neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>). Conditional and specific downregulation of AP2γ in the adult brain NSCs decreases the generation of new neurons in the hippocampal DG and disrupts the electrophysiological synchronization between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Furthermore, mice with conditional deletion of AP2γ exhibit behavioral impairments, particularly a deficient performance in cognitive-related tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>). These studies reveal the crucial modulatory role of AP2γ during embryonic cerebral cortex development as well as its influence on glutamatergic neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent behaviors during adulthood. Still, it is relevant to assess the importance of AP2γ for postnatal neurophysiology and behavior since development, comprehending how defects in the neurogenic process since early development can impact on behavior at specific developmental stages.</p><p>Herein, we explored the neurogenic, behavioral, and functional effects of AP2γ constitutive and heterozygous deletion in mice from early postnatal development to adulthood. We revealed that AP2γ deficiency promotes downregulation of the hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenic process, compromises functional limbic-cortical connectivity, and leads to significant behavioral impairments on emotional and memory functional modalities. We showed that these impairments induced by AP2γ deficiency do not occur only during adulthood and that compromised hippocampal neurogenesis leads to emotional and memory deficits as early as the juvenile phase. These functional behavioral impairments are either maintained from the juvenile phase to adulthood or emerge as behavioral flexibility and object location recognition deficits in adult mice with AP2γ constitutive deletion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Constitutive AP2γ deficiency decreases proliferation and neurogenesis in the postnatal DG, reduces dendritic length and complexity of short-DCX<sup>+</sup> cells, without affecting neuronal morphology of mature granular neurons</title><p>We sought to dissect the impact of constitutive and heterozygous deficiency of AP2γ in the modulation of postnatal neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, including its effect in the hippocampal neurogenic niche on proliferation and morphology of doublecortin<sup>+</sup> (DCX) cells and pre-existing DG granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We assessed the morphology of DCX<sup>+</sup> cells only in adult animals as during juvenile period, the large amount of DCX<sup>+</sup> cells does not allow a proper segmentation of dendrites through this methodology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We divided the analysis of DCX<sup>+</sup> immature neurons into those that exhibit dendrites that branch into the inner molecular layer (IML) – short-DCX<sup>+</sup> cells – and DCX<sup>+</sup> cells with dendritic trees that reach the medial/outer molecular layer (M/OML) – long-DCX<sup>+</sup> cells, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dioli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Adult AP2γ KO mice presented decreased density of both short- and long-DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in comparison to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and G</xref>).

At juvenile age and during adulthood, AP2γ deficiency led to the manifestation of anxiety-like behavior and significant impairments in different memory behavioral tasks dependent on hippocampal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garthe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garthe and Kempermann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jessberger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ruediger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Treves et al., 2008</xref>). These functional behavioral impairments are either maintained from the juvenile phase until adulthood or emerge in adult mice with deficits in behavioral flexibility and object location recognition together with decreased AHN. Given the importance of AP2γ for the proliferation and expansion of a subpopulation of TAPs (Tbr2<sup>+</sup>), our results reveal that downregulating this specific cell population since early development promotes a significant long-term impact on different behavioral functions. Regulation of TAPs’ by AP2γ seems to be also relevant for the preservation of cognitive performance, as shown by its impact on hippocampal-dependent emotional and memory tasks. These observations are in agreement with previous publications where suppression of the TAP’s regulator Tbr2 exerted both an anxiety-like phenotype during the juvenile period and induced cognitive deficits during early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Veerasammy et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, Ngn2, another regulator of TAP cells, is also reported as important for the modulation of cognitive behavior, namely in the rescue of cognitive function in the T-Maze task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>AP2γ deficiency resulted in poor performance on the MWM’s behavioral flexibility task and compromised object context discrimination in the adult mice, both of which are memory tasks that rely on the interaction of the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker and Warburton, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamilton and Brigman, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, adult mice with constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ present significant deficits of electrophysiological coherence between the dHip and the mPFC in a wide range of frequencies, previously associated to behavior outputs dependent on cortico-limbic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Oliveira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sardinha et al., 2017</xref>). Previously, we observed that conditional deletion of AP2γ during adulthood led to coherence impairments between the vHip-to-mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>). This apparent discrepancy may be related to the specific time of AP2γ deletion on these different mice models. Yet, similar electrophysiological deficits in dHIP-mPFC coherence were observed in a rat model of hippocampal cytogenesis abrogation, which also denote long-term manifestation of emotional and cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the integrity of the hippocampus-to-PFC circuitry was described to be relevant for the action of antidepressants, such as ketamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carreno et al., 2016</xref>), which promote neurogenesis, suggesting that AP2γ may be involved in conserving this neuronal circuit. Additionally, AP2γ plays an important role on cortical basal progenitors’ specification during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pinto et al., 2009</xref>) that might be affecting the mPFC activity. In fact, AP2γ KO mice presented impaired neuronal activity in the mPFC in a wide range of frequency bands, as detected by the general decrease of PSD signals recorded, and in concordance to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, misspecification of upper cortical layers promoted by AP2γ deficiency since embryonic development may be contributing to the functional electrophysiological alterations, and eliciting cognitive defects herein observed.</p><p>Collectively, the findings of this study show that AP2γ transcription factor deficiency compromises the generation of hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, altering the ontogeny of behavior complexity associated with the hippocampus formation. Decreased hippocampal neurogenesis since early development in AP2γ KO mice leads to a compromised basic repertoire of adaptive behaviors. Impairments in DHN induced by deficiencies in AP2γ transcription factor leads to a hypersensitivity toward aversive stimulus as revealed by the presence of an anxious-like phenotype, and memory impairments shown in multiple cognitive tests. These functional behavioral impairments are either maintained from the juvenile phase until adulthood or emerge in adult mice as a result of the reduced AHN caused by constitutive deletion of AP2γ. These observations highlight the importance of an intact hippocampal neurogenic process for such functional outputs.</p><p>The current study adds a temporal window of analysis not yet studied and hints that future works should elucidate whether AP2γ can participate in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and/or psychiatric disorders and whether positive modulation of AP2γ could be applied at younger ages as a therapeutic approach to revert deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis and associated behavioral impairments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

To generate the AP2γ KO mice, ESs with the null allele were injected into blastocysts resulting in chimeric animals. The offspring of germ line transmitting animals were tested for the presence of the AP2γ null allele. AP2γ KO transgenic mice line was maintained in a 129/SV background and identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Werling and Schorle, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Along the study, distinctive cohorts (at least two <italic>per</italic> timepoint) of littermate WT and AP2γ KO male mice were submitted to molecular (n = 4–6 <italic>per</italic> group), behavioral (n = 6–17 <italic>per</italic> group) and electrophysiological (n = 5–6 <italic>per</italic> group) assessment at the different postnatal ages (early postnatal period: from postnatal day (P)one to P21; juvenile period, from P25 to P33; adulthood, from P70 to P84). None of the animals’ cohorts were used in multiple timepoints. Different cohorts of animals were used for each analyzed developmental stage to avoid any potential influence of habituation or learning from the repetition of behavior assessment and avoid any long-term impact of behavioral testing during development periods.</p><p>As a result of limiting the number of behavioral tests to which each animal was subjected, there is some variation in sample size across behavioral tests. All mice were housed and kept under standard laboratory conditions at 22°C ± 1°C, 55 % humidity, and ad libitum access to food and water on a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.).

This consisted in a daily evaluation for the first 21 days of life. Mice subjected to early postnatal behavioral assessment did not perform any additional behavioral test later in life. From postnatal day P1 onward, newborn animals were evaluated in several parameters, including skin appearance, activity, and presence of milk spot in the stomach, indicator of correct maternal care and well-being. Pups were examined for the acquisition of developmental milestones until weaning (P21), every day at the same time, in the same experimental room, by the same experimenter. This daily scoring included tests to assess the acquisition of mature response regarding somatic parameters and neurobiological reflexes.</p><sec id="s4-2-1-1-1"><title>Somatic parameters</title><p>As a measure of morphological development, animals were daily weighed (weight ±0.01 g).

When it was possible to detect a gradual progression in performance as for walking, surface righting, grasping, negative geotaxis, cliff aversion, daily score was attributed between 0 and 3, with 0 representing absence, and three corresponding to the achievement of the mature response.

Individual cohorts of mice were exclusively subjected to behavioral characterization at one of these periods, either while juvenile or later at adulthood. To avoid any possible impact of habituation or learning from the repetition of behavior assessment, we exposed different cohorts of animals to a subset of behavioral paradigms. Thus, with this approach of limiting the number of behavioral tests each animal was exposed to, there is some variation in the sample number across behavioral paradigms. Behavioral tests were performed in the following order: Open-field, elevated-plus maze, novelty-suppressed feeding, sucrose splash, forced-swimming, tail suspension, object recognition, pattern separation, Morris water maze, and contextual fear conditioning. When mice were exposed to multiple behavioral paradigms, 1–2 days of resting were added between tests. Sucrose splash test was only performed in juvenile mice while elevated-plus maze and forced-swimming test were exclusively tested during the adult period.</p><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Open field (OF) test</title><p>The OF test is a behavioral paradigm commonly used to assess anxiety-like and exploratory behavior, and general activity in rodents. This apparatus consists of a square arena of 43.2 cm x 43.2 cm, closed by a 30.5 cm high wall, with a lamp at the center (~850 lux). Mice were individually placed in the center of the OF arena, and their movement was tracked for 5 mins, using a 16-beam infrared system (MedAssociates, US). Average velocity of the animals was considered as a measure of locomotor capacity, and the percentage of distance traveled in the center of the arena (defined as the central 11 × 11 cm region) was considered as measurement of anxiety-like behavior. Data was analysed using the Activity Monitor software (MedAssociates, US).

The central area connecting both arms corresponds to an area of 10 × 10 cm. Animals were individually positioned in the center of the maze, facing an edge of a closed-arm, and were allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. All trials were recorded using an infrared photobeam system, and the percentage of time spent in the open arms was accessed through the EthoVision XT 11.5 tracking system (Ethovision, Noldus Information Technologies, Netherlands). For the adult behavioral assessment, animals were between P70 and P84.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) test</title><p>Following ~18 h of food deprivation, animals were placed in an illuminated open-field arena with 43.2 cm x 43.2 cm, closed by a 30.5 cm high wall, with a lamp at the center (~850 lux). The arena floor was covered with 2 cm of the habitual bedding material, and a single food pellet was placed on a 5 cm square piece of filter paper at the center. Mice were placed facing a wall, and the latency to reach and feed on the food pellet was assessed, within a maximum limit of 10 min. Feeding behavior was defined as rearing with visible food consumption. Latency to reach and feed on the food pellet was used as a measure of anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Samuels and Hen, 2011</xref>). After this test trial, animals were single housed in homecages containing a pre-weighted food pellet, and allowed to feed during 10 min. The amount of food consumption in the home cage provided a measure of appetite drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bessa et al., 2009</xref>).

Briefly, each animal was individually placed in glass cylinders filled with water (23 °C; depth 30 cm) for 5 min. All sessions were video-recorded, and the immobility time, defined through a video tracking software Ethovision XT 11.5 (Noldus, Netherlands), was considered as a measure of coping behavior. Mice were considered immobile when all active behaviors (struggling, swimming, and jumping) were ceased. For immobility, the animals had to remain passively floating or making minimal movements required to maintain the nostrils above water. For the assessment of coping behavior, the first 3 min of the trial were considered as a habituation period and the last 2 min as the test period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>).

Briefly, mice were suspended by the tail to the edge of a laboratory bench 80 cm above the floor (using adhesive tape) for 6 min. Trials were video-recorded, and the immobility and climbing times were automatically analyzed by the video tracking software Ethovision XT 11.5 (Noldus, Netherlands). In the TST, immobility time is normally defined as a readout of coping behavior. Animal models of depression typically exhibit longer periods of immobility during the TST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krishnan and Nestler, 2011</xref>).

This test relies on rodents’ nature to explore and preference for novelty. First, mice were acclimatized to a testing arena (30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm) under dim light (desk lamp pointing to a room wall ~150–200 lux at the arenas level) for 3 days during 20 min. After habituation, animals were presented with two equal objects for 10 min (training), positioned in the center of the arena. One hour later, one of the objects was moved toward an arena wall, and mice were allowed to freely explore the objects for 10 min. On the following day, animals returned to the arena for 10 min, with one of the objects being replaced by a novel object. The familiar and novel objects had different size, color, shape, and texture. These objects were made from building blocks as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>. Between trials, the arena and objects were properly cleaned with 10 % ethanol.

During the training phase, animals were placed in an open white chamber wall-patterned with laminated blue squares and allowed to explore two identical objects for 10 min. After 30 min inter-trial interval, mice were placed in a second open grey chamber wall-patterned with laminated white stripes.

Additionally, the strategies used to reach the platform were also analyzed. MWM was performed in a circular white pool (170 cm diameter) filled with water at 22 °C to a depth of 31 cm in a room with and dim light and extrinsic clues (triangle, square, cross, and horizontal stripes). The pool was divided into four quadrants by imaginary lines, and a clear-acrylic cylinder platform (12 cm diameter; 30 cm high), placed in one of the quadrants.

In this task, animals had to learn the position of the hidden platform and to retain this information for four consecutive daily trials. The task was performed for 4 days and in a clockwise manner the platform was repositioned in a new quadrant each day. During the daily trials, animals had different starting positions (north, east, west, and south). Trials ended when mice reached the platform within the time limit of 120 s. If the animals did not reach the platform during the trial time, they were guided to the platform and allowed to stay for 30 s.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>All reviewers found the paper interesting for scientists in the fields of developmental psychobiology and molecular mechanisms underlying adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The data analysis is rigorous, and the conclusions are justified by the data.</p><p>However, additional data from the different ontogenic stages would be helpful to strength the conclusions. In addition, given the authors previous publication on the impact of conditional knockdown of AP2γ (Mateus-Pinheiro et al., Mol Psy 2017), the authors need to emphasise what the novelty of this work is and how it advances their previous findings.</p><p>In addition, more information is needed to improve the manuscript. In particular, we recommend to better describe the animal model, the methods and use anova for the analysis of coherence or PSD at different frequencies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The aim of this study is to examine the impact of AP2γ deficiency on the emergence of behavioral impairments of emotional and cognitive functions. This longitudinal behavioral analysis show that AP2γ deficiency anxiety leads to memory impairments and an anxious-like phenotype during the juvenile period, a phenotype that persists into adulthood. In contrast, depression-like responses remain unchanged. These changes are associated with an alteration in hippocampal neurogenesis and an alteration in adult hippocampal-to-PFC functional connectivity.</p><p>Major strength:</p><p>Understanding when emotional and cognitive functions emerge during development is a fundamental question with regard to neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, the authors addressed this question by determining the impact of AP2γ deficiency on the emergence of different behavioral responses. They found some neurobiological correlates for the deficits observed.</p><p>Major weakness:</p><p>It is unclear whether different batches of animals were used for the behavioral testing or alternatively whether the same batch of animals was tested during two different developmental periods. In this latter case, the impact of training during the juvenile period may have interfered with the behavior of animals tested at adulthood. In addition, it would have been interesting to test (1) anxiety before weaning, (2) spatial learning in a WM or contextual fear conditioning in juvenile/adolescent animals.</p><p>Given that the behavioral syndrome is a stable form from the juvenile period into adulthood, the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in this context is unclear.</p><p>The authors found no differences when assessing DG neuronal characteristics in juvenile and adult mice. It would be interesting to determine whether AP2γ deficiency impacts the dendritic arborisation of Dcx neurons in juvenile and adult mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Loureiro-Campos, Dinis Alves et al. investigated impact of a constitutive AP2γ; heterozygous deletion in mice from early postnatal development until adulthood on hippocampal neurogenesis, emotional and cognitive behaviors, and limbic-cortical connectivity. The authors demonstrate that constitutive and heterozygous AP2γ deficiency does not alter early postnatal development but reduces BrdU-positive and BrdU/DCX double-positive cells, but not dendritic length, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus both at juvenile and adult periods. The authors also find that constitutive and heterozygous AP2γ deficiency in juvenile mice (P25-31) increases anxiety-like behavior (% distance center zone open-field test), without altering coping behavior in response to an acute stressor (immobility during tail suspension test) or depressive-like behavior (grooming during sucrose splash test), while promoting cognitive deficits (novel object recognition during object recognition test). Constitutive and heterozygous AP2γ deficiency in adult mice (P70-92) increases anxiety-like behavior (% distance center zone open-field test, % time in open arms elevated plus-maze), without altering coping behavior in response to an acute stressor (immobility during forced swim test or tail suspension test). Adult AP2γ+/- also showed altered behavior during the object recognition test (trend for decreased preference to explore novel object location) and deficits in contextual hippocampal-related memory (reduced freezing time during exposure to familiar context during the contextual fear conditioning test). Adult AP2γ+/- also showed impaired behavioral flexibility (reference memory test in Morris water maze) and a delayed switch from non-hippocampal-dependent to hippocampal-dependent strategies to reach the escape platform during consecutive Morris water maze trials. Finally, simultaneous assessment of electrophysiological features of local field potentials (LFPs) in the dorsal hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex revealed an impaired functional connectivity between these two brain regions in adult AP2γ+/- mice compared to wild-type controls, and decreases in power spectral density, predominantly in the medial prefrontal cortex.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are supported by the data. The manuscript is written clearly, and the figures are organized and informative.

Here, the authors report that these impairments also occur following constitutive AP2γ knockdown and are apparent prior to adulthood, namely in the juvenile period. The authors also report that constitutive AP2γ knockdown disrupts dorsal hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) coherence but does not affect ventral hippocampus-mPFC coherence which opposes the authors previous findings when investigating the impact of conditional AP2γ knockout in adulthood. The experiments are well designed and results are presented clearly. The authors conclusions are justified by the data. However, some weaknesses that require addressing include: correction of typos; provision of additional methodological details; provision of a more explicit statement as to the novelty of the findings of this work; a more detailed discussion including discussion of the lack of ventral hippocampus-mPFC impairments here versus their previous publication and a discussion on why some behavioural effects (novel object recognition) observed in the juvenile period were not sustained into adulthood.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Given the authors previous publication on the impact of conditional knockdown of AP2γ on hippocampal neurogenesis, anxiety-like behaviour and cognition, the authors need to emphasise what the novelty of this work is and how it advances their previous findings.

This result indicates that constitutive deficiency of AP2γ may exert a longitudinal cumulative impact leading to more severe alterations in behavioral performance of mice&quot;.

However, they have added new behavioral data that deserve to be discussed more deeply in the context of ontogeny of emotion and memory.</p><p>1. The authors made several additional experiments. However, some of them have not been included in the revised version. In particular, results of the Figure 2 of the rebuttal letter should be added in figure 3 (in h). These results are really important because they show that animals are too immature to navigate through space using reference memory (Schenk et al. 1985). This is consistent with the delayed development of the hippocampus and indicates that deficits observed at adulthood in the WM are NOT linked to neurons born during the juvenile period or before.</p><p>2. The authors demonstrated that constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ has a complex influence on behaviors:</p><p>– Depression-like behaviors remain unchanged</p><p>– Some deficits induced in juveniles persist in adulthood : anxiety-like behavior, contextual fear memory (which by the way might be linked to enhanced anxiety levels )</p><p>– Some deficits observed in juveniles do not persist in adulthood: novel object recognition</p><p>– Some deficits are specific of adult: spatial reference memory, novel object location.</p><p>The authors should add value to their results by highlighting the complexity of these observations. This complexity should be discussed in term of ontogeny of behaviors, emergence of the different memory systems and different waves of neurogenesis.</p><p>3. There is too much emphasis in the discussion on adult neurogenesis. For example the observation that juveniles exhibit some deficits (anxiety like behavior, simple memory operation) is not relevant to adult neurogenesis! In contrast, the late emergence of spatial reference memory and behavioral flexibility might be! (Dupret et al., 2008; Garthe et al., 2009, see also review of Anacker and Hen R, 2017; Abrous et al., 2021).</p><p>4. The title do not reflect the results</p><p>5. Abstract/introduction : the concluding sentences do not highlight the novelty of the results.</p><p>6. Results</p><p>• Ln 109 the age of the animals should be indicated here and not later (ln126).</p><p>• Ln 126 The sentence is not clear enough: We assessed the morphology of DCX+ cells <italic>only</italic> in adult animals as during juvenile period (P31), the large amount of DCX+ cells does not allow a proper segmentation of dendrites through this methodology (Figure 2A).</p><p>• Ln 150-151: the subtitle does not reflect the results since memory deficits are not systematically observed. Moreover the word cognitive is rather vague (memory is more appropriate).</p><p>• The last paragraph of page 6 needs more breath.</p><p>• Ln 180: the task used in Figure 3J is not a &quot;behavioral pattern separation&quot; task. In this task, the ability to combine &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot; information is measured (object in context) and mutant mice are impaired in their ability to contextualize the information. Among others, the work of Rasmaran et al., 2016 (Determinants of object-in-context and object-place-context recognition in the developing rat); Barker and Warburton 2011 (When Is the Hippocampus Involved in Recognition Memory). Barker and Warburton 2021 (Putting objects in context: A prefrontal-hippocampal-perirhinal cortex network) might be helpful for the discussion.</p><p>• A task measuring &quot;behavioral pattern separation&quot; is not really needed as behavioral flexibility also depends upon adult born neurons (Dupret et al., 2008; Garthe et al., 2009, see also review of Anacker and Hen R, 2017; Abrous et al., 2021).</p><p>• Fig3N (and also Fig4L): the authors wrote &quot;No alterations in freezing behavior were observed in context B&quot;. These results have not been discussed. The % of freezing are high (40% and 60%) and are certainly higher than that measured before conditioning (please provide the results). Does that mean both groups of animals generalized and did not recognize the context?</p><p>• Ln 201 the subtitle does not reflect the results since not all deficits persist (and some appear).</p><p>• Ln 222 the 2 contexts are not similar.</p><p>• The last paragraph of page 7 needs more breath.</p><p>• Ln 218: memory (and not cognitive) performances.</p><p>• Ln 227 the authors concluded that &quot;These observations suggest that adult KO mice exhibit deficits in contextual hippocampal&quot;, a conclusion that does not fit with the lack of deficits observed in Figure 4H.</p><p>• Ln 245 This conclusion does not summarize the results appropriately</p><p>7.

In this study, individual cohorts of mice were used for behavioral characterization at early postnatal period, juvenile or later at adulthood. Our intention was to avoid any possible impact of habituation or learning from the repetition of behavior assessment, as evoked by the reviewer, and prevent a possible long-term impact of behavioral testing during development periods. In the ”Materials and Methods” section, of the revised manuscript, we added this important information to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it would have been interesting to test (1) anxiety before weaning, (2) spatial learning in a WM or contextual fear conditioning in juvenile/adolescent animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer for such pertinent suggestions.</p><p>1. We agree that the assessment of the anxiety-like state before weaning represents an additional time point of analysis between the developmental milestones and the behavioral assessment during the juvenile period. As such, in consequence of the reviewer’s suggestion, at postnatal day (P)21, wild-type (WT) and AP2γ KO mice were subjected to the open-field test. Results reveal that similarly to the ones observed during the juvenile period, before weaning, AP2γ KO mice show a significant decrease in distance traveled in the center of the open-field, in comparison to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). These results reinforce the observation that constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ promotes an increase of anxiety-like behavior, manifested as early as P21, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Importantly, AP2γ deletion does not impact the locomotor activity during the juvenile period as denoted by the average velocity in the open-field test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Before weaning, anxiety-like behavior was assessed through the open-field (OF) test.</title><p>AP2γ KO mice exhibited a decreased in distance traveled in center, when compared to WT , suggesting an anxious-like phenotype (A).

Furthermore, we totally agree with the reviewer’s suggestion to evaluate the impact of constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ on cognitive performance during the juvenile period, as performed during adulthood. Thus, we performed the Morris water maze (MWM), as also suggested by the editor, and the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) test on WT and AP2γ KO juvenile mice. Results from the CFC reveal that juvenile AP2γ KO mice exhibit a significant decrease in freezing behavior on context probe A when compared to WT animals. No significant alterations in freezing behavior were observed either at context probe B or cue probe. These results are in line with those observed during adulthood, suggesting an early and specific impact of constitutive and heterozygous AP2γ deletion on context-dependent fear memory, observed during the juvenile period and still detected in adult mice. Results of CFC in juvenile mice are now included as figure 3 L-O in the revised manuscript. On the other hand, results from the MWM in juvenile mice were unable to provide further evidence of the impact of AP2γ deletion on cognitive performance, and more particularly on spatial reference memory. Along the days of training, both WT and AP2γ KO mice did not reveal a significant decrease in escape latency to find the hidden platform, suggesting that, at this early age, mice were not able to successfully learn this complex task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>).

We observed that both juvenile and adult AP2γ KO mice were unable to distinguish changes of objects between distinct contexts as evidenced by a similar exploration of objects in the familiar and novel context. These observations constitute further evidence of a strong impact of the constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ on multiple cognitive modalities. Results from the pattern separation task are included as figures 3J-K (juvenile) and 4J (adult) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the behavioral syndrome is a stable form from the juvenile period into adulthood, the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in this context is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In fact, the results of this study reveal that constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ promotes a significant impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and on behavior which is already evidenced during the juvenile period. In this context, we agree with the reviewer that AP2γ deletion does not impact solely on adult hippocampal neurogenesis but impacts this neurogenic process early on development. As so, throughout the manuscript namely in the “Results” and “Discussion” sections, we clearly state this perspective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors found no differences when assessing DG neuronal characteristics in juvenile and adult mice. It would be interesting to determine whether AP2γ deficiency impacts the dendritic arborisation of Dcx neurons in juvenile and adult mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the pertinent reviewer’s suggestion and we agree that assessing the impact of AP2γ deletion on the morphology of immature DCX<sup>+</sup> neurons would represent a more refine measurement than the morphology of pre-existing mature neurons in the dentate gyrus. In this context, we analyzed the dendritic arborization of DCX<sup>+</sup> neurons in juvenile and adult mice. We assessed the morphology of short (dendrites extend to the inner molecular layer) and long (dendritic tree reaches the outer molecular layer) DCX<sup>+</sup> cells. In adult mice, we observed a significant decrease in the arborization of short DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in AP2γ KO mice when compared to WT. In addition to a decrease in the total dendritic length, we found a decreased complexity of short DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in AP2γ KO mice denoted by a reduced number of intersections along their dendritic tree. Interestingly, we detected no differences between the dendritic arborization of long DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in the DG of adult WT and AP2γ KO mice. These observations suggest that in addition to a decrease in the number of DCX<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 2C and G), in adult mice, AP2γ deficiency delays the maturation of granular neurons but has no impact on their definitive morphology. In juvenile mice, as expected (Kase et al., 2020; Katsimpardi and Lledo, 2018), we found in both groups a larger amount and density of DCX<sup>+</sup> cells than at adulthood. In consequence of large overlap of these cells, it was impossible to distinguish individual dendritic trees of DCX<sup>+</sup> cells which prevent us to analyze their morphology and understand the impact of AP2γ deletion at this period. The analysis of dendritic arborization of DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in the hippocampal DG of adult mice is now presented in figure 2 of the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have the following recommendations to improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>– Adding individual datapoints to the graph would increase clarity for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this relevant suggestion to improve the clarity of the manuscript.

In previous studies, we observed that AP2γ transcription factor was critically required for neuronal specialization and development for specific and defined periods, for proper embryonic development of the cerebral cortex (Pinto et al., 2009), and a continuous generation of the neurons in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017). In the latter, we used conditional AP2γ knockout mice and showed that conditional deletion of AP2γ in the adult mice also triggered hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficits. In this context, it is important to investigate the cumulative impact of AP2γ deficiency since development. For that we used in this study a constitutive and heterozygous mice model of AP2γ deletion (homozygous mice are not viable) unabling us, for the first time, to assess the importance of AP2γ for postnatal neurodevelopment, particularly on the process of hippocampal neurogenesis, and the impact of its deletion to important hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Furthermore, in light of the importance of AP2γ for the proliferation and expansion of a subpopulation (Tbr2<sup>+</sup>) of transient amplifying progenitors (TAPs), we also intend to reveal the long-term impact of downregulating this cell population since early development. As such, in this study, we applied a longitudinal assessment of postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal morphology, regional electrophysiological coherence, and behavioral performance. This extensive and multimodal evaluation of the impact of AP2γ deficiency was performed during the juvenile period and adulthood.

With the conditional deletion of AP2γ during adulthood from our study in Molecular Psychiatry 2017 (Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017), we were not able to understand how deficiencies of AP2γ transcription factor could modulate postnatal neurodevelopment, particularly hippocampal neurogenesis, and hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Hence, the current study adds a temporal window of analysis not yet studied, and hints that in future works some positive modulation of AP2γ could be applied at younger ages, as a therapeutic approach, to revert deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis in the context of neurological disorders.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of frame this study among previous and related publications, in the revised version of the manuscript we made it more clear to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction</p><p>There are some typos that should be fixed:</p><p>L49: &quot;Postnatal mice brain&quot; – please change to mouse brain.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we increased the accuracy of the first sentence of the introduction section changing the terminology to “mouse brain”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L49 Boldrini paper is on human and not mouse hippocampal neurogenesis and thus should be removed from this sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s suggestion, and in the revised manuscript we removed the reference Boldrini et., 2018 when referring to the neurogenic process in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L53 &quot;in a fined and tuned process&quot; – change to a finely tuned process?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion and we corrected the sentence in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods</p><p>L318 &quot;distinctive at cohorts&quot; – delete &quot;at&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we deleted ‘at’ from the referred sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why were only males assessed and not females also?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s comment.

However, we adapted it to a 5 minutes-long protocol, being the first 3 mins of habituation period and the last 2 mins of test trial as previously described (Mateus-Pinheiro et al., Molecular Psychiatry, 2017). Importantly, the results obtained in this FST protocol are in accordance with those observations from TST, where we found no differences in behavioral despair between WT and AP2γ KO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Neither the tail suspension test nor the forced swim test are tests of &quot;learned helplessness&quot;. Please revise the language used to describe these tests and the behaviour they induce. These tests were developed to measure antidepressant-like behaviour.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s comment. In fact, we agree that “learned helplessness” is not the most appropriate term to describe the behavior assessed by tail suspension test and forced swimming test. Thus, throughout the revised manuscript, we changed the term “learned helplessness” to “behavioral despair”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since AP2γ regulates hippocampal neurogenesis , it is curious as to why the authors did not use behavioural tests known to be dependent on hippocampal neurogenesis such as pattern separation or antidepressant action in the novelty suppressed feeding test. This limitation and direction for future research should be acknowledged in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and agree with this pertinent question raised by the reviewer. It is crucial to assess the behavioral impact of the constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ, a key regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, through behavioral tests particularly dependent on this neurogenic process. As such, we performed the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) test in both juvenile and adult wild-type and AP2γ KO mice. We observed both in juvenile and adult mice an anxious-like phenotype in AP2γ KO mice, denoted by increased latency to the food pellet in comparison to WT animals. Results from NSF are included in the revised version of the manuscript as figures 3C-D (juvenile) and 4D-E (adult). Furthermore, we assessed the performance of juvenile and adult WT and AP2γ KO mice in the pattern separation task. Results from both periods reveal an impaired capacity of AP2γ KO mice to distinguish changes of objects between distinct contexts as evidenced by a similar exploration of objects in the familiar and novel context. Together, these observations constitute further evidence of the impact of constitutive and heterozygous AP2γ deletion on hippocampal neurogenesis and consequent impairment on dependent behaviors. Results from the pattern separation task are now included as figures 3J-K (juvenile) and 4J (adult) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please name/describe the objects used in the novel object recognition test.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, in the revised manuscript we added a detailed description of the objects used in the novel object recognition test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why was morphological assessment of neurons restricted to the dorsal dentate gyrus?

In our study, the assessment of the neuromorphological impact of constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ was performed in the dorsal hippocampus. As pointed out by the reviewer, a reason for this option is related to the fact that constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ solely impacts on the mPFC-dorsal hippocampus coherence. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out a possible impact on the morphology of mature granular neurons in the ventral hippocampus. Indeed, it would be of interest in next studies the assessment of putative changes in number and morphology, particularly of DG neurons in the ventral hippocampus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>Figure 1 – please add the time line and sequence of specific behavioural tests into the figure or describe the sequence and experimental days in which behavioural testing was conducted in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s suggestion for clarity on the sequence of behavioral testing used in this study.

We agree with the reviewer that there is a variation in the number of animals that performed the different behavioral tests within each period, juvenile or adulthood. This variation results from our intention to prevent overexposure mice with all behavior tests (a total of 13 different tests). We believed this would impact the normal performance of the animals, leading to habituation and training to behavioral testing, and would represent a cofounding effect for the interpretation of the results. Thus, different cohorts of mice containing both experimental groups WT and AP2γ KO were exposed to a representative portion of behavior tests. Each individual cohort was slightly different in their size. Furthermore, some cohorts of mice had commonly performed one or more behavioral tests, which resulted in the combination of data from these cohorts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fear conditioning – The authors report that AP2γ+/- mice freeze less in context A.

The assessment of cognitive performance in the contextual fear conditioning in both juvenile (now included in the revised version of the manuscript) and adult mice revealed that after one day of training and an acquired light-shock association, AP2γ KO mice display decreased freezing behavior when exposed to the previous context (A), when compared to WT mice. As the context test is performed after the acquisition of context-dependent fear memory, these observations suggest a specific deficit in contextual hippocampal-related memory. In our interpretation, similar observation from exposure to context A that preceded light-shock association would eventually suggest reduced anxiety-like behavior, which would be in line with observations from OF, EPM and NSF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 legend should clearly state whether these measurements were taken from adult or juvenile mice.</p><p>Title of suppl Figure 5 should state whether these measurements are made in juvenile or adult mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these relevant observations.

In fact, juvenile AP2γ KO mice exhibit a decreased performance in the novel object recognition task, when compared to WT mice, which is not observed when assessed at adulthood. Yet, we believe it is worthy to note that adult AP2γ KO mice present a trend towards significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.08) for cognitive deficits in a similar task when challenged to recognize a change in the location of the object. Furthermore, evidence from other cognitive tests assessed both in juvenile and adult mice, pattern separation and contextual fear conditioning, revealed significant differences between experimental groups at both periods, suggesting that constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ promotes an early and strong impact on cognitive performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should discuss why in this experiment dHi-mPFC but not vHi-mPFC coherence was disrupted, but in their previous manuscript conditional knockout impaired vHi-mPFC coherence.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this pertinent observation. In fact, in this study we sought to understand how constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ affects the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We observed that the spectral coherence between dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) and mPFC is significantly decreased in delta, theta, and beta frequency bands. This impaired interregional coherence was accompanied by a reduced neuronal activity in the mPFC, including in delta, theta, beta, and low gamma frequencies. We found no differences in the connectivity between the ventral-hippocampus (vHip) and the mPFC. Taking into consideration our previously published work (Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017), this was an unexpected result, since conditional deletion of AP2γ in adult mice led to coherence impairments between the vHip-to-mPFC. However, we must take into consideration the time specificity on these mice models of AP2γ deletion. The first and previously published study, deletion of AP2γ was specifically performed at adulthood, while in the current study, mice have a constitutive deficiency of AP2γ since embryonic development. The time in which deficiency of the transcription factor AP2γ is induced might lead to different brain circuitry changes/remodelling, altering for example the connectivity between distinct hippocampal regions and the mPFC, and in this way, contributing to distinct functional readouts as shown in our studies. Although we are in both modulating the hippocampal neurogenic process, we have to bear in mind that AP2γ deficiency since embryonic development might induce not accounted differences contributing to these functional readouts, and the other way around. Yet, it is important to note that similar electrophysiological deficits in dHIP-mPFC coherence were observed in a rat model of hippocampal cytogenesis abrogation, which also denote long-term manifestation of emotional and cognitive deficits (Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L276: &quot;conditional deletion of AP2γ in adulthood lead to a less evident effect on emotional behavior, namely in anxiety-like behavior tested in the OF and EPM behavioral tests, when comparing with the constitutive mice model herein presented (Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017). This result indicates that constitutive deficiency of AP2γ may exert a longitudinal cumulative impact leading to more severe alterations in behavioral performance of mice&quot;. To support this conclusion, the authors should provide empirical data such as percentage difference in time spent in OA of EPM in AP2γ knockdown mice versus controls in both studies or else describe in more specific detail the findings in the previous paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this pertinent observation. We agree that the referred statement is not supported by the data of the present study. To fully compare with precision the impact of the conditional and the constitutive heterozygous deletion of AP2γ, a more refine experiment would be needed. In this experiment would be necessary to provide the same experimental conditions for behavioral testing and a similar degree of deletion. In this context, in the revised version of the manuscript, we reformulated this inaccurate statement.</p><p>References:</p><p>Chari T, Griswold S, Andrews NA, Fagiolini M. 2020.

However, they have added new behavioral data that deserve to be discussed more deeply in the context of ontogeny of emotion and memory.</p><p>1. The authors made several additional experiments. However, some of them have not been included in the revised version. In particular, results of the Figure 2 of the rebuttal letter should be added in figure 3 (in h). These results are really important because they show that animals are too immature to navigate through space using reference memory (Schenk et al. 1985). This is consistent with the delayed development of the hippocampus and indicates that deficits observed at adulthood in the WM are NOT linked to neurons born during the juvenile period or before.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we included these results in Figure 3 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Indeed, constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ transcription factor leads to complex behavior alterations in juvenile and adult animals. We acknowledge this complexity in the discussion of the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is too much emphasis in the discussion on adult neurogenesis. For example the observation that juveniles exhibit some deficits (anxiety like behavior, simple memory operation) is not relevant to adult neurogenesis! In contrast, the late emergence of spatial reference memory and behavioral flexibility might be! (Dupret et al., 2008; Garthe et al., 2009, see also review of Anacker and Hen R, 2017; Abrous et al., 2021).</p></disp-quote><p>We believe these two pertinent points (2 and 3) raised by the reviewer are interconnected. As so, we decided to address the arguments together.</p><p>In the last years, we have seen an increased number of studies focusing on the functional specificity of hippocampal neurogenesis during development (DHN) and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). The ontogenetic interpretation of hippocampal neurogenesis assigns different functional relevance to DHN (as the neurogenic process that establishes the basic repertoire of adaptable behaviors) and AHN (as the neurogenic process that underpins the adult brain's ability to adapt functional behaviors) (Abrous et al., 2021). This functional dissociation between these two types of hippocampal neurogenesis is very interesting because it allows us to understand how influences in the neurogenic process at different stages, whether during development or adulthood, can lead to distinct impairments in emotional states and cognitive functions.</p><p>AP2γ transcription factor plays detrimental roles in early mammalian extraembryonic development and organogenesis, being one of the molecular components regulating the number of upper layer neurons during ontogeny and phylogeny in the developing cortex (Pinto et al., 2009). Also, AP2γ expression persists in the adult hippocampus, acting as a promoter of proliferation and neuronal differentiation (Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2017). In this context, we sought to comprehend how defects in the neurogenic process since the early development through constitutive and heterozygous deletion of AP2γ impact function and behavior in specific developmental stages: early postnatal, juvenile phase, and adulthood. Our findings revealed that constitutive and heterozygous AP2γ deletion has a significant impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral dimensions in juvenile and adult mice, without affecting sensory-motor development. We agree with the reviewer that AP2γ deletion impacts neurogenesis earlier in development rather than just adult hippocampal neurogenesis. As so, throughout the manuscript, namely in the Results and Discussion sections, we clearly state this perspective.</p><p>Memory and emotional responses are not distinct ontogenetic processes, but they progress from simple to complex capacities (Abrous et al., 2021). We can hypothesize that AP2γ transcription factor deficiencies can alter the ontogeny of the hippocampal neurogenic process, altering the development of behavior complexity associated with the hippocampus. To address this possibility, we would need to trace the early postnatally born hippocampal neurons, as Marie Lods and colleagues previously performed (Lods et al., 2021), and infer their activity throughout the juvenile phase and adulthood. Moreover, we would need to discriminate how AP2γ transcription factor deficiencies distinctly impair DHN and AHN and their functional outputs. In this study, we observed that at both the juvenile phase and during adulthood hippocampal neurogenesis is reduced, being the transcriptional network underlying this neurogenic process impaired. Furthermore, we noticed that adult AP2γ KO mice showed not only reduced hippocampal neurogenesis but also presented delayed maturation of granular neurons. However, we did not follow the activation/inactivation of these granular neurons throughout different behavioral tests, nor did we analyze how AP2γ transcription factor deficiencies could impact dentate gyrus engrams differently during the juvenile phase and adulthood.</p><p>Nonetheless, as AP2γ KO mice have decreased hippocampal neurogenesis since early development, the basic repertoire of adaptive behaviors might be already compromised, leading to behavioral deficits as early as the juvenile phase. Impairments in early postnatal neurogenesis induced by deficiencies in AP2γ transcription factor contributes to a hypersensitivity towards aversive stimulus, as uncovered by the presence of an anxious-like phenotype, and memory impairments as revealed by the AP2γ KO mice performance in multiple cognitive tests. Moreover, the adult emergence of behavioral flexibility by AHN (Abrous et al., 2021) and the impaired performance of adult AP2γ KO mice in anxious behavior testing, contextual memory, and cognitive behavior flexibility demonstrate the importance of an intact adult hippocampal neurogenic process for such functional outputs.</p><p>Recognizing the reviewer's comments and the fact that some concepts had not yet been fully explored in our work, we further detailed them in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

As expected, freezing behavior prior to conditioning was low, both during the juvenile phase and adulthood.

However, as referred by the reviewer, the generalization and the misplaced recognition of the new context after the conditioning could be a concerning observation. Nonetheless, the difference in the percentage of freezing of WT mice between Context A and B is of relevancy. WT mice demonstrated a lower average percentage of freezing in Context B during the juvenile and adulthood evaluations. These findings show that WT mice do not generalize and instead recognize Context B as new. Both in the juvenile and adult phases, the freezing percentages in context B were still lower than the ones observed in the conditioning contexts and light-cued probes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Ln 201 the subtitle does not reflect the results since not all deficits persist (and some appear).</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern about the subtitle, and we revised it to reflect the observed findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Ln 222 the 2 contexts are not similar.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct.

This was quite surprising since, at the juvenile window of analysis, this was already an established phenotype.</p><p>Memory and emotional responses are not singular ontogenetic processes, but they progress from simple to complex capacities (Abrous et al., 2021). During rodents’ adulthood, it is already well described that animals in normal/healthy conditions can recognize novel objects, locations and discriminate objects in different contexts (Abrous et al., 2021; Ainge and Langston, 2012). Moreover, these abilities emerge early in the juvenile phase (around P17) and reach maturity over adolescence (Ramsaran et al., 2016).</p><p>In the behavior assessment at juvenile period performed in this work, we confirmed that the WT mice were able to recognize the novel object and its displacement. In these ORT tasks, WT animals displayed an average exploration of the displaced and novel object as high as 80%, with AP2γ KO mice showing impaired performance in the novel object recognition. During adulthood, in the novel location task, WT mice showed similar percentages of exploration of the displaced object (~80%). However, in the recognition task, the exploration of the novel object dropped under 60%. Nevertheless, results from the Object-in-context (OIC) tasks and the Contextual Fear Conditioning (CFC) test point out that AP2γ constitutive deletion induced impairments in information contextualization. In OIC, both during the juvenile phase and adulthood, WT mice spent a greater proportion of time exploring the out of context object than the object in the familiar environment, whereas AP2γ KO mice showed no preference for object exploration (Figure 3K and Figure 4J). Moreover, in the CFC behavioral paradigm, juvenile and adult AP2γ KO mice exhibited reduced freezing behavior when exposed to the conditioning context where they have previously received foot shocks (Figure 3O and Figure 4L). These results reinforce the idea that deletion of the AP2γ transcription factor induces contextual memory impairments.</p><p>We understand the reviewers’ point of view, regarding the lack of deficits in this specific novel object exploration task. However, we believe that with the results obtained in the previous round of revisions in the OIC paradigm, as well as with the addition of the CFC evaluation at the juvenile phase, we were able to corroborate our conclusion.

We understand this point of view regarding FST and TST and how the analysis of these paradigms has been shifting in the last years (Gorman‐Sandler and Hollis, 2021; Molendijk and de Kloet, 2019; Molendijk and Kloet, 2021). Thus, throughout the revised manuscript, we changed the term “behavioral despair” to either “adaptive behavior to cope with an inescapable stressor” or “coping behavior”. In some contexts, we had to summarize the suggested terminology for a simpler version. Nevertheless, we always referred that this coping mechanism is related to an inescapable stressor (either the water in the FST or the suspension in the TST).</p><p>References:</p><p>Abrous DN, Koehl M, Lemoine M. 2021.
