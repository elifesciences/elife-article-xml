These cycles involve dramatic but poorly understood mechanisms of dynamic physiological regulation at the level of gene expression. Each cycle, Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) drives periodic arousal from torpor by generating essential heat. We applied digital transcriptome analysis to precisely timed samples to identify molecular pathways that underlie the intense activity cycles of hibernator BAT. A cohort of transcripts increased during torpor, paradoxical because transcription effectively ceases at these low temperatures. We show that this increase occurs not by elevated transcription but rather by enhanced stabilization associated with maintenance and/or extension of long poly(A) tails. Mathematical modeling further supports a temperature-sensitive mechanism to protect a subset of transcripts from ongoing bulk degradation instead of increased transcription. This subset was enriched in a C-rich motif and genes required for BAT activation, suggesting a model and mechanism to prioritize translation of key proteins for thermogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04517.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04517.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04517.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many mammals hibernate to avoid food scarcity and harsh conditions during winter. Hibernation involves entering a state called torpor, which drastically reduces the amount of energy used by the body. During torpor, body temperature also decreases. This is particularly exemplified in ground squirrels, whose body temperature can hover at just above or even below the point of freezing. However, hibernating mammals cannot remain in this state continuously over the months of hibernation but instead cycle between bouts of torpor lasting for 1–3 weeks and brief periods of ‘arousal’ lasting between 12–24 hr, during which their body rapidly warms up.</p><p>The heat required to start warming up the hibernator is generated from a specialized form of fat called brown adipose tissue. Normally, the bursts of metabolic activity that are required to create this heat depend on certain proteins being produced. Making a protein involves ‘translating’ its sequence from template molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which are ‘transcribed’ from the gene that encodes the protein. During the low body temperatures experienced during torpor, both of these processes stop. So how is the hibernator able to quickly and efficiently heat itself up during the arousal periods of hibernation?</p><p>Grabek et al. investigated this by analyzing the relative levels of mRNA in the brown adipose tissue of hibernating 13-lined ground squirrels. Using a special technique to sample and sequence small fragments of mRNA taken from brown adipose tissue, Grabek et al. compiled a profile of the mRNA molecules present at different points in the torpor–arousal cycle and compared this with a similar profile taken from squirrels that were not hibernating.</p><p>From this analysis, Grabek et al. detected that a particular group of mRNA molecules that are required for producing heat increase in abundance during torpor, even though body temperature is low enough to stop gene transcription. This increased abundance does not occur because more of the mRNA molecules are made; instead, the mRNA molecules are modified to become more stable and long lasting. Once the animal warms up during arousal, gene transcription is reactivated and more new mRNA molecules are made.</p><p>Grabek et al. suggest that the key mRNAs required for brown adipose tissue function are selectively stabilized during torpor through a temperature-dependent protective mechanism. These mRNAs are then preferentially translated into proteins during arousal to rapidly and efficiently heat the hibernator. Most other mRNA molecules degrade throughout torpor, and so their numbers decline as replacements are not transcribed until body temperature briefly recovers during arousal. Whether this protective mechanism is also used in other tissues during torpor remains a question for future work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04517.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04517.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic></kwd><kwd>non-shivering thermogenesis</kwd><kwd>biological oscillation</kwd><kwd>digital transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DK095180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Sandra L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000121</institution-id><institution>Division of Mathematical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1121361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diniz Behn</surname><given-names>Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the torpid hibernator, when transcription is inhibited, enhanced stability and polyadenylation explain increased abundance of crucial transcripts required for intense non-shivering thermogenesis during arousal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many mammals hibernate to conserve energy during extended periods of limited resource availability and harsh environmental conditions. As winter approaches in temperate climates, hibernators enter into a state of torpor. Torpor in ground squirrels involves active suppression of physiological processes to 2–5% of basal rates, which allows body temperature to lower to just above ambient, even as ambient temperatures fall to near freezing. This depressed state is not continuous throughout winter, however, instead it lasts for 1–3 weeks until it is punctuated by a spontaneous, rapid re-warming to 37°C; physiological rates during re-warming match or even exceed basal rates. The interbout arousal period is then sustained for 12–24 hr before torpor resumes. Cycles between torpor and arousal result in winter heterothermy or hibernation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Hibernation persists for 5–8 months before emergence in spring and maintenance of more typical mammalian homeostatic physiology throughout the summer period of growth and reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carey et al., 2003</xref>; for review). Although of broad medical interest for their ability to tolerate these extraordinary physiological extremes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dave et al., 2012</xref>), many aspects of the hibernation phenotype remain poorly understood. Some of hibernation's most defining mysteries are the mechanisms that underlie the highly dynamic oscillations of the torpor–arousal cycle.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04517.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The hibernating phenotype as a model for studying BAT metabolic regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting the metabolic suppression and activation cycle of BAT during the highly recruited, winter hibernation phase (blue shading) of the annual cycle.

The need for immediate intense metabolic activation at low temperature is most pronounced in brown adipose tissue (BAT); early re-warming depends exclusively on non-shivering thermogenesis in this organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). Because of the constraints on gene expression during torpor, the rapid burst of metabolic activity that characterizes early re-warming may be particularly challenging for BAT.</p><p>To balance the decreased transcription, mRNA degradation during torpor also must be reduced to maintain cellular integrity and permit function in early arousal. Just as with transcription, low body temperature (i.e., Q10 effects) will slow rates of RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burka, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bremer and Moyes, 2014</xref>), but it is unclear how these two opposing activities will converge after two weeks to determine the steady-state abundance of specific RNAs at the end of a torpor bout. While the general consensus is that the transcriptome is largely stable during torpor (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tessier and Storey (2014)</xref>), this view is based upon results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frerichs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knight et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Williams et al., 2005</xref>) where ongoing degradation is not readily distinguishable from a stable transcriptome because of the sampling and normalization strategies employed. There are few clear examples of transcripts that diminish across a torpor bout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Epperson and Martin, 2002</xref>) and others that appear to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 1999</xref>), largely because few studies provide the necessary temporal resolution to quantify changes across a torpor bout.</p><p>In this study, we interrogate BAT mRNA dynamics in 13-lined ground squirrels across the torpor–arousal cycle and the circannual rhythm of hibernation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We chose BAT because of its unique requirement to function quickly and maximally in the earliest moments of arousal, after spending two weeks at the transcriptionally prohibitive body temperatures of torpor. We used a transcriptional profiling approach developed for non-model organisms, EDGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2011</xref>), on five precisely timed sample groups to capture multiple phases of the torpor–arousal cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and, for comparison, three groups from the non-hibernating, homeothermic portion of the year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 38 EDGE-tag libraries, representing 8 distinct sampling groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), were sequenced, processed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and analyzed for changes associated with hibernation physiology. For each of the libraries, 90.1 ± 2.6% of the sequence reads aligned to ground squirrel genomic (Supplementary file 3A in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabek et al., 2014</xref>) or mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We first clustered the individual sample libraries by tag abundance using Random Forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breiman, 2001</xref>). Three main groups were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>): (1)‘spring’, independent of ambient temperature, spring cold (SpC), and spring warm (SpW); (2) ‘winter warm’: interbout aroused (IBA), entrance (Ent), and summer active (SA); (3) ‘winter cold’: early torpor (ET), late torpor (LT), and early arousal (EAr). Notably, BAT samples harvested from winter animals at warm body temperature clustered separately from those at low body temperature. This separation indicates the transcriptome is dynamic across a torpor bout.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04517.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>EDGE-tag library properties.</title><p>Pie charts of EDGE tags mapped: (<bold>A</bold>) uniquely to 13-lined ground squirrel nuclear (Genome Unique) or mitochondrial (Mito.

While their EDGE-tags appeared to increase during torpor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, left), this increase was not mirrored in total RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, middle-left).

Total RNA for five Class IIA transcripts remained stable among states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, middle-left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, these transcripts increased in the short and long poly(A) fractions during late torpor and particularly early arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>) with concurrent poly(A) tail lengthening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), correlating with their EDGE-tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Total RNA decreased in torpor and early arousal for four transcripts in Class IIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), whereas their polyadenylated fraction remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, middle-right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), resulting in an apparent increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2 fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>) and consistent with the EDGE-tag pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Thus, in contrast to Class I, Class II transcripts are stabilized throughout torpor with maintenance or acquisition of a poly(A) tail. The enhanced stability of this subset relative to all other transcripts apparently leads to their relative increases at low body temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, DIANA Clusters 4–6).</p><p>We next tested whether the observed transcript dynamics in torpor–arousal cycles could impact the corresponding protein by measuring PNPLA2<italic>.</italic> Three PNPLA2 protein isoforms, whose sizes were consistent with those predicted for mouse in UniProt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">UniProt Consortium, 2014</xref>), were detected by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). All appeared to cycle, but only the 48-kD band changed significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), following the dynamics of the transcript with the long poly(A) tail despite no change in overall transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Hence, the dynamics of this PNPLA2 protein isoform appears to be explained by polyadenylation changes in its transcript.</p><p>To investigate how changes in rates of transcription and degradation could affect differential gene expression in torpor, we developed a mathematical model of transcript dynamics across the torpor–arousal cycle. We simulated a population of 50 ‘protected’ transcripts and a bulk population of 1,400 transcripts; these numbers are proportional to the 531 tags that were either increased or stabilized across a bout of torpor (DIANA Clusters 5 and 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) compared to the 14,267 tags in the full dataset. For this simulated population, the abundance of each RNA transcript was governed by a differential equation describing temperature-dependent rates of RNA synthesis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</xref>). To model RNA transcript dynamics across the torpor–arousal cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we introduced a representative 12-day body temperature profile, incorporating temperature-dependence into the rates of RNA synthesis and degradation based on Q10 effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burka, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Breukelen and Martin, 2002</xref>), as described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p>In the 50-transcript subset, we implemented either fixed or temperature-dependent alterations to degradation and synthesis rates to determine the resulting protective effects on normalized transcript abundance following 10 days of torpor. We found that a temperature-dependent mechanism that protected a subset of transcripts relative to bulk RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>) was most consistent with the increased abundances observed experimentally. For a body temperature threshold of 10°C and degradation set to 3% of its rate in the warm animal, the relative abundance of the protected transcripts increased over twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), best reflecting the experimental data. This effect was dose-dependent with the level of protection and was relatively insensitive to thresholds above 10°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Although temperature-independent decreases in degradation rates also led to increases in the relative abundance of protected transcripts, this mechanism required implausible compensatory changes to either steady state RNA abundance or transcription rates in the warm animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Due to the differential Q10 effects on transcription and degradation, increasing transcription rate did not produce relative abundance increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, in agreement with RT-qPCR data, mathematical modeling supports enhanced stabilization of a subset of transcripts via a temperature-dependent protective mechanism; this, rather than increased transcription, leads to the observed increase in their relative abundances at the low body temperature of torpor.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04517.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mathematical modeling dynamics for 1,400 bulk and 50 protected transcripts simulated over the 12-day torpor–arousal cycle.</title><p>A temperature-dependent protective mechanism against degradation is implemented for protected transcripts: for body temperature below 10°C, degradation is set to 3% of its rate in the warm animal.

This choice was validated by taking a random sampling of 3′ UTR sequences in all clusters, which returned enrichment for a motif resembling the polyadenylation signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colgan and Manley, 1997</xref>) when compared to a scrambled background set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>]). To identify motifs unique to the protected RNA subset, the significantly changed transcripts were divided into two groups for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>): (1) the positive set of transcripts that appeared to be stabilized (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, DIANA Cluster 6) or increased in torpor (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, DIANA Clusters 4–5); and (2) the negative set of transcripts that appeared to decrease in torpor (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, DIANA Clusters 1–3). When the positive set was compared to the negative set, EXTREME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quang and Xie, 2014</xref>) identified two significantly enriched C-rich motifs (Motif 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Significantly, DIANA Cluster 5, comprised of the transcripts that most clearly increased in relative abundance from early to late in torpor, contained the greatest percentage of mRNAs with the two motifs (Motif 1: 59.1%; Motif 2: 66.7% of transcripts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). DIANA Cluster 6, comprised of transcripts that remained elevated and stable across a torpor bout, contained a higher proportion of transcripts with Motif 2 (50.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) relative to the other DIANA clusters (8.5–39.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and the control, non-significant transcripts (21.1%, NS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Although the transcripts in DIANA Cluster 4 appeared elevated in early torpor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), their motif enrichment was similar to that of Cluster 3. In contrast to those in Clusters 5 and 6, these transcripts also appeared to largely degrade by late torpor (compare ET to LT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); hence their reduced motif enrichment is consistent with reduced transcript stability across a bout of torpor.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04517.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Motif enrichment in the 3′ ends of protected transcripts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic shows methodology for identifying motifs enriched in the 3′ UTR regions (500-nt) of transcripts increased or stabilized in torpor (positive set; transcripts in DIANA Clusters 4–6) compared to transcripts decreased in torpor (negative set; transcripts in DIANA Clusters 1–3).

Dynamic polyadenylation has been demonstrated to control temporal and spatial regulation of translation in many systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kojima et al., 2012</xref>), including maternal <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte maturation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vasudevan et al. [2006]</xref>). Generally, poly(A) tail elongation causes translational activation, whereas shortening leads to silencing and/or RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weill et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to oocyte maturation, in hibernation, the transcriptional machinery is silenced during the two week period of torpor; therefore, post-transcriptional mechanisms affecting mRNA stability and translation serve in the rapid switch between a hypo- and hyper-metabolic state in BAT. For instance, PNPLA2 catalyzes the first committed step in triacylglycerol hydrolysis, resulting in diacylglycerol and free fatty acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zimmermann et al., 2004</xref>). Its increased translation via poly(A) tail lengthening in early arousal would ensure immediate generation of free fatty acids for thermogenesis, while poly(A) shortening during interbout arousal offers a parsimonious means to silence protein translation and lower free fatty acids as metabolic activity declines. Additionally, dynamic polyadenylation likely controls translation of the other Class IIA transcripts. Although there is currently no evidence for this type of mechanism operating in human BAT, our results suggest a potential therapeutic strategy by which translation of key proteins can be prioritized for recovery from metabolic repression, and more specifically, for rapid activation of thermogenesis in BAT.</p><p>A role for post-transcriptional regulation in hibernation was posited previously, based on poor correlations between mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shao et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we provide evidence for stabilization of a specific, functionally relevant subset of mRNAs during torpor. Moreover, our findings are consistent with reports of mRNA degradation during torpor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Epperson and Martin, 2002</xref>) and with global maintenance of poly(A) tails and their increased length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knight et al., 2000</xref>). These results also provide further explanation to histological observations, as RNP granules containing both ncRNAs and mRNAs are formed during torpor in BAT nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malatesta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malatesta et al., 2011</xref>). The Class II ncRNAs identified in our study are located in nucleoli, suggesting that sequestration into these RNP granules protects a subset of transcripts from the degradation affecting bulk BAT RNA, which is also consistent with the results of our mathematical modeling.</p><p>Our results propose that a mechanism underlying enhanced stabilization of a subset of RNAs involves their binding by one of the poly(C) binding proteins (PCBPs), as we detected their corresponding C-rich motifs in the 3′ regions of the torpor-stabilized mRNAs. Intriguingly, PCBPs are involved in many aspects of post-transcriptional control that are consistent with our observations, including enhanced stability of long-lived mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Makeyev and Liebhaber, 2002</xref>). Further roles include 3′ end-processing and alternative polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ji et al., 2013</xref>), and the addition, maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 1999</xref>), and elongation of poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vishnu et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, these proteins are involved in both translational silencing and enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Makeyev and Liebhaber, 2002</xref>). Although these roles are established for the predominantly studied PCBP1 and PCBP2, these paralogs were not detected in our dataset. Rather, we detected increased expression of <italic>PCBP3</italic> during winter heterothermy, a pattern that would be expected for a role involving enhanced mRNA stabilization and polyadenylation during torpor. Furthermore, <italic>PCBP3's</italic> pattern runs in contrast to most of the other RNA binding proteins detected in this dataset, which, if changed, were largely decreased during winter heterothermy (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, functional annotations for DIANA Clusters 1 and 2).</p><p>In addition to a PCBP, other 3′ UTR binding proteins may be involved in enhancing mRNA stability during torpor. The poly(A) binding protein PABP1 and the TIA-1/R RNA binding proteins were recently shown to localize to discrete sub-nuclear foci during torpor in the livers of 13-lined ground squirrels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tessier et al., 2014</xref>). PABP1 specifically binds to the poly(A) tails of transcripts, influencing their length as well as overall transcript translation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess and Gray, 2010</xref>). Significantly, the PCBPs 1 and 2 functionally interact with PABP1 in order to prevent deadenylation and to maintain mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 1999</xref>). While further research is needed to determine whether the protection identified here extends to other tissues during torpor and to thoroughly examine the role of PCBP3 or its homologs in this protection, our results of enhanced stabilization and polyadenylation for a subset of crucial transcripts suggest a mechanistic link to PABP1 observations in other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knight et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tessier et al., 2014</xref>). Although there are reports of elevated RBM3, a cold-induced RNA binding protein, in several organs including BAT from ground squirrels and bears during hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Williams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fedorov et al., 2011</xref>), we found no evidence for enrichment of RBM3 recognition motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ray et al., 2013</xref>) in our subset of stabilized transcripts.</p><p>More broadly, our study highlights the importance of how transcriptome data is interpreted. While it is generally assumed that changes in steady-state mRNA levels stem from changes in the rate of transcription, varying the rate of degradation also changes steady-state levels; this phenomenon has been observed at both mRNA and protein levels in the cold acclimation of fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sidell, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bremer and Moyes, 2014</xref>). Recently, the balance between mRNA synthesis and degradation rates was examined on a global scale in cultured mammalian cells, demonstrating complex gene-specific effects of transcription, processing, decay, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rabani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, the modeling results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> demonstrate that transcript-specific variability in the rate of degradation may cause a subset of transcripts to increase in relative abundance. These transcripts are degrading, but more slowly than most of the bulk transcripts and therefore exhibit a small increase in relative abundance across the torpor bout. Thus, many of the smaller fold changes observed in gene expression datasets from hibernators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Williams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>) likely reflect intrinsic differences in the stability of specific mRNAs rather than specific mechanisms to regulate their transcription or decay. However, for changes greater than approximately twofold in a substantial number of transcripts, here ∼3.5% of the total, a specific regulatory mechanism appears to be required. Furthermore, particularly large fold changes, as observed here with <italic>RPPH1</italic>, likely reflect the addition or lengthening of poly(A) tails.</p><p>Our data suggest a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) of RNA dynamics in hibernator BAT wherein key RNAs for BAT function are selectively stabilized during torpor while bulk transcripts decline through degradation in the absence of new transcription. Stabilization likely occurs by a temperature-dependent protective mechanism that is in place before body temperature reaches 5°C, such as PCPB3 binding to the 3′ UTRs of protected transcripts, which then leads to their relative increase as torpor progresses. At the end of torpor and onset of arousal, the stabilized mRNA subset with the longest poly(A) tails is translated immediately as BAT temperature becomes permissive. As BAT temperature rises, further polyadenylation of the remaining stabilized RNAs facilitates their translation, transcription resumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osborne et al., 2004</xref>), and, during interbout arousal, transcripts that were previously degraded during torpor are replenished to their baseline levels. This dynamic cycle of transcription, degradation, stabilization, and polyadenylation in BAT leads to translation of the correct transcripts at the correct time with minimal energy expenditure. Specifically: (1) energy intensive translation during early arousal is directed to proteins needed for BAT activation; (2) the cell is not dependent on de novo transcription at the onset of the short bursts of metabolic activity, which could delay thermogenesis and induce stress; (3) inhibition of translation via shortening of poly(A) tails while body temperature is high or begins to decline conserves energy compared to mRNA degradation and subsequent re-synthesis. Thus, given a general suppression of transcription by low body temperature during two-week torpor periods, stabilization and dynamic polyadenylation provide an alternative mechanism to prioritize transcripts for immediate translation when BAT metabolic activity rapidly resumes.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04517.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of BAT RNA dynamics in hibernation.</title><p>Physiological stages of the torpor–arousal cycle are listed inside of the arrows and underneath representative animals.

First, the transcripts were divided by whether they fell into the ‘torpor-increased’ DIANA clusters 4–6 or ‘torpor-decreased’ DIANA clusters 1–3. Each transcript was counted only once; in cases where multiple tags mapped to the same transcript, the most 3′ D.E. tag was used for assignment of the transcript to a particular cluster. Annotation of the 3′ UTRs in the ground-squirrel genome is currently sparse and likely imprecise; thus, for each gene, we conservatively defined the ‘3′ UTR’ to be the 500-nt region immediately 3′ to the stop codon. To identify enriched motifs, we used the motif discovery algorithm EXTREME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quang and Xie, 2014</xref>) with the default settings, except allowing 0 gaps, and with the 500-nt ‘3′ UTR’ sequences from ‘torpor-increased’ transcripts input as the positive set and the 500-nt ‘3′ UTR’ sequences from the ‘torpor-decreased’ transcripts input as the negative set. We considered resulting motifs with E values &lt;1 as significantly enriched in the positive set. The enriched motifs were used as input in the MAST tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey and Gribskov, 1998</xref>) of MEME Suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>), which counted the number of transcripts containing the motif (E-value &lt;10) within each DIANA cluster. As a control, we also counted the number of motif occurrences in the 500-nt ‘3′UTRs’ of 484 non-significant D.E. transcripts (q &gt; 0.97; 500 transcripts were originally chosen but 16 lacked 3′ sequence data, hence 484 transcripts). Finally, to detect motifs enriched in all clusters, 3′ UTR sequences from 20 randomly chosen transcripts in each cluster (120 total) were compared against a scrambled background set in MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</xref>), with the settings set at a maximum width of 8-nt and a search of the given strand only.</p><p>To identify the putative RNA binding proteins that might recognize these motifs, the significantly enriched motifs were uploaded into the TOMTOM motif comparison tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta et al., 2007</xref>) of the MEME Suite. The database against which these motifs were first searched consisted of the RNA binding protein motifs described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ray et al. (2013)</xref>; however, no significant matches were found. We next added the nine C-rich motifs reported and provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ji et al. (2013)</xref> to the RNA binding protein motif database and repeated the search for significantly enriched motifs. The significance values for motif matches were calculated via Pearson correlation coefficient in TOMTOM. All motif logos were generated in TOMTOM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank S Clark, C Henegar, A Hindle, J Spalding, and A Zukowski for help with experiments and useful discussion.

The authors performed RNA-Seq profiling of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in ground squirrels across different periods of the torpor-arousal cycle. Three major observations were made: (1) unsupervised clustering of the samples revealed three main groups—spring, winter warm, and winter cold. Between these three groups, 1638 genes with significant differential steady-state transcript levels were detected. Gene ontology analysis identified processes associated with BAT function in the winter groups; (2) a subset of transcripts in the winter groups reached their highest abundance during early torpor, late torpor, and early arousal despite suppressed transcription rates at low body temperatures. RT-PCR analysis revealed two classes of transcripts during torpor: transcripts were either degraded and not replenished, or they were stabilized by the maintenance or acquisition of a long poly(A) tail; (3) the authors propose a mathematical model to describe the changes in transcription rates and degradation could affect differential gene expression in torpor. A temperature-dependent mechanism was identified that protected a subset of transcripts relative to bulk RNA degradation.</p><p>This study provides novel insight into the transcriptional dynamics of hibernating animals. In particular, how certain transcripts are activated/maintained despite suppressed transcription during low body temperatures is poorly understood. The findings in this study would appeal to those interested in hibernation dynamics, as well as those who study post-transcriptional regulation. While it is known that polyadenylation is important for mRNA stability, localization, and translation, the authors present evidence for the first time that this mechanism is implicated in the torpor-arousal cycle.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript reads very well written with clearly reported observations and results. A significant limitation of the manuscript, as was discussed by the three reviewers, is the lack of experimental data addressing the molecular mechanisms underlying the authors' observations.</p><p>Main comments:</p><p>1) The authors' manuscript would be significantly strengthened if they could provide mechanistic insight into the temperature-dependence of poly(A) tail length. For example, the reviewers wonder whether BAT samples from torpor-arousal cycling animals could be used to assess differential cross-linking/binding of PABP1 and/or RBM3 to transcripts that display polyA length changes, to test the authors' proposal (based on previous observations they have cited) that these factors may be associated with differential transcript stability dynamics. This experiment could potentially be performed using CLIP-Seq, or CLIP-qRT-PCR on selected transcripts, by employing commercial antibodies that bind to conserved epitopes on these proteins (which overall are highly conserved). Related to this, have the authors examined the levels of transcripts from genes that encode factors involved in the control of polyA tail length (i.e. deadenylation or polyadenylation factors) across their RNA-Seq datasets? Such information may lead to mechanistic insight as well.</p><p>2) The authors are requested to provide basic information on polyA site usage in the different samples.

Although the suggested strategy of either CLIP or CLIP-Seq using antibodies to PABP1 or RBM3 might enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism involved, this is often not a trivial undertaking in ground squirrels in terms of identifying useful antibodies. We do not think that evidence for PABP1 binding would be particularly helpful because it is unlikely to provide the specificity needed to explain the selectivity among transcripts that is evident in our data. Before embarking on a potentially difficult search for an appropriate immunoprecipitating RBM3 antibody, we employed a motif-searching bioinformatics approach to see whether RBM3 binding sites were enriched in the protected transcript subset. Although neither of the two (worrisomely unrelated) RBM3 binding sites that have been reported by others are significantly enriched in our population of protected transcripts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>), we believe that the motif searching strategy employed set us on a path that has proven to be extremely fruitful. Specifically, we detected two C-rich motifs that are significantly enriched in the 3’ regions of the stabilized transcripts; these motifs were the only enriched motifs (see figure) and are predicted to be bound by a poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). Significantly, the mRNA expression for one of the PCBP family members, PCBP3, increased during the winter in our dataset, in contrast to most of the other RNA binding proteins that were differentially expressed. We document this motif and its link with PCBP3 in a new Figure in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and now suggest, based on the motif enrichment analysis, that a PCBP paralog, most likely PCBP3, may be mechanistically linked to the observed transcript stability. We believe this analysis adds significant mechanistic insight underlying mRNA stabilization and polyadenylation and paves the way for the next step, which would be to identify the RNAs that are bound by PCBP3 (or its paralogs) at different hibernation timepoints using CLIP-Seq. We would like to argue here, however, that such a next step is well beyond the scope of this study.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Motif comparisons: Left side, RBM3 motifs reported by (top) Liu, Y. et al.

How many sites were detected and how does the rate of detection of polyA site usage relate to the steady-state expression of the corresponding transcripts?</italic></p><p>We hesitate to make any inference regarding poly(A) site usage at this point. If <italic>NlaIII</italic> cut to completion, we at best have identified the 3’ most “CATG” site within each transcript, not the 3’ end itself. Thus, we do not think these tags should be viewed as a conclusive proxy for defining 3’UTR’s and poly(A) site usage. However, we do provide all tag locations within their respective transcripts in the supplementary tables, so that others doing poly(A)-Seq analysis on ground-squirrel transcripts can easily make such comparisons. Our observations of enhanced mRNA stabilization and polyadenylation during torpor were an unanticipated finding from the digital transcriptome data that were collected to identify differentially-expressed genes linked to the phenotypic dynamics of hibernation. Although in the process we have detected what we suspect are alternative polyadenylation sites, focusing on them here would detract from the main findings of this work.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should provide a more basic description (i.e. for the general reader) of how the mathematical model they developed was conceived and how well it reliably models the experimental data.
