cross-linked protein aggregates, leading to cellular toxicity, dysfunction, and death. However, how bacteria protect themselves from damages caused by protein hydroperoxidation is unknown. Here, we show that YjbI, a group II truncated haemoglobin from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, prevents oxidative aggregation of cell-surface proteins by its protein hydroperoxide peroxidase-like activity, which removes hydroperoxide groups from oxidised proteins. Disruption of the <italic>yjbI</italic> gene in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> lowered biofilm water repellence, which associated with the cross-linked aggregation of the biofilm matrix protein TasA. YjbI was localised to the cell surface or the biofilm matrix, and the sensitivity of planktonically grown cells to generators of reactive oxygen species was significantly increased upon <italic>yjbI</italic> disruption, suggesting that YjbI pleiotropically protects labile cell-surface proteins from oxidative damage. YjbI removed hydroperoxide residues from the model oxidised protein substrate bovine serum albumin and biofilm component TasA, preventing oxidative aggregation in vitro. Furthermore, the replacement of Tyr<sup>63</sup> near the haem of YjbI with phenylalanine resulted in the loss of its protein peroxidase-like activity, and the mutant gene failed to rescue biofilm water repellency and resistance to oxidative stress induced by hypochlorous acid in the <italic>yjbI</italic>-deficient strain. These findings provide new insights into the role of truncated haemoglobin and the importance of hydroperoxide removal from proteins in the survival of aerobic bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein hydroperoxide</kwd><kwd>truncated haemoglobin</kwd><kwd>oxidoreductase</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd><kwd><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18K14383</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K15446</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ritsumeikan Global Innovation Research Organization, Ritsumeikan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mihara</surname><given-names>Hisaaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The repair of oxidatively damaged proteins by the newly discovered activity in YjbI is important for the adaptation of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> to oxidative environments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Truncated haemoglobins (trHbs) are small haem proteins found in microbes and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wittenberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boechi et al., 2010</xref>). They belong to the globin superfamily and form a distinct family separated from bacterial flavohemoglobins, <italic>Vitreoscilla</italic> haemoglobin, plant symbiotic and non-symbiotic haemoglobins, and animal haemoglobins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vuletich and Lecomte, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boechi et al., 2010</xref>). The haem group enables trHbs to bind to small biomolecules, such as oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric oxide (NO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wittenberg et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, haem-pocket residues are highly structurally variable, conferring trHbs with diverse roles, such as scavengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ouellet et al., 2002</xref>) or transport carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wittenberg et al., 2002</xref>) of the corresponding small ligands. Such versatility is possibly related to defence mechanisms against the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). trHbs are also implicated in the pathogenicity of some bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pawaria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ascenzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wittenberg et al., 2002</xref>), but the molecular functions of these proteins are unclear.</p><p>The trHb family proteins are further divided into three subfamilies, Groups I (trHbN), II (trHbO), and III (trHbP), with each subfamily having different structural characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bustamante et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wittenberg et al., 2002</xref>). Among these subfamilies, trHbO proteins evolutionarily originated before trHbN and trHbP proteins and are distributed into Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vuletich and Lecomte, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boechi et al., 2010</xref>). A trHbO from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> exhibits inefficient gas-exchange capacity with a very slow release of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ouellet et al., 2003</xref>) and a slower reaction rate with NO than other trHb subfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ouellet et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that trHbOs play additional roles other than transporting these molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Giangiacomo et al., 2005</xref>). In accordance, trHbOs from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ouellet et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>Thermobifida fusca</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Torge et al., 2009</xref>), and <italic>Roseobacter denitrificans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) can exhibit peroxidase activity on hydrogen peroxide in vitro. However, because these bacteria express catalases that scavenge hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manca et al., 1999</xref>), the physiological relevance of the peroxidase activity of trHbOs remains unknown.</p><p>The Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> possesses a trHbO, termed YjbI. YjbI has been heterologously expressed as a recombinant protein in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and the purified protein has been characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choudhary et al., 2005</xref>). It exists as a monomer with a molecular mass of 15.1 kDa and comprises 132 amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choudhary et al., 2005</xref>). The three-dimensional crystal structure of YjbI in the form of the cyano-Met derivative was determined at 2.15 Ã resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Giangiacomo et al., 2005</xref>), revealing intriguing structural features, including a shallow depression on the proximal side of the haem. The binding properties of YjbI to O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boechi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ouellet et al., 2002</xref>), CO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boechi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ouellet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choudhary et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lapini et al., 2012</xref>), and hydrogen sulphide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicoletti et al., 2010</xref> have been extensively studied in vitro. Some have observed that YjbI has a high affinity for O<sub>2</sub> and hydrogen sulphide, and the oxygenated derivative is significantly stable, which may rule out a role of YjbI in O<sub>2</sub> transport/storage. As is common for many haem proteins, an inherent low peroxidase activity of YjbI on hydrogen peroxide has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choudhary et al., 2005</xref>), but this observation remains controversial. The <italic>yjbI</italic> gene is part of the <italic>yjbIH</italic> operon. YjbH is a bacterial adaptor protein required for efficient degradation of the disulphide-stress-activated transcription regulator Spx by the protease ClpXP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Awad et al., 2019</xref>). Although these previous studies have implied a possible link between YjbI and response to oxidative stress, the exact function of YjbI remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we present in vivo and in vitro analyses of the physiological function of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> YjbI. We show <italic>yjbI</italic> is required for the formation of biofilms with water repellence. YjbI was found to suppress the ROS-mediated aggregation of the major biofilm matrix protein TasA and localise to the bacterial cell surface or the biofilm matrix. We show that, besides a role in biofilm maintenance, YjbI functions as an antioxidant protein. Moreover, we observed YjbI exerted a peroxidase-like activity on a protein hydroperoxide substrate. YjbI is proposed to function as an antioxidant protein in protecting cell-surface proteins from ROS-induced aggregation via its protein hydroperoxide peroxidase-like activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>yjbI</italic> is required for normal formation of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> biofilm</title><p>We observed unusual biofilm formation by the <italic>yjbI-</italic>deficient mutant on a solid medium. Specifically, the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 168 wild-type (WT) strain formed architecturally complex colonies with characteristic wrinkles on the MSgg solid medium, whereas the <italic>yjbI-</italic>deficient mutant failed to establish such biofilms; instead, it formed flat and glossy colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Because of the water-repellent properties of the mature biofilm surfaces, the functional integrity of a biofilm can be inferred from the contact angle of a water droplet placed on top of the biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaouteli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnaouteli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kobayashi and Iwano, 2012</xref>). Through this method, we examined the integrity of the biofilms of the <italic>yjbI-</italic>deficient mutant. Water droplets placed on the surfaces of the WT biofilms assumed nearly spherical shapes with a contact angle of 116Â±4.12Â°, indicating the remarkable surface repellence of the WT biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast to the WT strain, the water droplets on the surfaces of <italic>yjbI-</italic>deficient mutant biofilms had a contact angle of 30Â±1.55Â°, indicating a significant loss of surface repellence in the deficient mutant biofilms. Similarly, the <italic>tasA</italic>-deficient mutant (COTNd), which was a negative control lacking TasA, the main fibrous protein in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diehl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hobley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Romero et al., 2010</xref>), failed to form biofilms with normal wrinkles and water repellence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). When <italic>yjbI</italic> was reintroduced into the <italic>yjbI-</italic>deficient mutant, the ability of the strain to form biofilms with wrinkles and surface repellence was markedly recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

The Fenton reaction produces hydroxyl radicals according to the following equation: Fe<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>â Fe<sup>3+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup> + Â·OH, and was used to induce ROS-mediated protein oxidation. We investigated whether YjbI could prevent this oxidation-induced aggregation and found that adding purified YjbI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) to the mixture significantly suppressed the formation of TasA<sub>28-261</sub>-His aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), consistent with the results of the in vivo experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>.

Because YjbI suppressed TasA aggregation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), it is reasonable to expect that YjbI also localises to the cell surface. To address this hypothesis, the soluble and insoluble fractions of cell lysates from WT and <italic>yjbI-</italic>deficient <italic>B. subtilis</italic> pellicles and the planktonically grown culture supernatants were analysed by western blotting using an anti-YjbI antiserum. YjbI was detected only in the insoluble fraction from the WT pellicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We then examined whether YjbI is exposed on the cell surface. Towards this end, we treated intact <italic>B. subtilis</italic> WT pellicles with a protease cocktail before western blot analysis of the whole cells. The protease treatment almost eliminated the immunoreactive YjbI from the intact <italic>B. subtilis</italic> WT pellicles, suggesting that YjbI is localised to the extracellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Furthermore, we examined whether YjbI could be recognised by anti-YjbI antibodies, which must be cell impermeable. Treatment of the intact WT cells with the anti-YjbI antiserum before cultivation on MSgg medium impaired colony biofilm formation, with a significant loss of surface repellence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), as observed for the <italic>yjbI-</italic>deficient mutant. In contrast, treatment with the control pre-immune serum showed almost no effect.

AAPH was chosen as the radical initiator because it gently generates free radicals under neutral pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gebicki and Gebicki, 1993</xref>) and is suitable for a long-term cultivation experiment. We observed no significant difference between the WT strain and <italic>tasA</italic>-deficient mutant in the sensitivity to AAPH, indicating that TasA plays no apparent role in the protection of the planktonically grown cells from oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>yjbI-</italic>deficient mutant showed hypersensitivity to AAPH compared with the WT and <italic>tasA</italic>-deficient mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). This result shows that the hypersensitivity of the <italic>yjbI-</italic>deficient mutant to AAPH is not because of TasA impairment in this mutant but presumably because YjbI is involved in a general cellular protection against AAPH-induced oxidative stress, at least during the planktonic growth.

Protein cross-links are formed via radical reactions and the Michael additions after the generation of protein hydroperoxides (half-life: ~4 hr at 37Â°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies, 2016</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gieseg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Therefore, we examined in vitro whether YjbI could prevent the ROS-mediated aggregation of bovine serum albumin (BSA), which has been a model protein in studies of protein hydroperoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gebicki and Gebicki, 1993</xref>). A hydroperoxidised BSA (BSA-OOH) was prepared using the Fenton reaction followed by removal of excess hydrogen peroxide and unstable radicals via cold acetone precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gieseg et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequent incubation of BSA-OOH in the absence of YjbI promoted the spontaneous self-crosslinking of BSA to yield BSA aggregates and a concomitant fragmentation via nonspecific free radical chain reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In contrast, the addition of YjbI to the subsequent incubation of BSA-OOH markedly suppressed the BSA-OOH aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). An identical result was obtained for BSA-OOH prepared using AAPH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The protective function against oxidative BSA aggregation/fragmentation was specific to YjbI, because two typical haem proteins, haemoglobin and myoglobin, showed no protective effects, but promoted the oxidative BSA aggregation/fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The effects of haemoglobin and myoglobin are consistent with a previous observation that coexistence of a haem group and an oxidant generally accelerates radical reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Svistunenko, 2005</xref>). Time course analysis further demonstrated the rapid and significant elimination of the hydroperoxide groups from BSA-OOH by YjbI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). To provide direct experimental evidence of the proposed link between TasA and Yjbl, we purified mature TasA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and prepared TasA-OOH using the same procedure as for BSA-OOH. The addition of YjbI to TasA-OOH significantly decreased its hydroperoxide groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>), as observed in BSA-OOH. Taken together, these results suggest that YjbI prevents protein aggregation/fragmentation, most likely through its haem-mediated protein hydroperoxide peroxidase-like activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>YjbI exhibits protein hydroperoxide peroxidase activity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic drawing summarising the proposed protein cross-linking and fragmentation induced by protein radicals derived from protein hydroperoxides and prevention of these reactions by the protein hydroperoxide peroxidase activity of YjbI. The solid and dashed arrows indicate the already known reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies, 2016</xref>) occurring at protein side chains and backbones, respectively. Protein cross-linking proceeds via spontaneous radical coupling (red arrows), and the Michael addition occurs at protein side chains (yellow arrow). YjbI catalyses the protein hydroperoxide peroxidase reaction (blue arrow) to convert protein hydroperoxides (ROOH) to hydroxy groups (ROH) at protein side chains and prevents further protein cross-linking and fragmentation. Side chain alkoxyl radicals (ROÂ·) can be formed through one-electron reduction (e.g., homolysis) of ROOH, followed by hydrogen atom abstraction reactions with other protein side chains or backbones (R'H). The carbon-centred radicals (R'Â·) of side chains or backbones lead to protein cross-linking to yield protein aggregates (indicated with solid and dashed red arrows). The side chain or backbone R'Â· also reacts with oxygen to produce protein peroxy radicals (R'OOÂ·) under aerobic conditions. The side chain R'OOÂ· reacts with the side chains or backbones of other amino acid residues (RH) in its vicinity to yield protein ROOH moieties. The unstable backbone R'OOÂ· and ROOH moieties cause protein fragmentation.

Our results suggest that YjbI prevents the ROS-induced aggregation of proteins, such as TasA, localised on the cell surface of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. We also showed that YjbI may possess a unique protein hydroperoxide peroxidase-like activity, absent from other haem proteins, such as haemoglobin and myoglobin. Oxidative protein aggregation and protein carbonyls derived from protein radicals and hydroperoxides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies, 2016</xref> have emerged as important biomarkers of various cellular defects caused by oxidative stress not only in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Korovila et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heinecke et al., 1993</xref>) but also in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ling et al., 2012</xref>). Peroxiredoxins have been reported to repair intracellular protein peroxidation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peskin et al., 2010</xref>). However, YjbI is distinct from peroxiredoxins in that it is a haem protein with no significant sequence homology (&lt;15%). The second-order rate constants (M<sup>â1</sup>Â·s <sup>-1</sup>) for the reactions of mammalian peroxiredoxins 2 and 3 with BSA-OOH are 160 and 360, respectively, and have been shown to reduce protein hydroperoxides more efficiently than GSH under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peskin et al., 2010</xref>). Although direct comparison is difficult due to different experimental conditions, YjbI and peroxiredoxins are likely to have a similar catalytic rate, as both proteins can reduce BSA-OOH in the order of several Î¼M in roughly 5 min at similar protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peskin et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, selenomethionine can catalyse the removal of hydroperoxides from proteins in the presence of GSH or a thioredoxin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suryo Rahmanto and Davies, 2011</xref>). However, this system, as well as peroxiredoxins, localises in the cytoplasm of cells, which is a significant difference between YjbI and these proteins. Moreover, whether bacteria utilise peroxiredoxins and the selenomethionine system to remove hydroperoxides from proteins remains unclear.</p><p>Most studies on biofilm formation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> use the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> NCBI3610 strain as a model bacterium because of its ability to form well-structured three-dimensional biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaouteli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mielich-SÃ¼ss and Lopez, 2014</xref>). The biofilms of the WT and <italic>tasA</italic> mutant strains of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 168 strain are known to be morphologically different from those of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> NCBI3610 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Romero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vlamakis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erskine et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 168 strain was used because it is the most representative of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and serves as a model organism for a wider range of research aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zeigler et al., 2008</xref>) as we were not only interested in evaluating biofilm formation but also in more general aspects of oxidative damage responses in bacteria.</p><p>In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, several cytosolic factors have been known to protect the cells from oxidative damages. The catalase KatA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 1995</xref>) and hydrogen peroxide peroxidase AhpC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broden et al., 2016</xref>) protect the cells from hydrogen-peroxide-induced oxidative damages. OhrA and OhrB contribute to the cellular protection from organic hydroperoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuangthong et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, bacillithiol has been proposed to be involved in superoxide stress and metal homeostasis, but not in hydrogen-peroxide-induced oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fang and Dos Santos, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaballa et al., 2010</xref>). However, much less is known about the mechanism protecting cell-surface proteins from oxidative damages in Gram-positive bacteria. In the Gram-positive <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, surface-exposed proteins with methionine sulfoxide residues are reduced by the membrane-bound methionine sulfoxide reductase MsrAB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saleh et al., 2013</xref>), but the gene of an equivalent membrane-anchored enzyme is absent from the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome. To our best knowledge, YjbI is the first example of an antioxidant protein involved in protecting cell-surface proteins against oxidative aggregation. Antioxidation of cell-surface proteins is important, especially for proteins located and exposed at the air-liquid interface, such as the biofilm surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beloin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ezraty et al., 2017</xref>). Disrupting <italic>yjbI</italic> had a crucial effect on the integrity of the biofilm cell surface, presumably because of this reason (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> trHbO has an autokinase activity and plays a role in the survival and adaptation of the bacterium under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hade et al., 2020</xref>). However, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> trHbO shares a moderate (31%) amino acid sequence identity with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> YjbI, and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> carries another trHbN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Couture et al., 1999</xref>), which is missing in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Moreover, because <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is an obligate aerobic bacterium, its responses under oxygen stress may be largely different from those of the member of the facultative anaerobes <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Whether the YjbI orthologues found in other bacteria, including other <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains, function in the suppression of oxidative protein aggregation, biofilm formation, or oxidant resistance remains an open question for future research.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated YjbI reduces hydroperoxide groups in BSA-OOH via its peroxidase-like activity and suppressed the spontaneous aggregation of BSA-OOH. Typical haem peroxidases, such as horseradish peroxidase and lactoperoxidase, exhibit negligible activity on protein hydroperoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morgan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gebicki et al., 2002</xref>). Haemoglobin and myoglobin can react with small peptide-sized hydroperoxides but not with large protein hydroperoxides, such as BSA-OOH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morgan et al., 2004</xref>). The X-ray crystal structure of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> YjbI (PDB ID: 1UX8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Giangiacomo et al., 2005</xref>) shows this protein has a 55 Ã<sup>2</sup> surface opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>), which may allow direct access of bulk solvent and large molecules to the haem active site. Therefore, the structural feature probably confers the potential to react with a protein hydroperoxide on YjbI.</p><p>An electron donor is required for the proposed protein hydroperoxide peroxidase-like reaction by YjbI. We showed that the in vitro reduction of BSA-OOH and TasA-OOH by YjbI proceeded without addition of any external electron donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This observation implies that electrons needed for the in vitro protein hydroperoxide peroxidase-like reaction may be provided from the amino acid residues of YjbI itself. Interestingly, in the hydrogen peroxide peroxidase reaction catalysed by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> trHbO, the tyrosine residues near the haem of trHbO have been suggested to serve as electron donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ouellet et al., 2007</xref>). At least two of these tyrosine residues are conserved in trHbO orthologues (Tyr<sup>25</sup> and Tyr<sup>63</sup> in YjbI), which are located close to the haem according to the results of the crystal structure analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Giangiacomo et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, tryptophan, another electron-rich amino acid residue, is thought to contribute to electron transfer in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> trHbO orthologue (Trp<sup>89</sup> in YjbI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ouellet et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, tyrosine can be stabilised by providing electrons to yield either dityrosine or a series of oxidised derivatives of dityrosine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), DOPA semiquinone, and DOPA quinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maskos et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Giulivi and Davies, 2001</xref>). In fact, as shown in this study, the mutation in Tyr<sup>63</sup> affected the phenotype of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) and the activity of YjbI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Taken together, we propose that the tyrosine residues in YjbI are the most promising candidates for donating electrons for the in vitro YjbI<italic>-</italic>catalysed protein hydroperoxide peroxidase-like reaction. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether YjbI utilises an endogenous or exogenous electron donor other than the amino acid residues of YjbI itself in vivo. Previous reports have shown that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> trHbO can receive electrons from ferrocytochrome <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ouellet et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, YjbH, a DsbA-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guddat et al., 1998</xref>) with two active-site cysteine residues, may have a potential to donate electrons for the YjbI<italic>-</italic>catalysed reduction of protein hydroperoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fabianek et al., 2000</xref>). However, the role of YjbH as an electron donor to YjbI is inconclusive because disrupting <italic>yjbH</italic> did not affect the sensitivity to AAPH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), and YjbH localises to the cytosol, unlike YjbI, to function as an effector of Spx, a central regulator of stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larsson et al., 2007</xref>). It is also possible that physiological electron donation is operated by more than one molecule, as typical haem proteins can utilise a variety of electron-rich small or large molecules as electron donors because of their wide substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Galaris et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hayashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ouellet et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The localisation of YjbI to the cell surface or the biofilm matrix is consistent with its role in protecting TasA and other cell-surface proteins from ROS-induced aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). However, there is no apparent targeting signal sequence in the amino acid sequence of YjbI, and bioinformatic analysis using SignalP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/abstract.php">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/abstract.php</ext-link>) or PSORT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.psort.org">https://www.psort.org</ext-link>) predicted that YjbI is a cytoplasmic protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Purified recombinant YjbI, which was produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, was obtained in a soluble form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), in contrast to the insoluble feature of the native YjbI in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Analogously, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> trHbN belonging to another group of trHb family is also devoid of a targeting signal sequence, is localised to the cell surface following glycosylation, whereas the corresponding recombinant protein expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> is detected in a soluble form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arya et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, no glycosylation site is found on YjbI. Therefore, the mechanism for the translocation of YjbI to the extracellular surface or the biofilm matrix should be investigated in future studies.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>YjbI protects proteins and the cell from reactive oxygen species (ROS) by removing hydroperoxide groups from proteins.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) YjbI repairs the oxidatively damaged TasA-OOH in biofilms.

Biofilm matrix proteins are expected to be exposed to an air-liquid interface, which is a region with a relatively high risk of protein oxidation. Therefore, repairing the oxidatively damaged proteins on the cell surface may be important for bacterial adaptation in oxidative environments. The loss of biofilm integrity associated with the irreversible aggregation of the biofilm matrix protein TasA in the <italic>yjbI-</italic>deficient strain may provide an important clue to further understand the significance of protein hydroperoxide generation on the cell surface.</p><p>The findings of this study may lead to future applications. An increasing number of studies have suggested that biofilms are associated with bacterial infections in humans and with natural resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hall and Mah, 2017</xref>). We found that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> biofilm formation can be suppressed by an antiserum against YjbI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) and that YjbI deficiency severely impairs the bacterial tolerance to the oxidative stress induced by AAPH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) or HClO (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). HClO oxidises various amino acid residues such as methionine and lysine. In addition, the reaction of HClO with O<sub>2</sub> helps to form hydroxy radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Candeias et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Candeias et al., 1994</xref>), which initiates protein peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stadtman and Levine, 2003</xref>). Intriguingly, leukocytes employ ROS, including peroxides and HClO, in the respiratory burst during the innate immune response to bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Babior, 1984</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew Cabeen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Provide a direct experimental evidence for the proposed link between TasA and Yjbl (for example with titration NMR studies suggested by referee 1 point 4).</p><p>(2) Provide further evidence for the connection between the peroxidase activity of Yibl and its mutant phenotype in the biofilm (for example developing the mutant strain suggested by referee 2).</p><p>(3) Measure stiffness using the AFM in Force mode (referee 1 point 2) or head to head high resolution AFM comparison (referee 2 point 2).</p><p>(4) discuss why the WT and tasA colonies are more flat than in the reference paper, or why this point is not relevant for this study.</p><p>(5) Provide evidence or remove the connection between cross linking and lack of monomeric TasA in the mutant (referee 1 point 3).</p><p>(6) Clarify why you expect stiffness and wettability to be connected (in referee 2 point 2).</p><p>Please also consider all other points raised in the reviews and address them as you see fit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The term 'disruptant' is rather unclear. I suggest to use 'mutant' instead.</p><p>2. I am not quite sure that the term 'elusive' is appropriate where it was used.</p><p>3. Figure 2. Quality of the gel is low.</p><p>4. Fenton reaction is mentioned in passing in the text. I suggest to elaborate in a sentence or two on what it is and how it is relevant to the study, for better understanding of its relevance by a general audience reader.</p><p>5. I suggest to move figure S2 to the main text in order to explain the mechanism better.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are a few places where the results seem overinterpreted or are insufficiently explained. The claim (l. 331) that YjbI may be crucial for bacterial survival is not supported, as mutants have no growth defect except under &gt;25mM AAPH treatment. The claim that YjbI has &quot;biologically unprecedented&quot; protein hydroperoxide peroxidase activity warrants more explanation. Is this new for a haem protein, or new for any enzyme? Is YjbI markedly better than other molecules like selenomethonine or enzymes like peroxiredoxins at removing protein hydroperoxides? More explanation would help the reader appreciate the novelty and importance of this finding.</p><p>Another way to strengthen this work is to broaden its applicability. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is an excellent model organism for studying biofilm formation, but many other biofilm-forming bacterial species use different matrix components that do not include amyloid-like proteins. Showing biofilm or survival phenotypes in a few other species (and in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in other conditions) when a YjbI homolog is inactivated would be evidence that such peroxidase activity is generally important and not a niche phenomenon in this one species under biofilm-forming conditions.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Group II truncated haemoglobin YjbI prevents reactive oxygen species-induced protein aggregation in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Carlos Isales (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Please consider the recommendations of the reviewers either by editing the text or by performing the experiments suggested. Note that we will accept the manuscript even without additional experiments. However, we believe some of the experiments suggested should be relatively straightforward and strengthen considerably the results.</p><p>In particular, we strongly encourage you to perform HOCl sensitivity tests and/or AAPH growth curves with the three new mutants, i.e. point (1) of Reviewer #2. If you have expertise on point (2) of Reviewer #2 please consider doing these experiments, or alternatively comment on the issue.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have answered all my questions and addressed my concerns. This manuscript is now greatly improved!</p><p>One note: Please change gram-positive to Gram-positive throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This revised manuscript by Imai et al. describes the role of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> truncated Hb protein YjbI in reversing protein hydroperoxidation, hence reducing protein aggregation and abetting normal biofilm formation. YjbI also appears to generally protect cells from ROS even in planktonic growth, and Y63F substitution in the protein abrogates both its in vitro ability to reverse protein hydroperoxidation and its role in normal biofilm wettability. The authors deserve applause for their careful responses and additional experimentation to successfully address reviewer concerns about the original manuscript. The revised manuscript is stronger in its link between physiological phenotypes (biofilm formation, ROS sensitivity) and YjbI activity and reads well. I hesitate to suggest additional experimentation, but a few quite simple experiments could further strengthen the conclusions of the paper and/or broaden its significance.</p><p>(1) The correspondence between the increased wettability of the Y63F (but not Y25F or W89F) mutant (Figure 1b) and its inability to remove hydroperoxide groups from BSA (Figure 3g) is good. The link between protein sequence and phenotype would be even stronger if the other point mutants were tested for activity. An easier assay than the hydroperoxidation assay would simply be to examine HOCl sensitivity, as the discrepancy between WT and the yjbI mutant is large. Does only the Y63F, but not the other point mutants, show HOCl sensitivity? AAPH growth curves would also serve the same purpose.</p><p>(2) Is there a reason to think that YjbI is somehow tethered to the cell surface rather than simply secreted? The manuscript text seems to suggest that it is surface localized, but none of the experiments formally show the localization. Either the wording should be modified, or a test for localization should be performed. One relatively straightforward test would be immunofluorescence microscopy of whole cells, grown planktonically or in a pellicle, using their anti-YjbI Ab as the primary and then a fluorescent secondary Ab. Is the fluorescence localized to the cell surface or to the biofilm matrix (e.g., to TasA)?</p><p>(3) The significance of the paper would be considerably broadened with at least one other example of YjbI importance or function in another species or even in another strain. The authors state in their rebuttal letter that such studies are underway and will be reported separately. I am sensitive to that argument, especially as some of the other teHbO-encoding species might be difficult to manipulate genetically. But what about moving the yjbI::erm mutation into strain 3610 via phage transduction, which would be trivial? Does the mutation have an even more severe effect in a robust biofilm-former, or does the relatively low biofilm-forming ability of 168 sensitize it to loss of YjbI activity?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70467.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Provide a direct experimental evidence for the proposed link between TasA and Yjbl (for example with titration NMR studies suggested by referee 1 point 4).</p></disp-quote><p>To provide direct evidence of the link between TasA and YjbI, hydroperoxidised TasA (TasA-OOH) was prepared using purified mature TasA and incubated with YjbI to examine the elimination of TasA-OOH by YjbI in vitro.

Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we measured the stiffness of the cell surfaces of the WT and yjbI disruptant. The cell surface of the WT bacteria from pellicles was stiffer than the surrounding matrix, as indicated in the AFM phase images by the relatively lower brightness of the cell surface (Figure 1a).

The second-order rate constants (M<sup>-1</sup>Â·s <sup>-1</sup>) for the reactions of mammalian peroxiredoxins 2 and 3 with BSA-OOH are 160 and 360, respectively, and have been shown to reduce protein peroxides more efficiently than GSH under physiological conditions (Peskin et al., 2010). Although direct comparison is difficult due to different experimental conditions, YjbI and peroxiredoxins are likely to have a similar catalytic rate, as both proteins can reduce BSA-OOH in the order of several mM in roughly 5 min at similar protein concentrations (Figure 3e) (Peskin et al., 2010). Interestingly, selenomethionine can catalyze the removal of hydroperoxides from proteins in the presence of GSH or a thioredoxin system (Rahmanto and Davies, 2011). However, this system, as well as peroxiredoxins, localises in the cytoplasm of cells, which is a significant difference between YjbI and these proteins.

YjbI also appears to generally protect cells from ROS even in planktonic growth, and Y63F substitution in the protein abrogates both its in vitro ability to reverse protein hydroperoxidation and its role in normal biofilm wettability. The authors deserve applause for their careful responses and additional experimentation to successfully address reviewer concerns about the original manuscript. The revised manuscript is stronger in its link between physiological phenotypes (biofilm formation, ROS sensitivity) and YjbI activity and reads well. I hesitate to suggest additional experimentation, but a few quite simple experiments could further strengthen the conclusions of the paper and/or broaden its significance.</p><p>(1) The correspondence between the increased wettability of the Y63F (but not Y25F or W89F) mutant (Figure 1b) and its inability to remove hydroperoxide groups from BSA (Figure 3g) is good. The link between protein sequence and phenotype would be even stronger if the other point mutants were tested for activity. An easier assay than the hydroperoxidation assay would simply be to examine HOCl sensitivity, as the discrepancy between WT and the yjbI mutant is large. Does only the Y63F, but not the other point mutants, show HOCl sensitivity? AAPH growth curves would also serve the same purpose.</p></disp-quote><p>Following your advice, HClO sensitivity experiments were carried out using the complementary strains of each yjbI mutant (Y25F, Y63F, or W89F). The results are shown in the revised Table 2, where the HClO resistance was partially restored in the yjbI(WT)complementary strain (yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>WT</sup>). The results suggest that antioxidant capacity may be restored by complemented yjbI(WT) to the extent that the biofilm in Figure 1b is maintained. Although the complemented strain was not completely rescued in HClO sensitivity as much as obtained for the parent strain, most probably due to differences in the timing and amount of yjbI expression and/or a non-specific effect by forced recombinant expression. The yjbI/yjbI<sup>W89F</sup> strain showed sensitivity to the same extent as the yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>WT</sup> strain. In contrast, both yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>Y25F</sup> and yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjb<sup>Y63F</sup> strains did not recover HClO resistance, which was identical to that of the yjbI-deficient mutant. The apparent discrepancy between the biofilm water repellence and the HClO sensitivity of yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>Y25F</sup> strain may be due to differences in the experimental conditions, such as the levels of oxidative stress and the type of growth (biofilm or planktonic). To explain these observations, we have added the following text to the revised manuscript (lines 230â240):</p><p>âFurthermore, HClO resistance was partially restored by the introduction of a plasmid-encoded wildtype yjbI gene (yjbI<sup>WT</sup>) into the yjbI-deficient strain (Table 2). Among the mutant strains complemented with the yjbI derivatives, yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>W89F</sup> strain recovered its HClO resistance to the same extent as the yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>WT</sup>, whereas both yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>Y25F</sup> and yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>Y63F</sup> mutants showed high sensitivity to HClO, similar to the yjbI-deficient mutant. The apparent discrepancy between the biofilm water repellence and the HClO sensitivity of yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>Y25F</sup> may be due to differences in experimental conditions, such as the levels of oxidative stress and the type of growth (biofilms or planktonic). To determine whether the significant phenotypic changes observed for yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>Y63F</sup> relate to the protein hydroperoxide peroxidase-like activity of YjbI, we purified the Y63F derivative (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1) and evaluated its ability to remove the hydroperoxide groups in BSA-OOH.â</p><p>In this connection, the following texts have been added to the Methods section of the revised manuscript in lines 148-149 and 515-517:</p><p>âand the planktonically grown culture supernatantsâ.</p><p>âTetracycline was not added to the pre-culture and evaluation solid media in the yjbI<sup>-</sup>/yjbI<sup>WT</sup> and pointmutated strains to ensure that tetracycline did not cause oxidative damage synergistically with HClO.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Is there a reason to think that YjbI is somehow tethered to the cell surface rather than simply secreted? The manuscript text seems to suggest that it is surface localized, but none of the experiments formally show the localization. Either the wording should be modified, or a test for localization should be performed. One relatively straightforward test would be immunofluorescence microscopy of whole cells, grown planktonically or in a pellicle, using their anti-YjbI Ab as the primary and then a fluorescent secondary Ab. Is the fluorescence localized to the cell surface or to the biofilm matrix (e.g., to TasA)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed your advice and modified the text in lines 25-26, 87, 144, and 161â162:</p><p>âor the biofilm matrixâ.</p><p>âor the biofilm matrixâ.</p><p>âYjbI localises to the cell surface or the biofilm matrix of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>â.</p><p>âTaken together, these results suggest that YjbI localises to the cell surface or the biofilm matrix of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The significance of the paper would be considerably broadened with at least one other example of YjbI importance or function in another species or even in another strain. The authors state in their rebuttal letter that such studies are underway and will be reported separately. I am sensitive to that argument, especially as some of the other teHbO-encoding species might be difficult to manipulate genetically. But what about moving the yjbI::erm mutation into strain 3610 via phage transduction, which would be trivial? Does the mutation have an even more severe effect in a robust biofilm-former, or does the relatively low biofilm-forming ability of 168 sensitize it to loss of YjbI activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the suggested experiments will broaden the significance of this study.

To include this aspect, we have added the following text to the revised manuscript (lines 311â314):</p><p>âWhether the YjbI orthologues found in other bacteria, including other <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains, function in the suppression of oxidative protein aggregation, biofilm formation, or oxidant resistance remains an open question for future research.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
