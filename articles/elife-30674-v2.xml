Here, we show that genetic inactivation of a single DDM1/Lsh family nucleosome remodeler biases methylation toward inter-nucleosomal linker DNA in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and mouse. We find that DDM1 enables methylation of DNA bound to the nucleosome, suggesting that nucleosome-free DNA is the preferred substrate of eukaryotic methyltransferases in vivo. Furthermore, we show that simultaneous mutation of DDM1 and linker histone H1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> reproduces the strong linker-specific methylation patterns of species that diverged from flowering plants and animals over a billion years ago. Our results indicate that in the absence of remodeling, nucleosomes are strong barriers to DNA methyltransferases. Linker-specific methylation can evolve simply by breaking the connection between nucleosome remodeling and DNA methylation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30674.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells add chemical tags to their DNA to regulate which genes are switched on or off at any given time. These tags include methyl groups added to one of the letters of the DNA code called cytosine. Both plants and mammals need cytosine methylation to develop properly. This methylation also keeps sections of foreign DNA that may have invaded the cell in check.</p><p>DNA inside the cell is tightly packed, wrapped around proteins to form spool-like structures called nucleosomes. Between each nucleosome is a short DNA segment called a linker region. The DNA wound into nucleosomes is generally inaccessible to other proteins, such as those that add methyl groups. Yet, in flowering plants and mammals, cytosine methylation occurs in both nucleosomes and in linker regions. It was not clear how DNA could be modified in the restrained setting of nucleosomes.</p><p>Enzymes called nucleosome remodelers can loosen nucleosomes to allow other proteins to reach the DNA. Lyons and Zilberman asked whether cytosine methylation occurs on the nucleosome-bound DNA or if it requires enzymes like these to free the DNA from the constraints of the nucleosome. The experiments involved a plant called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and mouse cells grown in the laboratory. In mutant plants lacking a nucleosome remodeler called DDM1, cytosine methylation occurred in the linker regions but not in the nucleosomes. Mouse cells lacking the mouse version of DDM1 also showed less cytosine methylation in the nucleosomes.</p><p>These results suggest that nucleosomes are barriers to the enzymes that modify DNA. Nucleosome remodeling enzymes like DDM1 can overcome these obstacles to enable cytosine methylation of nucleosome-wrapped DNA.</p><p>These findings imply that cytosine methylation is more easily established and maintained on nucleosome-free DNA. Abnormal patterns of DNA methylation have been linked to medical conditions – such as neurological disorders and cancers – and to plant defects that hamper agriculture. A better understanding of the process may in the future lead to ways to correct problems with cytosine methylation in these different contexts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>DDM1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>55108592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zilberman</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>725746</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zilberman</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HG000047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lyons</surname><given-names>David B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lyons</surname><given-names>David B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nucleosomes and linker histones block eukaryotic cytosine methylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytosine methylation provides a mechanism to heritably alter the genome without permanent modification of the DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Zilberman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2015</xref>). In eukaryotes, Dnmt1 family methyltransferases, called MET1 in plants, rely on selective recognition of hemi-methylated symmetrical CG dinucleotides by an obligate cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). This mechanism semiconservatively propagates methylation patterns following cell division, and – especially in plants – across generations. Plant and animal genomes also contain cytosine methylation outside CG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2015</xref>). In plants, the CMT3 methyltransferase family catalyzes methylation of CNG trinucleotides, conventionally described as CHG (where H is any non-G base) to avoid overlapping CG sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>). The related CMT2 family can methylate cytosines outside CG and CNG contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>), a pattern of specificity referred to as CHH. CMT2 and CMT3 preferentially methylate heterochromatic transposable elements (TEs) and rely on a positive feedback loop with dimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3. Plants also possess an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, in which 24 nucleotide RNA molecules guide DRM methyltransferases (homologs of animal Dnmt3) to initiate DNA methylation in all sequence contexts, and to maintain CHH methylation at relatively euchromatic TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>).</p><p>As implied by the above description of methylation pathways, DNA methylation represses TE transcription and transposition in plants and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>). Methylation also regulates endogenous genes: methylation close to the transcriptional start site can cause gene silencing, whereas methylation of other genic regions can promote or counteract expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones, 2012</xref>). Genetic defects in the methylation machinery lead to human diseases such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baylin and Jones, 2016</xref>) and disruption of methylation patterns during clonal propagation of plants causes developmental defects that hamper agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ong-Abdullah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Springer and Schmitz, 2017</xref>). Faithful propagation of DNA methylation is clearly essential, yet our understanding of the underlying processes is far from complete. In particular, we do not know how DNA methyltransferases contend with nucleosomes, which comprise the basic repeating units of chromatin.</p><p>Nucleosomes consist of about 147 bp of DNA tightly wrapped around an octameric complex of histone proteins, with the major and minor grooves of the double helix alternately facing toward and away from the histones roughly every 10 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Nucleosomes are separated by short stretches of linker DNA, which are variably bound by histone H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raghuram et al., 2009</xref>). Flowering plants and mammals show an overall enrichment of methylation over nucleosomes, suggesting that the nucleosome is the preferred target for DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodavarapu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, a mild but robust 10 bp DNA methylation periodicity in both lineages suggests that methyltransferases directly modify DNA that is wrapped in nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodavarapu et al., 2010</xref>). However, mammalian methyltransferase activity is inhibited by nucleosomes and H1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robertson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takeshima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takeshima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Felle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schrader et al., 2015</xref>), and regions of the human and mouse genomes with reliably positioned nucleosome arrays organized by CTCF binding exhibit preferential methylation of linker DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>). Methylation is also almost completely confined to linker DNA in several diverse species of marine algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>), suggesting that nucleosomes are generally refractory to DNA methylation. The reasons for the apparent discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo methyltransferase preferences, and for the observed interspecies differences, remain unknown.</p><p>Adding to the mystery, plants and mammals depend on the DDM1/Lsh family of Snf2-class nucleosome remodelers – proteins that can alter nucleosomes in various ways – to achieve normal levels of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeddeloh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants with mutations in <italic>DDM1</italic> suffer major methylation losses in all sequence contexts, primarily in heterochromatic TEs, though much smaller losses are also observed in genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeddeloh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Teixeira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). Knockout of mouse Lsh likewise causes major depletion of DNA methylation from repetitive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dennis et al., 2001</xref>), with more variable effects on methylation in genes and other sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Myant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tao et al., 2011</xref>). Genetic inactivation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> histone H1 partially rescues the <italic>ddm1</italic> hypomethylation phenotype, suggesting that DDM1 facilitates methyltransferase access to H1-containing chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>). However, how DDM1 does this is unknown, and the incomplete rescue of DNA methylation in <italic>h1ddm1</italic> compound mutants remains unexplained. More generally, how nucleosome remodelers facilitate methylation in species in which methyltransferases are proposed to act on the nucleosome surface is unclear.</p><p>Here we explore how DNA methylation is regulated by DDM1/Lsh, H1 and nucleosomes. We find that nucleosomes and H1 are barriers to DNA methylation and that DDM1/Lsh remodelers are required for methylation of nucleosomal DNA. At heterochromatic loci with reliably positioned arrays of nucleosomes, methylation in <italic>h1ddm1</italic> plants is strikingly periodic, with nearly wild-type levels in linkers and nearly <italic>ddm1</italic> levels in nucleosomes. Our results indicate that methyltransferases generally require remodeling activity to access nucleosomal DNA. Lack of such remodeling biases methylation toward linker DNA, providing a straightforward explanation for the linker-specific methylation patterns found in diverse eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DDM1 enables CG and non-CG methylation of DNA wrapped in nucleosomes</title><p>To investigate the relationship between nucleosomes and DNA methylation, we deep sequenced unamplified DNA isolated from micrococcal nuclease (MNase)-digested chromatin of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants with inactivating mutations in both canonical linker histone H1 genes (<italic>h1</italic>), <italic>ddm1</italic> mutants, compound <italic>h1ddm1</italic> mutants, and in WT controls.

Nucleosomes, which form much more stable associations with DNA than H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Misteli et al., 2000</xref>), are more powerful obstacles. In WT an <italic>h1</italic> plants, DDM1 activity allows DNA methyltransferases robust access to DNA. In <italic>ddm1</italic> mutants, nucleosomes are inaccessible and H1 blocks linker DNA, but the greater accessibility of linkers allows higher methylation levels at these sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In the absence of DDM1 and H1, linker DNA is accessible to methyltransferases, but nucleosome cores are not, producing the robust methylation periodicity in <italic>h1ddm1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, non-CG methylation shows a pronounced nucleosome core depletion at well-positioned nucleosomes in all genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Thus, whereas DDM1 allows for near-perfect efficiency of nucleosome core CG methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), non-CG methylation of nucleosomal DNA is well below that of linkers even in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).

This idea is supported by the reported ability of H1 to prevent nucleosome remodeling in vitro for some Swi2/Snf2-type remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lusser et al., 2005</xref>) and could explain why heterochromatic nucleosomes – and not just linkers – show higher methylation in <italic>h1</italic> compared to WT, and in <italic>h1ddm1</italic> compared to <italic>ddm1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B–D</xref>).</p><p>The likely involvement of multiple remodelers in euchromatic DNA methylation does not by itself explain the robust enrichment of methylation within exonic nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The origins and biological functions of gene body methylation remain quite mysterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zilberman, 2017</xref>), and therefore any explanation of its features is inherently speculative. Given that introns do not exhibit preferential methylation of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), the pathways that target methylation to genes are unlikely to favor nucleosomes, especially considering that methylation in genes and TEs is catalyzed by the same methyltranferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>). Preferential methylation of nucleosomes within exons may be related to the function of gene body methylation. DNA methylation is known to affect the properties of nucleosomes, such as positioning and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jimenez-Useche et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). If gene body methylation influences splicing, other aspects of RNA processing, or the stability of transcript elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zilberman, 2017</xref>), it may do so in part by altering the properties of exonic nucleosomes. Enrichment of methylation over exonic nucleosomes may therefore be a product of selection. Despite their preferential methylation, genic nucleosomes – at least those experiencing low levels of transcription – are refractory to MET1 methyltransferase activity, as evidenced by their decreased methylation in <italic>ddm1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>The ability of nucleosomes and H1 to block DNA methylation in the absence of remodeling is dramatically illustrated by a set of heterochromatic loci with arrays of positioned nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, linker methylation that is close to or even above WT in <italic>h1ddm1</italic> plants is juxtaposed with severe depletion of nucleosomal methylation. Methylation patterns at these loci closely resemble the natural patterns of several diverse species in which methylation is confined to linker DNA throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). This resemblance is unlikely to be coincidental. Species with linker-specific methylation are interspersed on the tree of life with species that do not limit methylation to linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). This evolutionary history has been difficult to explain, particularly if one assumes that transitions to or from linker-specific methylation require changing the intrinsic ability of DNA methyltransferases to access nucleosomes.</p><p>Our ability to impose an essentially linker-specific methylation pattern on a substantial fraction of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome by inactivating two chromatin proteins provides a plausible solution to this quandary. Species in which linker-specific methylation has been described have well-positioned nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>) and all but one of these species (<italic>Micromonas pusilla</italic>) lack the winged-helix motif of canonical H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinsky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Worden et al., 2009</xref>). A transition to linker-specific methylation in a species with reliably positioned nucleosomes and low or absent linker histones would only require the uncoupling of nucleosome remodeling from DNA methylation maintenance. This could occur through inactivation of the relevant remodeler, or – more likely – by a mutation that severs the spatiotemporal connection between DNA methylation and remodeling. Such a mutation, if sufficiently advantageous, could also be fixed in a species with complex nucleosome positioning and high H1. The linker-specific methylation patterns almost certainly offer a selective advantage to the species that have them, in part by contributing to nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). Thus, loss of H1 could be advantageous in the presence of a linker-specific methylation system, and reliable nucleosome positioning a consequence of such a system. Considering the many independent instances of complete DNA methylation loss among eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zemach and Zilberman, 2010</xref>), fixation of advantageous mutations that separate methylation from remodeling could plausibly occur multiple times during eukaryotic evolution. Such a model would easily explain the diverse methylation patterns observed among eukaryotes by providing the mechanism by which apparently radically different patterns can repeatedly evolve.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Biological materials</title><p><italic>ddm1-10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>h1.1</italic> and <italic>h1.2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>) <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Columbia ecotype) were crossed to generate <italic>h1ddm1</italic> and siblings for this study.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Richard Amasino (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Vincent Colot (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision below to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In the consolidated review below, some parts are directly from the first round of review and a ** was added to those parts when a comment to address was within a paragraph.</p><p>In this manuscript, Lyons and Zilberman examine the implication of the chromatin remodeler DDM1 and canonical histone H1 in the relationship between nucleosomes and DNA methylation in Arabidopsis. In previous work, the Zilberman lab showed that removal of canonical histone H1 leads to an increase in DNA methylation over heterochromatic TEs and a partial rescue of the well-documented loss of DNA methylation seen in ddm1. These observations lead to the conclusion that DDM1 provides DNA methyltransferases (MTases) with access to H1-containing heterochromatin (Zemach et al., Cell 2013).</p><p>Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies using mammalian MTases and de novo DNA methylation assays have indeed established that the nucleosome core is an obstacle to DNA methylation. The authors should cite Felle et al., NAR 2011 as well as Baubec et al., Nature 2015 in their introductory paragraph (Baubec et al. is only cited later, in a different context). In addition, the authors should cite Takeshima et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2008; in this paper it was shown that histone H1 blocks DNA methylation of linker DNA in vitro.</p><p>Lyons and Zilberman used MNase-seq and BS-seq to investigate directly DNA methylation in relation to nucleosome position in h1, ddm1 and h1ddm1 mutant plants as well as in WT controls. Key to their analysis is the definition of four groups of nucleosomes, from well-positioned to poorly-positioned. This distinction enabled the authors to report several new findings, which clarify the role of DDM1 in the maintenance of DNA methylation over H1-enriched nucleosomes.</p><p>1) First, they show that heterochromatic nucleosomes, which are enriched in histone H1, have invariably high average CG methylation across the core and linker in WT controls. This is strong evidence that, in vivo, core and linker DNA are equally accessible to MET1, which is responsible for the maintenance of CG methylation. In marked contrast, average CHG and CHH methylation, which is much lower than average CG methylation, is preferentially located over linker DNA for these same nucleosomes. Thus, the MTases responsible for the perpetuation of this non-CG methylation across cell divisions preferentially access linker DNA in vivo.</p><p>2/3) The second and key set of findings in this manuscript is that at presumably the same (**this is not clear from the text) well-positioned heterochromatic nucleosomes, the increase and decrease in average CG, CHG and CHH methylation observed in h1 and ddm1 mutant plants, is most and least pronounced over linker DNA, respectively. As could then be predicted, the partial rescue of methylation in the double mutant is also more pronounced over linker DNA. These findings are entirely consistent with the inhibitory effect in vitro of histone H1 on linker DNA methylation (Takeshima et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2008) and as noted above Takeshima et al. should be cited in this context. In addition, they suggest that DDM1 facilitates – to varying extents – the access of the different MTases responsible for CG, CHG and CHH methylation: not only to the core, but also to the linker, of H1-enriched, heterochromatic nucleosomes. **However, in the absence of genomic binding data for these MTases in WT and mutant backgrounds, indirect effects cannot be ruled out. This notwithstanding, the authors also used published nucleosome positioning and methylome data to show that loss of Lsh, the mammalian homolog of DDM1, causes a much greater depletion of DNA methylation over nucleosome cores than over linkers in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.</p><p>4) Coming back to Arabidopsis, the authors then show that in contrast to TEs (which comprise most heterochromatic nucleosomes), genes have higher average CG methylation over nucleosome cores than over linker DNA in WT plants. This pattern is evident for exons but not for introns (**an intriguing observation, which would merit being discussed by the authors) and it remains largely unaltered in the three mutant backgrounds, except in the case of lowly expressed genes, perhaps because these genes undergo less transcription-coupled nucleosome displacement (it is not clear though if these genes are not part of TEs). The 10 bp methylation periodicity seen over nucleosome cores in all sequence contexts is also analyzed and results indicate that in the case of heterochromatic nucleosomes, it is dependent on DDM1. Based on this last result, the authors propose a model whereby DDM1 acts by releasing a loop of DNA from the surface of the histone octamer.</p><p>In a last part, the authors show that a subset of heterochromatic nucleosomes that are well-positioned in the h1ddm1 double mutant exhibit the same DNA methylation pattern as seen in marine algae, namely a perfect alternation of low and high methylation over the nucleosome core and linker, respectively.</p><p>In sum, this manuscript reports many new findings that are of broad interest. It adds nicely to the two other comprehensive studies by the Zilberman lab (Zemach et al., Cell 2013; Huff and Zilberman 2014) and to that of Baubec et al. (Nature 2015) indicating that nucleosomes inhibit DNA methylation in vivo. In addition, it provides novel and compelling evidence that the linker histone H1 inhibits DNA methylation in vivo mainly by preventing access to linker DNA, consistent with in vitro data (Takeshima et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2008). Thus, as the authors suggest, the distinct patterns of DNA methylation observed among eukaryotes are likely determined in large part by whether or not a given species has well positioned nucleosomes and possesses the linker histone H1 and/or chromatin remodelers that can provide DNA MTases access to nucleosomes.</p><p>5/6) Overall, the data as well as the analyses presented in the manuscript are solid and comprehensive. **However, most analyses are described too succinctly and it is often difficult to understand what exactly was done (see below for a list of specific points that the authors need to address in addition to those raised in the general comments). Furthermore, the manuscript is difficult to read in places and I would recommend that the authors **subdivide it into three clearly identified sections (Introduction, Results, Discussion) as well as several sub-sections in Results. This division will also help separate what is a fair interpretation of the findings reported in the manuscript, from the more speculative conclusions.</p><p>7) One of the authors' main claims is that mutation of both DDM and Lsh1 bias methylation towards linker DNA. To support, and fully evaluate, this claim the following points should be addressed:</p><p>a) The conclusion from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is that nucleosomes are refractory to DNA methylation without chromatin remodelers. However, it is unclear how the correlations between DNA methylation and nucleosomes were conducted. For panels A and C, either the methylation in all the mutants is shown relative to the nucleosome position in WT plants, in which case potential differences in nucleosome position in the mutants should be accounted for, or the methylation is shown relative the nucleosome positioning in each mutant, in which case the sequence differences in the nucleosome cores vs linker regions should be accounted for. Likewise, for the mammalian data, where the methylation data in the WT and lsh mutants is relative to the nucleosome positions in WT samples, changes in nucleosome positions in the lsh mutant should be accounted for in the analysis. Without such information it remains unclear whether the differences in methylation observed in the mutants are associated with changes in nucleosome positions, DNA sequence biases, and/or changes in the ability of DNA methyltransferases to methylate nucleosomal or linker DNA.</p><p>b) For the lsh mutant, a meta-analysis is presented showing decreases in DNA methylation over well positioned nucleosomes and near WT levels of methylation in the linker regions; thus, methylation is skewed towards linkers. For ddm1/h1ddm1 mutants a similar trend is observed. However, more in-depth analyses should be presented to strengthen the assertion that LSH and DDM1 are acting similarly. For example, is Lsh activity also mainly associated with heterochromatin? Is the methylation periodicity in mammalian cells disrupted in lsh mutants?</p><p>8) Another major point is that DDM1 enables the methylation of nucleosomal DNA by remodeling the chromatin such that DNA methylation actually occurs on a DNA loop and not directly on nucleosome bound DNA.</p><p>Here the authors suppose (without any data) that this loop would still retain a bias in DNA methylation resulting in a periodic pattern matching previous in vivo findings. To test their model, the periodicity of DNA methylation was then assessed in a ddm1 mutant background. However, as this mutant causes global decreases in DNA methylation, disruption of the periodic behavior is hard to assess. Furthermore, the decrease in periodicity could either be because the DNA loops aren't created so methylation is blocked or because DDM1 serves a different function that allows MET1 to directly methylate nucleosomal DNA. Thus, these in vivo experiments remain inconclusive. To support their conclusions, in vitro remodeling assays showing that DDM1 activity creates accessible DNA loops that can be methylated by MET1 would be highly informative, although such assays are clearly not trivial. In the absence of such assays, the authors should note the alternative interpretations noted above.</p><p>9) A final point of the paper is that the decoupling of chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation could explain some of the differences in global methylation patterns observed between species.</p><p>Here the authors find that a subset of well positioned, heterochromatin-localized nucleosomes (cluster C2) have strong linker methylation and low nucleosome methylation in the h1ddm1 background. Based on the similarity of this DNA methylation pattern with those observed in algae, it is proposed that decoupling methylation and remodeling is a mechanism employed to generate such patterns in organisms with well positioned nucleosomes. However, this model is not further vetted. In this case, a phylogenetic analysis correlating the presence or absence of DDM1 or H1 orthologs with linker-specific methylation patterns might provide additional support for the authors claims.</p><p>Although in general we appreciate brevity, some elaboration here would be useful to the reader. Do you think this phenomenon is a result of genetic drift in which in some organisms the loss of one component is not selected against or might it provide some selective advantage? In this section is the sentence: &quot;These species are interspersed on the tree of life with species that do not limit methylation to linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).&quot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> (does this mean <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4 <italic>and</italic> figure supplement 1</xref>?) does not seem to have much relation to the sentence that cites them – i.e., nothing to do with the phylogenetically &quot;interspersed&quot; nature of the phenomenon because both figures are about Arabidopsis.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Main text, first paragraph: Replace Jones and Baylin, 2007 with Baylin and Jones, CSH Persp.

I suspect that it is the latter, but the description in Materials and methods suggests otherwise. How can meaningful comparisons be made if the four groups of nucleosomes differ for each genotype?</p><p>4) The authors could easily complement their analysis of heterochromatic nucleosomes by considering separately those that have CMT2-dependent CHH methylation and those that are targeted by DRM1/2 instead. This additional analysis could also prove very informative.</p><p>5) Main text, fourth paragraph: Make also reference to the Materials and methods section (&quot;Description of Arabidopsis genome features&quot;).</p><p>6) Main text, seventh paragraph: “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>” should be <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>7) Main text, ninth paragraph: Are all genes non TE-genes? And what about TEs? Please provide about how the TE class was defined and how it differs from the heterochromatic nucleosomes analyzed in the first part.</p><p>8) Main text, tenth paragraph: The fact that gene methylation is enriched over nucleosomes and that DDM1 is not required for this type of methylation except in the case of lowly expressed genes suggests that other chromatin remodelers are involved. However, at this stage this is only a hypothesis and the authors should therefore tone down the last sentence of this paragraph.</p><p>9) Materials and methods:</p><p>- Why was the mutant allele ddm1-10 chosen over the much more commonly studied allele ddm1-2, used for instance in Zemach et al., 2013.</p><p>- Which generation was used for ddm1 and h1ddm1? This is important to know as the demethylation of heterochromatic sequences increases with the number of generations.</p><p>- Were DNA, RNA and nucleosomes extracted from the same starting biological material?</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>: I would recommend that the supplement be moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, as it is clear that CHH methylation is also affected in the three mutant backgrounds. I would also recommend for each of the three sequence contexts merging the four graphs, so as to make more apparent the gains and losses of methylation. This is particularly important for CHH methylation, which is low to start with compared to CHG and especially CG methylation and which show modest fluctuations in absolute values. Indicating levels relative to WT could improve visualization further.</p><p>11) The legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> is confusing as a result that figure is difficult to understand. The authors should also show mCHG and mCHH data or else justify why they chose not to show them.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> it is not clear what data is being shown in the right panels.</p><p>12) It is not clear from the methods if the same stage leaf tissue was used for the plant DNA methylation and nucleosome profiling experiments. As these features can vary during development, this point should be clarified.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;DDM1 and Lsh remodelers allow methylation of DNA wrapped in nucleosomes&quot; for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>There are a few minor points to address that the reviewers and I think would make your paper even more clear to the eLife readership.</p><p>1)We suggest a more direct formulation. &quot;DNA methylation at DRM1/2-dependent loci is actually enriched around well-positioned nucleosomes in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). This enrichment is likely caused by the small size of DRM1/2-dependent TEs and hence the high proportion of non-methylated adjacent sequences over these nucleosomes. Consistent with this interpretation, an analysis anchored to the centers of differentially methylated regions (DMRs; see Methods)[…]&quot;</p><p>2) Discussion, fourth paragraph, last sentence: This sentence is ambiguous. Gene body methylation is affected by MET1, with no contribution from the other methyltransferases. The ddm1 mutation affects only a small subset of body methylated genes.</p><p>3) Re the statement in the Abstract &quot;We find that DDM1 enables methylation of DNA bound to the nucleosome, thus demonstrating that nucleosome-free DNA is the preferred substrate of eukaryotic methyltransferases in vivo.&quot; The first half of the statement is well supported, but the data do not demonstrate that nucleosome-free DNA is the preferred substrate. Rather, the data support this hypothesis. It is up to you how to re-phrase, but an example of re-phrasing would be &quot;We find that DDM1 enables methylation of DNA bound to the nucleosome, consistent with a model in which nucleosome-free DNA is the preferred substrate of eukaryotic methyltransferases in vivo.&quot;</p><p>4) In several cases, you draw specifically on the effects of h1 on CG methylation (see quoted text below). However, the effects of h1 on CG methylation are minimal. Indeed, when plotted relative to WT levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the line is flat. However, h1 clearly has effect on nucleosome core methylation levels in the CHG and CHH contexts, and it also enhances the ddm1 mutant. In light of these observations the text should be modified to more accurately reflect the data presented.</p><p>&quot;CG methylation is relatively evenly distributed with respect to nucleosomes in WT plants, and shows a weak nucleosomal depletion in h1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).&quot;</p><p>&quot;Without H1, linker DNA becomes even more accessible, producing the observed slight core-to-linker methylation differential in h1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).”</p><p>5) The text now makes clear that the methylation data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is relative to the specific nucleosome positions in each genotype. The authors also account for possible affects due to differences in the sequences in the nucleosomes and the linkers through their analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. However, to fully evaluate this data, it would be informative to know how many well positioned nucleosomes there are in total and how many are shared between WT and h1ddm1 or between h1 and h1ddm1. In the response to reviewers it is stated that &quot;only a limited subset of WT well-positioned nucleosomes are also well positioned in the mutants.&quot; If this overlap is very small, then it remains unclear if this subset of regions can be used to extrapolate information regarding global effects.</p><p>6) The implications of the following statement are unclear.</p><p>&quot;However, this appearance is almost certainly caused by the small size of DRM1/2-dependent TEs, because an analysis anchored to the centers of differentially methylated regions (DMRs; see Methods) between drm1drm2 mutants and wild-type that occur in regions with very poorly positioned nucleosomes (those outside the four groups defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; see Methods) shows an even sharper peak (plots in the right column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>).&quot;</p><p>7) To avoid confusion the word &quot;can&quot; should be added to this sentence of the Introduction: &quot;Methylation also regulates endogenous genes: methylation close to the transcriptional start site <italic>can</italic> cause gene silencing[…]&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30674.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the consolidated review below, some parts are directly from the first round of review and a ** was added to those parts when a comment to address was within a paragraph.</p><p>In this manuscript, Lyons and Zilberman examine the implication of the chromatin remodeler DDM1 and canonical histone H1 in the relationship between nucleosomes and DNA methylation in Arabidopsis. In previous work, the Zilberman lab showed that removal of canonical histone H1 leads to an increase in DNA methylation over heterochromatic TEs and a partial rescue of the well-documented loss of DNA methylation seen in ddm1. These observations lead to the conclusion that DDM1 provides DNA methyltransferases (MTases) with access to H1-containing heterochromatin (Zemach et al., Cell 2013).</p><p>Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies using mammalian MTases and de novo DNA methylation assays have indeed established that the nucleosome core is an obstacle to DNA methylation. The authors should cite Felle et al., NAR 2011 as well as Baubec et al., Nature 2015 in their introductory paragraph (Baubec et al. is only cited later, in a different context). In addition, the authors should cite Takeshima et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2008; in this paper it was shown that histone H1 blocks DNA methylation of linker DNA in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following sentence to the Introduction section:</p><p>“However, mammalian methyltransferase activity is inhibited by nucleosomes and H1 in vitro (Robertson et al., 2004; Takeshima et al., 2006; Takeshima et al. 2008; Felle et al., 2011; Schrader et al., 2015), and regions of the human and mouse genomes with reliably positioned nucleosome arrays organized by CTCF binding exhibit preferential methylation of linker DNA (Kelly et al., 2012; Baubec et al., 2015).”</p><p>We are reluctant to cite Felle et al. in support of linker-biased methylation in vivo because the in vivo experiments in this paper are deeply flawed. The authors find that larger MNase-digested fragments, which represent multiple nucleosomes and are enriched for linker DNA, are more methylated than shorter mononucleosome fragments. They infer that linkers are more methylated than nucleosomes, but this assumes all genomic sequences are equally accessible to MNase. Instead, the shorter fragments come from more accessible and less methylated euchromatin, explaining the enrichment of methylation on longer fragments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lyons and Zilberman used MNase-seq and BS-seq to investigate directly DNA methylation in relation to nucleosome position in h1, ddm1 and h1ddm1 mutant plants as well as in WT controls. Key to their analysis is the definition of four groups of nucleosomes, from well-positioned to poorly-positioned. This distinction enabled the authors to report several new findings, which clarify the role of DDM1 in the maintenance of DNA methylation over H1-enriched nucleosomes.</p><p>1) First, they show that heterochromatic nucleosomes, which are enriched in histone H1, have invariably high average CG methylation across the core and linker in WT controls. This is strong evidence that, in vivo, core and linker DNA are equally accessible to MET1, which is responsible for the maintenance of CG methylation. In marked contrast, average CHG and CHH methylation, which is much lower than average CG methylation, is preferentially located over linker DNA for these same nucleosomes. Thus, the MTases responsible for the perpetuation of this non-CG methylation across cell divisions preferentially access linker DNA in vivo.</p><p>2/3) The second and key set of findings in this manuscript is that at presumably the same (**this is not clear from the text) well-positioned heterochromatic nucleosomes, the increase and decrease in average CG, CHG and CHH methylation observed in h1 and ddm1 mutant plants, is most and least pronounced over linker DNA, respectively. As could then be predicted, the partial rescue of methylation in the double mutant is also more pronounced over linker DNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the differences between nucleosome sets and added a detailed explanation regarding why we used nucleosomes defined separately for each genotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We have also added supplemental data to illustrate that our conclusions do not change when analyzing sets of well-positioned nucleosomes shared by different genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; see point 7a below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These findings are entirely consistent with the inhibitory effect in vitro of histone H1 on linker DNA methylation (Takeshima et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2008) and as noted above Takeshima et al. should be cited in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a citation to Takeshima et al. (2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, they suggest that DDM1 facilitates – to varying extents – the access of the different MTases responsible for CG, CHG and CHH methylation: not only to the core, but also to the linker, of H1-enriched, heterochromatic nucleosomes. **However, in the absence of genomic binding data for these MTases in WT and mutant backgrounds, indirect effects cannot be ruled out.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following comment to the beginning of our Discussion section:</p><p>“It remains formally possible that DDM1/Lsh remodelers permit methyltransferases to work directly on the nucleosome surface or promote catalysis without affecting methyltransferase access.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This notwithstanding, the authors also used published nucleosome positioning and methylome data to show that loss of Lsh, the mammalian homolog of DDM1, causes a much greater depletion of DNA methylation over nucleosome cores than over linkers in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.</p><p>4) Coming back to Arabidopsis, the authors then show that in contrast to TEs (which comprise most heterochromatic nucleosomes), genes have higher average CG methylation over nucleosome cores than over linker DNA in WT plants. This pattern is evident for exons but not for introns (**an intriguing observation, which would merit being discussed by the authors) and it remains largely unaltered in the three mutant backgrounds, except in the case of lowly expressed genes, perhaps because these genes undergo less transcription-coupled nucleosome displacement (it is not clear though if these genes are not part of TEs).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to the Discussion regarding gene body methylation and exon vs. intron DNA methylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The 10 bp methylation periodicity seen over nucleosome cores in all sequence contexts is also analyzed and results indicate that in the case of heterochromatic nucleosomes, it is dependent on DDM1. Based on this last result, the authors propose a model whereby DDM1 acts by releasing a loop of DNA from the surface of the histone octamer.</p><p>In a last part, the authors show that a subset of heterochromatic nucleosomes that are well-positioned in the h1ddm1 double mutant exhibit the same DNA methylation pattern as seen in marine algae, namely a perfect alternation of low and high methylation over the nucleosome core and linker, respectively.</p><p>In sum, this manuscript reports many new findings that are of broad interest. It adds nicely to the two other comprehensive studies by the Zilberman lab (Zemach et al., Cell 2013; Huff &amp; Zilberman 2014) and to that of Baubec et al. (Nature 2015) indicating that nucleosomes inhibit DNA methylation in vivo. In addition, it provides novel and compelling evidence that the linker histone H1 inhibits DNA methylation in vivo mainly by preventing access to linker DNA, consistent with in vitro data (Takeshima et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2008). Thus, as the authors suggest, the distinct patterns of DNA methylation observed among eukaryotes are likely determined in large part by whether or not a given species has well positioned nucleosomes and possesses the linker histone H1 and/or chromatin remodelers that can provide DNA MTases access to nucleosomes.</p><p>5/6) Overall, the data as well as the analyses presented in the manuscript are solid and comprehensive. **However, most analyses are described too succinctly and it is often difficult to understand what exactly was done (see below for a list of specific points that the authors need to address in addition to those raised in the general comments). Furthermore, the manuscript is difficult to read in places and I would recommend that the authors **subdivide it into three clearly identified sections (Introduction, Results, Discussion) as well as several sub-sections in Results. This division will also help separate what is a fair interpretation of the findings reported in the manuscript, from the more speculative conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized the paper into separate Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections. We also added Results subsections and moved more speculative elements of our interpretation of data to the Discussion. We have expanded the explanations of our methods as well as the results, and much of the interpretation of the results has been expanded in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) One of the authors' main claims is that mutation of both DDM and Lsh1 bias methylation towards linker DNA. To support, and fully evaluate, this claim the following points should be addressed:</p><p>a) The conclusion from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is that nucleosomes are refractory to DNA methylation without chromatin remodelers. However, it is unclear how the correlations between DNA methylation and nucleosomes were conducted.

Likewise, for the mammalian data, where the methylation data in the WT and lsh mutants is relative to the nucleosome positions in WT samples, changes in nucleosome positions in the lsh mutant should be accounted for in the analysis. Without such information it remains unclear whether the differences in methylation observed in the mutants are associated with changes in nucleosome positions, DNA sequence biases, and/or changes in the ability of DNA methyltransferases to methylate nucleosomal or linker DNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added supplemental figures and explanatory text in the results to help clarify this issue for Arabidopsis data. We define groups of positioned nucleosomes separately for each genotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to account for nucleosome position differences between mutants. Our clustering analysis (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) shows methylation patterns in all genotypes around the same set of nucleosomes (cluster C2) and reaches the same overall conclusion.</p><p>We have now added supplemental data to illustrate that our conclusions do not change when analyzing sets of well-positioned nucleosomes shared by different genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This figure also shows that using only WT positioned nucleosomes as methylation anchors masks the depletion of methylation from nucleosomes in ddm1 and h1ddm1 genotypes. This is because only a limited subset of WT well-positioned nucleosomes are also well positioned in the mutants.</p><p>Regarding nucleosome positioning in Lsh null cells, we unfortunately do not have Lsh null nucleosome data. We feel that CTCF sites are appropriate for anchoring analysis of methylation in this context; in essence, these can be thought of as ‘shared well-positioned nucleosomes’. Nucleosome positioning at CTCF sites in humans and mouse has been well-described and is generally invariant when averaged across a population of cells (e.g. Fu et al., 2008) as we do in the current work. Furthermore, this subset of CTCF sites is distant from potentially disruptive positioning cues such as gene promoters (see Methods section of Baubec et al. 2015).</p><p>Indeed, the CTCF sites we used here are well bound by CTCF regardless of levels of DNA methylation (Baubec et al. 2015, as derived from Stadler et al. 2011) and following the addition of DNMT3a to mutant cells, mCG appears in the presumptive linker DNA of these regions (Baubec et al. 2015). The observation that average DNA methylation in Lsh null cells peaks in the presumptive linker regions at near-WT levels provides strong evidence that the nucleosomes are positioned as in WT. There is also precedent for our analysis: Baubec et al. (2015) show MNase-seq from WT cells (Teif et al. 2012) in relation to methylation data from Dnmt-triple KO mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) For the lsh mutant, a meta-analysis is presented showing decreases in DNA methylation over well positioned nucleosomes and near WT levels of methylation in the linker regions; thus, methylation is skewed towards linkers.

No such phylogenetic pattern emerges when analyzing DDM1/Lsh homologs, potentially because these enzymes are multi-functional.

This enrichment is likely caused by the small size of DRM1/2-dependent TEs and hence the high proportion of non-methylated adjacent sequences over these nucleosomes. Consistent with this interpretation, an analysis anchored to the centers of differentially methylated regions (DMRs; see Methods)...&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The issue here is similar to the point above – we did not present our data clearly and described the results in an overly conservative and confusing way. CG and CHG methylation is actually depleted over nucleosomes very similarly at DRM- and CMT2-dependent loci, which shouldn’t be surprising given that the same methyltransferases (MET1 and CMT3, respectively) are responsible. CHH methylation is also depleted over nucleosomes at DRM-dependent loci, but mutating H1 or DDM1 doesn’t make much difference. We now illustrate this by plotting methylation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as we do in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, D and E</xref>, and by including a new supplementary figure analogous to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> (please see response to point 4). We also changed the associated text as follows:</p><p>“<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> TEs can be roughly grouped into heterochromatic and euchromatic elements (Zemach et al., 2013). […] Due to the strong linker enrichment of methylation in <italic>h1ddm1</italic> heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-E</xref>), even analyses centered on DMRs between <italic>cmt2</italic> and wild-type without regard to nucleosome position produce periodic <italic>h1ddm1</italic> methylation patterns (plots in the right column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-E</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Discussion, fourth paragraph, last sentence: This sentence is ambiguous. Gene body methylation is affected by MET1, with no contribution from the other methyltransferases. The ddm1 mutation affects only a small subset of body methylated genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We altered this sentence to:</p><p>“Despite their preferential methylation, genic nucleosomes – at least those experiencing low levels of transcription – are refractory to MET1 methyltransferase activity, as evidenced by their decreased methylation in <italic>ddm1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Re the statement in the Abstract &quot;We find that DDM1 enables methylation of DNA bound to the nucleosome, thus demonstrating that nucleosome-free DNA is the preferred substrate of eukaryotic methyltransferases in vivo.&quot; The first half of the statement is well supported, but the data do not demonstrate that nucleosome-free DNA is the preferred substrate. Rather, the data support this hypothesis. It is up to you how to re-phrase, but an example of re-phrasing would be &quot;We find that DDM1 enables methylation of DNA bound to the nucleosome, consistent with a model in which nucleosome-free DNA is the preferred substrate of eukaryotic methyltransferases in vivo.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We changed this sentence of the Abstract to:</p><p>“We find that DDM1 enables methylation of DNA bound to the nucleosome, suggesting that nucleosome-free DNA is the preferred substrate of eukaryotic methyltransferases in vivo.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In several cases, you draw specifically on the effects of h1 on CG methylation (see quoted text below). However, the effects of h1 on CG methylation are minimal. Indeed, when plotted relative to WT levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the line is flat. However, h1 clearly has effect on nucleosome core methylation levels in the CHG and CHH contexts, and it also enhances the ddm1 mutant. In light of these observations the text should be modified to more accurately reflect the data presented.</p><p>&quot;CG methylation is relatively evenly distributed with respect to nucleosomes in WT plants, and shows a weak nucleosomal depletion in h1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).&quot;</p><p>&quot;Without H1, linker DNA becomes even more accessible, producing the observed slight core-to-linker methylation differential in h1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that our data presentation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not clear and should convey the relationship between nucleosomes and methylation more accurately. To avoid the appearance of over-interpretation, we actually described our data too conservatively. CG methylation is depleted over nucleosomes in all genotypes, including h1 and WT. This wasn’t obvious in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, especially for WT, because the figure presented only one full linker-to-linker oscillation, and because the Y-axis methylation interval was fixed at 0.2 to allow for easier comparison between genotypes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the nucleosome depletion in h1 plants is even less apparent because WT data (also depleted over the nucleosome) are subtracted from h1 data, and the Y-axis range is four times greater than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p><p>To present our data clearly and accurately, we changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> panels A, D and E to display methylation for +/-1 kb from the point of alignment. This presents multiple nucleosomal oscillations, which make the relationship between methylation and nucleosomes in all the genotypes far more obvious. We are also including a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, which shows the same analysis (+/-150 bp) but allows the Y-axis to adjust to the data to emphasize the depletion over the nucleosome in WT and h1. We changed the associated text as follows:</p><p>“CG methylation shows a mild but clear depletion over well-positioned nucleosomes in WT and <italic>h1</italic> mutant plants, and an overt depletion in <italic>ddm1</italic> and <italic>h1ddm1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, loci with well-positioned nucleosomes on the left). […] In the absence of DDM1 and H1, linker DNA is accessible to methyltransferases, but nucleosome cores are not, producing the robust methylation periodicity in <italic>h1ddm1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The text now makes clear that the methylation data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is relative to the specific nucleosome positions in each genotype. The authors also account for possible affects due to differences in the sequences in the nucleosomes and the linkers through their analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. However, to fully evaluate this data, it would be informative to know how many well positioned nucleosomes there are in total and how many are shared between WT and h1ddm1 or between h1 and h1ddm1. In the response to reviewers it is stated that &quot;only a limited subset of WT well-positioned nucleosomes are also well positioned in the mutants.&quot; If this overlap is very small, then it remains unclear if this subset of regions can be used to extrapolate information regarding global effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the relevant nucleosome numbers to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>:</p><p>“Nucleosome numbers: 19122 for WT, 4267 shared by WT and h1ddm1 (22.3% of WT), 22745 for h1ddm1, 6364 shared by h1 and h1ddm1 (28.0% of h1ddm1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The implications of the following statement are unclear.</p><p>&quot;However, this appearance is almost certainly caused by the small size of DRM1/2-dependent TEs, because an analysis anchored to the centers of differentially methylated regions (DMRs; see Methods) between drm1drm2 mutants and wild-type that occur in regions with very poorly positioned nucleosomes (those outside the four groups defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; see Methods) shows an even sharper peak (plots in the right column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to comment 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) To avoid confusion the word &quot;can&quot; should be added to this sentence of the Introduction: &quot;Methylation also regulates endogenous genes: methylation close to the transcriptional start site can cause gene silencing[…]&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We made the suggested change.</p></body></sub-article></article>
