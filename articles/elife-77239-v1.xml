ovulatory functions of the ovary. Folliculogenesis and follicle progression require the orchestrated response of a variety of cell types to allow the maturation of the follicle and its sequela, ovulation, corpus luteum formation, and ovulatory wound repair. Little is known about the cell state dynamics of the ovary during the estrous cycle and the paracrine factors that help coordinate this process. Herein, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to evaluate the transcriptome of &gt;34,000 cells of the adult mouse ovary and describe the transcriptional changes that occur across the normal estrous cycle and other reproductive states to build a comprehensive dynamic atlas of murine ovarian cell types and states.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>estrous cycle</kwd><kwd>ovary</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01HD102014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pépin</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005294</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pépin</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Donahoe</surname><given-names>Patricia K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Huiying Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Huiying Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saatcioglu</surname><given-names>Hatice D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pépin</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A survey of the transcriptomic landscape of the mouse ovary at the single-cell level reveals both the cellular complexity of this organs and the dynamic nature of the cellular states that accompany estrous cycling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ovary is composed of a variety of cell types that govern its dynamic functions as both an endocrine organ capable of producing hormones such as sex steroids and a reproductive organ orchestrating the development of follicles, a structure defined by an oocyte surrounded by supporting somatic cells such as granulosa cells and theca cells. Most follicles in the ovary are quiescent primordial follicles, representing the ovarian reserve. Once activated, a primordial follicle grows in size and complexity as it progresses to primary, preantral, and antral stages, adding layers of granulosa and theca cells and forming an antral cavity, until it ultimately ejects the oocyte-cumulus complex at ovulation while the follicular remnants undergo terminal differentiation to form the corpus luteum (CL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunlop and Anderson, 2014</xref>). This process necessitates precise coordination of germ cells and several somatic cell types, including granulosa cells, thecal cells, vascular cells, and other stromal cells of the ovary to support the growth of the oocyte until its ovulation or, as is most often the case, undergo follicular atresia. In addition to supporting germ cells, ovarian somatic cells must produce the necessary hormonal cues, as well as coordinate the profound tissue remodeling, necessary to accommodate these dynamic developing structures. For reproductive success to occur, the state of each of these cells must change in a coordinated fashion over the course of the estrous cycle; this allows waves of follicles to grow and mature, ovulation to be triggered precisely, and provides the hormonal support necessary for pregnancy.</p><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has been used in a variety of tissues to obtain an in-depth understanding of gene expression and cellular diversity. In the ovary, this technique has allowed us, and others, to explore various physiological processes during early ovarian development and ovarian aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stévant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niu and Spradling, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jevitt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Man et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meinsohn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). For example, Fan et al. cataloged the transcriptomic changes that occur during follicular development and regression and mapped the cell types of the human ovary using surgical specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2019</xref>). A primate model has been used to investigate changes in cell types and states that occur in the ovary with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Zhao et al. looked at the formation of the follicle during early embryonic ovarian development to discern the relationship of oocytes to their support cells in formation of follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). We have used scRNAseq to identify inhibitory pathways regulated by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) during the first wave of follicular growth in the murine ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meinsohn et al., 2021</xref>). While all these studies have helped establish a static framework to understand the major cell types in the ovary, they fail to describe the dynamic nature of cell states across the reproductive cycle, known as the estrous cycle. The estrous cycle in mice is analogous to the human menstrual cycle, which both reflect follicle development in the ovary. In mice, this cycle lasts 4–5 days and is composed of four different phases known as proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. The murine proestrus is analogous to the human follicular stage and leads to ovulation at estrus. Metestrus and diestrus are analogous to early and late secretory stages of the reproductive cycle in humans, which are orchestrated by production of progesterone by the CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajayi and Akhigbe, 2020</xref>).</p><p>To understand more fully the dynamic effects of cyclic endocrine, autocrine, and paracrine signals on ovarian cell states, we performed high-throughput scRNAseq of ovaries from adult mice across a physiological spectrum of reproductive states. Ovaries were harvested from mice in the four phases of the normal estrous cycle: proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. Additionally, ovaries were evaluated from mice that were either lactating or non-lactating 10 days post-partum, and from randomly cycling adult mice to increase the diversity of cell states represented in the dataset. Herein, we (1) describe the previously unrecognized complexity in the ovarian cellular subtypes and their cyclic expression states during the estrous cycle, and (2) identify secreted factors that cycle and thus could represent potential biomarkers for staging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scRNA-seq of adult mouse ovaries across reproductive states</title><p>To survey the dynamic transcriptional landscape of ovaries at the single-cell level across a range of physiological reproductive states in sexually mature female mice, we isolated the ovaries (four mice per group) at each stage of estrous cycling (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus), post-partum non-lactating (PPNL) (day 10 post-partum, with pups removed on the day they were born), post-partum lactating (day 10 post-partum, actively lactating with pups), and non-monitored adult mice to increase sample diversity and cell counts. Following enzymatic digestion of the ovaries, we generated single-cell suspensions and sorted them by microfluidics using the inDROP methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klein et al., 2015</xref>), targeting 1500 cells per animal.

To assign cell type identity, we used cluster-specific markers which were previously described in other studies or newly identified makers later validated by RNA in situ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The largest groups of clusters consisted of granulosa cells (N=17627 cells) and mesenchymal cells of the ovarian stroma (N=10825 cells). Other minor cell types were identified including endothelial cells (N=3501 cells), ovarian surface epithelial cells (N=1088 cells), immune cells (N=1649 cells), and oocytes (N=22 cells), altogether recapitulating all the major cell types of the ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Oocytes were poorly represented in the dataset due to cell size limitations of inDROP, likely restricting our sampling to small oocytes of primordial follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To characterize more fully the transcriptional signatures of the identified cell types, we evaluated a heatmap of marker gene expression across the major categories of cell types and states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Cells were also classified depending on the stage of the estrous cycle or lactating states in which the ovaries were collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Based on prior studies and conserved marker expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), we were able to identify subclusters within mesenchymal cells and their relative abundance (percentage) as follows: early theca (16.8%), which formed the theca interna of preantral follicles; steroidogenic theca (13.2%), which formed the theca interna of antral follicles; smooth muscle cells (10.2%), which were part of the theca externa of both antral and preantral follicles; pericytes (6.2%), which surrounded the vasculature; and two interstitial stromal cell clusters, one composed of steroidogenic cells (28.7%) and the other of fibroblast-like cells (24.9%), which together constituted the bulk of the ovarian volume (outside of follicles).

Meanwhile, the steroidogenic theca cells were identified by their expression of cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1 (<italic>Cyp17a1</italic>), an essential enzyme for androgen biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richards et al., 2018</xref>); they were found in antral follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The theca externa is a connective tissue rich in extracellular matrix situated on the outermost layer of the follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), containing fibroblasts, macrophages, blood vessels, and abundant smooth muscle cells, which we identified based on expression of microfibril-associated protein 5 (<italic>Mfap5</italic>) by RNA in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To validate the identity and histology of these smooth muscle cells, we performed RNAish/IHC colocalization of <italic>Mfap5</italic> and actin alpha 2 (<italic>Acta2</italic>), another marker of smooth muscle, which confirmed their position within the theca externa. In contrast, <italic>Hhip</italic>, which was expressed in theca interna (both immature and steroidogenic), did not colocalize with Acta2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). These results suggest Mfap5 labels smooth muscle cells of the theca externa more specifically than Acta2; these cells are thought to perform a contractile function during ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Young and McNeilly, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, the bulk of the ovarian interstitial stromal space was made up of two closely related cell types which could not be differentiated by specific dichotomous markers but rather were distinguished based on relative expression of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphoiestrase 2 (<italic>Enpp2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Early preantral follicle numbers are thought to be relatively stable across the estrous cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deb et al., 2013</xref>), given that they are largely unresponsive to gonadotropins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richards, 1980</xref>), in contrast to antral follicles, whose numbers and size are more variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deb et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, while subclusters such as ‘preantral granulosa cells’ were equally represented in samples from proestrus, metestrus, and diestrus, others, such as the ‘luteinizing mural’ cluster, were dominated by cells derived from one stage (in this case ‘estrus’). Genes enriched in this cluster had been previously reported to be involved in the ovulatory process and regulated by the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, including markers of terminal differentiation and steroidogenesis such as <italic>Smarca1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lazzaro et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Cyp11a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Irving-Rodgers et al., 2009</xref>), metallothionein 1 (<italic>Mt1</italic>), and metallothionein <italic>2</italic> (<italic>Mt2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Other genes enriched in this subcluster include Prss35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wahlberg et al., 2008</xref>) and Adamts1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lussier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sayasith et al., 2013</xref>), which had previously been identified as playing a role in the follicular rupture necessary for ovulation.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that granulosa cells of preantral follicles and cumulus cells of antral follicles clustered together and shared markers that distinguished them from mural granulosa cells. For example, Kctd14, a member of the potassium channel tetramerisation domain-containing family, was expressed in granulosa cells during the initial growth of early preantral follicles, but also specifically expressed only in cumulus cells, but not mural granulosa cells, of larger antral follicles. Intriguingly, we have previously shown that AMH (anti- Müllerian hormone, a.k.a Müllerian Inhibiting Substance), which is specifically expressed by cumulus cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diaz et al., 2007</xref>) in antral follicles, regulates KCTD14 expression in preantral follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meinsohn et al., 2021</xref>). This conservation of cellular state and marker expression from preantral granulosa cells to cumulus cells of antral follicles suggests a continuous lineage, potentially defined and maintained by the close interaction with the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diaz et al., 2007</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with the presence of a differentiation fork in the granulosa cell lineage during antrum formation, which would give rise to a distinct mural granulosa cell fate poised to respond to the LH surge. Indeed, the periovulatory granulosa cell state was identified based on its expression of genes regulated by LH such as Smarca1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lazzaro et al., 2006</xref>), and we propose Oxtr as a specific marker for these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Oxtr expression was found only in the mural cells of large Graafian follicles, suggesting it indeed corresponds to an LH-stimulated mural granulosa cell state.</p><p>After ovulation, these LH-stimulated mural granulosa cells, along with the steroidogenic theca cells, terminally differentiate into luteal cells and form the corpus luteum (CL). The CL is a transient structure with highly active steroid biosynthesis, providing the progesterone to maintain pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duncan, 2021</xref>). In absence of implantation, the CL degenerates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>). We found this progression of the CL to be recapitulated at the transcriptional level, leading to two luteal subclusters: active CL and regressing CL. While the active CL was characterized by expression of proliferation markers (Top2a) in addition to steroidogenic enzymes, the regressing CL expressed the cell cycle inhibitor and senescence maker Cdkn1a, along with luteolysis markers such as syndecan 4 (Sdc4), claudin domain containing 1 (Cldnd1), and BTG anti-proliferation factor 1 (Btg1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Talbott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). The distinct expression signatures observed in these two clusters may provide insights into the molecular basis of luteolysis and warrant further investigation.</p><p>The mesenchymal cluster was also surprisingly complex and variable across the estrous cycle, reflecting stromal remodeling and other physiological functions supporting follicle growth, steroid hormone production, and ovulation. For example, during follicle maturation, the ovarian stromal cells adjacent to the developing follicle differentiates into the theca, which is ultimately responsible for steroid hormone biosynthesis and therefore underlies the cyclic hormone production of the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ryan and Petro, 1966</xref>). Herein, we identified two thecal clusters, designated as early and steroidogenic theca. Early theca was defined by markers such as Hhip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richards et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hummitzsch et al., 2019</xref>), mesoderm-specific transcript (Mest) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2019</xref>), and patched 1 (Ptch1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richards et al., 2018</xref>) and given its association with small follicles, presumed to be immature and the precursor to steroidogenic theca. As the follicle matures and the antrum forms, this layer becomes more vascularized and differentiates into theca interna, which is steroidogenic. This steroidogenic theca cluster was readily identifiable through its expression of steroidogenic enzymes such as Hsd3b1, Cyp17a1, Cyp11a1, and also well-established markers such as ferredoxin-1 (Fdx1) and prolactin receptor (Prlr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grosdemouge et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, we confirmed the presence of steroidogenic interstitial stromal cells which also likely contribute to sex steroid production in the ovary. Indeed, such cells likely represent the precursors of the theca interna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinnear et al., 2020</xref>). Smooth muscle cells, which are part of the theca externa, were identified by their expression of structural proteins such as Mfap5, myosin heavy chain 11 (Myh11), Tagln, and smooth muscle actin (Sma or Acta2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to mice, human smooth muscle cells are thought to express high levels of collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2019</xref>), which we did not observe here. Another species difference between mice and humans was the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (Aldh1a1), which we found primarily in the steroidogenic theca cluster, while it is presumably enriched in the theca externa in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Ovulation is associated with a dramatic remodeling of the ovary, including the subsequent ovulatory wound repair. We identified fibroblast-like cells in the ovarian stroma expressing many of the extracellular matrix protein known to play a role in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duffy et al., 2019</xref>). Another important player in ovulatory would repair is the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), a simple mesothelial cell layer that covers the surface of the ovary and must dynamically expand to cover wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hartanti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). The OSE cluster could be identified based on well-established markers such as keratin (Krt) 7, 8, and 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kenngott et al., 2014</xref>) and was represented by only 3% of all cells in our dataset, which could be further subdivided in proliferative and non-proliferative states. As expected from their function in ovulatory wound repair, dividing OSE was enriched during estrus. Furthermore, genes associated with wound healing such as galectin 1 (<italic>Lgals1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2015</xref>) were also significantly upregulated in estrus. Similarly, the expression of the immediate-early genes Fos, Jun, Junb, and Egr1 was variable during the estrous cycle, following a common pattern of strong downregulation at estrous compared to the other stages, consistent with their temporal expression during the repair of other tissues such as the cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okada et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to take advantage of this rich dataset, we sought to identify secreted markers which varied in abundance during the estrous cycle and could thus be used as staging biomarkers in assisted reproduction. We identified and prioritized four secreted biomarkers, expressed in mouse but also human ovaries, which varied significantly during different transitions of the estrous cycle, namely <italic>Inhba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wijayarathna and de Kretser, 2016</xref>), <italic>Prss35</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wahlberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Nppc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xi et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>Tinagl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaiwa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Activin A is a secreted protein homodimer translated from the <italic>Inhba</italic> transcript that is a crucial modulator of diverse ovarian functions including pituitary feedback, and whose expression level depends highly on the stage of the estrous cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang and Leung, 2018</xref>). Quantification of activin A protein in the serum by ELISA revealed elevated levels in the blood during both proestrus and estrus, which is consistent with studies of other species such as ewes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">OConnell et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the protein product of <italic>Inhba</italic>, the inhibin beta-A subunit, can be incorporated into other protein dimers, such as activin BA, and inhibin A, which were not measured in this study and may also represent cycling biomarkers.</p><p>The serine protease 35 transcript was expressed in the theca layers of preantral follicles and induced in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles and all stages of the corpora lutea, peaking at the estrous stage according to qPCR, leading us to speculate that it may be involved tissue remodeling during ovulation and CL formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wahlberg et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the PRSS35 protein levels were highest in the diestrus and proestrus stages as determined by ELISA, suggesting other tissue sources of PRSS35 or an offset in peak protein levels due to delays in accumulation of the protein in the circulation.</p><p>The natriuretic peptide precursor C (NPPC) protein is a peptide hormone encoded by the <italic>Nppc</italic> gene. <italic>Nppc</italic> has been reported to be expressed by mural granulosa cells, while its receptor Npr2 is expressed by cumulus cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). The pair acts on developing follicles by increasing the production of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate and maintains oocyte meiotic arrest during maturation. Upon downregulation of this pathway, the oocyte can escape meiotic arrest and ovulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Celik et al., 2019</xref>). This close relationship with the ovulatory process makes <italic>Nppc</italic> an attractive marker to predict ovulation. Herein, qPCR analysis revealed that <italic>Nppc</italic> was highest in the ovary at proestrus and was quickly and significantly downregulated at estrous, probably in response to the increased levels of LH which in turn inhibit the Nppc/Npr2 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Celik et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, there was a trend for the circulating NPCC peptide to be highest in metestrus and diestrus, albeit not in a statistically significant way.</p><p>Finally, we evaluated the level of transcription and protein expression of the matricellular factor Tinagl1. We found both the <italic>Tinagl1</italic> transcript and the circulating TINAGL1 protein in the blood to be highest during estrous, thus coinciding with ovulation, with a pattern of expression consistent with expression by mural granulosa cells of antral follicles. While the role of TINAGL1 in the ovary has not been extensively investigated, it has been associated with delayed ovarian collagen deposition and increased ovulation in aging Tinagl1 knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaiwa et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Those four potential cyclic biomarkers, activin A, PRSS35, NPPC, and TINAGL1, provide a proof of concept that a deeper understanding of transcriptional changes at the single-cell level may translate into useful applications in assisted reproduction. It will be of interest to follow up the findings of cyclic expression of these four markers, particularly in combination as an index, for the purpose of staging and predicting ovulation timing in humans and other species .</p><p>In summary, this study outlines the dynamic transcriptome of murine ovaries at the single-cell level and across the estrous cycle and other reproductive states, and extends our understanding of the diversity of cell types in the adult ovary. We identified herein novel biomarkers of the estrous cycle that can be readily measured in the blood and may have utility in predicting staging for assisted reproduction. This rich dataset and extensive validation of new molecular markers of cell types of the ovary will provide a hypothesis-generating framework of dynamic cell states across the cycle with which to elucidate the complex cellular interactions that are required for ovarian homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Estrous stage was determined by observation of the vaginal opening and by vaginal swabs done at the same time daily, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2017</xref>). Each mouse was monitored for a minimum of 2 weeks to ensure its cyclicity. Four mice were sacrificed in each of the four phases of the estrous cycle and labeled as being from experimental batch ‘cycling’. An additional eight mice were included in the analysis and labeled as being from experimental batch ‘lactating’. Four of these mice were lactating at day 10 post-partum, and four were 10 days post-partum with pups removed at delivery. Four additional mice were not monitored for cycling and included to increase sample size and diversity.</p><p>Additional mice were monitored throughout the estrous cycle to collect ovaries at each stage (groups of N=5 for proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) for gene validation.

Briefly, proestrus was determined if the smear showed a preponderance of nucleated epithelial cells as well as leukocytes. Estrous was marked by an abundance of cornified epithelial cells, while metestrous smears contained a mixture of cornified epithelial cells and leukocytes.

The final merged dataset contained ~70,000 cells which were clustered based on expression of marker genes. These were further processed in several ways to exclude low-quality data and potential doublets. Visualization of single-cell data was performed using a non-linear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection. Markers for each level of cluster were identified using MAST in Seurat (R version 4.1.3 - Seurat version 4.1.0). Following identification of the main clusters (granulosa, mesenchyme, endothelium, immune, epithelium, and oocyte), we reanalyzed each cluster population to perform subclustering. Briefly, the granulosa, mesenchyme, and epithelium clusters were extracted from the integrated dataset by the subset function.

Following deparaffinization in xylene, dehydration, peroxidase blocking, and heat-induced epitope retrieval by the target retrieval and protease plus reagents (ACD bio), tissue sections were hybridized with probes for the target genes (see Key resources table for accession number and catalog number of each gene) in the HybEZ hybridization oven (ACD Bio) for 2 hr at 40°C. The slides were then processed for standard signal amplification steps and chromogen development. Slides were counterstained in 50% hematoxylin (Dako), air dried, and cover-slipped with EcoMount. In addition to cycling and non-cycling mice, superovulated mice were used to validate markers from follicles associated with LH surge response in ovulatory follicles at the estrous stage for more precise timing of collection.</p><p>For colocalization of RNAish staining with immunohistochemistry, we first processed the tissue section for RNAscope as described above, including deparaffinization, antigen retrieval, hybridization, and chromogen development.

Following three washes with TBS, the sections were incubated with the primary antibody (smooth muscle actin primary antibody; 1:300, Abcam) overnight at 4°C and developed with Dako EnVision + System horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Labeled polymer anti-rabbit was used as the secondary antibody, and the HRP signal was detected using the Dako detection system. Slides were then counterstained in hematoxylin and mounted as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Mice were monitored through the estrous cycle and sacrificed at specific stage/timepoints as described above. Ovaries were dissected, and total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). A cDNA library was synthesized from 500 ng total RNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR using manufacturer’s instructions with random hexamers (Invitrogen). The primers used for this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major concerns were regarding some data analysis and a request for further validation of the RNA seq. data.</p><p>1. In the Monocle in Figure 5C-D, why are the periovulatory GC that is the visualization look very much like mural GC in a completely different branch than mural GC? I have the impression that either the clusters need to be refined/validated further or the Monocle is not providing meaningful results regarding lineage trajectories. Why would the &quot;periovulatory&quot; GCs be at the end of the CL branch? In addition, the population of periovulatory Runx1+ cells seems rather aspecific. I think the authors could increase the robustness of the data/evidence regarding this cluster. Particularly because they go on comparing periovulatory and antral GCs. Could at least one differentially expressed marker from the volcano plot be validated?</p><p>2. The author used tSNE for visualization of the generated scRNA seq dataset, which, according to my knowledge, is outdated for scRNA seq data visualization as its reproducibility has become an issue. Which version of the Seurat package does the author use? And also the other software information should be implemented. Therefore, I suggest the author reanalyze their dataset using an updated Seurat pipeline, and also reanalyze all of their data using UMAP.</p><p>3. It does not appear that Figure 2 represents a real &quot;subcluster&quot; analysis. Instead, these cells are from the original clustering performed on all cells. To get a better resolution as to the different cell types, it would be best to perform a subcluster analysis where these cells are first extracted from the total data set and then re-clustered using more relevant principal components (for example, see Niu and Spradling, 2020).</p><p>4. For the pseudotime analysis presented in Figure 4 the authors excluded the mitotic and putative atretic granulosa cells. What is the justification for this?</p><p>5. The reviewers also have many other suggestions that the authors should likely consider to clarify the manuscript for the broad audience of <italic>eLife</italic> readers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I think this is a fantastic dataset, but I think it could be better explored. The relation between different stages of estrous/lactating and the histology/validation could have been better explored and the cell types more explicitly named. I am not sure the Monocle analysis is clarifying things, this is tricky to use and I would consider using other comparable methods to determine the trajectories.</p><p>I have some points that I would like to see clarified:</p><p>– How was it determined that the postpartum 10-day females were lactating or not-lactating?</p><p>– Could the authors color the cells per oestrus phase, postlactating, randomly next to Figure 1B? It would be very useful to understand how the different cells in the initial clustering are represented in the different groups, particularly to determine the periovulatory follicles. In that sense, it would be very helpful to have corresponding histology of the ovaries in the respective cycle phase from the beginning. This aspect of the manuscript should be better explored. Also, the ovary from the lactating/nonlactating could be provided.</p><p>– Could the authors clarify what cluster corresponds to theca externa? In the text, they mentioned the expression of Mfap5, but in Figure 2 they only mention smooth muscle cells. How are the population for the smooth muscle cells and theca externa connected and or differentiated? This is confusing the text and Figures. In other words: where are the theca externa cells in Figure 2? Perhaps the authors could provide fields with higher magnification, eventually in the Suppl Figure? Could the &quot;smooth muscle cells&quot; simply be the theca externa?</p><p>– In Figure 2 is also not clear where are the theca interna cells, although the authors do mention those in the text. This is confusing. Please refer to the theca interna in the text and Figure. Could there be two populations of Theca interna (steroidogenic) and the ones closer to the basement membrane? I don't see any evidence to call this 'immature' theca (see Figure 4C).</p><p>– Regarding the atretic granulosa cells: the follicle provided still looks rather healthy. Is there a second marker you could use together with Ghr to confirm that particular cluster corresponds to atretic GC? Or can you colocalise Ghr with a marker of atresia?</p><p>– In addition, the periovulatory marker chosen does not seem very specific. I would suggest the authors choose a better marker. Otherwise, the identity of this cluster remains inconclusive. Moreover, what is the evidence that this would be periovulatory follicles? Is this the phase of the cycle? This could be better explained/evidenced, perhaps using histology of ovaries corresponding to the respective stages.</p><p>– The 3 clusters of granulosa cells (Figure 3) in the corpus luteum are intriguing. I wonder whether the authors have an explanation for that. What are the oestrous stages the cells were observed in?</p><p>– I am not sure the Monocle results (Figure 4A-B) are informative because the theca are not separated in theca interna and externa. Hence to me, it is unclear how the mesenchymal clusters, if they are well determined and reflect biology, relate to each other.</p><p>– In the Monocle in Figure 5C-D, I have similar issues – why are the periovulatory GC that is the visualization look very much like mural GC in a completely different branch than mural GC? I have the impression that either the clusters need to be refined/validated further or the Monocle is not providing meaningful results regarding lineage trajectories. Why would the &quot;periovulatory&quot; GCs be at the end of the CL<sup>-</sup>branch? In addition, the population of periovulatory Runx1+ cells seems rather aspecific. I think the authors could increase the robustness of the data/evidence regarding this cluster. Particularly because they go on comparing periovulatory and antral GCs. Could at least one differentially expressed marker from the volcano plot be validated?</p><p>– I am not sure the Monocle analysis is clarifying things, this is tricky to use and I would consider using other comparable methods to determine the trajectories.</p><p>– In Figure 4C: if the authors claim that the stroma is more medullary or cortex. In the Results, they do not visualise it. Hence, I would remove the claim from the Results but keep it in the Discussion.</p><p>– Results on the OSE should be shown in the Results section, now they are part of the Discussion? Where are those cells? What clusters? Etc. This population is very interesting/elusive and should be given proper attention/validation in the Results. In addition, the authors mention no differences between the estrous states: this should be clearly shown in the Results.</p><p>– The Discussion is too long, in particular, the discussion on the biomarkers reads more like a review than a discussion of your results. This should be shortened and made concise.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The introduction is very brief. It would be improved with a more thorough description of the estrus cycle beyond simply naming the stages. For example, how many days is the estrus cycle in the mouse?

However, for this dataset to serve as a useful resource for the wider community, the processed data should be uploaded to the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal (https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org).</p><p>3. The abstract indicates that in addition to ovaries isolated from the four stages of estrus, scRNA-seq was also performed on ovaries isolated from lactating or non-lactating 10 days postpartum mice, and from randomly cycling mice. However, cells from these later samples were never presented or discussed. It is therefore not clear what cells were used in the analysis. To make this clear, Figure 1 (or a supplemental figure) should include a tSNE plot where the cells are color-coded based on their sample origin (i.e. like Figure 5A).</p><p>4. Figure 1 – Given that this is the first figure, it would be good to show a tSNE plot that identifies which cells are from which library.</p><p>5. Figure 2 – It does not appear that Figure 2 represents a real &quot;subcluster&quot; analysis. Instead, these cells are from the original clustering performed on all cells. To get a better resolution as to the different cell types, it would be best to perform a subcluster analysis where these cells are first extracted from the total data set and then re-clustered using more relevant principal components (for example, see Niu and Spradling, 2020).</p><p>6. For the data presented in Figure 2, it is not entirely clear what is novel and what is already known. There are no references to the genes used to identify the cell sub-types types. References that are cited in the tables are not listed in the reference list. These references should, at a minimum, be listed in a supplemental text and it should be made clear in the text what genes are novel.</p><p>7. In addition to the markers chosen for specificity (e.g. Mafap5), it would be nice to see representative UMAPS (or dot plots) showing standard cell-type markers (e.g. Tcf21, Dcn, Notch3, Cxcl12). This could be a supplemental figure.</p><p>8. The description of the mesenchyme cell subpopulations is confusing as the authors do not use consistent terminology. A more concise definition of theca interna, theca externa, mature theca and immature theca as it relates to theca 1 and 2, stroma 1 and 2, smooth muscle would make the paper more accessible to the non-expert.</p><p>9. Line 196: Text refers to &quot;dividing mesenchyme (8%) as seen in Figure 2A&quot; but this population is not labeled. Which subcluster of cells is this referring to?</p><p>10. Line 204: Confusing to use theca externa when Figure 2C is labeled smooth muscle. Defining theca interna vs. theca externa, as mentioned above, would help.</p><p>11. Line 206: &quot;…whereas Hhip was expressed in theca interna and immature theca (Figure S2A, B).&quot; What is the difference between theca 1 and immature theca? Are these the same?</p><p>12. Figure 2 FigSup2: hard to see Acta2-Mfap5 overlap in Figure S2B. A higher magnification image would be helpful. It looks like there are two distinct cell layers, not the same cells. Also, Hhip expressing cells appear to be located outside of the Acta2-expressing cells, but Hhip is referred to as marking theca interna while Acta2 is said to mark theca externa. This needs to be explained.</p><p>13. Figure 2C – To make interpretation of the expression patterns more accessible to the non-expert, I suggest labeling some structures in these figure panels (e.g. oocyte, granulosa cells, cortical, medullary).</p><p>14. What cell type are the mitotic granulosa cells most similar to? Antral/mural or preantral/cumulus? Or are they an intermediate between these two? Subcluster analysis, as mentioned above, may help to better define their relationship.</p><p>15. Line 228: What is the justification for identifying these as atretic? What is the significance of Ghr to atresia? References would help.</p><p>16. Fan et al., used the following gene expression signatures to distinguish cumulus from mural GC's: cumulus GC (VCANhigh/FSThigh/IGFBP2high/HTRA1high/INHBBhigh/IHHhigh); mural GC (WT1low/EGR4low/KRT18high/CITED2high/LIHPhigh/AKIRIN1high). However, in Table S5 Fst and Inhbb are listed as markers for mural, not cumulus cells. This should be explained.</p><p>17. For the pseudotime analysis presented in Figure 4 the authors excluded the mitotic and putative atretic granulosa cells. What is the justification for this?</p><p>18. Figure 4D and E – Why are the preovulatory cells at the terminus of the pseudotime with CL2, while CL1 and CL3 cells positioned along the root. This does not match expectations. The discussion suggests that the developmental progression is PO&gt;CL2&gt;CL1&gt;CL3, but this is not supported by the trajectory analysis. This calls into question the usefulness of the pseudotime analysis. It is mentioned in the discussion that instead of the different CL clusters representing a developmental progression, they are instead distinct cell types within a CL. This could be resolved with double RNA in situ hybridization using CL cluster-specific genes.</p><p>19. Figure 5A – It would be nice to show 4 separate plots for each of the stages. Hard to see this on a single plot. Perhaps 4 smaller panels next to A. It would also be helpful to label the different cell sub-types so the reader does not need to refer back to Figure 3.</p><p>20. Figure 5B – It would be helpful to label this panel &quot;Proestrus-Estrus,&quot; following that in Figure S5.</p><p>21. Line 270 – reference to Figure S5D should be Figures 5E.</p><p>22. Figure S5D – This figure panel is not mentioned in the text.</p><p>23. Line 270: &quot;…involved in wound repair during ovulation.&quot; This needs a reference.</p><p>24. It is stated that the motivation for identifying stage-specific secreted biomarkers was to identify markers that would be useful for staging in assisted reproduction and other applications in reproductive medicine. This begs the question if Prss35, Nppc and Tinagl1 are also expressed in human ovaries? Was this part of the reason they were selected?</p><p>25. Figure 6B: I think panel B should be first since it is from the scRNA-seq data set and then A is validation. I would also add Lhcgr and Pgr to the dot plot in B. Also, it makes more sense to put Inhba next to Nppc.</p><p>26. Figure 6A: The graphs in A are somewhat randomly organized, which makes it unnecessarily complicated. These should be reorganized to group factors high in P vs. E together and those high in E vs. P together.</p><p>27. Figure 6C: Follicle stages should be labeled. Mural vs. Cumulus cell should be labeled. Would be best to show both follicles that are labeled and ones that are not labeled to emphasize that this is a stage-specific expression. I cannot see Nppc expression. Might be helpful to have a higher magnification or arrows pointing to expressing cells.</p><p>28.

Why would the &quot;periovulatory&quot; GCs be at the end of the CL branch?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the pseudo-time analysis we presented using monocle appeared counter intuitive. Furthermore, other pseudotime analyses gave similar results. This is because the lineage from preantral granulosa cell to cumulus granulosa cells of antral follicles is linear. In contrast, mural granulosa cells of antral follicles have a distinct trajectory representing a branching point leading to luteal differentiation. However to luteinizing cell state is unique, and more similar to luteal cells of the corpus luteum than to antral mural granulosa. This creates a discontinuous trajectory of granulosa lineages in pseudotime, where the transcriptional response to the LH surge appears as a terminal state, when it is in fact transient. Therefore, in an effort to improve clarity, we have removed the pseudotime analysis in favor of more concise explanation of these lineages and states in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the population of periovulatory Runx1+ cells seems rather aspecific.

Are these the same?</p></disp-quote><p>We adopted a consistent nomenclature reflecting the updated subclustering analysis. The theca clusters have been renamed early theca, steroidogenic theca, and smooth muscle (of the theca externa) and the text was modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Figure 2 FigSup2: hard to see Acta2-Mfap5 overlap in Figure S2B. A higher magnification image would be helpful. It looks like there are two distinct cell layers, not the same cells. Also, Hhip expressing cells appear to be located outside of the Acta2-expressing cells, but Hhip is referred to as marking theca interna while Acta2 is said to mark theca externa. This needs to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We added higher magnification of Hhip and Mfap5 staining colocalization with Acta2 in Figure 2 – supplement 1B. While Hhip is expressed in the early theca, of the theca interna, Mfap5 is expressed in smooth muscle cells of the theca externa and colocalizes with Acta2, a general marker of smooth muscle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Figure 2C – To make interpretation of the expression patterns more accessible to the non-expert, I suggest labeling some structures in these figure panels (e.g. oocyte, granulosa cells, cortical, medullary).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The general histology of ovarian structures across diverse reproductive states are now shown in supplemental figure 1 – supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. What cell type are the mitotic granulosa cells most similar to? Antral/mural or preantral/cumulus? Or are they an intermediate between these two? Subcluster analysis, as mentioned above, may help to better define their relationship.</p></disp-quote><p>The mitotic granulosa cells cluster was composed of cells that were closely related to both the antral mural and the preantral-cumulus granulosa (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> the expression of both markers Mro (red) and Kctd14(green) in the mitotic cluster).

Line 228: What is the justification for identifying these as atretic? What is the significance of Ghr to atresia? References would help.</p></disp-quote><p>We propose Ghr as a new marker for atretic granulosa cells. We confirmed the identification of atretic cluster based on expression of apoptotic markers such as Pik3ip1, Nupr1 and Gadd45a presented on Figure S3A along with additional previously validated markers which are referenced in Tables S4. Moreover, we provided a better representative example of an atretic follicle with Ghr in-situ hybridization in Figure 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. Fan et al., used the following gene expression signatures to distinguish cumulus from mural GC's: cumulus GC (VCANhigh/FSThigh/IGFBP2high/HTRA1high/INHBBhigh/IHHhigh); mural GC (WT1low/EGR4low/KRT18high/CITED2high/LIHPhigh/AKIRIN1high). However, in Table S5 Fst and Inhbb are listed as markers for mural, not cumulus cells. This should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>While we investigated all markers discussed in the Fan et al., publication, many were not conserved from human to mouse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).

For the pseudotime analysis presented in Figure 4 the authors excluded the mitotic and putative atretic granulosa cells. What is the justification for this?</p></disp-quote><p>Given that the monocle pseudotime trajectories of granulosa cells were difficult to interpret, we have removed this analysis from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. Figure 4D and E – Why are the preovulatory cells at the terminus of the pseudotime with CL2, while CL1 and CL3 cells positioned along the root. This does not match expectations. The discussion suggests that the developmental progression is PO&gt;CL2&gt;CL1&gt;CL3, but this is not supported by the trajectory analysis. This calls into question the usefulness of the pseudotime analysis. It is mentioned in the discussion that instead of the different CL clusters representing a developmental progression, they are instead distinct cell types within a CL. This could be resolved with double RNA in situ hybridization using CL cluster-specific genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the pseudo-time analysis we presented using monocle appears counter intuitive. This is because the pseudotime progression from mural granulosa cells of antral follicles to periovulatory follicle granulosa cells, to active CL to regressing CL does not appear linear. Therefore, in an effort to improve clarity, we have removed the pseudotime analysis in favor of more concise explanation of these lineages and states in the discussion (line 378-382).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. Figure 5A – It would be nice to show 4 separate plots for each of the stages. Hard to see this on a single plot. Perhaps 4 smaller panels next to A. It would also be helpful to label the different cell sub-types so the reader does not need to refer back to Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

It is stated that the motivation for identifying stage-specific secreted biomarkers was to identify markers that would be useful for staging in assisted reproduction and other applications in reproductive medicine. This begs the question if Prss35, Nppc and Tinagl1 are also expressed in human ovaries? Was this part of the reason they were selected?</p></disp-quote><p>To prioritize these markers, we identified factors specifically secreted by ovarian granulosa in our dataset, and predominantly expressed by the gonads in the human GTEX database. We have added selection details to the text (lines 320-324).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25. Figure 6B: I think panel B should be first since it is from the scRNA-seq data set and then A is validation. I would also add Lhcgr and Pgr to the dot plot in B.

We modified Figure 6B accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>26. Figure 6A: The graphs in A are somewhat randomly organized, which makes it unnecessarily complicated.

We modified Figure 6A accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>27. Figure 6C: Follicle stages should be labeled. Mural vs. Cumulus cell should be labeled. Would be best to show both follicles that are labeled and ones that are not labeled to emphasize that this is a stage-specific expression. I cannot see Nppc expression.
