cellular or biological aging. The effect results from the production of asymmetrical daughters, one with a lower elongation rate, by the division of a mother cell. The slower daughter compared to the faster daughter, denoted respectively as the old and new daughters, has more aggregates of damaged proteins and fewer expressed gene products. We have examined further the degree of asymmetry by measuring the density of ribosomes between old and new daughters and between their poles. We found that ribosomes were denser in the new daughter and also in the new pole of the daughters. These ribosome patterns match the ones we previously found for expressed gene products. This outcome suggests that the asymmetry is not likely to result from properties unique to the gene expressed in our previous study, but rather from a more fundamental upstream process affecting the distribution of ribosomal abundance. Because damage aggregates and ribosomes are both more abundant at the poles of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, we suggest that competition for space between the two could explain the reduced ribosomal density in old daughters. Using published values for aggregate sizes and the relationship between ribosomal number and elongation rates, we show that the aggregate volumes could in principle displace quantitatively the amount of ribosomes needed to reduce the elongation rate of the old daughters.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>damage</kwd><kwd>ribosomes</kwd><kwd>asymmetry</kwd><kwd>single cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1354253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chao</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Differences in the ribosomal densities of the two daughters produced by a mother <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> could explain the asymmetry of aging and growth rate in previously reported such daughter pairs.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A mother <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cell divides asymmetrically into two daughter cells that have different elongation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Łapińska et al., 2019</xref>). The new daughter elongates faster while the old daughter is slower. The asymmetry and old-new designation of the daughters result from the fact that the rod-shaped mother divides by forming new poles at its midplane. As a result, all <italic>E. coli</italic> cells are polarized at birth with a new and an old pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When a polarized cell in turn becomes a mother and divides, its daughters will also be polarized but they can also be identified as new and old daughters depending on whether they acquired the mother’s new or old pole. Note that mothers can also be denoted as new or old, depending on whether they were new or old daughters at birth. The difference in elongation rate between old and new daughters was found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindner et al., 2008</xref> to correlate negatively with the amount of damaged proteins (inclusion bodies) in individual cells. They also found that protein aggregates were more often associated with the old pole of the mother, in which case damaged proteins are partitioned asymmetrically by the mother to its daughters. However, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govers et al., 2018</xref> has reported a weaker and nonsignificant negative correlation. Because the two studies used different external stressors (to induce damage) and fluorescent reporters, they are not fully comparable and the relationship between elongation rate and the damaged proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> remains unresolved (see ‘Discussion’ for additional details). Despite the differences between Lindner et al. and Govers et al., protein aggregates often have a negative qualitative effect on cell health and viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maisonneuve et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gatti-Lafranconi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schramm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rang et al., 2018</xref>), and more so in old daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vedel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winkler et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell division and polarity in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Assignment of old (red) and new (blue) poles and daughters. The starting cell is white because it was randomly picked to start the experiment and its polarity was unknown. Because the division plane (dashed line) cuts the white cell at the midpoint of the long axis, the poles formed at the division point are new and the distal poles are old. At the next division, the new daughter acquires the new pole, while the old daughter receives the old pole. Note that two divisions must be tracked to determine the old and new daughters from the starting white cell. The outlines of the bottom four daughters in the figure are colored red and blue to identify them as old and new daughters, while the intracellular red and blue colors identify the old and new poles, also designated as O and N. Although old and new poles and daughters are here tracked for only two generations, the notation and tracking methods can be extended into generations 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and further if needed. For example, if the old and new poles of any of the four daughters after two divisions are known as in (<bold>A</bold>), and these daughters elongate, become a mother, and divide to produce two grand-daughters, the polarity of the grand-daughters can be determined by the same tracking methods.

The asymmetry creates fitness variance between daughters that increases the effectiveness of natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chao et al., 2016</xref>), and an asymmetrical lineage has more progeny over time relative to a symmetrical one. An analogy comes from economic models. Two asymmetrical $500 bank accounts at 10 and 6% yield more money over time than two symmetrical $500 accounts at 8%. However, the asymmetry comes with costs. While the higher elongation rate of the new daughter rises in the lineage over generations, the rate of the old daughter declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao, 2010</xref>). Under more benign culture conditions, the rise and the decline can achieve stable values and the lineages are immortal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Łapińska et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rang et al., 2012</xref>). Under more stressful and damage-inducing conditions, the old daughter lineage can die because its elongation rate declines to zero and the death probability is dosage dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>). The bacterial population survives despite the death of the old daughter lineage because the new daughter lineage is still able to achieve a stable rate that is greater than zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>). Because the elongation rate declines and death of the old daughter lineage is a form of physiological aging, bacteria can be used to investigate the evolutionary origins of biological aging. Despite a quantitative correlation between the amount of damaged proteins and elongation rates remaining unresolved (see above), the asymmetries here described for elongation rates and death strongly suggest that damage stress in <italic>E. coli</italic> may play a key, if not causal, role in cell aging. We note that the asymmetrical partitioning of damage is not an alternative to protein repair, or vice versa. Protein repair (including reprocessing) is occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ezraty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merdanovic et al., 2011</xref>) and its effect is to lower the damage rate experienced by the cell. However, if damage aggregates are present in cells, the damage rate must necessarily exceed the repair rate. There is likely a cost to repair, in which case the repair rate may become limited by diminishing returns. Thus, the asymmetry could be an evolutionary adaptation for dealing with a low repair rate. If repair rates were sufficiently high to negate damage, <italic>E. coli</italic> should not have evolved asymmetry.</p><p>To develop further our understanding bacterial aging, our previous study examined the distribution of expressed native (not fused to another protein) GFP molecules in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). We found that the GFP density was higher in new poles than in old ones and in cells with a faster elongation rate. To take the analysis one step further, we present here results from our examination of the distribution of ribosomes in the poles and daughters of single <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. We used the <italic>yfp</italic> (yellow fluorescent protein) and S2 subunit (<italic>rpsB</italic> gene) fusion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref> as a reporter for ribosomal density. The S2-YFP construct is an effective fluorescent reporter. The S2 ribosomal subunit makes a desirable reporting partner because free subunits are negligible and nearly all cellular S2-YFP is incorporated into ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanamrad et al., 2014</xref>). Almost all of the detected fluorescent S2-YFP comes from copies are already incorporated in ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref> used S2-YFP to successfully make a more detailed map of the nucleoid/ribosome segregation. Most importantly, because fluorescent reporters can produce artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Swulius and Jensen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Landgraf et al., 2012</xref>), YFP and S2-YFP were extensively tested to validate that the reported fluorescence was not artifactual. These tests are detailed next.</p><p>The tests validating YFP and S2-YFP followed the methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Landgraf et al., 2012</xref> by which validation requires that either fluorescent aggregation, clusters, or foci are reported when non-uniformity is expected by an assay or alternatively not reported when uniformity is expected. An artifact occurs when uniformity is reported when non-uniformity is expected (and vice versa). Because reporting artifacts depend on the protein to which a fluorescent reporter is fused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Landgraf et al., 2012</xref>), a reporter that makes artifacts with one protein does not necessarily make it with a second. Thus, many of the tests were targeted specifically to the S2-YFP construct. (i) A first test focused on native YFP (not fused to any protein) because an earlier study suggested that YFP produced artifactual non-uniformity due to self-aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govers et al., 2018</xref>). This test was needed because the self-aggregation results were based on a fusion construct of the chaperone IbpA and YFP. However, was the self-aggregation a property of YFP or an interaction with IbpA? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref> found that native YFP reported a uniform distribution, in which case YFP is not inherently prone to self-aggregation artifacts (see also ‘IbpA-YFP self-aggregation’ in ‘Discussion’). (ii) If YFP is fused to OmpR, which is a regulator that binds to the OmpC and OmpF loci, and the three loci (OmpR-YFP, OmpC, and OmpF) are expressed from the bacterial chromosome (hereafter strain A), the fluorescence distribution is uniform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batchelor and Goulian, 2006</xref>). Because the chromosome has a low copy number, most OmpR-YFP is distributed over the entire cell. Some OmpR-YFP is bound to OmpC and OmpF but they are too few to produce a fluorescence focus. If OmpC and OmpF are cloned into the multi-copy plasmid pBR322, which forms clusters in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pogliano et al., 2001</xref>), and the plasmid is inserted into strain A (making strain B), a fluorescence focus reporting the plasmid cluster emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batchelor and Goulian, 2006</xref>). Additionally, if native OmpR (not fused to YFP or any fluorescent reporter) is over-expressed from a second plasmid that is inserted into strain B (making strain C), the fluorescence focus disappears because the more numerous native OmpR outcompetes OmpR-YFP in binding to the pBR322/OmpC-OmpF cluster. Thus, OmpR-YFP is responding correctly when either uniformity or non-uniformity is expected. (iii) To confirm that the nucleoid/ribosome segregation they observed was not due to YFP reporting artifacts, Bakshi et al. repeated their experiments by adding rifampicin and chloramphenicol, two antibiotics that affect the distribution of the nucleoid DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabrera et al., 2009</xref>). Whereas the nucleoid is expanded and rendered more uniform by rifampicin, it is compacted and clumped by chloramphenicol. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref> found that the fluorescence reported by S2-YFP became more uniform with rifampicin but more clumped and non-uniform with chloramphenicol. As the nucleoid expanded with rifampicin, the ribosome distribution also expanded as it filled the spaces created by the nucleoid expansion. On the other hand, as the nucleoid contracted with chloramphenicol, the ribosomes were excluded from the space occupied by the more clumped nucleoid and they in turn became less uniform. In summary, these YFP, OmpR-, and S2- controls give us confidence that S2-YFP is a reliable reporter for ribosomes and that reported fluorescence foci are better explained by the non-uniform properties of the cell rather than any inherent property or artifact of YFP. We find these tests that functionally validate S2-YFP to be more convincing than examining S2 fused with more fluorescent reporters. If two reporters disagree, which one is the artifact? If they agree, are they both truthful or artifactual?</p><p>Our examination of the distribution of ribosomes with S2-YFP could be particularly instructive. First, while Bakshi et al. have shown that ribosomes congregate in the poles, it is not known if ribosomal densities differ between old and new daughters or their poles. Second, our previous report of more expressed gene products in new poles and daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2020</xref>) could have resulted from regulatory factors acting on a specific gene or at a higher upstream level such as ribosomal abundance. In the latter case, the consequences would be much more fundamental as they could affect the entire proteome. The fact that ribosomal density and elongation rates are highly correlated in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schaechter et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neidhardt and Magasanik, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kjeldgaard and Kurland, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poulsen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greulich et al., 2015</xref>) additionally reinforces the importance of knowing the distribution of ribosomes in the poles and daughters of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Lastly, given that ribosomes occupy nearly 40% of the cytoplasmic volume of an <italic>E. coli</italic> cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woldringh and Nanninga, 1985</xref>) and that both ribosomes and damage aggregates tend to reside in the poles, the possibility that the two could be excluding each other at the poles becomes a probability. However, a space-limiting model as a hypothesis for explaining bacterial aging requires first that the distribution of ribosomes in old and new poles or daughters be characterized. Here, we present the results of our study quantifying the temporal and spatial distribution of ribosomes in single <italic>E. coli</italic> cells by time-lapse microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Following ‘Materials and methods’, the distribution of ribosomes was measured in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain AFS55 with a fluorescent <italic>yfp</italic> reporter fused to the ribosomal subunit S25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref>). Fluorescence levels were quantified from time-lapse images of single cells cultured on agarose pads. Because the level recorded for a cell on an image is affected by the light that the cell loses by diffraction and gains by diffraction from neighboring cells, the diffractional scatter of all images was corrected by deconvolution. Red and blue colors in the figures represent old and new daughters or mothers, respectively. Ratio data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) were derived from estimates that were not normalized. All other data for cell length, ribosomal density, and time were normalized when pooling and comparing cells. All error bars are ± SEM and statistical details are presented in figure legends.</p><p>We first examined the density of ribosomes in colonies starting from a single cell. A quick visual inspection of the fluorescent images and their heatmaps for a few representative cells showed clearly that the ribosomal densities tended to be highest near the poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, high densities also built up in the mid-region of a mother cell right before division. As the mid-region leads to the formation of the new poles of the daughters, the buildup explains how those poles acquired their higher levels. These polar concentrations of ribosomal densities matched the previous ones reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref>. To obtain a more quantitative analysis of the changes in ribosomal densities during cell growth, we collected a larger sample size and compared measurements between old and new mothers, old and new daughters, between their poles, along the length of their cells, and during their elongation from birth to division.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>New daughters at birth from old mothers have more ribosomes</title><p>A first comparison revealed that if a pair of old and new daughters descending from the same mother were compared, ribosome density measured by the fluorescence was higher for new daughters. The ratio of reported fluorescence between new/old daughters (the daughter ratio) was 1.08 ± 0.012, which was significantly greater than 1.00 (p=4.38 × 10<sup>–6</sup>). However, if the mothers were split into pools of old and new mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the daughter ratio from old mothers was 1.11 ± 0.018 and significantly greater than 1.00 (p=6.89 × 10–6) and the ratio from new mothers was 1.04 ± 0.015 and barely significant (p=0.04). Thus, the higher ribosome density in new daughters resulted primarily from old mothers. The difference between old and new mothers was further demonstrated by a strong significant difference between their daughter ratios (1.11 vs. 1.04; p=0.007). Thus, new daughters have more ribosomes relative to old daughters produced by the same mother, but asymmetry is higher in pairs from old mothers. This higher density of ribosomes in new daughters correlates qualitatively with our previously reported higher levels of expressed gene products and elongation rates in new daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ratios of ribosome density and elongation rates within and between cells.</title><p>Because ratios are a form of normalization, their values were derived from non-normalized data.

The two pole halves were transformed into a ratio (new/old) for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that pole ratio in old mothers was significantly greater than 1.00 (1.10 ± 0.015; p=6.23 × 10<sup>–5</sup>). The pole ratio in new mothers was much lower (1.03 ± 0.010) and not significantly greater than 1.00 (p=0.08). The pole ratios between new and old mothers were significantly different from each other (p=1.3 × 10<sup>–4</sup>). Thus, the density of ribosomes in the old and new poles of mothers matches well the density in the old and new daughters of both old and new mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). This match argues that the physical placement of ribosomes in the mother at the time of division sets in place the ribosome distribution in the daughters. To test this argument, we compared directly the ribosomal pole ratio of an individual mother against the ribosomal daughter ratio of the same mother. No significant difference was found, in both old and new mothers, when the ribosomal ratio of the poles and daughters was compared. With new mothers, the pole and daughter ratios were respectively 1.03 vs. 1.04 and not different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; p=0.27). With old mothers, the respective ratios were 1.10 vs. 1.1 and also not different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; p=0.62). Thus, as the new and old pole halves yield directly the new and old daughters upon the division of a mother, the placement of ribosomes in the mother cell sets up the quantity, and hence asymmetry, of ribosomes in the new and old daughters of a mother.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Stochastic and deterministic components of ribosomal variance in daughter cells</title><p>Although new and old daughters can differ significantly in ribosome density, there was also substantial variation within each daughter population. A plot of the distributions shows clearly the within-population variation, although the difference between old and new daughters is also apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Old and new daughters form their own distributions, but their mean values are displaced by a difference D, which is larger when the daughters are derived from old mothers. The variation within the old and new daughter distributions is presumably due to stochastic noise, although the stochasticity could also result from an unknown deterministic source. The latter is well illustrated by the discovery that <italic>E. coli</italic> mothers produce asymmetrical daughters. For example, without knowledge about the asymmetry, old and new daughters would have been pooled into one population with a total variance V<sub>T</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; dashed lines), which would have been interpreted to result from stochasticity. In reality, V<sub>T</sub> would actually have a deterministic component due to the difference between old and new daughters. As we have shown for expressed gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2020</xref>), V<sub>T</sub> = (V<sub>Old</sub> +V<sub>New</sub>)/2 + D<sup>2</sup>/4, when there is deterministic asymmetry (D &gt; 0) and V<sub>Old</sub> and V<sub>New</sub> are the variances of the unpooled old and new daughter populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; red and blue lines). If D = 0, V<sub>T</sub> is the average of V<sub>Old</sub> and V<sub>New</sub>. Thus, D<sup>2</sup>/4 represents the deterministic component of V<sub>T</sub>, and the contribution of deterministic asymmetry expressed as a percentage is h<sup>2</sup> = (D<sup>2</sup>/4)/V<sub>T</sub>. Our estimates of D showed that h<sup>2</sup> was 39.9% from old mothers and 2.4% from new mothers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1A</xref>). The higher h<italic><sup>2</sup></italic> for daughters from old mothers is consistent with our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> that show old mothers having more different daughters than new mothers. These results were also consistent with our previous report that h<sup>2</sup> is higher for expressed gene products in daughters of old than of new mothers (h<sup>2</sup> of 40.1 and 10.1%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, a claim of stochasticity to explain the variance of ribosomal density of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells could have introduced an error of nearly 40% without knowledge of the asymmetry between old and new daughters. Without knowing more, we presume that the variances V<sub>Old</sub> and V<sub>New</sub> result from stochasticity, but it may also be that a deterministic process still lies hidden.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Variation in ribosome density and elongation rate in old and new daughters from old and new mothers.</title><p>The measurements were made from the same cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.

When new and old daughters were pooled irrespective of whether they originated from old or new mothers, new daughters were found to elongate faster than old daughters (new/old ratio of 1.09 ± 0.011; p=3.9 × 10<sup>–16</sup>). When the old and new daughters were separated as descending from old or new mothers, the ratio was respectively 1.11 ± 0.017 (p=1.3 × 10<sup>–10</sup>) and 1.07 ± 0.011 (p=2.8 × 10<sup>–7</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although both ratios were significantly greater than 1.00, the asymmetry was greater between daughters from old mothers and the two ratios were significantly different (p=0.02). As we did for the ribosome data, the variance of elongation rate measurements was also portioned into a deterministic and stochastic component to estimate the percentage h<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). The deterministic percentage of the variance was found to be h<sup>2</sup> = 18.5% and 12.2% for daughters originating from old and new mothers, respectively. As we observed for ribosome densities, the h<sup>2</sup> for old mothers was still higher, but not to the same magnitude (see ‘Discussion’).

Thus, we increased the resolution of the process by sampling over a finer spatial (lengthwise) and temporal (birth to division) grain of the ribosomal density in a mother cell. The length of the mother cell was divided into four quartiles, which were termed NP (new pole), L2, L3, and OP (old pole) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The time from birth to division of the mother cell was also divided into four quartiles termed birth (B), T2, T3, and division (D). Ribosome density and the quartiles of length and time were all normalized for pooling the cells. Note that because ribosome densities are normalized, they indicate relative rather than absolute amounts and the former can change even when the latter is constant.</p><p>We first examined whether the new length quartile results were consistent with our previous ribosome pole ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) for the new and old pole halves in the mothers.

The ratios increased from birth to division in both old and new mothers, but increase was significant only for the old mothers (p=0.026 vs. 0.59, respectively). The rapid rise in the old mothers also began from a higher value at birth. More importantly, the final ratio values at quartile D (1.11 and 1.02 for old and new mothers, respectively) were comparable to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> (1.11 and 1.04), which was also timed to division. Thus, old mothers magnified the asymmetry of their ribosome distribution over time to achieve the higher ratio that we used above to explain the larger asymmetry of their daughters. On the other hand, the new mothers began with a pole ratio close to 1.02 and did not change over time, which explained the higher symmetry of their daughters.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Ratio of ribosome density in old and new mothers over quartile time from birth to division.</title><p>Ratios correspond to density in the new pole half divided by density in the old pole half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) of the mothers.

Several key patterns emerged. First, the trajectories decreased in NP and OP and increased in L2 and L3 in both old and new mothers. Moreover, the density at the final time quartile D was L2 &gt; NP and L3 &gt; OP. Because L2 and L3 are the new poles of the daughters after division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the daughters were already being provisioned by their mothers to be biased to have more ribosomes at their future new poles at the expense of their future old poles. Second, the trajectories of new mothers in NP-L2 were mirrored by L3-OP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; blue lines), that is, NP was more similar to OP, and L2 more similar to L3. The trajectory slopes of NP vs. OP (–0.00520 ± 0.00313 to –0.00809 ± 0.00340; p&gt;0.05) and L2 vs. L3 (0.00675 ± 0.00200 vs. 0.00655 ± 0.00198; p&gt;0.05) were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, ribosomes were being redistributed from NP and OP to L2 and L3 in an equal manner and the lower asymmetry of new mothers was being maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Third, the trajectories for the old mothers had a higher asymmetrical signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; red lines). They resided above the new mother trajectories in NP and declined until they were below in OP. Moreover, the trajectory slopes of NP vs. OP (–0.00390 ± 0.00313 to –0.00803 ± 0.00347; p&lt;0.05) and L2 vs. L3 (0.00788 ± 0.00220 vs. 0.00405 ± 0.00217; p&lt;0.05) were now significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, relative to L3 and OP, NP and L2 not only began at birth with more ribosomes, but also NP lost fewer and L2 acquired more ribosomes over time.

The causal trigger for the asymmetry between the daughters remains unknown, although damaged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindner et al., 2008</xref>), expressed gene products (GFP), and now ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; see below) have been shown to correlate with the differences in elongation rate. Damage may have the strongest causal link because the addition of external damage agents such as heat, phototoxicity, and antibiotics increases differentially the death probability of old daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>). Because new daughters are born with less damage, they are not killed by the damage agents and allow for the survival of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>). The elongation rate differences have an epigenetic effect because slow mothers produce slower daughter pairs, although the new daughter is still quicker within the pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rang et al., 2011</xref>). If the causal factor were damaged proteins, the epigenetic interpretation is that the slower mother has more damage than average, and therefore the old and new daughters receive also more than their respective averages but the asymmetry is preserved because the former still gets more than the latter.</p><p>Because old daughters are more vulnerable to cell death than new daughters (see above), the elongation rate asymmetry can be considered a form of biological aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, <italic>E. coli</italic> is a model for the evolutionary origin of biological aging from single-celled organisms. We would extend the argument to suggest that the old daughters are more properly considered to be the continuation of mother, and the new daughters are the true daughters. Given an epigenetic factor that slows the elongation rate of a cell, the mother retains a larger pool during division and it ages. The daughter is allocated less and it is rejuvenated. The larger pool that the mother does not transmit to the daughter is the original soma. Aging is the price that a mother pays to produce healthy daughters. Because the elongation rate asymmetry between mothers and daughters maximizes the fitness of the lineage (see ‘Introduction’), aging is indirectly favored by natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chao et al., 2016</xref>). Because the origin of life required organization of genetic material into protocells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chao, 1991</xref>) in hazardous damage-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miller and Urey, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Michaelian, 2011</xref>), biological aging may have evolved in the first life forms.</p><p>The higher vulnerability of old daughters (or old mothers) in the presence of added damage agents was quantified by estimating the mean <italic>a</italic> and the variance <italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup> of the regression (or mapping) coefficient of the doubling time (DT) of daughters onto mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>). The vulnerability is high if (<italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup> + <italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup>) &lt; 1 because the daughter could then acquire a very long DT and fail to divide. For example, if <italic>a</italic> = 1.1, a mother with DT = 40 min would have a daughter with a longer DT = 1.1 * 40 min, and the DT of each subsequent daughter in the lineage is even longer. If <italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup> is large, then by chance the DT of a daughter could also be vulnerably long. When damage agents were added, the old daughters were the first ones to die because their values of <italic>a</italic> and <italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup> increased above the threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the asymmetry between old and new daughters is extended to include the values of <italic>a</italic> and <italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup>.</p><p>A question that is often raised is why evolution by natural selection is not able to minimize <italic>a</italic> and <italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup> to diminish the window of vulnerability. An answer is that it does, but the damage agents are pathological conditions beyond the physiological limits. We suggest an additional answer for <italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup> based on our variance measurements for ribosome density and elongation rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). From those measurements, we estimated the stochastic and deterministic components of the variances. The deterministic component, which resulted from the old and new daughter asymmetry, was D<sup>2</sup>/4. The stochastic component is therefore V<sub>E</sub> = V<sub>T</sub> – D<sup>2</sup>/4 = V<sub>T</sub> (1 – h<sup>2</sup>). V<sub>E</sub> is comparable to <italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup> because both describe phenotypic variation in a clonal population and are generated by stochastic noise. From our measured values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1C</xref>), V<sub>E</sub> for ribosome density was 0.0038 and 0.0034 in old and new mothers and not significantly different (p=0.40). For elongation rate, V<sub>E</sub> was 0.074 and 0.051, significantly higher in old mothers (p=.007), and comparable with the trend reported for <italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>). A cross-comparison of V<sub>E</sub> for ribosome and elongation showed that the latter was significantly higher both in old mothers (0.00381 vs. 0.00744; p=1 × 10<sup>–6</sup>) and in new mothers (0.00338 vs. 0.00510; p=0.0041). This inflation of the elongation V<sub>E</sub> is consistent with the hypothesis that downstream traits are inherently noisier because they are at the end of many converging pathways or networks, each one with its own inherent noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Price and Schluter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Houle, 1992</xref>). Because ribosomes are farther upstream, they have fewer inputs and a lower final V<sub>E</sub>. Thus, another answer is that although complex traits such as elongation are important for a cell and under strong natural selection, they are most likely downstream and their V<sub>E</sub> are noisier and higher in value.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that old and new daughters in <italic>E. coli</italic> are asymmetrical for elongation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Łapińska et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rang et al., 2011</xref>), gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2020</xref>), and vulnerability to dying in the presence of damage agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proenca et al., 2019</xref>). We show here that the variances (V<sub>E</sub>) of ribosome density and elongation rates are also asymmetric. If asymmetry is a central characteristic of bacterial aging, identifying its cause becomes an important goal. We began our studies by examining asymmetry for elongation rates, and then to gene products and now to ribosomes. Because ribosomes are positioned highly upstream in the pathway of these cells and their abundance correlates strongly with elongation rates in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schaechter et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neidhardt and Magasanik, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kjeldgaard and Kurland, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poulsen et al., 1995</xref>), their physiological role is both fundamental and general. As we have argued, our previous report on the asymmetry of gene products was instructive but left uncertain whether the outcome was unique to the gene that was studied or a more general phenomenon. Our present results on ribosome asymmetry move the process to a more fundamental level because ribosomes can affect more genes and more downstream processes. More importantly, existing measurements of ribosome cytology and cell growth in <italic>E. coli</italic>, in conjunction with our new results, allow us to quantitatively evaluate, understandingly not to prove, our previous suggestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2020</xref>) that space competition between damage aggregates and ribosomes could be responsible for the asymmetry.</p><p>The nucleoid and ribosomes in a rod-shaped <italic>E. coli</italic> occupy non-overlapping space along the length of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref>). At birth, the cells are smaller and the nucleiod resides at the mid-region of the rod and the ribosomes are displaced to the poles. As the cell elongates, the nucleoid splits to create the two nucleoids for the daughters. The splitting opens space in mid-region and the void is then filled by the ribosomes. Cell division ensues with a cleavage at the mid-region, and the ribosomes at the mid-region are distributed to the new poles of the daughters. However, the data used to generate this description did not distinguish between old and new poles or daughters. As a result, the cells were oriented randomly, and the resulting profiles are generic averages and necessarily symmetrical. When we distinguished between the old and new poles and daughters, the ribosome distribution resembles the generic profile only in new mothers and is asymmetrical in old mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Because damage aggregates also tend to reside at the poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindner et al., 2008</xref>), we need to evaluate whether the volume of added aggregates displaced a volume of ribosomes that could quantitatively account for the elongation rate difference between old and new daughters from old mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Such an analysis is possible using published information.</p><p>Single-cell measurements estimate elongation rates for <italic>E. coli</italic> to be 2.148 and 1.964 hr<sup>–1</sup> for new and old daughters in rich media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>). The well-known linear relationship between elongation rate and ribosomal content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schaechter et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neidhardt and Magasanik, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kjeldgaard and Kurland, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greulich et al., 2015</xref>) can be quantified from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poulsen et al., 1995</xref>) as Y = 337.046 ∙ X+87.167, where Y is ribosomal content (A.U.) and X is elongation rate (hr<sup>–1</sup>). The relationship between ribosome density and elongation rate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> could not be used because the values were normalized. Letting X<sub>New</sub> = 2.148 and X<sub>Old</sub> = 1.964 hr<sup>–1</sup> from above, Y<sub>New</sub> = 811.02 and Y<sub>Old</sub> = 749.08 A.U. The proportional reduction of ribosomes in the old daughter relative to the new daughter is therefore <italic>p</italic> = (811.02–749.08)/811.02 = 0.0764. The total volume occupied by ribosomes in rich media is estimated to be V<sub>ribo</sub> = 0.79 μm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woldringh and Nanninga, 1985</xref>). The volume needed to reduce the elongate rate of the old daughter to 1.964 hr<sup>–1</sup> becomes ∆ = <italic>p</italic>∙V<sub>ribo</sub> = 0.0764 ∙ 0.79 = 0.0603 μm<sup>3</sup>. Aggregate radii have been estimated from diffusion constants for <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in rich media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coquel et al., 2013</xref>). By converting the radii to a sphere as (4π/3) ∙ radius<sup>3</sup>, the largest aggregates had mean values of 0.0852 μm<sup>3</sup>, which is well in the range of our estimate of ∆ = 0.0603 μm<sup>3</sup>. Thus, space competition between aggregates and ribosomes could quantitatively account for the lower elongation rate of old daughters of old mothers.</p><p>Our above space competition model implies that elongation rates and the size of damage aggregates should be negatively correlated. However, while the initial study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindner et al., 2008</xref> found a strong and significant negative correlation (p&lt;0.0001), a later study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govers et al., 2018</xref> found one that was negative but nonsignificant (p=0.08). Lindner et al. and Govers et al., respectively, used different stressors to induce damage (streptomycin and heat shock) and fluorescent reporters (YFP and msfGFP) to quantify aggregate size. The YFP and msfGFP used in both studies were fused to the chaperone IbpA, which associates to aggregates of damaged proteins. Because Govers et al. believed that IbpA-YFP formed self-aggregates they suggested that the correlation of Lindner et al. was an artifact of YFP self-aggregation. However, the rejection of Lindner et al. may be premature. First, the suggestion of YFP self-aggregation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govers et al., 2018</xref> was based on their demonstration that IbpA-YFP increased the expression of IbpA (at another locus), which is induced by perturbations to protein homeostasis. The expression was not increased in the IbpA-msfGFP control. Because the assay was conducted in the absence of heat shock or another stressor, they surmised that it was YFP self-aggregates that had perturbed the homeostasis. However, a recent report that IbpA self-represses its own translation because over-expression is harmful in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miwa et al., 2021</xref>) suggests an alternative explanation for why IbpA-YFP increased expression. It could be that IbpA-YFP was unable to self-repress because of its larger size. Second, msfGFP-YFP may have its own issues because super-folding GFPs are more prone to photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valbuena et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pédelacq et al., 2006</xref>). Could photobleaching have weakened the correlation of Govers et al. and rendered it nonsignificant? Third, most importantly, the correlations of Lindner et al. and Govers et al. must be compared with caution. While Lindner et al. induced cell damage with 10 µg ml<sup>–1</sup> of streptomycin, where the minimal inhibitory concentration is 16–32 µg ml<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tashiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Regoes et al., 2004</xref>), Govers et al. used 47°C heat shock for 15 min, where 50°C at 15 min is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govers et al., 2018</xref>). Although both Lindner et al. and Govers et al. grew their cells in LB broth, the elongation rate in the two studies, respectively, centered about 0.35 hr<sup>–1</sup> and 0.25 hr<sup>–1</sup> (19 and 27 min doubling times). To have a doubling time of 27 min in LB, the cells in Govers et al. must have experienced severe stress and damage. In relative terms, the two treatments, respectively, were 10/16 to 10/32 = 63% to 31% vs. 47/50 = 94% of stopping growth. It is likely that at 94% lethality the stress level in Govers et al. is collapsing most cellular processes, including protein aggregation. This possibility is supported by Govers et al.’s measurement of the mean IbpA-msfGFP fluorescence per cell as a function of increasing heat shock temperature. The mean response increased linearly from 42°C up to 48°C, and then from 48°C to 50°C it crashed abruptly back to the control level (shock-free) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govers et al., 2018</xref>). If the accuracy of laboratory incubators is ± 1°C, Govers et al. were using IbpA-msfGFP dangerously near the failure point of the reporter, which could have underestimated (or estimated with more error) the true amount of protein damage in the cells. If a 47°C heat shock induced damage to other cellular components besides proteins (e.g., DNA), the IbpA-msfGFP would not have reported them. High heat can damage DNA and elevate mutation rates in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zamenhof and Greer, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2018</xref>). The choice of 47°C was justified because Govers et al. wanted to test whether protein aggregates could protect cells from new damage. However, if the underestimates or statistical analyses weakened by measurement errors compromised the correlation of Govers et al., the two correlations are not equivalent and cannot be used to reject each other.</p><p>Until new studies prove otherwise, we believe that the elongation rate and aggregate correlations of Lindner et al. and Govers et al. should be viewed as alternative models to be further tested. Although the correlations do not bear directly on our ribosome results, they are relevant to our discussion of the relationship of ribosomes, damage aggregates, and elongation rates. Our space competition model (see above) was evaluated to test whether our data was (or was not) quantitatively consistent with the correlation reported by Lindner et al. We look forward to other tests or challenges as connecting the two correlations will be critical. The protection uncovered by Govers et al. is an exciting new phenomenon. However, we are most excited by the possibility that both correlations are correct and protein aggregates are harmful and protective under low and high stress, respectively. At low stress levels, proteins could be the main target of damage and the amount of protein aggregates correlates with elongation rate. The damaged proteins are aggregated and then partitioned asymmetrically between the daughters. Protein repair is occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ezraty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merdanovic et al., 2011</xref>) and its effect is to lower the damage rate experienced by the cell. If aggregates are observed, damage rates must be exceeding repair rates. However, a full stress response (e.g., SOS, efflux transporters, and RpoS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roemhild et al., 2022</xref>) is too costly and unnecessary. At high stress levels and near lethality, proteins, DNA, and other cellular processes (including protein aggregation and IbpA-msfGFP reporting) are all failing due to damage and the correlation between elongation rate and protein aggregates is weakened. In order to survive, the cell needs a full stress response and aggregates become beneficial because they are present to act as a trigger (or the ‘epigenetic memory’ of Govers et al.). In effect, protein aggregates at high levels are inducing persister states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leszczynska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dewachter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goode et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balaban et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, previous reports have documented in <italic>E. coli</italic> the asymmetrical associations between bacterial aging, elongation rates, cell poles, damage aggregates, and expressed gene products, and we have added one more phenotype, the density of ribosomes. Because ribosomes have a fundamental role in determining cell function, our results indicate that bacterial aging and the asymmetry are resulting from processes that are central to cell function and not just a subset of genes or pathways. Moreover, ribosomal function has been well characterized and the information allowed us to show that space competition between ribosomes and damage aggregates, both of which tend to reside in the poles, could quantitatively account for the elongation rate asymmetry between old and new daughters. The latter calculation does not prove a causal role for damage aggregates, but we hope it will motivate and guide new research to evaluate hypotheses emanating from the work by us and others.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strain</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> AFS55 was used to quantify ribosome density.

To be able to quantify the fluorescence of growing single cells, movies were started and ended following guidelines.

To avoid the effects of crowding within the micro-colonies, movies were ended when micro-colonies exceeded 128 cells. Phase-contrast and fluorescence images were recorded every 2 and 20 min, respectively.

Because a cell in a micro-colony receives scattered fluorescence light from neighboring cells, the value of a fluorescence pixel inside a cell is the sum of the true emission of the pixel plus the scatter. Note that background pixels, which are outside a cell and lacking a fluorescent reporter, should have a true emission of zero (not be emitting) and only contain scatter from pixels in the neighboring cells. The true emission can be estimated by dividing the image into all its pixels, treating the pixels as light point sources, using a system of differential equations to describe the scatter from every pixel to every other pixel, and solving the system. Because every fluorescence image has a matching phase image (see above fluorescence–phase pair), any single cell can be outlined in the phase image. The correct total amount of fluorescence in the cell is therefore the true emission of all pixels contained by the outline. However, because in practice the value of a pixel is measured with error (stochasticity), the system cannot be solved analytically and must be solved numerically by the iterative process of deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lucy, 1974</xref>). Deconvolution introduces a new problem because the number of iterations needs to be optimized. The true emission is underestimated if too few iterations are conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biggs and Andrews, 1997</xref>). Too many iterations also underestimate, but by introducing ringing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mosleh et al., 2014</xref>). Ringing results when a background pixel is brighter than average and is treated as an emitting pixel by the over-iteration. As a result, the over-iteration removes light from the true emission value of the pixels inside cells and allocates them to such background pixels. By tracking and plotting the sum of all pixels in a cell as a function of iterations, we have found that the sum invariably produced a peak by increasing initially and then decreasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). The number of iterations corresponding to the peak is chosen as the desired number that balanced the opposing effects of under and over-iterating. Because a detailed description has been published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2020</xref>, we present next a more abbreviated technical summary.</p><p>The background of the fluorescence–phase image pairs (see above) was first subtracted using the ‘rolling ball’ algorithm in ImageJ (NIH) with ball radius 20 pixels. The noise created by the heat overflow of single pixel was corrected using the ‘remove outliers’ algorithm in ImageJ with a threshold intensity difference of 1000 and threshold radius of 0.5 pixel. The resulting image was processed by iterative Lucy–Richardson deconvolution in MATLAB 2017b using an optimal number of iterations for each fluorescence–phase pair as described above. The outline of a single cell was traced manually with ImageJ. Blind replicates without any awareness of the history of the cells found no bias between outlines measured for old and new mothers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analyses, data measurements, and normalization</title><p>Standard <italic>t</italic>-test and regression analyses were implemented with packaged R functions. All reported error bars are standard error of the mean (SEM).</p><p>Following deconvolution, fluorescence images and the outlines of cells were imported as data matrices into computational R-programs. For fluorescence measurements reporting ribosomal density, the outlines were cut into the desired number of partitions (halves or quartiles; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the partitions were superimposed onto the fluorescence images, and the fluorescence pixel values contained by each partition were summed. The sum was then divided by the area of the partitions to obtain the average pixel value or density. The elongation rate of a cell was estimated as <italic>r</italic> = ln(L<sub>T</sub>/L<sub>0</sub>)/T, where L<sub>T</sub> and L<sub>0</sub> are the lengths of the cell when it was born and divided, respectively, and T is the time to division (min). Cell length measured manually from the phase images with ImageJ. A log transformation was used because elongation rates are known to be exponential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, ribosome densities (here denoted X) were normalized as (X – u)/u, where u = (X<sub>Old</sub> + X<sub>New</sub>)/2. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, elongation rates were likewise normalized. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the cells were pooled by first dividing each cell into four length quartiles (NP, L2, L3, and OP; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Each cell was then normalized by dividing the ribosome density of each of the cell’s quartiles by the sum of the ribosome density of the cell’s four quartiles. After normalization, the sum equals 1.0. For statistical comparisons between two regression slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the SEM values and sample sizes from the regression were used to estimate the resulting <italic>t</italic>-statistic and ensuing p-value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sokal and Rohlf, 1995</xref>).</p><p>To pool cells for comparison over a time cycle from birth to division, time was normalized into quartiles (B, T2, T3, and D; birth, quartile 2, quartile 3, and division). For example, given a cell with a division time of 28 min and time-lapse images of the cell from birth to division, the images from the window <italic>t</italic> = [0–7], [7–14], [14–21], and [21–28] min. Because time quartiles are dimensionless, we provide as a reference the mean division times that were observed. The means for old and new daughters (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>) were, respectively, 74.58 and 67.48 min (from old mothers; n = 216) and 69.76 and 65.71 min (from new mothers; n = 198).</p><p>All statistical analyses were conducted with both length and ribosome densities values normalized as halves or quartiles. We provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> a plot of ribosomal density versus length as a continuous variable for visualization and reference.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-89543-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data analyzed and presented in Figures are available in Dryad in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.59zw3r2jg">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.59zw3r2jg</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chao</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>CK</given-names></name><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Rang</surname><given-names>CU</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Spatial and temporal distribution of ribosomes in single cells reveals aging differences between old and new daughters of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic></data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.59zw3r2jg</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank James Weisshaar for the bacterial strain.

We have been interested in the evolution of asymmetric bacterial growth and aging for many years. However, a motivational difference is that we are more interested in the evolutionary process, and evolution by natural selection works on the phenotype. Thus, we wanted to start with the phenotype closest to fitness, appropriately defined for the conditions, work downwards. We examined first the asymmetry of elongation rates in single cells, then gene products, and now ribosomes. As we have pointed out, our demonstration of ribosomal asymmetry shows that the phenomenon was not peculiar and unique to the gene products we examined. Rather, the asymmetry is acting higher up in the metabolic network and likely affecting all genes. We find such conceptual guidance to be important. In the ideal world, of course we would have liked to have worked out the causal mechanisms in one swoop. In a less than ideal situation, it is a subjective decision as where to stop. We believe that the publication of this manuscript is more than appropriate at this juncture. We work at the interface of evolutionary theory and microbiology. Our results could appeal to both fields. If we attract new researchers, progress could be accelerated. Could the delay caused by publishing only completed stories slow the rate of discovery? These questions are likely as old as science (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2021/01/28/how-not-to-write-a-response-to-reviewers/">https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2021/01/28/how-not-to-write-a-response-to-reviewers/</ext-link>).</p><p>We present below our response to specific comments by reviewers. We have not added a new discussion of papers suggested by Reviewer #1 because we feel that the speculations would have been too unfocused. We were already criticized for speculation in the Discussion about a link between aggregate size and ribosomal density.</p><p>Respond to Major comments by Reviewer #1.</p><p>a) Fig. 1 only shows 2 divisions (rather than 3 as per Rev1) to avoid an overly elaborate figure. We have added text to the figure legend that the old and new poles and daughters in the subsequent 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 generations can be determined by following the same notations and tracking we presented for generations 1 and 2 in Fig. 1. For example, if we know the old and new poles of any of the four daughters after 2 divisions (as in Fig. 1), and allow that daughter to elongate, become a mother, and divide to produce 2 “grand-daughters”, the polarity of the grand-daughters can also be determined.</p><p>b) Because division times were normalized and analyzed as quartiles, the raw values were never used. Rather than annotating unused values, we have provided the mean division times in the Material and Methods section on normalization to provide representative values.</p><p>c) We did not quantify in our study the changes over generations for three reasons. First, the sample sizes for the first generations (cohorts of 1, 2, 4, and 8 cells) are statistically small. Second, and most importantly, cells on an agar pad in a microscope slide, despite being inoculated as fresh exponentially growing cells, experience a growth lag, as all cells transferred to a new physiological condition. Thus, to be safe, we do not collect data from cohorts 1, 2, 4, and 8 to ensure that our cells are as much as possible physiologically uniform. Lastly, as we noted in the Material and Methods they also slow down after 7 generations (128 cells). Thus, we have collected ribosome and length measurements primarily from cohorts 16, 32, 64, and 128. Measurable cells from the 128 cohort are actually rare because a colony with that many cells often starts to form double layers, which are not measurable. Most of our measurements came from the 16, 32, and 64 cohorts, in which case a time series would not be meaningful. Some of these details were not included in our manuscript but have been added to the Material and Methods (Microscopy and time-lapse movies). For these reasons we have not added a time series as requested by the reviewer.</p><p>d) We have added the additional figure as requested, but as a supplement rather than in the main article (Supplemental Materials Fig. S1). This figure showed the normalized density of ribosomes along the normalized length of old and new daughters. The density was continuous rather than quartiles. This figure was included in the original manuscript, but readers recommended that it be removed because the all the analyzed data had been done with quartiles. Readers felt mislead and confused.</p></body></sub-article></article>
