mutations affecting the structure or production of β-globin subunits in adult hemoglobin. Many gene editing efforts to treat the β-hemoglobinopathies attempt to correct β-globin mutations or increase γ-globin for fetal hemoglobin production. δ-globin, the subunit of adult hemoglobin A2, has high homology to β-globin and is already pan-cellularly expressed at low levels in adult red blood cells. However, upregulation of δ-globin is a relatively unexplored avenue to increase the amount of functional hemoglobin. Here, we use CRISPR-Cas9 to repair non-functional transcriptional elements in the endogenous promoter region of δ-globin to increase overall expression of adult hemoglobin 2 (HbA2). We find that insertion of a KLF1 site alone is insufficient to upregulate δ-globin. Instead, multiple transcription factor elements are necessary for robust upregulation of δ-globin from the endogenous locus. Promoter edited HUDEP-2 immortalized erythroid progenitor cells exhibit striking increases of <italic>HBD</italic> transcript, from less than 5% to over 20% of total β-like globins in clonal populations. Edited CD34 +hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSPCs) differentiated to primary human erythroblasts express up to 46% <italic>HBD</italic> in clonal populations. These findings add mechanistic insight to globin gene regulation and offer a new therapeutic avenue to treat β-hemoglobinopathies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hemoglobin</kwd><kwd>erythrocyte</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas9</kwd><kwd>gene-editing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ETH Zürich Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ETH Pioneer Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boontanrart</surname><given-names>Mandy Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SNSF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BRIDGE Proof of Concept</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boontanrart</surname><given-names>Mandy Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene-editing to repair non-functional transcriptional elements in the endogenous promoter of δ-globin increases overall expression of adult hemoglobin 2 (HbA2), providing proof-of-concept for a therapeutic avenue to treat β-hemoglobinopathies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, are packed with hemoglobin and circulate the body to supply all organs with oxygen. Hemoglobin is a hetero-tetrameric protein made up of two α-like and two β-like subunits. Hemoglobin A1 (HbA1) accounts for approximately 97% of the hemoglobin expressed in adults and is composed of two α-globin subunits (<italic>HBA</italic>) and two β−globin (<italic>HBB</italic>) subunits. Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) accounts for the remaining 2–3% of hemoglobin expressed in adults and is composed of two α-globin subunits and two δ-globin (<italic>HBD</italic>) subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Steinberg and Rodgers, 2015</xref>.</p><p>The β-hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia, are caused by mutations in <italic>HBB</italic> that effect the structure or expression of β-globin. The clinical hallmarks include hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusion, which can lead to acute and chronic pain and organ damage. Clinical management is limited to frequent blood transfusions and life-long treatment of anemia and pain crises. The only curative approach is allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which is dependent upon HLA-identical donor availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is the predominant hemoglobin expressed before birth, has anti-sickling properties and its re-expression is frequently pursued as a treatment for β-hemoglobinopathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wienert et al., 2018</xref>. While increasing HbF has shown to be clinically effective to combat SCD, studies have also validated the in vitro and in vivo anti-sickling abilities of δ-globin using a humanized mouse model of SCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nagel et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Poillon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Porcu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Waterman et al., 1979</xref>.</p><p>Increased HbA2 expression has some potential advantages over HbF that suggests it could provide an alternative avenue for ameliorating the β-hemoglobinopathies. HbA2 is weakly transcriptionally active and expressed pancellularly in all adult red blood cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heller and Yakulis, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Steinberg, 2021</xref>. Additionally, δ-globin shares 93% amino acid homology to β-globin, suggesting that HbA2 may be a better replacement relative to HbF, whose γ-globin subunit shares 73% amino acid homology to β-globin. Finally, HbF is known to bind oxygen more tightly than HbA1, an evolutionary advantage for the fetus to draw oxygen from the maternal blood source, while HbA2 has a similar oxygen-binding capacity as HbA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Di Cera et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Inagaki et al., 2000</xref>. On-going clinical trials re-express HbF to extremely high levels not commonly seen even in individuals with Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frangoul et al., 2021</xref>. The effect of extreme maternal HbF re-expression during pregnancy is currently unknown.</p><p>The genes for β−globin (<italic>HBB</italic>) and δ-globin (<italic>HBD</italic>) are located in the β-like globin cluster and regulated by the same control region. The β-like globin cluster is located on chromosome 11, and harbors the five β-like genes: <italic>HBB</italic> (β-globin gene), <italic>HBD</italic> (δ-globin gene), <italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic> (γ-globin genes), and HBE (ε-globin gene). β-globin and δ-globin both comprise 147 amino acids and differ at only 10 positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moleirinho et al., 2013</xref>. The extreme difference in expression levels between these two globins is not due to protein instability or differences in translation, but instead results from a lower transcription rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Steinberg and Rodgers, 2015</xref>. The globin genes are arranged in order of their expression during development and regulated by contact to a distal enhancer called the Locus Control Region that contains five active DNase Hypersensitivity Sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2002</xref>.

However, these studies do not reflect the complex chromosomal context and extensive epigenetic regulation at the β-like globin cluster. Due to the large size of the β-like globin locus, transgenic studies have mostly included only a subset of the genes of the β-like globin locus and a minimal region of the LCR. They therefore do not necessarily predict the biological outcomes of perturbations at the native β-globin locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Woodard et al., 2022</xref>.</p><p>The expression of globin genes is a tightly regulated developmental process. There are currently no drugs or therapeutic approaches to increase HbA2 for the β-hemoglobinopathies. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we used homology directed repair at the endogenous <italic>HBD</italic> promoter to engineer the transcriptional elements present in <italic>HBB</italic>. We find that insertion of single transcriptional elements to the endogenous promoter is insufficient for δ-globin upregulation. However, insertion of KLF1, β-DRF, and TFIIB motifs drive high expression of δ-globin from the endogenous locus in clonal populations of HUDEP-2 cells and primary erythroblasts. This leads to reconstitution of high levels of HbA2, over 10-fold increase compared to WT unedited cells. Our work adds mechanistic insight to the globin gene regulation at the β-like globin cluster and suggests a potential therapeutic avenue to upregulate HbA2 for the β-hemoglobinopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting the endogenous <italic>HBD</italic> promoter to introduce functional <italic>HBB</italic> promoter elements</title><p>We aligned the promoter sequences of <italic>HBB</italic> and <italic>HBD</italic> to identify transcriptional elements missing in the <italic>HBD</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This highlighted multiple mutations and deletions in the KLF1, NF-Y, β-DRF, and TFIIB binding motifs. To re-engineer the endogenous <italic>HBD</italic> promoter, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 induced homology directed repair (HDR) gene editing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yeh et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>We designed and tested three sgRNAs targeting the <italic>HBD</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and three HDR templates that would incorporate base pairs needed to complete the transcriptional element motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The HDR templates were designed as single stranded oligo donor nucleotides (ssODN) to either insert a KLF1 (K) sequence, a β-DRF and TFIIB (DT) sequence, or all three elements (KDT). A previous transgenic study showed that the NF-Y site has a lesser impact on <italic>HBB</italic> transcription in comparison to KLF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tang et al., 1997</xref>. Therefore, in order to minimize the number of transcription element iterations for testing, we omitted NF-Y from our designs. For the K repair template, the KLF1 sequence was inserted adjacent to the cut site, after the TATA box sequence, in order to disrupt the seed sequence of the sgRNA to reduce subsequent cutting post HDR repair. For the DT repair template, β-DRF and TFIIB motifs were designed into a single template as they are separated by only 2 base pairs. For the KDT repair template, we maintained the ordering between motifs KLF1, β-DRF and TFIIB to mimic the <italic>HBB</italic> promoter and limited the number of mutated base pairs to increase the likelihood of successful HDR editing. For both the K and KDT repair template, the KLF1 motifs inserted are not designed in the homologous position to the KLF1 site in the <italic>HBB</italic> promoter. The homologous site is considerably upstream of the sgRNA cut site and therefore more difficult to integrate given the relatively short conversion tracts of HDR in human cells.</p><p>We performed editing in HUDEP-2 cells, an immortalized cell line capable of differentiating into hemoglobin-producing erythroid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kurita et al., 2013</xref>, using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and an ssODN. After optimizing conditions and testing multiple sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; data not shown), we found that the sgRNA g1 had the highest editing efficiency, and proceeded to use sgRNA g1 for all further experiments. Editing resulted in NHEJ rates ranging from 56% to 74% and HDR efficiencies from 13% to 27% as measured by next generation sequencing (NGS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The edited pools were differentiated to erythroblasts and qRT-PCR measurements were taken to assess the effects on <italic>HBD</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

We isolated heterozygous and homozygous HDR clones to more accurately assess the effect of each motif edit on <italic>HBD</italic> expression.

Due to the unavailability of a TFIIB antibody suitable for ChIP, we performed ChIP for RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). While Pol II is a binding partner of TFIIB in the pre-initiation complex, this ChIP does have the limitation of indirectly immunoprecipitating other factors in the transcriptional pre-initiation complex and might also reflect general promoter activity.

Cas9 editing can sometimes be accompanied by large deletions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shin et al., 2017</xref>, which in the case of editing the <italic>HBD</italic> promoter might impinge upon the neighboring gene for β-globin. To test if editing at the <italic>HBD</italic> promoter leads to decrease of other β-like globins, we edited four different HSPC donors with Cas9 and the <italic>HBD</italic> gRNA alone, mimicking a ‘worst case’ scenario of only NHEJ with no HDR alleles. We observed indel efficiencies ranging from 61% to 78% in the various donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We differentiated these edited pools into erythroblasts and performed qRT-PCR on the β-like globins <italic>HBB</italic>, <italic>HBD</italic>, and <italic>HBG1/2</italic> and normalized their expressions to <italic>HBA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The <italic>HBA</italic> gene, which is present in a different locus from the β-like genes, should be unaffected by editing at the β-globin locus. We observed that <italic>HBD</italic> expression decreased by approximately 50%, while the expression of <italic>HBB</italic> and <italic>HBG1/2</italic> were not significantly changed. While we cannot rule out a small percentage of large deletions among the indel alleles, we do conclude that indel-based targeting of the <italic>HBD</italic> promoter decreases <italic>HBD</italic>, as expected, without grossly affecting the expression of the other β-like globins.</p><p>To test the effect of KDT editing on a single-cell level, we isolated and grew colonies from HSPCs under erythroid expansion conditions. Each colony was genotyped and their alleles classified as either unmodified, NHEJ, or HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). These CD34 +derived clonal erythroblasts were differentiated and qRT-PCR was performed to determine <italic>HBD</italic> expression relative to total β-like globins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). <italic>HBB</italic> transcript levels remain similar between unedited or NHEJ clones and KDT knock-in clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). We observed that colonies with unedited or all NHEJ alleles had an average expression of lower than 3% <italic>HBD</italic> of total β-like globins. Heterozygous KDT knock-ins from multiple donors increased <italic>HBD</italic> expression dramatically, between 15–35% of total β-like globins in heterozygous knock-ins and between 17–46% of total β-like globins in homozygous knock-ins.</p><p>Clonal erythroblasts harboring either a heterozygous or homozygous knock-in of KDT expressed significantly increased <italic>HBD</italic>. However, the edited pools of HSPCs had only a slight increase in <italic>HBD</italic>, far below the level required to be clinically relevant. We hypothesized that increased HDR efficiency in the pool could lead to higher <italic>HBD</italic> levels. Small molecule drugs, most notably DNA-PKcs inhibitors that effectively inhibit NHEJ, have shown to shift editing outcomes in CRISPR-Cas9 induced double-stranded break to favor HDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Peterka et al., 2022</xref>. We tested the DNA-PKcs inhibitor AZD-7648 on HSPCs using our editing conditions for KDT knock-in. In three different HSPC donors, we observed an increase from 20% to 24% HDR alleles to 47–65% when we used AZD-7648. We differentiated the edited HSPC pools and performed qRT-PCR to measure <italic>HBD</italic> expression levels. In these edited erythroblast pools, the KDT-editing pool expressed 6–7% <italic>HBD</italic> of total β-like globins, while the pools edited with KDT along with HDR enhancer showed increased <italic>HBD</italic> expression to 17–19%, confirming that increasing the HDR efficiency of KDT knock-in can increase <italic>HBD</italic> levels within edited pools of HSPCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Current gene editing efforts to treat the β-hemoglobinopathies include correcting individual <italic>HBB</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">DeWitt et al., 2016</xref>, a method which would be limited to specific types of patient mutations, or increasing fetal hemoglobin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wienert et al., 2018</xref>, which has different oxygen-binding capacities than HbA1. In this study, we describe a path to upregulating HbA2, which shares high similarity to HbA1 and is applicable to all β-hemoglobinopathy disease mutations.</p><p>Previous transgenic studies have shown that insertion of KLF1 alone to the <italic>HBD</italic> promoter sequence is sufficient to drive expression of <italic>HBD</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Porcu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Donze et al., 1996</xref>. In our study, we found that endogenous insertion of a KLF1 motif is insufficient to drive <italic>HBD</italic> expression. One explanation of this discrepancy could be that previous transgenic studies do not reflect the complex chromatin context and regulation at the β-like globin locus. Another explanation could be the importance of the KLF1 motif placement. To ablate re-recognition of the HDR alleles by Cas9, we inserted the KLF1 motif in the K repair template after the TATA box, while the DT and KDT repair templates inserted all motifs upstream of the TATA box. In the <italic>HBB</italic> promoter, the KLF1 motif is upstream of the TATA box. In a previous study using a HBD promoter luciferase reporter system, they found the highest luciferase activity when the KLF1 motif was upstream of the TATA box, in the homologous position to the HBB promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Donze et al., 1996</xref>. In another study, it was shown that insertion of the KLF1 motif in varying positions resulted in differences in luciferase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ristaldi et al., 1999</xref>. The placement of transcription factor binding sites can play a crucial role in promoter activity and follow-up studies of our work should further test the spacing and positioning of these various promoter elements, as well as include the NF-Y motif that was not explored in this study.</p><p>We have shown that insertion of three motifs, KLF1, β-DRF, and TFIIB, is necessary to recruit RNA Pol II and induce high expression of <italic>HBD</italic>. In CD34 + derived erythroblasts, homozygous knock-in of KLF1, β-DRF, and TFIIB leads to increases in <italic>HBD</italic> up to 46% of total β-like globins in clonal populations. To our knowledge, this is the first genomic editing of the <italic>HBD</italic> promoter that results in increased HbA2. Bulk editing of <italic>HBD</italic> through insertion of multiple transcriptional elements will rely on high levels of HDR. Increasing HDR outcomes might be achieved in CD34 + cells by a variety of methods such as controlled cell-cycling or modulation of DNA repair factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Howden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Charpentier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schiroli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shin et al., 2018</xref>. In this study, we found that AZD-7648 increased HDR outcomes in pooled edited HSPCs with concomitant increases in <italic>HBD</italic> expression. Further work should assess the safety and the effects of the AZD-7648 or other HDR-enhancing in HSPCs if they are to be pursued in a clinical context.</p><p>We observed high editing efficiencies when targeting CD34 + HSPCs. When editing targets <italic>HBB</italic>, NHEJ alleles that co-occur with HDR alleles can cause reductions in overall β-globin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">DeWitt et al., 2016</xref>. When targeting <italic>HBD</italic>, <italic>HBB</italic> might also be inadvertently affected by large deletions that extend into neighboring β-like globin genes. However, we using qRT-PCR experiment we found that <italic>HBB</italic> and <italic>HBG1/2</italic> mRNA expression were unaffected in our edited populations of HSPCs, suggesting that large deletions were not occurring with enough frequency to grossly affect β-like globin expression. However, some studies have shown that large deletions can occur at low levels, which might be detected by very sensitive tests such as long-range next-generation sequencing or ddPCR.</p><p>It is estimated that roughly 30% of beneficial hemoglobin (10 pg per cell) is sufficient to ameliorate β-hemoglobinopathy symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Steinberg, 2021</xref>. There are currently many gene editing approaches being explored for the β-hemoglobinopathies, mainly focused on increasing fetal hemoglobin or directly correcting the SCD mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wienert et al., 2018</xref>. A recent study reversed the SCD mutation using CRISPR-Cas9 prime-editing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Everette et al., 2023</xref>. They showed SCD mutation reversion rates of 17–41% in 4 SCD patient donors and resulted in expression of HbA1 to 10–45% of total hemoglobins. Sickling decreased proportionally to editing efficiencies, with an average of 63% sickled cells for untreated samples and decreasing to 37% in treated samples. Another strategy utilizes CRISPR-Cas9 base-editing to disrupt the LRF repressor binding site within <italic>HBG1/2</italic> and observed an upregulation of HbF to over 20% of total hemoglobins in SCD HSPCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antoniou et al., 2022</xref>. When disrupting the LRF site by insertion of a KLF1 site, HbF levels increased to 65–77%. All edited cell populations showed a therapeutically relevant reduction in the number of sickling cells. Another approach utilizes CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt the enhancer region of BCL11A, a repressor of fetal hemoglobin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frangoul et al., 2021</xref>. In an on-going clinical trial, BCL11A enhancer targeting yields editing efficiencies of 80–93% in four SCD patients and HbF upregulation to over 30% of total hemoglobins, with no vaso-occlusive crises 3 months post-transfusion of edited cells. These studies support the curative effect of increasing functional hemoglobin levels on β-hemoglobinopathies. In our study using CRISPR-Cas9 and a DNAPKcs inhibitor to knock the KDT promoter into <italic>HBD</italic>, we observed increased HbA2 to 17–19% of total hemoglobins in CD34+-derived erythroblasts. Further studies will need to be done to achieve even higher levels of HbA2 expression or test whether this lower expression of HbA2 is sufficient to ameliorate a disease phenotype.</p><p>In our experiments, heterozygous and homozygous knock-in of KDT in CD34+ erythroblasts led to 15–46% <italic>HBD</italic> relative to total β-like globins. Interestingly, in edited CD34+ erythroblasts, we observed that heterozygous and homozygous KDT populations expressed similar increases in <italic>HBD</italic>. Further studies should investigate whether heterozygous knock-in of KDT in β-hemoglobinopathy cells is sufficient to ameliorate disease phenotypes. For example, one could knock-in KDT to the <italic>HBD</italic> promoter of SCD patient HSPCs and perform HPLC or microscopy assays to determine the anti-sickling effects of a heterozygous or homozygous knock-in. If heterozygous knock-in of KDT is sufficient, one would see a decrease in sickle hemoglobin produced, or a decreased percentage of sickled red blood cells.</p><p>In summary, our presented study provides a novel strategy to increase levels of HbA2 from the endogenous <italic>HBD</italic> locus that could potentially be applicable as an ex vivo gene therapy. In pre-clinical studies, it will be important to quantitatively investigate the amount of <italic>HBD</italic> that is optimal for improving the function and health of patient red blood cells and explore the overall potential and safety of increasing HbA2 as a therapeutic option for the β-hemoglobinopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cas9 RNP nucleofection</title><p>Cas9 RNP was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lingeman et al., 2017</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Fyodor D. Urnov (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data presented in Figure 3C appears to be derived from a small number of clonal populations of cells from two donors. For some genotypes, data from a single colony only is presented. A larger dataset for this experiment would greatly improve the strength of conclusions that are able to be drawn from this data (Reviewer 2).</p><p>2) The strength of the conclusions in the manuscript should be altered to reflect the observation that editing of all three promoter elements in populations of cells is far below the level required to be clinically relevant and to suggest ways that this could be improved (Reviewer 3; Reviewer 2; Reviewer 1, Comment 3)</p><p>3) The high NHEJ seen in the CD34+ cells would be likely to lead to deletions that could inactivate genes of the β-globin locus and cause reductions in the total levels of β-like globins resulting in thalassemic cells. This caveat of the study and the implications of this high NHEJ for the therapeutic translation of this approach should be discussed in detail (Reviewer 3)</p><p>4) A section should be added to the discussion to comment on the level of HbA2 seen via the strategy in this manuscript and how it compares to other genome editing approaches currently being explored for the β-hemoglobinopathies (Reviewer 2)</p><p>5) It should be made clear throughout the manuscript that the KLF1 site has been inserted at a different position to the position of this site in the HBB promoter and in the K v KDL edited cells (Reviewer 1, Comment 1)</p><p>6) The justification for the exclusion of the CP1/NF-Y site from this study should be expanded (Reviewer 1, Comment 2)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a thorough and interesting paper. I have provided a positive overall review of the manuscript in the public review. Here, I will not repeat those comments but instead, provide specific suggestions on how the manuscript could be strengthened. Please note that addressing these comments would not require additional experimental work to be performed, so these are relatively minor concerns and do not detract from my enthusiasm for the work.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1. In reference to the finding (quoted from the abstract) &quot;We find that insertion of a KLF1 site alone is insufficient to upregulate δ-globin.&quot;: it is important to note that the KLF1 site has been inserted at a different position in the K edited cells (downstream of the TATA box) to the position in the KDL edited cells (just upstream of the β-DRF box) and both of these are different to that of the promoter location of the KLF1 site in the β-globin promoter (upstream of the NF-Y site). The spacing and positioning of promoter elements are important, and the placement chosen for insertion of the KLF1 sites in this study should be presented with a clear rationale so that readers of this manuscript can better appreciate this:</p><p>a. It should be made clear in the abstract that the KLF1 sites have been inserted at a de novo/non-homologous position (when compared to the location of the site in the HBB promoter).</p><p>b. It should be made explicitly clear in the Results section that the location of the KLF1 sites is different from that in the HBB promoter and different in the K v KDT cells and a justification for this choice provided.</p><p>c. The sentence &quot;We maintained the ordering between motifs to mimic the HBB promoter and paid particular attention to limiting the number of mutated base pairs to increase the likelihood of successful HDR editing.&quot; should be amended. While the order of the K, D, and T elements relative to each other is maintained in the KDT-edited cells, the K element is in two different positions, neither of which is in the homologous position to the KLF1 site in the HBB promoter.</p><p>d. The statement &quot;Taken together, these data indicate that an intact KLF1 site is sufficient to recruit KLF1…&quot; should be modified. The experiments performed do not repair the KLF1 site to create an intact KLF1 site. Instead, they introduce a KLF1 site at a new location (or, two new locations).</p><p>e. A section should be added to the discussion where the data from this study is compared and contrasted to that from references 6, 16, and 17, where, as the authors state &quot;Previous studies using transgenic approaches have shown that inclusion of a KLF1 motif in the HBD promoter can drive exogenous expression of δ-globin&quot;. The different locations of the KLF1 site in the K v KDT cells and how this could influence results should also be commented on. In my opinion, the way the KLF1 data is presented in this paper could result in the importance of the KLF1 site alone being inappropriately dismissed if this greater context is not provided.</p><p>2. In reference to the CP1 site:</p><p>a. It is my understanding that the promoter site referred to as the CP1 site (in the Results section) is more commonly referred to in the field as an NF-Y site. This should be amended.</p><p>b. The statement &quot;A previous transgenic study showed that the CP-1 site plays a minor role in HBB transcription, and was therefore omitted from our designs21&quot; is misleading. While, naturally, it would not have been practicable to target every promoter element in every combination in this study, I feel that the potential importance of this site has been inappropriately dismissed. In reference 21 (doi: 10.1182/blood.V90.1.421) the authors saw upregulation of δ-globin promoter activity in K562 cells and MEL cells when the CCAAT box was repaired and saw a reduction in β-globin expression when the CCAAT box was mutated (Figure 3). This is not consistent with the statement that the authors of this paper have made while citing this work. While this old study has its caveats, including that these experiments were luciferase reporter assays. A different rationale for why the NF-Y site was not considered should be presented.</p><p>c. In the Discussion section (perhaps in a new section where KLF1 site placement could be discussed, see above) the potential inclusion of other promoter elements/edits, such as the NF-Y site, in future studies to yield more robust potentially-therapeutic δ-globin upregulation could be discussed.</p><p>3. In reference to the abstract statement &quot;Edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSPCs) differentiated to primary human erythroblasts express up to 35% HBD.&quot; the findings should be presented slightly more conservatively:</p><p>a. It should be made clear in the abstract that this is in clonal populations. The effect is not seen in pooled populations.</p><p>b. It should be made clear in the introduction that this is in clonal populations. The effect is not seen in pooled populations. For example, the sentence &quot;However, insertion of KLF1, β-DRF, and TFIIB motifs drive high expression of δ-globin from the endogenous locus in HUDEP-2 cells and primary erythroblasts&quot; should be modified.</p><p>c. It should be made clear in the discussion that this is in clonal populations of edited cells.

For some genotypes, data from a single colony only is presented. A larger dataset for this experiment would greatly improve the strength of conclusions that are able to be drawn from this data (Reviewer 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed more experiments to strengthen Figure 3. As the reviewers suggested, we have isolated more edited HSPC colonies for Figure 3C. Specifically, we edited two more donors and isolated single colonies from here. As before, per donor, some genotypes only have few colonies represented. This is due to the difficulty in growing single cell CD34+ derived colonies large enough for genotyping and RNA extraction.</p><p>Additionally, we have also increased Figure 3A and 3B from n=2 HSPC donors to n=4 HSPC donors. Similarly, Figure 2B originally had one heterozygous or homozygous clone per knock-in condition, and we have now isolated more clones, at least three per condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The strength of the conclusions in the manuscript should be altered to reflect the observation that editing of all three promoter elements in populations of cells is far below the level required to be clinically relevant and to suggest ways that this could be improved (Reviewer 3; Reviewer 2; Reviewer 1, Comment 3)</p></disp-quote><p>In the Results section on HSPCs, we have now edited the text to state that KDT knock-in at the pooled level yields only slightly increases in HBD and that is below the level to be clinically relevant. We also state that in order to improve HBD levels, the HDR efficiency of knocking in KDT must be increased. We proposed using small molecule drugs and tested one HDR enhancer drug AZD4678. We find that AZD46789 is able to increase HDR efficiency with concomitantly increased HBD expression. This data is now included as new figures 3D and 3E. We have also edited the text in the Discussion section to state that further studies on the effects of AZD4678 will be necessary before utilizing it in a clinical context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The high NHEJ seen in the CD34+ cells would be likely to lead to deletions that could inactivate genes of the β-globin locus and cause reductions in the total levels of β-like globins resulting in thalassemic cells. This caveat of the study and the implications of this high NHEJ for the therapeutic translation of this approach should be discussed in detail (Reviewer 3)</p></disp-quote><p>We were not completely sure about the origin of this point, since our edits are aimed at HBD, which makes up less than 5% of total hemoglobins under normal conditions. NHEJ occurring in HBB (e.g. when doing HDR for direct correction) would potentially yield thalassemic cells. But indels in the HBD promoter might at most cause a 5% decrease in total globin levels (if δ expression was completely destroyed). We have performed a new experiment to explicitly address this point. We edited n=4 CD34+ HSPCs donors and compared unedited populations to populations edited with Cas9+HBD gRNA but no repair template. This represents a “worst case” scenario, in which there can be no HDR-based promoter engineering and only NHEJ. These data are included this in Supplementary Figure 3. We observed high editing efficiency of 61 – 78% in the HBD promoter. We performed qRT-PCR of the β-like globins in edited pools and normalized to HBA, reasoning that HBA is a neutral control for absolute levels of each globin in the β locus because HBA is located in a different locus. By qRT-PCR, HBD transcripts were decreased by half compared to mock treated cells, while HBB and HBG1/2 were non-significantly affected. But as mentioned above, HBD expression makes up less than 5% of total hemoglobins, and therefore a half reduction in HBD represents a total reduction of 2.5% of globins. We do acknowledge that this experiment does not specifically quantify the rates of large deletions that might span from δ to β, and further studies would be needed to address this point. But if such large deletions do exist, they do not greatly affect β expression. We have included this in the results and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A section should be added to the discussion to comment on the level of HbA2 seen via the strategy in this manuscript and how it compares to other genome editing approaches currently being explored for the β-hemoglobinopathies (Reviewer 2)</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a new section in the discussion summarizing some of the recent genome editing approaches for hemoglobinopathies.

In reference to the finding (quoted from the abstract) &quot;We find that insertion of a KLF1 site alone is insufficient to upregulate δ-globin.&quot;: it is important to note that the KLF1 site has been inserted at a different position in the K edited cells (downstream of the TATA box) to the position in the KDL edited cells (just upstream of the β-DRF box) and both of these are different to that of the promoter location of the KLF1 site in the β-globin promoter (upstream of the NF-Y site). The spacing and positioning of promoter elements are important, and the placement chosen for insertion of the KLF1 sites in this study should be presented with a clear rationale so that readers of this manuscript can better appreciate this:</p><p>a. It should be made clear in the abstract that the KLF1 sites have been inserted at a de novo/non-homologous position (when compared to the location of the site in the HBB promoter).</p><p>b. It should be made explicitly clear in the Results section that the location of the KLF1 sites is different from that in the HBB promoter and different in the K v KDT cells and a justification for this choice provided.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point to make and we have now addressed these points a. and b. in the results and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The sentence &quot;We maintained the ordering between motifs to mimic the HBB promoter and paid particular attention to limiting the number of mutated base pairs to increase the likelihood of successful HDR editing.&quot; should be amended. While the order of the K, D, and T elements relative to each other is maintained in the KDT-edited cells, the K element is in two different positions, neither of which is in the homologous position to the KLF1 site in the HBB promoter.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to this paragraph considerably to address the motif spacing and placements of the repair template designs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The statement &quot;Taken together, these data indicate that an intact KLF1 site is sufficient to recruit KLF1…&quot; should be modified. The experiments performed do not repair the KLF1 site to create an intact KLF1 site. Instead, they introduce a KLF1 site at a new location (or, two new locations).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified this statement in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. A section should be added to the discussion where the data from this study is compared and contrasted to that from references 6, 16, and 17, where, as the authors state &quot;Previous studies using transgenic approaches have shown that inclusion of a KLF1 motif in the HBD promoter can drive exogenous expression of δ-globin&quot;. The different locations of the KLF1 site in the K v KDT cells and how this could influence results should also be commented on. In my opinion, the way the KLF1 data is presented in this paper could result in the importance of the KLF1 site alone being inappropriately dismissed if this greater context is not provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate bringing this important point to our attention and have now added this to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In reference to the CP1 site:</p><p>a. It is my understanding that the promoter site referred to as the CP1 site (in the Results section) is more commonly referred to in the field as an NF-Y site. This should be amended.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now changed all references to CP1 in the figures and text to NF-Y.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The statement &quot;A previous transgenic study showed that the CP-1 site plays a minor role in HBB transcription, and was therefore omitted from our designs21&quot; is misleading. While, naturally, it would not have been practicable to target every promoter element in every combination in this study, I feel that the potential importance of this site has been inappropriately dismissed. In reference 21 (doi: 10.1182/blood.V90.1.421) the authors saw upregulation of δ-globin promoter activity in K562 cells and MEL cells when the CCAAT box was repaired and saw a reduction in β-globin expression when the CCAAT box was mutated (Figure 3). This is not consistent with the statement that the authors of this paper have made while citing this work. While this old study has its caveats, including that these experiments were luciferase reporter assays. A different rationale for why the NF-Y site was not considered should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the justification statement for omitting NF-Y and have also included it in the Discussion section on further testing of placements and spacing of the motifs in the repair templates. The sentence we use now is: “A previous transgenic study showed that the NF-Y site plays a lesser role in <italic>HBB</italic> transcription in comparison to KLF1<sup>21</sup>, and in the interest of reducing how many transcription element iterations to test, we therefore omitted NF-Y from our designs.”</p><p>We maintain that NF-Y plays a lesser role compared to KLF1 based on the reference 21 where they showed and stated in the abstract that restoring the NF-Y site led to increased luciferase activity, but restoration of KLF1 site led to much higher luciferase activity:</p><p>“Furthermore, a plasmid containing a single base pair (bp) mutation in the CCAAC box of the δ promoter, restoring the CCAAT box, caused a 5.6-fold and 2.4-fold (P &lt;.05) increase of LUC activity in transfected K562 cells and MEL cells, respectively, in comparison to the wild-type δ promoter. A set of substitutions that create an EKLF binding site centered at -85 bp increased the expression by 26.8-fold and 6.5-fold (P &lt;.05) in K562 and MEL cells, respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. In the Discussion section (perhaps in a new section where KLF1 site placement could be discussed, see above) the potential inclusion of other promoter elements/edits, such as the NF-Y site, in future studies to yield more robust potentially-therapeutic δ-globin upregulation could be discussed.</p><p>3. In reference to the abstract statement &quot;Edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSPCs) differentiated to primary human erythroblasts express up to 35% HBD.&quot; the findings should be presented slightly more conservatively:</p><p>a. It should be made clear in the abstract that this is in clonal populations. The effect is not seen in pooled populations.</p><p>b. It should be made clear in the introduction that this is in clonal populations. The effect is not seen in pooled populations. For example, the sentence &quot;However, insertion of KLF1, β-DRF, and TFIIB motifs drive high expression of δ-globin from the endogenous locus in HUDEP-2 cells and primary erythroblasts&quot; should be modified.</p><p>c. It should be made clear in the discussion that this is in clonal populations of edited cells. For example, in the sentence &quot;Our promoter engineering approach dramatically increases HBD levels…&quot; and the sentence &quot;In our experiments, heterozygous and homozygous knock-in of KDT in CD34+ erythroblasts led to 15 – 37% HBD relative to total β-like globins.&quot;</p><p>d.
