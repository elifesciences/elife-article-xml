pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10575.001</object-id><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a spectrum of human disorders, ranging from rare, inborn errors of metabolism to common, age-associated diseases such as neurodegeneration. How these lesions give rise to diverse pathology is not well understood, partly because their proximal consequences have not been well-studied in mammalian cells. Here we provide two lines of evidence that mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction leads to alterations in one-carbon metabolism pathways. First, using hypothesis-generating metabolic, proteomic, and transcriptional profiling, followed by confirmatory experiments, we report that mitochondrial DNA depletion leads to an ATF4-mediated increase in serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration. Second, we show that lesioning the respiratory chain impairs mitochondrial production of formate from serine, and that in some cells, respiratory chain inhibition leads to growth defects upon serine withdrawal that are rescuable with purine or formate supplementation. Our work underscores the connection between the respiratory chain and one-carbon metabolism with implications for understanding mitochondrial pathogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10575.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10575.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10575.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mitochondria are found within virtually all of our body’s cells and are best known as their power plants. Damaged mitochondria cause many diseases in humans – from rare, inherited metabolic disorders that cause symptoms including muscle weakness and developmental problems, to age-related diseases such as diabetes and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>How does mitochondrial damage lead to such a variety of symptoms and conditions? To answer this question, researchers must understand how cells respond to and compensate for such damage.</p><p>To mimic mitochondrial failure, Bao et al. reduced the amount of DNA in the mitochondria of human cells and observed that this caused the cells to accumulate more of an amino acid called serine. Further investigation showed that this accumulation comes in part from cells producing more serine, and that a protein called Activating Transcription Factor 4 is responsible for increasing the expression of the genes needed to produce serine in the cells.</p><p>Bao et al. also found that damaged mitochondria are less able to consume serine to produce a compound called formate, which is a precursor for DNA building blocks. If cells cannot acquire enough extra serine to compensate for this inefficiency, they cannot produce some of the building blocks required to make DNA and other critical compounds in the cell. Supplementing the cells with formate or the DNA building blocks enabled the cells to recover, which suggests that formate supplements may help to treat some mitochondrial disorders.</p><p>At a higher level, these results suggest that the mitochondrion’s role as a major chemical factory in the cell, and not just as the power plant, may also contribute to disease when the mitochondria are broken. Further work is now needed to investigate how cells know to turn on Activating Transcription Factor 4 when their mitochondria are damaged. It also remains to be discovered whether this reduces or exacerbates the symptoms of mitochondrial disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10575.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10575.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitochondrial disease</kwd><kwd>folate metabolism</kwd><kwd>sulfur metabolism</kwd><kwd>metabolite profiling</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>transcriptional profiling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>Xiaoyan Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldberger</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>Rohit</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Dawn A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vafai</surname><given-names>Scott B</given-names></name><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>Aviv</given-names></name><name><surname>Mootha</surname><given-names>Vamsi K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK081457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>Xiaoyan Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Mootha</surname><given-names>Vamsi K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R01CA119176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>Aviv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL101930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichinose</surname><given-names>Fumito</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction inhibits mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism, impairing cellular nucleotide biosynthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Damaged mitochondrial respiratory chains play a key role in the pathogenesis of rare congenital metabolic disorders, as well as in a number of age-associated disorders such as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Szendroedi et al., 2012</xref>), neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schapira et al., 1989</xref>), and aging. Mitochondrial respiratory chain components are encoded by two genomes; respiratory chain proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are expressed in all tissues, yet inherited lesions within mtDNA can lead to varying tissue pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koopman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</xref>), suggesting a complex interplay between the primary respiratory chain dysfunction and the compensatory adaptations to that dysfunction. Improved understanding of cellular responses to respiratory chain dysfunction promises to deepen our understanding of mitochondrial disease pathogenesis, nominate new biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suomalainen et al., 2011</xref>), and motivate new therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Cellular responses to respiratory chain dysfunction, collectively known as the mitochondrial retrograde response, have been studied in a number of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haynes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu and Butow, 2006</xref>). In yeast, early application of genomic profiling and genetic studies identified a transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu and Butow, 2006</xref>) that senses respiratory chain dysfunction, rewires metabolism to bypass a congested tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and promotes cellular survival. In worms, errors in mitochondrial biosynthesis trigger the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) to activate transcription of mitochondrial proteases and chaperones, proteins that reduce oxidative stress, and glycolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nargund et al., 2012</xref>). In flies, respiratory chain dysfunction signals to the nucleus and cytosol via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered energetics to JNK and AMPK, respectively, to place a checkpoint on cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owusu-Ansah et al., 2008</xref>). Induction of a mitochondrial retrograde response in flies has recently been shown to suppress age-dependent degradation of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owusu-Ansah et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Studies of mammalian cells have identified a small collection of cellular responses to respiratory chain dysfunction. Classic studies showed that loss of mtDNA gives rise to uridine and pyruvate dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">King and Attardi, 1989</xref>). Altered mitochondrial calcium uptake stemming from collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential triggers metabolic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amuthan et al., 2001</xref>). Loss of the mtDNA induces expression of mitochondrial chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martinus et al., 1996</xref>). Recently, a mouse model of mitochondrial respiratory chain disease has been shown to mount an ATF4-mediated, starvation-like transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tyynismaa et al., 2010</xref>), though the functional relevance of this response remains unclear. At present, a systematic picture of how mammalian cells respond to respiratory chain dysfunction at the levels of both gene expression and metabolism is lacking; such a picture could help to unify the above observations, while also pointing to novel responsive and adaptive pathways.</p><p>We modeled mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction in human HEK-293 cells by depleting them of mtDNA. In human cells, mtDNA is required for expression of 13 structural subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes that make up the respiratory chain; human patients with mtDNA depletion exhibit severe multicomplex respiratory chain deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shoffner, 2005</xref>). To generate hypotheses about pathways remodeling in respons to mitochondrial dysfunction, we systematically characterized the response of HEK-293 cells to mtDNA depletion using complementary metabolite, RNA, and protein profiling.</p><p>Integrated analysis of the profiles raised the hypothesis that one carbon metabolism, especially serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration, remodels in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. We confirmed this hypothesis with mechanistic follow-up experiments. We then explored alterations in serine metabolism in greater detail, and discovered that cells experience impairment of mitochondrial one-carbon synthesis upon respiratory chain dysfunction. In some cell lines, this leads to dependence on exogenously provided serine in the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, our study identifies a new metabolic vulnerability of cells facing mitochondrial stress, with implications for our understanding and treatment of human mitochondrial disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A cellular model of mitochondrial dysfunction</title><p>We stably transfected T-REx-293 cells, a HEK-293-derived cell line expressing the tet repressor, with a plasmid that expresses a dominant-negative mutant of DNA polymerase gamma (POLGdn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jazayeri et al., 2003</xref>) under tet repressor control. Doxycycline-triggered expression of POLGdn halts replication of mtDNA, which is then diluted as cells continue to divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS complex components become depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jazayeri et al., 2003</xref>), cellular respiratory capacity becomes compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and after several days, cell growth also slows. Removal of doxycycline allows recovery of mtDNA content and cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some of the recovery could be due to selection of cells that lose tet-inducible POLGdn expression (see Materials and methods), so we repeated these experiments using 100 ng/ml ethidium bromide treatment.

Inhibition of OXPHOS complexes III and V using antimycin and oligomycin, respectively, gives the strongest activation of genes shown above to be ATF4-responsive. Inhibition of complex I using rotenone gives subtle activation. Membrane potential dissipation using the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) fails to elicit activation of these genes, and indeed partially reversed ATF4 activation from mtDNA depletion. These results suggest that mtDNA depletion-triggered activation of ATF4 arises from redox stress due to a stalled respiratory chain, and not from defects in ATP synthesis or membrane depolarization.</p><p>To further investigate redox effects on ATF4 activation, we manipulated NAD+/NADH in cells by growing them in media with either 1 mM pyruvate or 1 mM lactate. Pyruvate and lactate are known to freely cross the plasma membrane, and altering the extracellular pyruvate:lactate ratio allows control over the cytoplasmic NAD+/NADH ratio through the action of lactate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bücher et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williamson et al., 1967</xref>). Cells grown in media for 24 hrs with 1 mM lactate showed significantly higher expression of ATF4 target genes than with 1 mM pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). However, the magnitude of the changes is modest compared to those seen with either antimycin treatment or with mtDNA depletion. Therefore, while altered cellular redox balance appears to contribute to ATF4 activation, other factors, such as oxidative stress from stalling of the respiratory chain, may also be important when mtDNA is depleted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Transcriptional and metabolic changes are independent of doxycycline toxicity</title><p>Because doxycycline can itself inhibit mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ugalde et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), we wondered whether direct doxycycline toxicity, and not doxycycline-induced POLGdn, was responsible for the transcriptional effects we observe in our profiling experiments.

Therefore, increased endpoint serine in the spent media atop mtDNA-depleted cells could reflect either increased synthesis or decreased consumption. To determine the contribution of serine biosynthesis to our observed increase in serine abundance, we performed isotopic tracer analysis using <sup>13</sup>C labeled glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaneton et al., 2012</xref>). To avoid product inhibition of serine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fell and Snell, 1988</xref>), we used a low (50 μM) concentration of unlabeled serine in the labeled glucose media. The analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) shows that in response to mtDNA depletion, cells both produce more serine from glucose and take up less serine from the media. We estimate that the cell volume is at least 1000 fold smaller than the media volume in our experiments. Therefore, decreased serine uptake implies decreased overall serine consumption and not simply decreased serine accumulation in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Respiratory chain dysfunction compromises mitochondrial formate production</title><p>To explain why serine consumption decreases, we considered the metabolic roles of serine in mammalian cells. In addition to its role in protein synthesis, serine is also a precursor for phospholipid biosynthesis and a major source of one-carbon (1C) units in folate metabolism, which supports purine and thymidylate synthesis as well as cellular methylation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tibbetts and Appling, 2010</xref>). Serine can allosterically activate PKM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaneton et al., 2012</xref>) and thereby regulate the exit of carbons from glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye et al., 2012</xref>). Serine is also a precursor for cysteine and glutathione biosynthesis via transsulfuration, and HCT116 cells lacking <italic>p53</italic> exhibit serine dependency that is rescuable with glutathione supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maddocks et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We became interested in the role of serine in 1C metabolism because mitochondria are the source of most of the 1C units used in cellular biosynthesis, and because consumption of serine for 1C metabolism involves an oxidation step that requires an NAD+ cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tibbetts and Appling, 2010</xref>). Thus, loss of NAD+ reoxidation due to the loss of the mitochondrial respiratory chain could conceivably lead to impairment of mitochondrial 1C metabolism, as theorized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desler et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To test this model of 1C metabolism blockade in intact cells, we note that the NAD+-dependent step in mitochondrial metabolism is the oxidation of methylene-THF to formyl-THF by MTHFD2. Our model thus predicts an increase in abundance of methylene-THF. We inferred increased methylene-THF abundance by determining rates of serine isotopic scrambling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Briefly, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-labeled serine generates <sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-glycine and a <sup>13</sup>C labeled methylene-THF in mitochondria by the action of SHMT2. This labeled methylene-THF can recombine with an unlabeled glycine – which is present in excess – by the reverse action of SHMT2 to generate <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-serine. The rate of emergence of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-serine thus reads out methylene THF abundance. We performed these experiments in SHMT1 knockout cells (see below) to avoid interference from cytoplasmic folate reactions, and found increased emergence of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-serine upon mtDNA depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). We observed similarly increased serine scrambling by treatment with rotenone, which directly inhibits NADH reoxidation through respiratory complex I. Measurement of cellular NAD+:NADH ratios confirms that these are altered with both mtDNA depletion and rotenone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration likely shifts the redox state of the mitochondrial folate pool in favor of reduced species such as methylene-THF.</p><p>To determine whether the shift in the mitochondrial redox state could inhibit mitochondrial 1C metabolism, we performed formate synthesis assays on isolated mitochondria treated with respiratory chain poisons. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, both rotenone and antimycin A partially inhibit mitochondrial synthesis of formate from serine. García-Martínez and Appling performed similar experiments with mitochondria isolated from rat liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Martínez and Appling, 1993</xref>), and also observed partial inhibition of formate synthesis with rotenone treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>1C units are not used for homocysteine remethylation in T-REx-293 cells</title><p>Elevations in homocysteine often signify insufficient one carbon pools. Hence, an important question is the degree to which mitochondrial 1C compromise is compatible with our observation of decreased homocysteine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In mammals, homocysteine has two major fates: conversion to cysteine via transsulfuration, and conversion to methionine via remethylation; the latter process consumes cytoplasmic 1C units. Our hypothesized mitochondrial 1C compromise might therefore lead to increased homocysteine abundance and be in direct conflict with the strong observed decrease in homocysteine levels in both spent media and cell extract.</p><p>To examine this issue more closely, we performed deuterium tracer experiments to determine the extent of homocysteine remethylation in T-REx-293 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, homocysteine remethylation using exogenously supplied, deuterated formate was nearly 1000-fold slower than synthesis of serine from deuterated formate. We conclude that remethylation is not a major fate for homocysteine in T-REx-293 cells, regardless of 1C availability.

Indeed, if cells with mitochondrial dysfunction were truly serine auxotrophs, they would show increased serine consumption. Instead, we observed the opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). We surmise that these cells can overcome blockade of mitochondrial serine metabolism by mass action, but only at high cytoplasmic serine concentrations. Such a bypass mechanism would give rise to serine dependency if cells lose the cytoplasmic serine that they synthesize by diffusion to the media when exogenous serine is withheld, as has been observed for many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eagle and Piez, 1962</xref>).</p><p>We also observed serine dependency with oligomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), which others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maddocks et al., 2013</xref>) have reported in HCT116 cells and attributed to serine involvement in energy metabolism. To distinguish the two models of serine dependency, we tested the effect of the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP, which impairs energy production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>) but increases NADH oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). CCCP did not give rise to serine dependency, and indeed a low dose of CCCP could rescue both the growth defect and the serine dependency arising from oligomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These data suggest that the mitochondrial dysfunction-induced serine dependency that we observe is related to the redox state of NAD cofactors, and not to energy impairment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Serine dependency can be rescued using 1C related metabolites</title><p>To further implicate 1C metabolism in serine dependency, we rescued this dependency using 1C related metabolites. Knockouts of MTHFD2 and MTHFD1L, two enzymes involved in mitochondrial formate synthesis, are embryonic lethal in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Pietro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Momb et al., 2013</xref>), but some knockout phenotypes are rescuable with formate or hypoxanthine supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Momb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patel et al., 2003</xref>). Exogenous formate bypasses the need for its mitochondrial synthesis, and hypoxanthine is an alternate source of purines, the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of which requires 1C units. Experiments on OXPHOS-inhibited T-REx-293 cells with serine withdrawal showed near-complete rescue of growth when media was supplement with either 30 µM hypoxanthine or 3 mM sodium formate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). These concentrations of hypoxanthine and formate also gave strong rescue of growth defects in the absence of serine in mtDNA-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). These data further support the notion that serine dependence in the face of mitochondrial dysfunction is related to 1C metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Exploring compartment specificity using SHMT knockouts</title><p>Parallel folate pathways exist in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tibbetts and Appling, 2010</xref>). To further determine the compartment specificity of serine fluxes, we used CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ran et al., 2013</xref>) to knock out serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) genes in T-REx-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). SHMT catalyzes the first step in folate-mediated production of formate from serine. Two isoforms exist in mammals: SHMT1, which is exclusively cytoplasmic, and SHMT2, which is mostly mitochondrial but has a cytoplasmic splice variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Stover, 2009</xref>). As expected, knockout of SHMT2, but not SHMT1, abolished formate synthesis from serine in isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c</xref>). In the presence of serine, neither SHMT1 KO nor SHMT2 KO cell lines required formate or hypoxanthine for growth, indicating that serine can be used to generate 1C units in either compartment. Without serine in the culturing media, SHMT2 KO cells showed strongly suppressed growth that could be rescued with formate, similarly to cells treated with RC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), whereas SHMT1 KO cells did not. We hypothesize that high levels of exogenous serine are required to drive conversion of serine to formyl-THF in the cytoplasm via SHMT1, likely because MTHFD1, the cytoplasmic enzyme that makes formate, is coupled to NADPH and thus favors formyl-THF consumption rather than generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tibbetts and Appling, 2010</xref>). This provides a possible explanation for why high levels of serine can rescue 1C synthesis in T-REx-293 cells with compromised RC function.</p><p>Mammalian cells can also derive 1C units from breakdown of choline and glycine, which could in principle support growth in the absence of serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tibbetts and Appling, 2010</xref>). To investigate the roles of these other 1C precursors, we generated T-REx-293 cells with simultaneous knockout of both SHMT1 and SHMT2 genes. Supplementation with hypoxanthine and thymidine (HT) is required for cell growth in the absence of 1C metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hakala, 1957</xref>), since 1C units are used for the synthesis of purines and of thymidylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tibbetts and Appling, 2010</xref>). Therefore, we supplemented media with HT when we generated these double-KO (DKO) clones. DKO cells so generated were unable to grow on unsupplemented media, whereas most single knockouts and WT cells were able to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>). In all cases, formate (3 mM) could replace HT to support DKO cell growth (not shown). We conclude from this that other sources of 1C are unable to completely replace serine-derived 1C units. Interestingly, hypoxanthine alone was also able to partially rescue DKO cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2e</xref>), suggesting that an alternative pathway might be sufficient to supply 1C for thymidylate synthesis. Finally, DKO cells, when rescued using either formate or hypoxanthine, were no longer serine dependent even with antimycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2f</xref>), indicating that no other functions of serine account for its requirement in cells undergoing RC inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Other cell types</title><p>We performed serine scrambling assays in five cell lines – T-Rex293, 293T, HeLa, C2C12, and MCH58 – to determine whether mtDNA depletion could induce 1C deficits in each of them.

Except with MCH58 cells, where high variance in the untreated samples prevented us from reaching any conclusions, we consistently observed increased ratios of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-serine to <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-serine, with at least one time point showing a statistically significant increase for all the other cell lines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>However, impairment of 1C metabolism only led to serine dependence, manifesting as a proliferation defect upon serine withdrawal, in a small handful of cell lines: besides T-Rex293, we only observed similar results in 293MSR and U251 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>); a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maddocks et al., 2013</xref>) additionally shows serine dependence of HCT116 cells treated with oligomycin.

Therapeutic strategies for these diseases are often aimed at limiting substrate accumulation or replenishing of downstream factors. In respiratory chain dysfunction, however, the resultant metabolic derangements are manifold because of the numerous mitochondrial and cytoplasmic processes that are intimately coupled to the respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</xref>). Well-known metabolic alterations associated with mitochondrial disease include increased reliance on glycolysis as a source of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Robinson et al., 1992</xref>), dependence on pyruvate to support aspartate biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref>), and inability to synthesize pyrimidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">King and Attardi, 1989</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we offer two lines of evidence to support the idea that cellular 1C metabolism is also altered upon respiratory chain dysfunction.

Second, we show in separate experiments that lesioning the respiratory chain impairs mitochondrial production of formate from serine. In a small number of cell types, this leads to growth defects upon serine withdrawal that is rescuable with purine or formate supplementation.</p><p>An important question is the degree to which our observations of one-carbon metabolism remodeling in proliferating cells are relevant to in vivo mitochondrial disease, which mostly affects post-proliferative tissue.</p><p>We note that our observation of ATF4 activation and alterations in serine metabolism and transsulfuration is richly supported by recent studies of mitochondrial disease. These have shown ATF4 activation by mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martínez-Reyes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Silva et al., 2009</xref>), rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tyynismaa et al., 2010</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crimi et al., 2005</xref>). Increased transsulfuration has been observed following ATF4 activation in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickhout et al., 2012</xref>), and mitochondrial dysfunction in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krug et al., 2014</xref>). One of the byproducts of transsulfuration, α-hydroxybutyrate, has been recently identified as a promising biomarker for mitochondrial disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thompson Legault et al., 2015</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jain et al., 2016</xref>). ATF4 is known to activate serine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye et al., 2012</xref>), and increased serine has been observed in a number of mitochondrial disease settings, albeit with less consistency. Muscle from male mice (but not female ones) with mitochondrial myopathy show increased serine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tyynismaa et al., 2010</xref>). Serine was found to be highly elevated in urine from mitochondrial disease patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smuts et al., 2013</xref>) and proposed as a component of a novel biosignature for mitochondrial disease, but not found to be increased in the blood of a different cohort of mitochondrial disease patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke et al., 2013</xref>). Serine levels are increased in a mitochondrial Parkinson’s disease model in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tufi et al., 2014),</xref> but not in <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic models of mitochondrial disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falk et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morgan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, while serine dependency appears to be cell type specific, 1C compromise as evidenced by altered serine scrambling appears to be more general. We note that a recent report on the effect of mitochondrial inhibitors showed impaired serine uptake and formate release in differentiated C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, 1C compromise does not appear to be limited to proliferating cells. More recently, studies of mouse mitochondrial disease models have also noted imbalanced nucleotide pools and altered 1C-related metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nikkanen et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that 1C metabolism is more efficient in the presence of a functioning respiratory chain in a variety of in vivo and in vitro contexts, and argues that the 1C compromise seen with respiratory chain dysfunction might be generalizable to whole body metabolism.</p><p>Whether the ATF4 response is adaptive in this context has not been clear. Our study shows ATF4-dependent activation of serine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye et al., 2012</xref>) following respiratory chain blockade, and poses the hypothesis that the serine synthesis-activating aspect of ATF4 might be adaptive by helping maintain cellular 1C availability. Indeed, ATF4 has recently been shown to mediate purine synthesis induction by mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Sahra et al., 2016</xref>). Transsulfuration constitutes another potentially adaptive element of the ATF4 response program, since it supports synthesis of glutathione, a key cellular ROS scavenger. However, we have so far failed to observe deleterious effects of ablating the ATF4 response in T-REx-293 cells. Since the ATF4 integrated stress response program encompasses a number of different genes and functions, we hypothesize that it contains both adaptive and maladaptive components. In support of this notion, a recent paper showed that inhibition of ATF4 activation is protective in rodent models of intracerebral hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karuppagounder et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our work may provide mechanistic insights into the folate deficiency in mitochondrial disease, with therapeutic implications. Mitochondrial disorders are occasionally associated with cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), and some of these patients are known to respond to treatment with folinic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia-Cazorla et al., 2008</xref>). No proven mechanism yet connects mitochondrial disease to CFD, but given that brain expresses very little SHMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Girgis et al., 1998</xref>), our results pose the hypothesis that CFD may result from impaired mitochondrial formate synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Formate supplementation has been shown to ameliorate defects associated with 1C gene knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Momb et al., 2013</xref>), and a recent report demonstrated that the bioenergetics defects of a fly model of Parkinson’s disease could be reversed with supplementation of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tufi et al., 2014</xref>). Mitochondrial disease patients are commonly given folic acid as part of the 'mito cocktail,' with no proven efficacy. Our results suggests that these patients might lack the 1C units that are bound by the folate cofactors, and not the co-factors themselves. Our work raises the hypothesis that formate or nucleotide supplementation may be of benefit in some of respiratory chain diseases.</p><p>One of the most puzzling characteristics of mitochondrial diseases is their phenotypic heterogeneity and tissue-specific pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</xref>). Our identification of 1C metabolism and transsulfuration as metabolic alterations associated with mitochondrial disease presents a new set of hypotheses that could help explain this heterogeneity. Different organs in the body differ in which 1C donors they utilize, in their ability to metabolize those 1C units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yoshida and Kikuchi, 1973</xref>), and in their transsulfuration activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mudd et al., 1965</xref>). Because many of these one-carbon pathways are coupled to the respiratory chain, a lesion within the mitochondrion could in principle ripple out to 1C defects that could manifest in many different ways depending on the tissue and cell state. Rapidly proliferating cells might be unable to replicate their DNA due to nucleotide imbalances, whereas metabolically active cells in the liver and kidney might be deprived of essential purine-containing cofactors such as NAD+. Tissue-specific variations in 1C metabolism may contribute to the remarkable phenotypic variation of mitochondrial disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>T-REx-293 cells were obtained from Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA).

Media samples (10 µL) were extracted using 90 µL of 74.9:24.9:0.2 v/v/v acetonitrile/methanol/formic acid containing stable isotope-labeled internal standards (valine-d8, Isotec; and phenylalanine-d8, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; Andover, MA) and centrifuged (10 min, 9000 x g, 4°C). Cell extracts and media extraction supernatants (10 µL) were injected directly onto a 150 x 2 mm Atlantis HILIC column (Waters; Milford, MA). The column was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 250 μL/min with 5% mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in water) for 1 min followed by a linear gradient to 40% mobile phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) over 10 min. MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization and selective multiple reaction monitoring scans in the positive ion mode. Declustering potentials and collision energies were optimized for each metabolite by infusion of reference standards before sample analyses. The ion spray voltage was 4.5 kV and the source temperature was 450°C. Polar metabolite were profiling in the negative ion mode using a 5500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (SCIEX; Framingham, MA) coupled to an ACQUITY UPLC (Waters; Milford, MA). Media samples (30 µL) were extracted using 120 µL of 80% methanol containing inosine-<sup>15</sup>N4, thymine-d4 and glycocholate-d4 internal standards (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; Andover, MA) and were centrifuged (10 min, 9000 x g, 4°C).

The ion spray voltage was -4.5 kV and the source temperature was 500°C. Lipid profiling was performed in the positive ion mode using a 4000 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (SCIEX; Framingham, MA) coupled to a 1100 Series pump (Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA) and an HTS PAL autosampler (Leap Technologies; Carrboro, NC). Lipids were extracted from media (10 µL) using 190 µL of isopropanol containing 1-dodecanoyl-2-tridecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids; Alabaster, AL). Cell and media extracts (10 µL) were injected directly onto a 150 x 3.0 mm Prosphere HP C4 column (Grace, Columbia, MD). The column was eluted isocratically with 80% mobile phase A (95:5:0.1 vol/vol/vol 10 mM ammonium acetate/methanol/acetic acid) for 2 min followed by a linear gradient to 80% mobile-phase B (99.9:0.1 vol/vol methanol/acetic acid) over 1 min, a linear gradient to 100% mobile phase B over 12 min, then 10 min at 100% mobile-phase B. MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization and Q1 scans in the positive ion mode. Ion spray voltage was 5.0 kV and source temperature was 400°C.

MultiQuant software (Version 1.1; AB SCIEX; Foster City, CA) was used for automated peak integration and metabolite peaks were manually reviewed for quality of integration and compared against a known standard to confirm identity.</p><p>Cell extract metabolite abundances were normalized to sample geometric means to adjust for cell number differences. We used a multi-step protocol to adjust spent media metabolite abundances. First, we measured a media volume change of 12.0% in 6 cm plates with 3 ml media over the course of 3 d, and re-scaled media metabolite measurements accordingly. Then, we used the log mean cell extract metabolite differences between the different samples to estimate the per-day growth rate difference due to doxycycline treatment. We then used the growth rate difference to estimate changes in the area-under-the-curve (AUC) exposure of media to cells and adjusted accordingly. While this adjustment entailed straightforward flux multiplication in the case of metabolites released to the media, metabolites strongly absorbed from the media were more difficult to treat because multiplication would give rise to cells absorbing more metabolite than was present in the base media. We therefore used an ad-hoc adjustment function for uptaken metabolites that satisfied three criteria: (1) its value and slope would match that for released metabolites at the zero flux boundary case; (2) it would be continuous for all uptake fluxes; (3) measurements of near-100% uptake would adjust to yield near-100% uptake.

Mouse-human homology was used to improve detection of conserved transcription factor binding sites.

We BLASTed the C. griseus GADD34 protein sequence against the human, and determined that the truncation point corresponded to position 308 in the H. sapiens GADD34 protein sequence (NCBI reference sequence symbol PPP1R15A). We amplified this fragment from T-REx-293-derived complementary DNA using the PCR primers GATGAAGAGGAGGGTGAGGTCAAG and GCCACGCCTCCCACTGAGG, performed an additional 30 cycles of PCR using Gateway-flanked primers that also incorporated an ATG start codon, and recombined the resulting PCR product into the pDONR221 Gateway entry vector using BP Clonase II (Thermo Fisher). We call the protein product of this insert GADD34△N. We encountered difficulties in selecting for lentivirally-transduced GADD34△N expression using puromycin resistance, and suspected that inhibition of the ATF4 response might make cells more susceptible to puromycin treatment. To work around this, we used restriction digestion to remove the puromycin resistance open reading frame from the pLX302 lentiviral expression vector (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) and used Gibson isothermal assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>) to replace it with GFP.

We then selected for GFP expression with two rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting on a FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson). Control infections were done similarly, except with an additional copy of GFP instead of GADD34△N inserted using Gateway recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Protein profiling</title><p>We characterized protein changes (<italic>n</italic> = 1) for two different time points, plus a control.

U251 cells were split at 2 d intervals, and the growth rates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> are from days 2–10 in the U251 growth curves and days 0–6 in the 293MSR growth curves.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Yeast</title><p>To revive the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> BY4741 strain, cells were plated onto YPD (rich medium) plates from frozen glycerol stocks. After 2 days, cells were taken from plates, re-suspended into liquid YPD, and counted. Next, an appropriate amount of cells were taken to inoculate a 3 mL culture of SD +2% Dextrose (Sunrise Science, San Diego, CA) at 1x10<sup>6</sup>cells/ml. The resulting 3 mL culture was placed in a New Brunswick Scientific (Edison, NJ) model TC-7 roller drum on the fastest rotation until saturated (16 hr). The cells were then counted and diluted back to 1x10<sup>6</sup>cells/ml in SD-serine-adenine+2% glycerol+2% ethanol with 5 nm Antimycin A. For the serine and adenine additions, 1X corresponds to 85.6 mg/L and 21 mg/L, respectively. To monitor growth in each condition, 150 uL of culture was placed in the wells of a 96-well plate and growth curves were done using the Bio Tek (Winooski, VT) Synergy H1 multi-mode plate reader. The growth conditions were 30°C with continuous low shaking. OD<sub>600</sub> was measured every 15 min for 48 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistics</title><p>All significance values were computed using Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed) unless otherwise specified.

The primary stressor employed is a doxycyline inducible POLG dominant -negative mutant that depletes mitochondrial DNA. Upon doxycycline treatment, the metabolite profiling experiments identified commonly seen indicators of metabolic stress, such as an increase lactate or decrease in uridine. However, they also observed novel changes, including increases in serine and decreases in homocysteine. RNA profiling identified changes in genes that might be responsible for these changes. They determine that the transcripts of enzymes involved in serine biosynthesis increase upon doxycycline treatment, as do enzymes involved in transsulfuranation. The authors next identified ATF4 as a possible transcription factor that mediates the transcriptional response to mtDNA depletion, and determined that ATF4 responsive genes also changed in expression in response to other mitochondrial stresses. Proteomic profiling confirmed that core mitochondrial protein complexes decreased in abundance, and that enzymes involved in serine biosynthesis are increased.</p><p>In follow-up experiments, the authors determined the effect of mtDNA depletion on H2S generation, serine consumption, and explore mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction might compromise 1C metabolism. They identify that mitochondrial stressors cause a serine dependency that can be rescued by 1C donors, such as formate and hypoxanthine.</p><p>The manuscript has many positive aspects. The coordinated global analysis in which metabolite, protein and RNA levels are determined in response to mtDNA depletion, appears expertly performed and have yielded valuable information. The integration of these different data-sets is particularly impressive. The results are likely to be clinically important in proposing that mitochondrial dysfunction impacts upon serine and homocysteine metabolism. Indeed, if true for the in vivo situation, this information could be used to develop novel therapeutic approaches.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The primary mitochondrial stress used in this manuscript is a doxycycline inducible method to deplete mtDNA. Numerous reports have demonstrated that doxycycline inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis. The lab of Johan Auwerx has published work recently, including a study in Nature, showing that 1 ug/ml doxycycline (the dose used in this study to turn on POLGdn expression) substantially decreases COX1 levels and decreases oxygen consumption in hek293 cells. Furthermore, other reports have determined that doxycycline increases ATF4 levels, in a POLGdn-independent manner. This study would be strengthened if the effect of doxycycline-dependent mtDNA depletion and doxycycline-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis were differentiated. An appropriate control was performed for the transcription analysis. Within this data-set, it would be useful to compare which genes are doxycycline sensitive and which respond only to mtDNA depletion (i.e. do the levels of ATF4 responsive genes change upon exposure to doxycycline)?</p><p>2) An important control experiment would be to determine whether control T-rex-293 cells treated with doxycycline increase serine or decrease homocysteine levels. Another key control would be to determine whether doxycycline treated cells demonstrate serine dependency.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> mtDNA copy number seems very high. In the original paper describing this system, Jazyeri et al. determined a copy number of ~500 before mtDNA depletion in this system (compared to ~20, 000 here), which is more consistent with other analyses in mammalian cell lines. In this manuscript, the cells still have ~1000 copies of mtDNA per cell following depletion. Given that mtDNA depletion is the primary stressor used, it will be useful to re-assess whether the values in the Figure are correct, or whether a minor technical error has occurred and these values need to be re-normalized.</p><p>4) In Figure 7, the authors demonstrate clearly that cells exposed to the mitochondrial toxins rotenone and antimycin, grow more slowly in the absence of serine. These experiments were performed using an alternative supplier of DMEM (US Biological compared to Invitrogen), so as the media could be made without serine. For those looking to repeat these experiments, it will be useful to specify more clearly in the Methods the DMEM components in the US Biological derived media. Specifically, it is necessary to state whether the home-made media contains the same amount of pyruvate as the Invitrogen media (1 mM pyruvate). Many commercial DMEMs do not contain pyruvate (including the base US biological DMEM), and variation in pyruvate experiments will greatly affect the results of these experiments.</p><p>5) The great strength of this paper is using a range of profiling technologies to link mitochondrial dysfunction to changes in serine (and homocysteine) metabolism. The authors hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction impacts upon NAD+/ NADH levels and that this then perturbs mitochondrial 1C metabolism. This is a very plausible hypothesis, but it is difficult to test directly, and the follow up experiments do not appear to fully and unambiguously resolve how mitochondrial dysfunction increases serine levels, lead to serine dependency and fully clarify the role of 1C metabolism in these processes. To further explore the role of 1C metabolism a detailed study of the levels of mitochondrial 1C metabolites would have been useful, although it is technically difficult, so may be beyond the scope of this study. For example, as the authors note, in CFD caused by mitochondrial DNA depletion 5-methyltetrahydrofolate levels are substantially decreased – it would be useful to measure 5-mTHF levels in these cells. Similarly, the authors do not directly demonstrate that mitochondrial NAD+/NADH levels are altered.</p><p>6) A great advantage of this system is that the profiling experiments can be very carefully controlled. A disadvantage of this system is that these cells are tolerant of severe mitochondrial stress (i.e. they can be used to make viable proliferating cells which contain no mtDNA). In fully differentiated cells, such as neurons or myocytes, which mtDNA depletion seems to affect most in vivo, the relative importance of the energetic component of mitochondrial stress and these secondary metabolic pathways is likely to be different. Full assessment of the relevance of these findings (such serine dependency upon mitochondrial stress) to metabolic disease will require the use of an animal model, but is beyond the scope of this study. The Discussion would be strengthened if a description of the limitations of the in vitro model were included.</p><p>7) An issue that is central to this paper is how ATF-4 function is regulated by redox changes. Does alteration of the redox status of a cell in the absence of mitochondrial insult also show similar phenotype?</p><p>8) (Minor point) A change in the redox balance induces many other changes like changes in the activity of SIRTUINS: do they also play a role in this response pathway?</p><p>9) The loss of a cell's ability to utilize glucose through TCA metabolism results in hypoxic response in many model systems. Is there a relationship of the present study to hypoxic response that also occurs under the conditions of RC stress?</p><p>10) Please comment on why was cysteine not analyzed, but homocysteine apparently did not pose a problem?</p><p>11) Authors should detail methods and metadata, if necessary due to length restrictions, even in extended supplement material sections, but at least briefly in the Methods sections in a summarized form.</p><p>12) In the Discussion section, the question posed is &quot;An important question is the degree to which our cell culture data are relevant to in vivo mitochondrial disease?&quot; However, the subsequent sentence is unclear both in grammar and style, but also in its meaning, i.e. in how far the answer relates to the initial question:</p><p>&quot;We note, however, that more upstream measures of 1C compromise appear also to be more robust.&quot;</p><p>The reviewer assumes the authors want to say &quot;More upstream signals of 1C damage appear also to be more robust&quot; but that's not answering the question on in vivo relevance…</p><p>13) (Minor point) The authors wrote (subsection “Integration of profiling data”) their metabolite analysis method was a &quot;high-throughput&quot; method. Why would high-throughput be needed here? Is this high throughput like in research chemical analysis (e.g. in combinatorial chemistry libraries), where easily 3,000 analyses per hour can be conducted?</p><p>If such throughput is not meant in this case, such words should not be used. I have the vague conception the authors want to highlight the idea that more than one target is analyzed per run, but that is not &quot;throughput&quot;.</p><p>14) In the Discussion, the authors acknowledge there may be questions regarding generality of these findings in vivo. But no literature data was provided that may question the generality of the conclusions. For example, in &quot;Comparison of proteomic and metabolomic profiles of mutants of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>&quot; by Morgan et al. serine does not appear to be increased in <italic>C. elegans</italic> with RC defects. There must be other metabolomics publications on mitochondrial defects in vivo, and it would be nice to have more discussion on this issue.</p><p>15) The manuscript is quite complex and difficult for a non-specialist to grasp the significance of the results. Perhaps reducing the use of abbreviations could help, but it could also be structured in a simpler manner. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, for example, it is hard to understand the color coding (mRNA changes in blue look more like metabolites).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mitochondrial dysfunction remodels one-carbon metabolism in human cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by a Senior editor, and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but a rather important issue has been brought to light from the data in the submitted Supplementary material. As you know, biological and technical replicates are critical for the analysis to be statistically meaningful.</p><p>Using n=2 data set cannot be considered acceptable for any analysis. Even using an n=3 is only common for molecular biology testing of presence versus absence of bands e.g. for RNA or proteins, showing that e.g. a knockout or transgenic gene was correctly expressed. Using an n=3 for molecular phenotyping (proteomics, metabolomics) is marginal and for sure 2 is unacceptable.</p><p>Metabolite profiling data are given in supplement 1 (metabolite data n=2 per condition, i.e. a total of 12 samples plus one baseline control).</p><p>Protein data are given as supplement 3 (worksheet 2, columns AR to BC, total number of samples =12, but it is hard to say how those samples relate to the study groups). Likely similar to the metabolite data, but no clear headers are given.</p><p>In the Methods section:</p><p>&quot;We characterized protein changes (n = 1) for two different time points, plus a control&quot;. In difference to the metabolite profiling, internal controls (heavy isotope labeled reagents) to correct for mass spec differences, but of course, this would not correct for biological variability if this experiment is replicated.</p><p>For transcript data these are uploaded to GEO. The authors say they have a total of 18 samples for a time course with n=1 (&quot;RNA profiling. RNA from 18 time points (n = 1 for each time point…&quot;).</p><p>The statistical prowess of the data presented needs to be significantly improved. This may be difficult to achieve in a reasonable time frame for revisions, in which case, you may wish to send the manuscript to another journal. However, since the reviewers and editors all consider this work to be valuable and important, we are willing to expedite a new submission of the manuscript with the proper statistically significant data added. If this is going to be the course of action, we ask that you get in touch with our editorial staff, providing a plan of action that can be pre-assessed by our reviewer.</p><p>Minor issue:</p><p>Reviewer 2 also would like to see more details of the experimental methods. Please do include this in Supplementary Material or Methods section as you please if you decide to submit a new version of the paper. Below, we summarize the reviewer's comments, and once again, it will be useful to let us know whether you intend to include all or some of these experimental details:</p><p>&quot;The metabolite profiling section, as stated, is not following common reporting standards in science, let alone the recommendations of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative. The authors state &quot;Media and cellular metabolite extract (n = 2 for each) were characterised using liquid chromatography / tandem mass spectrometry following the procedure in (Jain et al., 2012) for polar metabolites (including organic acids), and the procedure in (Rhee et al., 2011) for lipids.</p><p>It is not sufficient to point to papers in which methods may, or may not, be explained in detail. In order to understand, interpret, and possibly repeat analyses, methods require detailed information, for example: (a) use of internal standards, and the readout of these standards. (b) use of quality controls, including negative and positive controls, for measurements and for biological as well as technical reproducibility. (c) details on HILIC columns use, solvents in the LC, gradients, flow rates, injection volumes, reconstitution solvents of the sample prior to injection, and volume of the reconstituted samples. (d) details on the mass spectrometry methods used, including e.g. declustering potentials and electrospray voltages, temperature for desolvation, precursor ion windows for Q1, use of multiple MRM transitions per metabolite as qualifier ions to confirm that in a MRM, the correct metabolite was analyzed. (e) use of calibration curves to determine sensitivity of analyses (incl LOD and LOQ).</p><p>Moreover, the MSI recommends detailed information given for each metabolite in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, second worksheet, namely: mass, and MRM, for each metabolite. A database identifier (e.g. PubChem ID or InChI key) for each metabolite. And the retention time, for each metabolite.</p><p>The authors may want to choose uploading result data, and raw data, to one of the public metabolomic databases e.g. the NIH database metabolomics workbench.org or the European counterpart, Metabolites. For other types of data, similar repositories exist.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10575.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The primary mitochondrial stress used in this manuscript is a doxycycline inducible method to deplete mtDNA.

This study would be strengthened if the effect of doxycycline-dependent mtDNA depletion and doxycycline-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis were differentiated. An appropriate control was performed for the transcription analysis. Within this data-set, it would be useful to compare which genes are doxycycline sensitive and which respond only to mtDNA depletion (i.e. do the levels of ATF4 responsive genes change upon exposure to doxycycline)?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the important work by the Auwerx lab on this topic. We have performed the requested analysis of ATF4 activation in T-Rex-293 cells treated with doxycycline. Using motifADE, we observed a subtle but significant association between the ATF4 motif TGATGCAA and increased expression upon doxycycline treatment. However, the magnitude of this association is much stronger in cells expressing PolGdn: the δ median metric for the association was 0.213 (with nominal <italic>P</italic>≈5.5×10<sup>-9</sup>) for PolGdn-expressing cells, whereas it was 0.016 (with nominal <italic>P</italic>≈1.6×10<sup>-2</sup>) for the parent T-REx-293 cells. Indeed, if we perform motifADE analysis on the doxycycline control data and consider all possible 8-mers, the signal associated with TTGCATCA is not significant due to Bonferroni correction of the <italic>p</italic>-value. Individual ATF4 target genes also show much weaker – if any – activation with doxycycline treatment in the absence of POLGdn expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). We now include a discussion of this finding in the main text, and compare degrees of gene activation in the two different cell lines in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 2. Furthermore, we note that we confirmed ATF4 activation in cells treated with ethidium bromide (EtBr) to induce mtDNA depletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, while doxycycline alone might contribute some small part of the transcriptional changes that we observe, the majority of those changes can be attributed to PolGdn overexpression and the ensuing mtDNA depletion.</p><p><italic>2) An important control experiment would be to determine whether control T-rex-293 cells treated with doxycycline increase serine or decrease homocysteine levels. Another key control would be to determine whether doxycycline treated cells demonstrate serine dependency.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ concern here. However, because the suspected mode of off-target doxycycline action also involves mitochondrial damage, changes in 1C metabolites or serine dependency induced by doxycycline treatment alone would not necessarily disprove our model. Instead, the salient question is whether other modes of mitochondrial damage also induce these metabolic and growth changes. We have included new data showing increased serine and decreased homocysteine levels in spent media when cells are treated with ethidium bromide to induce mtDNA depletion (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Furthermore, we note that our serine dependency growth studies were also performed using EtBr. We hope these additions and clarifications satisfy the reviewers’ concerns that the effects we observe arise solely as a result of doxycycline toxicity.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> mtDNA copy number seems very high. In the original paper describing this system, Jazyeri et al. determined a copy number of ~500 before mtDNA depletion in this system (compared to ~20, 000 here), which is more consistent with other analyses in mammalian cell lines. In this manuscript, the cells still have ~1000 copies of mtDNA per cell following depletion. Given that mtDNA depletion is the primary stressor used, it will be useful to re-assess whether the values in the Figure are correct, or whether a minor technical error has occurred and these values need to be re-normalized.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the discrepancy. We wish to note two issues here. (1) The mtDNA copy number of 400-500 determined by Jazayeri et al.was not per cell, but <italic>per nuclear genome</italic> (Jazayeri et al., 2003). Since 293 cells are considered pseudotriploid (Lin et al., 2014), this actually corresponds to 1200-1500 copies per cell. (2) Literature reports for mtDNA copy numbers in HEK293 cells appear to vary. For instance, another paper (Wanrooij et al., 2007) reports a per cell copy number of around 3000 for a very similar HEK293-derived cell line.</p><p>We have re-assessed the calibration of mitochondrial DNA copy numbers, and discovered two technical errors that inflated the mtDNA copy number. Correcting these yields approximately 7000 mtDNA per cell (untreated), which is in much closer proximity to the aforementioned previous reports. In addition, we note that the precise copy number is not salient to any of our conclusions, and that we confirm abrogation of mitochondrial translation using Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and oxygen consumption measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we have adjusted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> to only show relative mtDNA copy numbers.</p><p><italic>4) In Figure 7, the authors demonstrate clearly that cells exposed to the mitochondrial toxins rotenone and antimycin, grow more slowly in the absence of serine. These experiments were performed using an alternative supplier of DMEM (US Biological compared to Invitrogen), so as the media could be made without serine. For those looking to repeat these experiments, it will be useful to specify more clearly in the Methods the DMEM components in the US Biological derived media. Specifically, it is necessary to state whether the home-made media contains the same amount of pyruvate as the Invitrogen media (1 mM pyruvate). Many commercial DMEMs do not contain pyruvate (including the base US biological DMEM), and variation in pyruvate experiments will greatly affect the results of these experiments.</italic></p><p>We specifically requested US Biological to include 1 mM pyruvate in the custom-synthesized DMEM. We have amended the Methods section to address it.</p><p><italic>5) The great strength of this paper is using a range of profiling technologies to link mitochondrial dysfunction to changes in serine (and homocysteine) metabolism. The authors hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction impacts upon NAD+/ NADH levels and that this then perturbs mitochondrial 1C metabolism. This is a very plausible hypothesis, but it is difficult to test directly, and the follow up experiments do not appear to fully and unambiguously resolve how mitochondrial dysfunction increases serine levels, lead to serine dependency and fully clarify the role of 1C metabolism in these processes. To further explore the role of 1C metabolism a detailed study of the levels of mitochondrial 1C metabolites would have been useful, although it is technically difficult, so may be beyond the scope of this study. For example, as the authors note, in CFD caused by mitochondrial DNA depletion 5-methyltetrahydrofolate levels are substantially decreased – it would be useful to measure 5-mTHF levels in these cells. Similarly, the authors do not directly demonstrate that mitochondrial NAD+/NADH levels are altered.</italic></p><p>We have measured total NAD+/NADH levels in cells, and shown that the ratio does indeed decrease with either EtBr or rotenone treatment. These data are shown in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 2. Because both drugs affect cellular physiology by their action on mitochondria, it is highly unlikely that they could affect the total cellular NAD+:NADH ratio without altering the mitochondrial ratio.</p><p>As the reviewers correctly note, a detailed study of mitochondrial 1C metabolites would be very valuable for the current story. We indeed set up mass spectrometry methods to measure 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-mTHF) and were able to detect commercially available standards. Unfortunately, we were not able to detect 5-mTHF in T-REx-293 cell extracts, likely because 5-mTHF is not abundant in our cells. This conclusion is supported by our observation of very low rates of remethylation of homocysteine using formate-derived 1C units (Figure 6—figure supplement 4) despite a high expression level of methionine synthetase in our cells, because 5-mTHF is a cofactor in that reaction.</p><p><italic>6) A great advantage of this system is that the profiling experiments can be very carefully controlled. A disadvantage of this system is that these cells are tolerant of severe mitochondrial stress (i.e. they can be used to make viable proliferating cells which contain no mtDNA). In fully differentiated cells, such as neurons or myocytes, which mtDNA depletion seems to affect most in vivo, the relative importance of the energetic component of mitochondrial stress and these secondary metabolic pathways is likely to be different. Full assessment of the relevance of these findings (such serine dependency upon mitochondrial stress) to metabolic disease will require the use of an animal model, but is beyond the scope of this study. The Discussion would be strengthened if a description of the limitations of the in vitro model were included.</italic></p><p>We have added a discussion of the limitations of using a cell culture system that is tolerant of severe mitochondrial stress.</p><p><italic>7) An issue that is central to this paper is how ATF-4 function is regulated by redox changes. Does alteration of the redox status of a cell in the absence of mitochondrial insult also show similar phenotype?</italic></p><p>The precise mechanism of ATF4 activation by mitochondrial dysfunction is a very interesting question. Indeed, while both rotenone and antimycin were used at saturating concentrations, rotenone was much less effective at inducing the ATF4 response than was antimycin. Therefore, we suspect that redox changes are not the only signals of mitochondrial dysfunction that are salient for ATF4 activation.</p><p>As to the specific request of reviewers: we induced cellular redox imbalance by treating cells with lactate, and observed subtle but significant activation of the ATF4 response (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). The magnitude of the effect is much lower than that elicited by either mtDNA depletion or antimycin treatment, so other effects might also contribute, but it does appear that redox imbalance itself might be able to trigger the ATF4 response. We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion.</p><p>The nature of the signals emanating from damaged mitochondria that activates ATF4 will be an important topic for future studies.</p><p><italic>8) (Minor point) A change in the redox balance induces many other changes like changes in the activity of SIRTUINS: do they also play a role in this response pathway?</italic></p><p>We did not explore the role of sirtuins in the present study.</p><p><italic>9) The loss of a cell's ability to utilize glucose through TCA metabolism results in hypoxic response in many model systems. Is there a relationship of the present study to hypoxic response that also occurs under the conditions of RC stress?</italic></p><p>The connection between respiratory chain dysfunction and the hypoxic response remains controversial. While impaired respiratory chain function can activate HIF1 via altered NAD+/NADH ratios (Gomes et al., 2013) or increased cytoplasmic succinate (Selak et al., 2005), it can also inhibit HIF1 accumulation during hypoxia (Chua et al., 2010).</p><p>In our data, with a few notable exceptions, we did not observe activation of known HIF1 target genes.</p><p>More generally, we note that a prominent effect of the hypoxia response is to upregulate glycolysis, which provides – among other things – the substrate from which serine is synthesized. Serine is an allosteric activator of PKM2 (Chaneton et al., 2012), which is transcriptionally activated by HIF1. Therefore, we hypothesize that in settings where both ATF4 and HIF1 are activated, they may enhance each other’s adaptive effects. Understanding the interplay between these two pathways will require further experimentation.</p><p><italic>10) Please comment on why was cysteine not analyzed, but homocysteine apparently did not pose a problem?</italic></p><p>For unknown reasons, the targeted LC-MS method used for our initial metabolite profiling did not yield quantifiable cysteine signals using sample quantities that were sufficient to measure other amino acids. While the method could measure cysteine in neat reference standard solutions, the signal intensity was much lower in magnitude compared to the majority of other amino acids – including homocysteine – measured at similar concentrations, and the signals in biological extracts were noisy. It remains uncertain whether the lack of sensitivity for cysteine was due to interferences from co-eluting metabolites, interferences with the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) MS settings used to measure cysteine in the method (m/z 122/76), or some other chemical interference related to the work up or the instrument.</p><p><italic>11) Authors should detail methods and metadata, if necessary due to length restrictions, even in extended supplement material sections, but at least briefly in the Methods sections in a summarized form.</italic></p><p>As far as we understand, the <italic>eLife</italic> format does not generally include extended supplement materials sections. As recommended by the <italic>eLife</italic> Research Article format, we have included fully detailed methods in the Methods section (now renamed “Materials and methods”) that appears after the Discussion.</p><p><italic>12) In the Discussion section, the question posed is &quot;An important question is the degree to which our cell culture data are relevant to in vivo mitochondrial disease?&quot; However, the subsequent sentence is unclear both in grammar and style, but also in its meaning, i.e. in how far the answer relates to the initial question:</italic></p><p><italic>&quot;We note, however, that more upstream measures of 1C compromise appear also to be more robust.&quot;</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewer assumes the authors want to say &quot;More upstream signals of 1C damage appear also to be more robust&quot; but that's not answering the question on in vivo relevance…</italic></p><p>We apologize for the awkward wording and paragraph organization here. Our point here was to initially caveat the generality of serine dependency upon respiratory chain inhibition, since we see it in so few cell lines, and then remark that more upstream measures of 1C compromise appears to be more general. We have reorganized and expanded the relevant Discussion paragraphs with this critique, as well as critiques #6 and #14, in mind.</p><p><italic>13) (Minor point) The authors wrote (subsection “Integration of profiling data”) their metabolite analysis method was a &quot;high-throughput&quot; method. Why would high-throughput be needed here? Is this high throughput like in research chemical analysis (e.g. in combinatorial chemistry libraries), where easily 3,000 analyses per hour can be conducted?</italic></p><p>If such throughput is not meant in this case, such words should not be used. I have the vague conception the authors want to highlight the idea that more than one target is analyzed per run, but that is not &quot;throughput&quot;.</p><p>We agree – we have removed the term “high-throughput” from the manuscript.</p><p><italic>14) In the Discussion, the authors acknowledge there may be questions regarding generality of these findings in vivo. But no literature data was provided that may question the generality of the conclusions. For example, in &quot;Comparison of proteomic and metabolomic profiles of mutants of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>&quot; <italic>by Morgan et al. serine does not appear to be increased in</italic> C. elegans <italic>with RC defects. There must be other metabolomics publications on mitochondrial defects in vivo, and it would be nice to have more discussion on this issue.</italic> </p><p>We have included a discussion of in vivo datasets in the revised Discussion section.</p><p><italic>15) The manuscript is quite complex and difficult for a non-specialist to grasp the significance of the results. Perhaps reducing the use of abbreviations could help, but it could also be structured in a simpler manner. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, for example, it is hard to understand the color coding (mRNA changes in blue look more like metabolites).</italic></p><p>We apologize that the key for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> was confusing; we have modified it to make it less ambiguous. Furthermore, in the present revision, we have reorganized the Results and Discussion sections, and made numerous smaller changes throughout the paper, with the goal of making the paper easier to read.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but a rather important issue has been brought to light from the data in the submitted Supplementary material. As you know, biological and technical replicates are critical for the analysis to be statistically meaningful.</italic></p><p><italic>Using n=2 data set cannot be considered acceptable for any analysis. Even using an n=3 is only common for molecular biology testing of presence versus absence of bands e.g. for RNA or proteins, showing that e.g. a knockout or transgenic gene was correctly expressed. Using an n=3 for molecular phenotyping (proteomics, metabolomics) is marginal and for sure 2 is unacceptable.</italic></p><p><italic>[…] The statistical prowess of the data presented needs to be significantly improved. This may be difficult to achieve in a reasonable time frame for revisions, in which case, you may wish to send the manuscript to another journal. However, since the reviewers and editors all consider this work to be valuable and important, we are willing to expedite a new submission of the manuscript with the proper statistically significant data added. If this is going to be the course of action, we ask that you get in touch with our editorial staff, providing a plan of action that can be pre-assessed by our reviewer.</italic></p><p>Our revision was rejected on the grounds of insufficient replicates in the initial microarray, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling experiments. We agree that the individual profiling experiments were not performed with sufficient statistical power to justify any conclusions when considered in isolation. However, we performed these profiling experiments with the goal of generating hypotheses, and in fact, focused our follow-up on a pathway that emerged from all three profiling modalities. The title claim of the paper is supported by no fewer than ten different follow-up experiments, each with <italic>n</italic> = 3 or more.</p><p>Please consider the analogy to a paper in which a drug screen is performed – rarely will a drug screen be performed with a large number of replicates (typically, two replicates are performed) – but then the follow-up focuses on a few key hits. In our case, the RNA, protein, and metabolite profiles were performed as a “screen,” designed to generate hypotheses, which we then pursued.</p><p>We do understand the institutional prerogatives of <italic>eLife</italic> to uphold the highest standards of statistical rigor in the papers that it publishes, and to avoid setting precedents that compromise these standards. Therefore, we have further revised the paper to caveat the interpretation of the profiling results:</p><p>· We have modified the Abstract to emphasize the hypothesis-generating nature of our RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling experiments.</p><p>· We have removed individual profiling panels from the main figures and placed them into figure supplements, to de-emphasize them.
