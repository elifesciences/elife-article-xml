We designed a flexible spatial working memory task that required rats to navigate – after distractions and a delay – to multiple possible goal locations from different starting points and via multiple routes. This made the current goal location the key variable to remember, instead of a particular direction or route to the goal. However, across a broad population of PFC neurons, we found no evidence of current-goal-specific memory in any previously reported form – that is differences in the rate, sequence, phase, or covariance of firing. This suggests that such patterns do not hold working memory in the PFC when information must be employed flexibly. Instead, the PFC grouped locations representing behaviorally equivalent task features together, consistent with a role in encoding long-term knowledge of task structure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>flexible behavior</kwd><kwd>goal-directed behavior</kwd><kwd>spatial navigation</kwd><kwd>Neuropixels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Böhm</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Albert K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Representation of goals in the forms previously reported in the PFC is not required for performance of a novel spatial working memory task where goal information must be used flexibly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals can pursue a goal while handling distractions and delays, starting from a variety of initial conditions, and adapting their responses in the face of unexpected obstacles. To guide such flexible goal-directed behavior, there needs to be a representation of the goal itself that is robust to these circumstances, which can provide top-down instruction for selecting appropriate actions. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a central role in flexible goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuster, 2015</xref>), and one of its primary functions is thought to be the maintenance of information relevant for achieving the current goal (i.e. working memory) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rainer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wimmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inagaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the PFC is a prime candidate area for containing a representation of the current goal itself.</p><p>Spatial working memory tasks are well-suited for investigating such representations. First, the current goal, a particular spatial location, can be clearly specified and is ethologically relevant for many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>). Second, all of the aspects of flexibility mentioned above can be incorporated naturally in a form that many animals, including rodents, can solve. However, rodent spatial working memory experiments employed to date with recording in PFC or other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wood et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frank et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baeg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guise and Shapiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>) have not combined all of these elements of flexibility in a single task. As a result, potential working memory representations of the current goal have been difficult to dissociate from behavioral or sensory correlates. For instance, classic T-mazes have a single start and single route to each of the two goals. Thus, differential neural activity before reaching the T junction could represent the goals themselves, the two sets of stereotyped actions used to reach each goal as well as any associated sensory correlates (e.g. looking left versus right), or the plan to ‘go left’ or ‘go right’. Furthermore, any goal-specific activity could differ if the animal were to start from another point, and therefore not be usable under different initial conditions. Here, we devised a novel spatial working memory task incorporating multiple aspects of behavioral flexibility, allowing a search for a ‘pure’ representation of the goal itself by disambiguating goal-related activity from other correlates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In our task, rats needed to remember one of three goal locations in each trial. The current goal was encoded during a ‘sample phase’, in which animals were guided with light cues to one goal where they received a small reward. Rats had to remember this location until they needed to navigate to that goal again in the ‘test phase’ – starting from one of three different locations and via one of three routes in the absence of lighted cues – to receive a large reward. The different routes were implemented by using an elevated maze design with bridges that could be raised (open) and lowered (blocked). The available route was only revealed after a 3 s (3.2 s in one animal) ‘fixation’ period (hereafter referred to as the ‘delay period’) during which animals had to hold their nose in one of the three test phase ‘start’ location ports. The correct start location port was assigned pseudorandomly in each trial. To find the correct start port between each trial’s sample and test phase, animals had to poke their nose into different ports until they found the one that elicited a tone when poked, which indicated the correct choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The goal sample phase route and test phase route were also pseudorandomly assigned in each trial (see Materials and methods). This design requires animals to update the currently relevant goal every trial (working memory task) and pushes them to remember the goal itself instead of memorizing a specific behavioral sequence or planning a particular motor action to reach the goal. Thus, the goal location is the key variable to retain, which must then be used flexibly to solve the task: navigating to that goal from any location by any route. Furthermore, having more than two goals excludes a strategy of navigating to one goal by default and only remembering when the goal is the other one – that is having three goals promotes the use of working memory representations of each goal itself.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task design, behavior and recording.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ‘multi-start/multi-goal/multi-route’ (MSMGMR) task environment.

To examine whether animals indeed remembered the goal location itself instead of particular routes, we compared the performance in trials where the route (bridge) animals had to take in the test phase was the same or different from the outbound and/or return bridge in the sample phase. The performance was comparable across routes for all animals, indicating that rats remembered goal locations instead of routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left). In trials where the goal was adjacent to (i.e. 60 degrees in either direction from) the available route, rats most often took the shortest route (88%, 81%, and 95% of trials for each animal, respectively), supporting the idea that animals used a spatial map instead of a fixed route plus recognition strategy. Furthermore, the performance was comparable and above chance for all goal locations, implying that rats remembered each goal location rather than relying on a strategy of remembering only a subset of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, center left). Rats spent several seconds in each task phase and generally ran faster on test outbound runs than sample outbound runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, center right). The search time to find the correct start location was on average slightly higher in the trials where the subsequent choice was incorrect, but overlapped with search times in correct trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right). During the test phase, rats rarely stopped at the end of the available bridge after crossing it on their way to the goal in a manner that might reflect vicarious trial and error behavior at the choice point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson and Redish, 2007</xref>) (see Materials and methods for details).</p><p>A Neuropixels probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jun et al., 2017a</xref>) was chronically implanted in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), previously shown to be required in variants of simpler rodent spatial working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guise and Shapiro, 2017</xref>). One hundred to two hundred units were simultaneously recorded across subareas including anterior cingulate, prelimbic (PL), infralimbic, and dorsal peduncular cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (n = 3 animals: 182, 131, and 98 cells in the three main sessions analyzed, one from each animal; in addition, for two animals, one novel rotation experiment session each, consisting of 152 and 186 cells, was used for the analysis of relearning). We primarily focused our analyses on the delay period since, during that time, behavior is well-controlled, and animals must remember a given goal while being in different defined locations and facing different defined directions, as well as not knowing the required future motor action. Analyses were applied to all putative principal cells with stable firing rates throughout the session (97, 84, and 68 cells in the three main sessions, and 84 and 105 cells in the additional relearning sessions; see Materials and methods) and pooled across subareas (results including all cells or split by subarea were similar and are provided in the supplementary figures as indicated).</p><p>We searched for representations of the current goal encoded in terms of the major forms of delay period activity previously found in other working memory tasks, spatial or non-spatial, involving recordings from the PFC or elsewhere in primates and rodents: activity reflecting the representation at the time of encoding the sample item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rainer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), elevated/suppressed activity in single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rainer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inagaki et al., 2019</xref>), or sequential firing patterns across multiple cells that tile the delay period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baeg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito et al., 2015</xref>), oscillatory phase-dependent firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watrous et al., 2018</xref>), and elevated/suppressed covariances in firing among pairs of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We first tested whether memory of the current goal could be maintained during the delay period by a firing rate pattern across cells (population vector, PV) similar to the one when the animal was at the goal itself during the sample phase. To begin with, the PV at each goal during the sample phase was distinguishable and stable over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), including across sample and test phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition to distinguishing which goal the animal was at in both sample and test phases, the task phase could also simultaneously be almost perfectly decoded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, right), likely because the animal received less reward in the sample phase. Having established the presence of a stable spatial representation at each goal, we correlated the overall activity during the delay period with the sample phase PV at each goal and asked whether it was more correlated with the currently remembered goal’s PV. This was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), as also seen in a different task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guise and Shapiro, 2017</xref>). To test whether the remembered goal was represented as transient increases in correlation or a switching between current and other goals with the relevant (current) one being overrepresented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelemen and Fenton, 2010</xref>), we attempted to predict the goal based on correlation scores resulting from sliding a window of variable width across the delay period. While the animal’s current (i.e. start) location was readily decodable (as expected), the remembered goal was not, using a wide range of time bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or activity restricted to individual subareas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) or to cells with significant spatial selectivity at goals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; note that individual cells in any subarea could show spatial selectivity at goals, as well as at starts, at both, or neither).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Memory is not maintained by goal-location-specific activity in the delay period.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Population vectors (PVs) of activity while animal at each goal during sample phase (left) are distinct and stable (middle, correlation matrix of single trials in one animal; right, decoding accuracy, logistic regression classifier, mean over all trials and animals: 94.48%, 95% bootstrap CI: [90.87, 96.80]).

While we did not record activity during the long training period, we performed a behavioral manipulation experiment after the task had been learned in which animals (n = 2 sessions from two animals) had to relearn the task in an altered configuration. Specifically, we rotated the maze by 60 degrees ~ 1/3 of the way through the recording session, so that the reference frame was changed, with the goal and start positions now in between their previous positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Animals had never seen this configuration before or seen a rotation of the maze. Consistent with the idea that the animals must adapt to the new configuration and learn to apply previously internalized rules, performance dropped dramatically then gradually improved over the remainder of the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, during this relearning, when the cognitive demand might be higher and thus elicit a more prominent representation of critical task variables, population analysis still could not decode the currently remembered goal during the delay period. In contrast, spatial representation of the start locations was again clearly represented even as the animal adapted to the new configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Lack of differential activity patterns corresponding to the current, remembered goal in the delay period during relearning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Task layout in familiar and novel configuration.

We explored three frequency bands (2.5–5 Hz, 5–12 Hz, and 15–30 Hz), identified based on their elevated power in the delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). First, we calculated each cell’s goal-specific phase preference in the delay period. We compared the distribution of phase preference magnitudes to one where goal labels were shuffled. The distributions were not different, neither when including all stable cells, nor when selecting only cells that showed significant overall phase locking, suggesting the remembered goal does not affect overall phase preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

We also explored the possibility of a recently described form of ‘activity-silent’ memory, in which working memory is expressed in the spiking synchrony between pairs of neurons while stimulus information is not decodable from firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2020</xref>). However, neither for the pairs of neurons exhibiting excitatory interactions nor for the pairs of neurons exhibiting inhibitory interactions did covariances differ between trials associated with one goal versus the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, see Materials and methods). Together, these results suggest that previously described forms of working memory maintenance are not responsible for storing the current goal in our task in which this information must be employed flexibly.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Lack of differential phase or covariance of firing corresponding to the current, remembered goal in the delay period.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phase analysis.

Specifically, we tested how well the current goal could be decoded with respect to key behavioral reference time points: (1) when the animal arrives at the goal during the sample phase, (2) when the animal returns to the center during the transition between sample and test phases, (3) when the route becomes available, (4) at the choice point when the animal enters the outer ring of the maze in the test phase, and (5) when the animal arrives at the goal during the test phase. Importantly, we performed these analyses not only using the neural data but also, separately, using the position tracking data of the two LEDs on the animal’s head. We found that it was possible to decode the currently remembered goal location from the neural data at various time points. However, the remembered goal could also be decoded from the behavioral tracking data alone with a very similar time course. Thus, it is likely that this neural representation of the currently remembered goal at these times is due to the animal’s position, orientation, posture, or other behavioral features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Crucially, the decoding performance based on tracking data was at chance levels throughout the nose poke delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, third row, right, period from −3 to 0 s), providing direct evidence that our task design reduces the presence of confounding behavioral variables during that period.</p><p>If the mPFC does not encode memory of the goal in this task, what task-relevant processes might it support? We tested whether other task features could be decoded from mPFC activity. First, we analyzed if the activity at the goal in the sample phase (presumably during encoding) differs when there is an error in the subsequent test phase or not, but this was not the case. In contrast, after the animal had made an incorrect choice in the test phase, activity at the goal was markedly different, presumably due to the lack of reward; however, correlations between the PVs of activity at the goal among correct trials and, separately, among error trials was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, mPFC delay period activity did not indicate an upcoming or past error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), further corroborating that mPFC might not directly store current memory content. We then checked if mPFC distinguished the two task phases not only at the goal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which could be due to the amount of reward but when animals returned to the center. Before reaching the center, and at the center, task phase was not decodable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) (note the decodability afterwards could arise from cue or behavior differences in the two phases that were not present earlier). Lastly, we compared the population activity while rats engaged in different behaviors at different locations. Within each group of behaviors (i.e. waiting at a start nose port, crossing a bridge/route, consuming reward at a goal), mPFC displayed spatial selectivity (e.g. it differentiated the three bridges). Furthermore, we found that this spatial selectivity was embedded within a larger organization of activity in which these distinct, task-relevant groups were clearly separable from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Prefrontal cortex encodes task-relevant information and forms groups of behavioral equivalence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Correlation matrices between population vectors of activity at each goal in sample phase of trials where the animal is correct or incorrect in the subsequent test phase.

A pair of studies (using a single start location; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>) showed no evidence of goal-selective delay activity in rodent PL mPFC. In one of these studies, motor planning was prevented, but not in the other (i.e. standard T-maze), and a study similar to the latter one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) found goal-selective delay activity. Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lara and Wallis, 2014</xref>) found no evidence of visual stimulus-selective delay activity in primate PFC. However, this study used color as the relevant stimulus dimension and found little evidence of color-selective activity even during stimulus presentation. Since PFC neurons have been shown in other cases to encode sample stimulus color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buschman et al., 2012</xref>), this suggests that encoding of the stimulus during the sample period may be a prerequisite for observing stimulus-selective activity in the delay period. Spatial information is strongly represented in PFC in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rainer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lara and Wallis, 2014</xref>) and essentially all rodent studies, including here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>); yet, we found no spatial goal-selective delay activity. Furthermore, our ability to decode the current start position and also the goal at various time points during the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), and the relatively high number of cells recorded simultaneously in our study, suggests that our data set was large enough to have detected an effect of sizes previously reported in the literature for simpler tasks.</p><p>In contrast to previous studies, we combined all elements of flexibility in one task – distractions, different start locations, and different unpredictable routes, as well as more than two goals. We found no evidence of goal-selective delay activity in fully trained animals or during relearning in any of the major forms previously documented over a wide range of parameters and across large numbers of simultaneously recorded cells in multiple mPFC subareas. Thus, these representations are unlikely to serve as general working memory correlates that can be employed under conditions of high behavioral flexibility, such as those often encountered in the real world. Whether animals in simpler tasks use such canonical representations of working memory to solve those tasks, employ an alternative strategy, or rely on an as-yet-undiscovered pattern of activity remains an open question. Our work therefore stresses the importance of employing more cognitively challenging tasks that allow dissociation between correlates of high-level cognitive variables and other task-related variables. For instance, the potential confounds resulting from such task-related variables are seen in the strikingly similar time course of goal decoding using either neural or behavioral tracking data outside of the well-controlled delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The search for a pure, flexible working memory correlate could focus both on other brain areas and on exploring as-yet-unobserved activity patterns or alternative memory mechanisms involving the mPFC. Such mechanisms could, for instance, be related to short-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>), but differ from the previously reported covariance patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2020</xref>) investigated here. Finally, our results suggest a role for mPFC in working memory tasks by representing task structure in terms of groups of behaviorally related elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaefer et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with findings that the PFC forms long-term memories of learned stimulus categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Freedman et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Surgery</title><p>All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Janelia Research Campus Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The chronic Neuropixels implant surgery followed previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jun et al., 2017a</xref>). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and mounted in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments). After thorough cleaning of the skull, a ground screw was placed through the skull above the cerebellum. A small craniotomy (diameter ~1 mm) was made above the target area (anterior-posterior: 3.24 mm, medio-lateral: 0.6 mm) in the right hemisphere. A single-shank Neuropixels ‘1.0’ probe was lowered over the course of about an hour to a depth of 6.0–6.3 mm. The craniotomy was covered with artificial dura (Dow Corning Silicone gel 3–4680), and any parts of the probe outside of the brain were covered with sterile Vaseline. The probe was permanently fixed to the skull with dental acrylic, and a protective cone made of copper mesh and dental acrylic or light cured cement was built around the probe. Recordings started after animals had fully recovered and were accustomed to the recording cable when attached to the implant, ~2–3 weeks after implant surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Behavioral procedures</title><p>Rats were housed in a reverse light cycle room (12 hr:12 hr day:night), and training and experiments were conducted mostly in the dark phase.</p><p>Rats learned the ‘multi-start/multi-goal/multi-route’ (MSMGMR) task over the course of several months in successive learning steps with generally one learning session per day. Animals were food restricted (with their weight maintained at ≥85% of their initial weight) to increase motivation to collect reward in our task.</p><p>Reward was given in the form of a sweet and nutritious liquid reward (Ensure Plus). The reward was dispensed from custom-made Teensy-operated reward pods which, along with the custom-made nose ports and bridges (that provide available ‘open’ routes when up and are unavailable ‘blocked’ routes when down in this elevated maze environment), were controlled by custom-written finite-state machine software written in Matlab.</p><p>Data from three male Long-Evans rats were included in this study. (Two other animals were trained to high levels of performance for this study, but the recordings were lost before training was complete, in one case due to probe failure. In both of these cases, the probe was implanted before training began and the losses occurred after ~4 months of training. To limit such outcomes, the probe was implanted after training was complete in the subsequent animals [two of the three included ones]). Animals were ~12 weeks of age when training began for two animals and ~6 months for one animal.</p><p>To accustom animals to the elevated maze layout and the type of reward they would receive, animals were placed on the maze for ~30 min per session to explore and collect reward from any of the reward pods, which were located at the end of each goal arm and one in the center of the maze. All routes were available at this point in training and animals could freely move around to collect reward from any of these four reward sites on the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Animals started exploring the maze immediately and learned to navigate between the reward sites within a few sessions.</p><p>Next, the sample phase of the task was introduced. Here, the animal learned the meaning of the visual cues (blue LEDs on the goal reward pod(s) blinking) and to find the current goal location by repeatedly being visually guided to the same goal and returning to the center after each run, which allowed it to understand the basic structure of the task (i.e. run out, run back to center, run out, and so on). This sample phase was implemented in two different configurations throughout the training and recording sessions for the three rats. For one rat, the correct goal location was indicated by a blinking light at the correct reward pod. For the other two rats, we used a reversed configuration where the correct goal was the only goal reward pod not blinking. This configuration was introduced to reduce the potential for the animals to remember the location of a simple visual cue instead of remembering the spatial location of the goal. However, both versions were readily learned by the animals and did not lead to any obvious changes in behavior in the test phase.</p><p>After the animal had learned to follow the guided cues, the test phase was introduced. Here the animal was cued three to four times to sample the same goal, followed by one run in which the animal was not cued and had to navigate to the same (correct) reward pod. If the animal went to an incorrect reward pod in the test phase first, they received a diminished or no reward if they then went to the correct one afterwards. The number of repeated ‘sample phases’ to the same goal was successively lowered until sample and test phases were interleaved.</p><p>Next, the use of a particular route was enforced during the sample phase. After animals returned from the test phase to the center reward pod, two of three bridges were lowered, that is the routes were blocked, forcing the animal to use the remaining one in the sample phase. The route available in each sample phase was chosen pseudorandomly.</p><p>Next, to introduce the nose pokes, all routes were blocked upon arrival of the rat at the center after the sample phase. The animal could choose any nose port; correct poking was indicated with a 4 kHz tone upon brief poking (50 ms). After holding for the specified duration, all routes would become available (i.e. all bridges were raised). At this stage, the duration of the required poke was successively increased from the initial 50 ms to approximately 1 s. Once the animal developed a habit of choosing the same nose port to make the routes available, only one pseudorandomly chosen nose port would elicit the tone and raise the bridges. The nosepoke duration was then successively increased until the animal became proficient at holding it for ~ 1.5 s. In two animals (the ones in which the goal was indicated as the pod that was not blinking), any incorrect nosepoke was indicated by a constant light at that port after it had been poked at least once.</p><p>As a final learning step, only one route would become available after the correct nose port poke (i.e. for the test phase) and the nosepoke duration was successively increased to 3 s (for two animals) and 3.2 s (for one animal).</p><p>The final version of the task used the following pseudorandom method for determining the goal, available sample phase route, correct nose poke, and available test phase route for each trial. The pseudorandom sequence of trials was determined anew for each session. There are 27 distinct combinations of start position, goal location, and test phase routes. To keep these combinations in balance overall and locally and to discourage formation of preferences for a particular goal, the order of these 27 combinations was randomly permuted with the constraints that (1) each of the three subblocks of nine trials was also balanced to equally contain each start location, goal location, and test phase bridge and (2) the same goal was not repeated in more than two consecutive trials. The sample route only had the constraint that in a subblock of nine trials, for each goal location each of the routes was presented once in the sample phase. Identical blocks of 27 trials were repeated in a given session. Note that there was no indication given to the animal of the 27-trial block or 9-trial subblock structure, so the entire session appeared as a single long sequence of trials. In this final version, the animal was not allowed to correct an error in the test phase and had to go to the center to initiate a new trial. In addition to the given pseudorandomly determined sequence of trials, if the animal made an error in the test phase of a trial, that same trial could be repeated one time (but with a potentially different sample route). In terms of discouraging preferences for a given goal, repeating a trial due to an error would necessarily mean the animal was not repeating a trip to the same goal in the test phase.</p><p>After the animal was able to perform the full task, training was continued until the animals reached ~70% accuracy (total training time from naïve animal to this point was ~3.5–6 months). Then (for two animals), a Neuropixels probe was implanted in the mPFC (while for one animal, the Neuropixels probe had been implanted before training). Recording began after the animal recovered and was acclimated to the recording cable.</p><p>Between training sessions, the maze was wiped with 70% ethanol to reduce any odor cues animals might use to navigate to the correct goal. Furthermore, the maze was mounted on a turntable-like frame and rotated to one of three orientations in between sessions, to further lower the probability that animals used local cues to remember goal locations. The maze was set up in a room with multiple cues outside of the maze, such as other lab equipment. Care was taken to ensure that the reward pods at the goals all delivered the same amount of reward and appeared visually identical. These precautions were taken to ensure that animals learned to use distal, non-local cues for navigation and to encode the currently rewarded goal location.</p><p>After conclusion of the experiments in the standard maze configuration, we performed a behavioral manipulation experiment in two of the three animals in which the maze was rotated by 60 degrees, so that the reference frame changed and the goal and start positions were in between their previous positions. The initial drop in performance we observed after the rotation of the maze in the relearning experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is in line with animals using distal, non-local cues for navigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Histology</title><p>After conclusion of the experiments, animals were deeply anesthetized and underwent transcardial perfusion with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation.

Location of PFC subareas was estimated based on the entry point of the probe into the brain (after the section had been aligned to the corresponding one in the atlas) and implant depth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Neural data from Neuropixels ‘1.0’ probes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neuropixels.org">https://www.neuropixels.org</ext-link>) was recorded with SpikeGLX software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/">http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/</ext-link>). Three hundred and eighty four channels were recorded simultaneously across subareas of the mPFC in two separate frequency bands (spike: 300 Hz to 10 kHz sampled at 30 kHz and LFP: 0.5–300 Hz sampled at 2.5 kHz). The recording system and a laptop capturing the digitized data from the probe were mounted on a manually controlled, motorized rotating platform mounted at the ceiling to avoid the cable from becoming too twisted from the animals’ turning. This apparatus was used for two of three animals. For one animal, the experiment was briefly interrupted to ‘untwist’ the cable by rotating the animal when it became necessary.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All data analysis was done using custom-written programs in Matlab or Python, and for some machine learning procedures, the scikit-learn library was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Behavioral data</title><p>Animal head location and orientation during neural recording were tracked at 30 Hz with two differently colored LEDs attached to the implant. To assess vicarious trial and error behavior, the speed of the animal (across windows of 330 ms) was analyzed in the test phase. Events were counted as candidate vicarious trial and error behavioral events when the speed of the animal dropped (for at least one window) below 5 cm/s in the 800 ms time window centered around the choice point (when the animal has crossed the bridge and enters the outer ring). We found that in 8, 3, and 4 trials, the speed dropped below the threshold in this manner for each of the animals, out of 62, 110, and 64 total correct trials, respectively.</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, only correct test phase trials were used for analysis. After removing the trials in the beginning as described below, the numbers of total trials (numbers of correct trials) per animal were 79 (62), 81 (64), and 145 (110).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Preprocessing of neural data</title><p>Multiple sessions were recorded from each animal in the standard maze configuration, but only one was included in the analysis per animal as the probes were not moveable and the population of cells could not be assumed to be independent across different recording sessions. The session to be included in the analysis from each animal was selected based on a combination of good behavioral performance and a high number of trials. For the behavioral manipulation presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (rotation experiment), two animals that were previously trained and recorded in the standard configuration underwent this experiment. Because this experiment required novelty, only the first session in which the manipulation was conducted was used for analysis. JRCLUST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jun et al., 2017b</xref>) (version 08/2019, Vidrio) was used to automatically presort the spike data and then manually curate it afterwards. To allow the animal to settle into the behavioral task and to remove global drifts leading to changes in firing rate across a significant number of cells (which were observed to occur at the beginning of each session, presumably due to the handling of the rat necessary to attach the probe to the cable), 3–20 trials were removed from the beginning of each session. Because we were searching for a working memory code that was stable and robust throughout the session, and to reduce the possibility that non-stationarities would reduce the performance of the decoders, we selected for analysis the subset of cells that satisfied the following three stability/robustness criteria applied to each cell separately (but we also performed the main analyses including all cells without such selection, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). First, the overall firing rate had to be stable across the session: specifically, a linear regression on the standardized firing rate in 10 s bins over the session was performed and the absolute difference between the first bin and the last bin could not exceed 1 (i.e. the slope of any change in firing rate needed to be within ±1 s.d./n, where n = the total number of 10 s bins). Second, the firing rate in delay periods had to be stable across the session: specifically, the absolute difference of a linear regression on the summed spike count for all delay periods (3 or 3.2 s each) between the first and the last delay period could not exceed 1.4 (note that the different goals were pseudorandomly distributed across a session, so that cells selective for only one goal would not be excluded this way). Third, the cell needed to be active in a minimum number of delay periods: specifically, the cell had to fire at least one spike in at least one-sixth of all delay periods (set to potentially allow for a cell that was active in half of the delay periods for a particular goal and silent otherwise). The numbers of clusters isolated during spike sorting were 182, 131, and 98 for the three animals (152 and 186 for the relearning sessions) and, after applying the criteria above, 103, 86, and 72 (88 and 111 for the relearning sessions) cells remained. Putative fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons were excluded from analysis based on having a combination of faster waveform (shorter peak to trough interval) and higher firing rate across the whole recording duration, resulting in 97, 84, and 68 active, stable, putative principal cells for the three animals (84 and 105 for the relearning sessions).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Correlation analysis</title><p>For the correlation matrices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, a ‘goal arrival’ PV for each trial was calculated from the 3 s period after the animal had arrived at the goal in the sample phase (where time point 0 was assigned to be the time that the infrared beam on the reward pod was broken, which triggers delivery of the reward). Similarly, for all test phases, a delay period PV was calculated. The matrices containing the raw firing rates were concatenated, and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for all combinations of PVs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, only the correlations among goal PVs are shown, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the correlation between delay period PVs and goal PVs is shown.</p><p>To test whether the remembered goal is preferentially represented in the delay period over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we calculated the average PV from all sample phases when the animal was at one specific goal and correlated the resulting three PVs with each time bin in all delay periods. For each delay period, the ‘winning’ goal was either the one with the highest mean correlation with that goal across all bins or the one that had the highest number of time bins in which the correlation was highest with that goal (majority vote). A corresponding approach was taken to classify each delay period with regards to the start (current location), except the current delay period was excluded from the average of the start PV. Here and elsewhere, a bootstrap analysis was used to calculate the 95% CI of the decoding accuracy: for each binwidth, 1000 - 10,000 samples were drawn randomly from all trials from all animals with replacement and the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile values of the means were taken as the interval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>H-score analysis</title><p>To assess what information is encoded in the delay period at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), the spikes in each delay period were binned using a variety of binwidths and each cell × bin was considered one sample of a class. Several types of classes were considered separately: the current start (current location), the remembered goal, the goal in egocentric coordinates (i.e. behind the start, to the left, or to the right), or the combination of the start and the remembered goal (3 × 3 classes). The distributions of spike counts of samples belonging to different classes (e.g. the different starts) were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis test. To correct for multiple comparisons, false discovery rate correction was applied to each binwidth tested.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Supervised machine learning classification methods</title><p>Generally, for each classification method, a range of hyperparameters were tested and a set of parameters that reached the highest cross-validation accuracy for start (i.e. current location) decoding was chosen for each method and kept constant. A leave-one-out cross-validation scheme was used for all classification methods. The numbers of samples per class were balanced throughout by randomly subsampling from the class(es) with the higher number of samples in the training set. Decoding accuracy was reported as the mean of the cross-validated accuracy over all classes. For population analyses where the delay period was binned in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B,C</xref>), all bins of a given delay period were concatenated into one vector and each cell × bin was treated as a separate feature, that is the activity patterns considered were fixed with respect to the starts of the delay periods (and analogously for the phase bins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The matrix size used for classification was thus # of time bins times multiplied by # of cells x # of trials. Each feature was standardized over all trials by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (std), unless stated otherwise. Logistic regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>, right, 3C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>) was used with L2 regularization. For the time-resolved decoding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, we used overlapping windows of 800 ms (200 ms bins, steps of 200 ms) for the neural data and 330 ms for the position tracking data in (steps of 100 ms).</p><p>The support vector machine classifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1B</xref>, Figure 3C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) was used with a Gaussian kernel to allow for non-linear decision boundaries. The kernel coefficient was set to 0.001, and L2 regularization was used. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left bottom, the data was divided into nine classes, corresponding to the nine possible combinations of remembered goals and current start locations. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, three classes corresponding to either the three possible start locations, three allocentric goals, or three egocentrically defined goals were used. Correspondingly, for the analysis of task phase and spatial selectivity at the goal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; note the time period analyzed was the 3 s after the animal had arrived at the goal as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the data were divided into six classes corresponding to the six possible combinations of goal location and task phase. For the summary plot containing all animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, middle, only the classification accuracy of either phase or goal was considered. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> right, two classifiers were trained, one with all data from the sample phase and one with all data from test phase. The remaining data were each used to predict the goal it encoded, that is data from the test phase were fed into the classifier built from sample phase data and the other way around. Decoding accuracy was given as the mean over all three classes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> for trial phase decoding at the center, we only compared trials in which the animal took the same bridge back to center, so that direction of arrival at the center was comparable.</p><p>For the random forest classification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, the data was prepared and balanced as described above, and the forest contained 1000 trees for each classifier.

The LFP trace considered for a given cluster was the average of 10 LFP channels that were at least eight sites away in both directions from the center of the cluster (i.e. the site with maximum amplitude) whose phase was analyzed, generally consisting of five sites above and below the center of the site (but if the center was too close to the edge of a block of recorded channels, the 10 channels used to average could be split unequally, e.g. eight sites above and two sites below for a cluster near the bottom of a block). The LFP from 3 s before to 3 s after the delay period was filtered in the 2.5 to 5, 5 to 12, or 15 to 30 Hz (FIR filter), but only the delay period itself was considered for phase analysis. The phase of the oscillation of a frequency band was determined by calculating the angle of the Hilbert transform. Periods in which the resulting phase was not monotonically increasing between peaks were rejected (mean time rejected per delay period, across animals and the three frequency bands: 194 ms, maximum time rejected: 1.52 s, out of 3–3.2 s total) and spike times were mapped onto phases. For each cell, the spike phases from all delay periods were divided into three classes, corresponding to the currently remembered goal. The length of the mean phase (resultant vector length) was computed as a measure of preferred firing phase for each cell and class. To test whether firing phase contained any information about the remembered goal location, the labels (remembered goal 1, remembered goal 2, or remembered goal 3) of delay periods were shuffled and the distribution of resultant vector lengths were compared to the one from the actual labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, middle). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, the same approach was taken, but only cells that showed significant phase locking over all correct trials were used. In a separate approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), the phases of all spikes were binned into 2, 6, or 12 bins, corresponding to the number of spikes that were elicited in a particular phase bin (e.g. one of the bins for the 2-bin case included phases from −90 to 90 degree). All phase bins for each cell were concatenated and used as features for a logistic regression classifier trained on all but one test trial and tested on that trial (i.e. leave-one-out). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> only cells that showed significant phase locking to at least one of the goals were used (only the training set was used for selecting the phase-locked cells). To account for differences in total valid duration of each delay period (which could be less than the full duration due to the existence of periods with non-monotonically increasing phase), the counts in each bin in each delay period were divided by the total valid duration of that delay period. To account for differences in overall spike rate, these adjusted counts were normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the std over all delay periods for a given feature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Covariance analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>)</title><p>Covariance was analyzed using the method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2020</xref> and parts of the associated code at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/comptelab/interplayPFC">https://github.com/comptelab/interplayPFC</ext-link>) was used in modified form. The following adaptations were made to fit our experimental data. Only cells that were significantly modulated at the sample goal location (i.e. different for different goals) were included in the analysis. A cell’s ‘preferred goal location’ was the one where it had the highest firing rate. Only pairs of neurons that shared the same preferred goal location were considered for analysis.</p><p>As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2020</xref>, spikes for all trials were binned in 10 ms bins and shuffled in steps of 50 ms. The cross-covariance was calculated for each shuffle (1000) and the mean subtracted from each trial to remove any dynamics faster than 50 ms. The resulting (jitter-corrected) cross-covariance was taken to be the mean of the three bins around the 0-lag bin. In the case of the single time point analysis, the full delay period was considered (3 or 3.2 s). For the time-resolved version in Figure 5-figure supplement 2 bottom, time windows of 1 s were used and cross-covariance was repeatedly calculated in steps of 50 ms. An ‘excitatory pair’ of neurons was considered as such if the sign of the mean jitter-corrected covariance was positive both for the preferred and non-preferred trials and conversely considered an ‘inhibitory pair’ if the sign was negative for both. Pairs with inconsistent signs were discarded. The sign was calculated separately for the delay period only and the extended delay period in Figure 5-figure supplement 2 for the time-resolved version (−2–5 s, with 0 being the beginning of the delay period).</p><p>This procedure resulted in the following numbers of total pairs/excitatory/inhibitory for the full delay period: rat 1: 288/67/67, rat 2: 339/88/82, rat 3: 232/61/59.</p><p>For the time-resolved version, these numbers were as follows: rat 1: 288/72/59, rat 2: 339/72/84, rat 3: 232/62/66.</p><p>The cross-correlation selectivity index (CCSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2020</xref>) for the excitatory pairs was the mean difference of the cross-covariance in preferred and non-preferred trials, and similarly for the inhibitory pairs.

is believed to depend on the prefrontal cortex in mammals. This papers combines cutting edge techniques to record large ensembles of prefrontal neurons in freely moving rats performing goal-oriented behaviour and advanced data analysis methods. No neuronal correlates of the goals were found in the prefrontal cortex, thus possibly invalidating a large class of computational models.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Canonical goal representations are absent from prefrontal cortex in a spatial working memory task requiring flexibility&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Vincent Hok (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>This paper reports how prefrontal (PFC) population activity does not obviously maintain trial-relevant information. Specifically, by recording from populations of neurons in freely moving rats during a spatial working memory task, the authors did not find any neuronal correlates of memory in the interval between sampling and choosing a rewarded goal location. While the three reviewers are enthusiastic about the findings, they have all stressed out the importance of improving controls by further analyzing the reported data and adding control data. If recordings were performed in these animals during the retraining phase following surgery, the reviewers have agreed that analyzing these data would certainly be sufficient to support the main claims of the study. You will find below a point-by-point summary of the major concerns raised by the reviewers. Please refer to their reviews for more details .</p><p>1) One potential confound of the present data is that the animals perform flexible route planning and maintain a memory of the goal position simultaneously. The authors did not separate the two aspects of the task. While, ideally, the authors would have additionally performed the task with fixed routes to disambiguate the contribution of route planning and spatial working memory, the authors should analyze data acquired during retraining after surgery – if these data were collected. A (likely) lower performance during retraining would allow the authors to further investigate how neuronal activity correlates (or not) with task parameters.</p><p>2) At any rate, the present data should be more carefully analyzed. First, along the lines of the last comment, the authors should report any difference between correct and error trials.</p><p>3) Furthermore, working memory during this task may be loaded/encoded as soon as the rat observes the sample cue light, which indicates a given trial's goal location. For this reason, it is reasonable to assume that the &quot;delay period&quot; starts and ends considerably beyond the 3s nose poke. Analyses extending to a fuller task timeline are required to provide a full picture of the neuronal processes at play during the task. See for example the study by Maggi et al., 2018, where the authors showed that neuronal correlates of task parameters appeared as the animals return to the starting point.</p><p>4) Different PFC neurons likely show different correlates to task parameters. The authors should provide statistics relative to the proportion of units showing goal location or any other representation of interest and investigate whether these representations are captured by the population-level analysis.</p><p>5) Can the authors be sure the rats can distinguish the reward magnitude, in other words discriminate between sample and test phases? Are there distinct neural correlates of these features?</p><p>6) The authors should report more details regarding animal behaviour. For instance, how often do animals progress directly to the correct goal, rather than trying each option sequentially? Do they always take the shortest path? If not, how does search behaviour progress through training? Does making an initial error lead to a faster run on the final approach to the correct goal? Do they show vicarious trial and error behavior in the task?</p><p>7) The LFP analysis should be improved. It may be that only a subset of the PFC population significantly phase-lock to 6-12Hz or 15-30Hz oscillations, but this would be missed by the current treatment. If 6-12Hz and 15-30Hz were chosen on the basis of &quot;power during the delay&quot;, how did power vary? What about γ rhythms (see γ burst during working memory by Earl Miller and colleagues)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I enjoyed reading this cognitive neuroscience manuscript, which combines a novel assay of goal-directed behavior in rat with chronic electrophysiological recording of prefrontal (PFC) cortical network activity. The experiments are well-designed and clearly described, the manuscript is readable and succinct, and analyses are sensibly motivated by the literature. The emphasis lies on a negative finding: that PFC population activity does not obviously maintain trial-relevant information during a stage of the task that occurs between sampling and choosing a rewarded goal location.</p><p>One key challenge for the authors is therefore to rule-out a false negative. This is not to say that a representation absolutely must be in the PFC somewhere and at some point during this task. After all, the task itself is novel and training extended over several months, making direct comparisons with existing data from (e.g.) T-mazes difficult. It is conceivable – but unlikely – that rats could perform the task without a functional PFC. The ideal would be to see the same rats perform a &quot;canonical&quot; working memory task, and check whether &quot;canonical&quot; representations do emerge under &quot;canonical&quot; conditions. A varied delay length would also be of interest; but I accept neither of these is a reasonable ask during a pandemic. With this in mind, I have the following comments:</p><p>1) The title is unintentionally misleading, since it states that representations are absent – but they have only been hunted during the 3s nose-poke / delay stage of the task.</p><p>2) In principle, working memory during this task may be loaded/encoded as soon as the rat observes the sample cue light, which indicates a given trial's goal location. So the &quot;delay period&quot; starts and ends considerably beyond the 3s nose poke. I think equivalent analyses extending to a fuller task timeline are required to make (more) sense of what is going on.</p><p>As an example, Maggi et al., 2018, analyzed rat PFC activity on a Y-maze. They show ensemble encoding of goal as rats return to the centre of the maze post-reward, but only during recording sessions associated with an inflexion in behavioral performance. Considering more task stages and relating analyses to behavior beyond picking a &quot;good&quot; session for each rat may change the picture.</p><p>3) Most analyses treat the PFC population as one. What proportion of units signal goal location? What if a subset of neurons carry the representation(s) of interest? Would this be captured by the current approach?</p><p>4) Can the authors be sure the rats can distinguish the reward magnitude, in other words discriminate between sample and test phases? Are there distinct neural correlates of these features?</p><p>5) The LFP phase analysis is briefly described and quite cursory. For instance, it may be that only a subset of the PFC population significantly phase-lock to 6-12Hz or 15-30Hz oscillations, but this would be missed by the current treatment. If 6-12Hz and 15-30Hz were chosen on the basis of &quot;power during the delay&quot;, how did power vary? What about γ rhythms (see γ burst during working memory by Earl Miller and colleagues)?</p><p>6) What happens on error trials?</p><p>7) Description of the animals' behavior is brief and requires further important details of this novel task in order for readers to grasp how rats might arrive at potential solutions. For instance, how often do animals progress directly to the correct goal, rather than trying each option sequentially? Do they always take the shortest path? If not, how does search behaviour progress through training? Does making an initial error lead to a faster run on the final approach to the correct goal? Do they show vicarious trial and error behavior in the task?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Bohm and Lee investigated the neuronal representations in the PFC during the spatial working memory task that needed flexible navigation. In this task, the rats were required to remember the goal position, and the routes from the start to the goal varied every trial. They recorded neuronal activities in the PFC during the task and found that PFC neurons did not represent goal-positon-related information during the delay periods at the start position. The topic is of great interest, and the paper contains some intriguing results. However, there is one major concern that should be addressed to support their claims.</p><p>1) One crucial issue is that the paper is missing proper control experiments. Because the authors attempt to claim that &quot;PFC neurons represents goal-related information in the working memory task without flexible route navigation (e.g., the routes are fixed), but do not represent it in the working memory task with flexible route navigation,&quot; they need to perform both the route-flexible and route-fixed working memory tasks with the same experimental apparatus. Otherwise, we cannot assess whether the lack of differential activity patterns of PFC neurons was due to the task structure (i.e., due to flexible navigation) or other reasons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>First of all, I would like to thank the authors for the great clarity of their manuscript, the quality of the analyses and the associated figures. Although it is difficult for me to rule on the relevance of certain parameters used in the t-SNE analysis, I was overall more than convinced by the results produced. In fact, the authors, in my opinion, performed all the relevant analyses to try to extract as much information as possible from their data set.</p><p>Nevertheless, one major question remains to be addressed. Given the extremely long learning time in this type of task, one may wonder whether the prefrontal cortex remains involved.</p><p>1) Because of the large amount of work this would represent, it would be unreasonable to ask the authors to perform a control experiment aiming at inactivating the prefrontal cortex when the animals master the task. Perhaps an acceptable solution would be to conduct the same analyses when the animals reacquire the task post-surgery, or at least when their overall performance level is significantly lower than that presented in the paper and significantly higher than the level of chance. The idea would be that in this reacquisition phase, the prefrontal cortex would be more likely to show correlates related to route planning.</p><p>2) The authors mention that one of the three animals was implanted prior to task acquisition. Although it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from a single animal, perhaps it is possible to analyze the activity of the prefrontal cortex in this animal during the learning of the last behavioural phase.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63035.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper reports how prefrontal (PFC) population activity does not obviously maintain trial-relevant information.

One animal received surgery before training but was not recorded in the training phase. In the other two animals, we initially retrained the animal using a dummy cable to habituate them to running with the implant and cable. We did collect some data during retraining, but the animal’s performance could be due to residual habituation to the cable, any residual recovery, etc, as well as the cognitive demands posed by relearning. However, we did perform a behavioral manipulation experiment in two of the three animals after they were fully retrained (after the recording sessions analyzed in the original manuscript), which allowed us to analyze activity during learning/relearning in this task with high trial numbers and free of potential confounds. In these experiments we rotated the maze, which is mounted on a rotatable frame, by 60 degrees so that the reference frame changed and the goal and start positions were in between their previous positions. Animals had never seen this configuration before or witnessed a rotation of the maze. We conducted the rotation approximately a third of the way through the session. Consistent with the idea that the animals must adapt to the new configuration and relearn to apply previously internalized rules, their performance dropped dramatically and gradually improved over the course of the session. We originally conducted these experiments to study remapping of a distributed spatial code such as the one we observed in prefrontal cortex.</p><p>However, since these appear to be ideal data sets to answer the question posed by the reviewer about the effect of learning on the representation of task variables, we have included them in this manuscript. We were able to sort 152 (84 stable pyramidal cells) and 186 (105 stable pyramidal cells) mPFC neurons from each animal during performance in rotation sessions that consisted of 45 and 40 trials in the standard configuration followed by 104 and 88 trials after rotation, where the number of trials performed after the manipulation is as many as in the standard sessions included in the original manuscript. We tested whether the higher cognitive demand during relearning could elicit a detectable representation of the currently remembered goal during the nose poke fixation delay period. Applying the various population-level machine learning classification methods at multiple time resolutions as in the standard sessions, we found no evidence for such representations. These data provide further evidence that flexible working memory is not encoded in prefrontal cortex in a canonical form. In contrast, spatial representation of the start locations is again strongly represented even as the animal adapts to the new configuration. We have added these two new data sets and analysis to the revised manuscript, in a new Figure 4, and in the Results, Discussion, and Materials and methods sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) At any rate, the present data should be more carefully analyzed.

First, we have analyzed the population vector activity at the goal during the sample phase, when the current goal is presumably encoded for later use in the test phase of the trial. The encoding during the sample phase is of particular interest in our task design because the current goal can change trial by trial as our task does not have a block structure. Inspired by the work of Maggi et al., 2018 (which was pointed out by the reviewers in point #3), we tested whether the correlation between the population vectors of prospective correct trials differed from the correlation between the population vectors between prospective error trials, and we found no difference. Second, again inspired by Maggi et al., 2018, we have analyzed data retrospective to the outcome of a trial. Here we found that activity after the animal has made an error is markedly different from activity in correct trials. This could be explained by the presence of reward in correct trials and the missing reward in error trials or the resulting differences in behavior. However, correlations between correct trial population vectors were similar to correlations between error trial population vectors. These analyses complement our survey of error information in the delay period in the original manuscript. We have included these new analyses in new panels to Figure 6 and have added the following text to the Results section:</p><p>“First, we analyzed if the activity at the goal in the sample phase (presumably during encoding) differs when there is an error in the subsequent test phase or not, but this was not the case. In contrast, after the animal had made an incorrect choice in the test phase, activity at the goal was markedly different, presumably due to the lack of reward; however, correlations between the population vectors of activity at the goal among correct trials and, separately, among error trials was comparable (Figure 6A)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Furthermore, working memory during this task may be loaded/encoded as soon as the rat observes the sample cue light, which indicates a given trial's goal location. For this reason, it is reasonable to assume that the &quot;delay period&quot; starts and ends considerably beyond the 3s nose poke. Analyses extending to a fuller task timeline are required to provide a full picture of the neuronal processes at play during the task. See for example the study by Maggi et al., 2018, where the authors showed that neuronal correlates of task parameters appeared as the animals return to the starting point.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that an analysis of other time periods than the controlled delay period (nose poke) are of great interest and we have conducted a comprehensive survey throughout the task timeline. We have analyzed our data in a temporally resolved fashion aligned to multiple reference time points during trial progression. Specifically, we tested how well the current goal can be decoded surrounding the time points: (1) when the animal arrives at the goal during the sample phase, (2) when the animal returns to the center during the transition between sample and test phase, (3) when the route becomes available (the end of the nose poke delay period), (4) around the choice point when the animal enters the outer ring in the test phase, and (5) when the animal arrives at the goal during the test phase. Importantly, we have conducted these analyses not only for the neural data but also for position tracking data that we obtained by following the two LEDs attached to the animals’ head during recordings. These data show that it is possible to decode the currently remembered goal location from the neural data at various other time points. However, a comparison to the ability to decode the current goal location based on position tracking data reveals a very high similarity in the time course of the appearance of a current goal signal in the neural data and the tracking data. Thus, it is likely that the apparent representation of the currently remembered goal is likely a representation of the animal’s position, posture or other behavioral features that happen to be correlated with the location of the current goal.</p><p>These data emphasize the importance of and validate our novel task design, which is specifically designed to feature a specific delay period (the nose poke fixation delay) during which any representation, if found, is free of other behavioral correlates. These data also serve as an important control as they show that the lack of a representation in the delay period (nose poke) is not due to insufficient amounts of data. We have included these new analyses as Figure 3—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Different PFC neurons likely show different correlates to task parameters. The authors should provide statistics relative to the proportion of units showing goal location or any other representation of interest and investigate whether these representations are captured by the population-level analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point we analyzed the spatial selectivity for start (i.e. nose poke delay) locations and goal locations for each animal at the single-cell level (the analysis for remembered goal locations is included in the manuscript in Figure 3—figure supplement 2). For each neuron we tested if its firing rate is significantly different for start locations (when the animal was at those locations during the nose poke delay) or goal locations (when the animal was at the goal itself in the sample phase). We have now included displays of the proportions of cells that are selective for start only, for goal only, for both or for neither. Either type of selectivity was found in all animals: the proportion of neurons that showed any spatial selectivity ranged between 54 and 72 %. Between 25 and 29 % of neurons distinguished only between goal locations and 9 to 16 % only between start locations, while 15 to 31 % of neurons had significantly different firing rates both at different goals and at different starts. To further investigate if cells of a given selectivity were predominantly found in a particular subarea, we investigated their distribution across subareas. We found that cells with any type of selectivity could reside in any subarea.</p><p>For population-level analysis, especially correlations, it is conceivable that goal-location specific activity in the delay period is concealed by neurons that do not contain goal-location specific activity. We thus searched for goal-location specific population activity in the delay period including only neurons that show goal-location specific activity at the goals themselves. The result strongly resembles the one found when including all neurons, again suggesting that current goal information is not maintained in canonical form in the delay period, even when measures like this to improve the signal to noise ratio are taken.</p><p>We have included these new analyses in a new figure supplement (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and present these new findings in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the authors be sure the rats can distinguish the reward magnitude, in other words discriminate between sample and test phases? Are there distinct neural correlates of these features?</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the data while the animal is at the goal and compared the activity in the sample and in the test phase (which is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Indeed, we can not only decode which goal the animal is currently at but also almost perfectly if the animal is visiting the goal in the test or in the sample phase. This might reflect the different amount of reward the animal receives or the different task phases per se. When animals return to the center they receive a small amount of reward which is not different in test and sample phases. Thus, we also tested if we can decode task phase in this period (Figure 6C). This was only possible after there were other sensory cues indicating the task phase (such as the lights going on) or the behavior was markedly different – suggesting that “pure” task phase might not be represented. We have expanded and clarified the description of these findings in the result section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should report more details regarding animal behaviour. For instance, how often do animals progress directly to the correct goal, rather than trying each option sequentially? Do they always take the shortest path? If not, how does search behaviour progress through training? Does making an initial error lead to a faster run on the final approach to the correct goal? Do they show vicarious trial and error behavior in the task?</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid confusing the animal, we did not allow the animal to correct themselves. If the first choice was wrong, they had to return to center and would be presented with a new sample phase. Thus, none of the trials which are counted as correct are preceded by incorrect choices.</p><p>Regarding the shortest path: In the test phase of trials, in the ~2/3 of cases in which one of the bridges adjacent to the current goal location is the one that is made available, rats most often take the shortest route (in 88%, 81% and 95% of trials for each of the animals, respectively), suggesting the animal indeed uses a map to navigate instead of a route planning or recognition strategy. We have added this information to the manuscript in the Results section. (Note that in the ~1/3 of cases in which the available bridge/route is opposite to the current goal, making a turn in either direction leads to routes to the goal of equal length.)</p><p>Regarding how behavior progresses through training: Animals are trained in stages, thus the strategy the animal chooses is impacted by the experimental design. Only early on in the training are the animals cued to go to the same goal more than one time. This only serves to teach the animal to understand the cues. As soon as the animal understands how the cueing works (which takes only a few sessions), each goal is only cued once in the sample phase, followed by the test phase. If the animal made an error in the sample phase (this is very rare), we repeat the sample phase to make sure the animal knows where the current goal is.</p><p>Regarding vicarious trial and error behavior: We have analyzed the speed of the animal (in windows of 330 ms length) in the test phase and find that in the majority of trials the animal did not stop to consider its choices. Specifically, we counted events as candidate vicarious trial and error behavior when the speed of the animal dropped below 5 cm/s in the 800 ms time window around the choice point (when the animal enters the outer ring after it crosses a bridge). We found that in 8, 3 and 4 trials the speed dropped below the threshold in this manner for each animal, out of 62, 110, and 64 total correct trials, respectively. We have added this observation to the Results and Materials and methods section of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The LFP analysis should be improved. It may be that only a subset of the PFC population significantly phase-lock to 6-12Hz or 15-30Hz oscillations, but this would be missed by the current treatment. If 6-12Hz and 15-30Hz were chosen on the basis of &quot;power during the delay&quot;, how did power vary? What about γ rhythms (see γ burst during working memory by Earl Miller and colleagues)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have accordingly conducted additional analyses: the distribution of the vector length as a measure of phase locking was extended and repeated using only cells that were significantly phase locked. For none of the tested conditions, frequency bands 2.5 – 5 Hz, 5 – 12 Hz and 15 – 30 Hz, egocentric or allocentric goal location, was the distribution significantly different from a distribution where the class labels, i.e. the currently remembered goal or the goal in egocentric coordinates were shuffled. We have also extended our decoding analysis using spike counts at specific phases. Here, to increase sensitivity as much as possible, we have included all cells that were significantly phase locked for any of the three goals in allocentric or egocentric coordinates, corresponding to the type of class labels used for decoding. The results were comparable to those without such selection. These new results are presented in the revised manuscript in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The frequency bands chosen for analysis were those that exhibited the highest power across the delay period. We should note that there was an offset error in the time windows for the LFP analysis in the original manuscript. This has been corrected, and the updated figures are in the manuscript. The updated spectrograms showed a peak of power in the 2.5-5 Hz frequency band in addition to the 5-12 and 15-30 Hz bands, so we also analyzed those data, the results were comparable to those for the other two bands and we have added the new frequency band to the classification analyses figures and added a note referring to the 2.5 – 5 Hz frequency band in the distribution of vector length analysis. We have now also added a plot of the mean power over the delay period next to the mean spectrograms shown in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Regarding γ bursts, to the best of our knowledge, in the work detecting γ bursts during the delay period, the delay periods generally also showed overall working memory content in the firing rates throughout the delay, which was not observed in our data. Therefore, we think that the potential role of γ bursts in supporting working memory in tasks such as ours is a potentially promising avenue for future investigation. Related to this, we did perform the covariance analysis of Barbosa et al., 2020, which is one of the few studies that looks into how stimulus information could be maintained in the absence of differential firing rates, though in our case goal information was not detected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
