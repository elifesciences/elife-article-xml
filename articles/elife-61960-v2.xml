However, how dead cells lose ATP has not been well investigated. In this study, we developed new FRET biosensors for dual imaging of intracellular ATP level and caspase-3 activity in single apoptotic cultured human cells. We show that the cytosolic ATP level starts to decrease immediately after the activation of caspase-3, and this process is completed typically within 2 hr. The ATP decrease was facilitated by caspase-dependent cleavage of the plasma membrane channel pannexin-1, indicating that the intracellular decrease of the apoptotic cell is a ‘programmed’ process. Apoptotic cells deficient of pannexin-1 sustained the ability to produce ATP through glycolysis and to consume ATP, and did not stop wasting glucose much longer period than normal apoptotic cells. Thus, the pannexin-1 plays a role in arresting the metabolic activity of dead apoptotic cells, most likely through facilitating the loss of intracellular ATP.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>biosensor</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22687011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imamura</surname><given-names>Hiromi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24657101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imamura</surname><given-names>Hiromi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K14709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imamura</surname><given-names>Hiromi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cleavage of pannexin-1 channel by caspases facilitates the loss of intracellular ATP level and attenuates glycolytic metabolism of apoptotic cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Living cells require energy that is provided by the principal intracellular energy carrier, adenosine-triphosphate (ATP). Free energy from ATP that is released upon hydrolysis is utilized in various vital processes including the generation and maintenance of the plasma membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaplan, 2002</xref>), remodeling of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vignali et al., 2000</xref>), locomotion of molecular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vale, 2003</xref>), protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ciechanover, 1994</xref>), and metabolic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Voet and Voet, 2010</xref>). Therefore, living cells must maintain high concentrations of intracellular ATP by continuously regenerating ATP from its hydrolysis products, adenosine-diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate ion, via energy metabolism that uses chemical energy stored in cellular nutrients, such as glucose. On the other hand, dead cells contain very little, or even no ATP.</p><p>Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, with important roles in development, tissue homeostasis, and immunity. It is characterized by distinctive morphological changes, such as membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and externalization of phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore, 2007</xref>). Although there are a variety of stimuli that can provoke apoptosis, these stimuli converge into the activation of a proteolytic cascade of cysteine proteases, called caspases. Because cleavage of specific target proteins by activated effector caspases triggers apoptotic events, including the characteristic morphological changes, apoptotic cell death is a systematically and genetically determined, or ‘programmed’, process. In contrast, necrosis is considered to be the ‘unprogrammed’, cataclysmic demise of the cell.</p><p>It has been reported that cells die from necrosis rather than apoptosis when intracellular ATP is depleted prior to otherwise apoptotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eguchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leist et al., 1997</xref>). It has been also reported that dATP/ATP is required for the formation of cytochrome c/Apaf-1/procaspase-9 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, it is suggested that ATP is required for chromatin condensation of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kass et al., 1996</xref>). Apoptosis is, thus, considered to be an energy-demanding process, requiring intracellular ATP for the execution of the cell death program. In spite of, or perhaps in part due to the requirement of ATP for apoptosis, the intracellular ATP in apoptotic cells is ultimately depleted. Therefore, it seems likely that both maintenance and reduction of the intracellular ATP level are systematically regulated during the progression of apoptosis. Intracellular ATP levels have been conventionally analyzed with the firefly luciferin-luciferase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lundin and Thore, 1975</xref>), liquid chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sellevold et al., 1986</xref>), or related methods, which use lysates of a large number of cells. Because apoptosis progresses differently between cells (for example see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldstein et al., 2000</xref>), even those cultured and stimulated in identical conditions, it has been quite difficult to precisely understand the dynamics of the intracellular ATP level in each dying apoptotic cell, and difficult to tell whether the ATP decrease accompanies specific apoptotic events. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of how intracellular ATP decreases in apoptotic cells also remains to be elucidated. In addition, it is totally unclear whether the depleted intracellular ATP in an apoptotic cell benefits the dying cell itself or the surrounding, healthy cells.</p><p>In this work, we established a method for imaging both ATP concentration and caspase-3 activity in a single apoptotic cell with newly developed genetically encoded Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors for ATP and caspase-3 activity. We found that the intracellular ATP level starts to decrease following the activation of caspase-3 and that the caspase-triggered opening of the plasma membrane channel pannexin-1 (PANX1) is the major cause of the decrease in intracellular ATP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of FRET biosensors for dual imaging of ATP and caspase-3 activity of apoptotic cells</title><p>In general, the progression of apoptosis varies between individual cells, even in the same cell type. It is, thus, essentially difficult to understand how the intracellular ATP level in a particular cell changes during apoptosis using conventional biochemical analyses of pooled cells, such as firefly luciferase assays. To reveal the dynamics of intracellular ATP levels during apoptosis at the single-cell level, we first used a genetically encoded FRET-based ATP biosensor, ATeam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>), which is comprised of a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP; mseCFP), an F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase ε subunit and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; cp173-mVenus). Unfortunately, we found that the original ATeam (AT1.03) was cleaved into its constituent pair of separate fluorescent proteins in apoptotic cells, most probably by activated caspases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the FRET signals of the original biosensor were reduced in apoptotic cells irrespective of the ATP concentration. We replaced Asp-242 and Asp-339 of AT1.03, which we predicted were within the target sequences of the caspases, with Asn and Gly, respectively, and found that the altered ATeam was not cleaved inside apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We subsequently used this caspase-resistant ATeam (AT1.03CR) to study the ATP dynamics in apoptotic cells.</p><p>The dynamics of cytosolic ATP levels throughout the apoptotic process were investigated by imaging single human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells expressing AT1.03CR. Overall, the intracellular ATP levels remained almost constant for several hours after stimulation. The cytosolic ATP levels in these cells started to decrease after a variable time interval (typically from 3 to 8 hr after apoptotic stimulation, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Once the intracellular ATP levels started to decrease, they were depleted within typically 0.5–2 hr.</p><p>The presence of a pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk almost completely blocked the cytosolic ATP decrease of anti-FAS-induced apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the ATP decrease induced by apoptotic stimuli is most likely a caspase-dependent process. Next, we developed a FRET-based caspase-3 biosensor O-DEVD-FR by connecting an orange fluorescent protein mKOκ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsutsui et al., 2008</xref>) and a far-red fluorescent protein mKate2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shcherbo et al., 2009</xref>) by a Gly-Gly-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Gly-Thr linker containing a <italic>bona fide</italic> caspase-3 recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Once caspase-3 is activated, it cleaves the linker in O-DEVD-FR, resulting in the separation of mKOκ and mKate2, and the consequent reduction in FRET signal in apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It was recently demonstrated that mKOκ-mKate2 FRET pair is compatible with CFP-YFP FRET pair because they use different spectral windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watabe et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is possible to use both biosensors to fluorescently image ATP level and caspase-3 activity in the same apoptotic cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Activation of caspase-3 was clearly observed as a decrease in FRET signal (an increase in mKO/mKate ratio). We defined onset of caspase-3 activation as the frame immediately preceding the first frame in which the increase in mKO/mKate ratio was first observed (see an arrow in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It was observed that intracellular ATP started to decrease after the onset of caspase-3 activation, also supporting that the ATP decrease of the apoptotic cell is a caspase-dependent process. It should be noted that any increase or decrease in fluorescence intensity due to cell morphological change was offset because we monitored the ratios of fluorescence intensities of an acceptor and a donor of the FRET biosensors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The initiation of cytosolic ATP decrease occurs almost simultaneously with that of caspase-3 activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single-cell ATP dynamics after anti-FAS treatment in the absence and the presence of zVAD-fmk.

It has been reported that apoptotic cells release ATP, AMP, and also UTP through the PANX1 channel as ‘find-me’ signals to attract macrophages and that the PANX1 channel is opened by caspase-3/7, which cleaves the C-terminal region of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elliott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamaguchi et al., 2014</xref>). The previous cell population-based study has reported that accumulation of extracellular adenine nucleotides correlates with decreases in intracellular ATP during the apoptotic progression of Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyd-Tressler et al., 2014</xref>). In order to investigate the impact of PANX1 on intracellular ATP dynamics during apoptosis at a single-cell level with high temporal resolution, we utilized the dual imaging setup for ATP and caspase-3 activity to PANX1-knock out (KO) HeLa cell lines (PANX1-KO1 and PANX1-KO2), which were generated using a CRISPR-Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Strikingly, decreases in the intracellular ATP levels of PANX1-KO cells after caspase-3 activation were significantly slower than those of wild-type HeLa cells when apoptosis was induced by anti-FAS antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). Knockout of PANX1 apparently has no effect on the ability of the cells to undergo cell death. A marked suppression of ATP decrease by knockout of PANX1 was also observed when apoptosis was induced by staurosporine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Moreover, knockout of PANX1 also suppressed the decrease in ATP during TRAIL-induced apoptosis of SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, PANX1 is involved in the facilitation of intracellular ATP decreases during apoptosis in multiple cell types and on various apoptotic stimuli. Notably, the intracellular ATP levels of PANX1-KO cells were almost unchanged in the first 30–60 min after the activation of caspase-3, followed by a gradual ATP decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The lag in the cytosolic ATP decrease observed for PANX1-KO cells might be partially relevant to the previous observation by Zamaraeva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zamaraeva et al., 2005</xref>), which suggested the enhancement of cytosolic ATP level after apoptotic stimulation. Single-cell imaging also provided unexpected observations that intracellular ATP concentration transiently and repeatedly re-elevated on the course of the gradual ATP decrease in some populations of the PANX1-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although the mechanism for these fluctuations in the intracellular ATP concentrations is unknown at present, the fluctuations must reflect either fluctuation in the rate of regeneration of ATP from ADP, that of adenosine nucleotide synthesis through de novo/salvage pathways, or that of degradation/release of ATP, or a combination thereof.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Knockout of PANX1 suppresses the cytosolic ATP decrease during apoptotic progression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of PANX1 expression of wild-type and PANX1-KO HeLa cells.

When PANX1-CR is overexpressed, most of the intrinsic wild-type PANX1 molecules are predicted to form hetero-heptamer with overexpressed PANX1-CR. The PANX1 hetero-heptamer will be expected to have much less channel activity than the wild-type PANX1 homo-heptamer as caspase-3 cannot separate the inhibitory C-terminal region from PANX1-CR inside the hetero-heptamers. In fact, it has been reported that the overexpression of PANX1-CR significantly suppresses the release of ATP from apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, the intracellular ATP depletion was significantly protracted by the overexpression of PANX1-CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), clearly indicating that the cleavage of the C-terminal region of PANX1 by caspases is required for the PANX1-dependent intracellular ATP decrease of apoptotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Single-cell dynamics of cytosolic ATP during apoptosis under an OXPHOS-dominant culture condition</title><p>It is known that cells in normal adult tissues preferentially use oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria for the regeneration of ATP, while cells in embryonic tissues and tumors use glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>). In the experiments described thus far we used HeLa cells cultured in glucose-containing medium. The cells preferentially regenerate ATP by glycolysis rather than OXPHOS under these conditions. To examine the role of PANX1 in apoptosis of OXPHOS-dominant cells, we compared the dynamics of intracellular ATP in PANX1-KO HeLa cells with those in wild-type cells during apoptotic progression under an OXPHOS-dominant culture condition. The cytosolic ATP level after the onset of caspase-3 activation dropped more quickly in the OXPHOS-dominant condition than in the glycolysis-dependent condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), probably because mitochondrial membrane potential ∆<italic>Ψ</italic><sub>m</sub>, which is required for mitochondrial ATP regeneration, is almost lost upon activation of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Thus, it is most likely that the intracellular ATP decrease of apoptotic cells is a result of a reduction in adenosine nucleotide pools inside apoptotic cells, which is caused, at least in part, by the release of AMP from the cells.

First, we examined the Mg<sup>2+</sup> dynamics of apoptotic cells. Mg<sup>2+</sup> is an essential divalent cation in cells, required for various cellular processes, including the activity of endonucleases and the compaction of chromosomes during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartwig, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeshima et al., 2018</xref>). It is known that most of the intracellular ATP form a complex with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, due to the high affinity of ATP for Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gupta and Moore, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grubbs, 2002</xref>). Thus, ATP acts as a major intracellular chelator for Mg<sup>2+</sup>. We hypothesized that the PANX1-dependent cytosolic ATP decrease might affect free Mg<sup>2+</sup> in apoptotic cells, and investigated the dynamics of free Mg<sup>2+</sup> in single apoptotic HeLa cells using a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sensing fluorescent probe MGH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matsui et al., 2017</xref>). In wild-type cells, free Mg<sup>2+</sup> was transiently decreased after shrinkage of the cells. Subsequently, free Mg<sup>2+</sup> began to increase and often reached higher than the basal level. In contrast, the fluctuations in free Mg<sup>2+</sup> were significantly suppressed in apoptotic PANX1-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Although the cause of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> decrease observed immediately after cell shrinkage is unclear, it might be possible that PANX1 transiently releases Mg<sup>2+</sup> from cytosol to extracellular space. The Mg<sup>2+</sup> increase in the second phase might be coupled with the decrease in ATP, an intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> chelator. Taken together, PANX1 regulates the dynamics of free Mg<sup>2+</sup> in apoptotic cells, likely in part by decreasing ATP concentrations inside cells. Second, we examined the role of PANX1 on the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on plasma membrane, one of the hallmarks of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagata, 2018</xref>). Externalized PS functions as an ‘eat-me’ signal for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. We examined whether PANX1 channel affects the externalization of PS in the plasma membrane by quantifying the amount of externalized PS using fluorescently-labeled annexin-V. As a result, no significant difference in the externalized PS was observed between wild-type and PANX1-KO HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that neither the PANX1-dependent intracellular ATP reduction or PANX1 itself does not contribute to the externalization of PS during apoptotic progression.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>PANX1 regulates the cytosolic free Mg<sup>2+</sup> level, but not the externalization of phosphatidylserine, in apoptotic cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells expressing Halo-tag were loaded with Halo-TMR and a magnesium indicator MGH(AM), followed by induction of apoptosis.

These observations suggest that an intracellular system for regenerating ATP from ADP and phosphate may still be active in dying apoptotic cells. In living cells, glycolysis and OXPHOS play prominent roles in the regeneration of ATP. To examine whether these ATP regenerating pathways are active, we treated PANX1-KO cells with either an inhibitor for glycolysis or OXPHOS after activation of caspase-3 while monitoring the dynamics of cytosolic ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). We used 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) or sodium oxamate, which are an inhibitor for hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively, to inhibit glycolysis, whereas used oligomycin A, which is an inhibitor for F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase, to inhibit OXPHOS. Treatment with either 2DG or sodium oxamate induced a rapid decrease in intracellular ATP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). In contrast, treatment with oligomycin A, an inhibitor of OXPHOS, seemed to have only a small effect on intracellular ATP dynamics under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These observations indicate that apoptotic processes do not disrupt the glycolytic system of the cells and that even dying apoptotic cells retain the ability to regenerate ATP by glycolysis. The rapid decrease in cytosolic ATP concentration of apoptotic PANX1-KO cells by inhibition of glycolysis also implies that at least some of the intracellular ATP-utilizing systems are active during apoptosis if sufficient intracellular ATP is present. It has been previously reported that apoptotic cells treated with a PANX1 inhibitor showed continuous and extensive blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poon et al., 2014</xref>), which is dependent on myosin ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coleman et al., 2001</xref>). Consistently, we also observed that PANX1-KO cells showed more extensive blebbing than wild-type cells during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Moreover, forced ATP depletion of apoptotic PANX1-KO cells by 2DG leaded to the reduction of the blebbing of the cells (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). It is also likely that the reduction of ATP during apoptosis leads to the decrease in the activities of other ATPases because ATPase activity depends on the concentration of ATP. We expected that if the intracellular ATP concentration of apoptotic cells is not depleted, the cycle of ATP consumption and regeneration will continue, resulting in a continuous glucose consumption by the cells. To examine glycolytic activity in apoptotic cells, we quantified the consumption of glucose and the release of lactate by wild-type and PANX1-KO HeLa cells after induction of apoptosis. Both cells exhibited similar glucose consumption and lactate production rates when apoptosis was not induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Glucose consumption and lactate production by wild-type cells had almost ceased by 16 hr after induction of apoptosis, while those by PANX1-KO cells continued for at least 32 hr when apoptosis was induced by anti-FAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Trends of glucose consumption and lactate production by those cells were quite similar when apoptosis was induced by ultraviolet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Thus, apoptotic cells with deficient PANX1 activity have a prolonged glycolytic activity compared to normal apoptotic cells.

This method allowed us to analyze the single-cell dynamics of cytosolic ATP level after caspase-3 activation, which occurs at different times in different cells. It was clearly shown that the cytosolic ATP level remained almost constant until caspase-3 was activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). We did not observe any profound immediate ATP changes upon induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), in contrast to the previous intracellular ATP analysis from populations of cells using firefly luciferase that has suggested acute ATP production when apoptosis is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zamaraeva et al., 2005</xref>). This discrepancy is not clear at present. Once caspase-3 was activated, cytosolic ATP level of the cells started to drop and was typically depleted within 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Previous studies have shown that sufficient levels of intracellular ATP are required for progression of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eguchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leist et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zamaraeva et al., 2005</xref>) and that pre-reduction of intracellular ATP inhibits the activation of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zamaraeva et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, apoptosome formation has been shown to require dATP/ATP in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 1997</xref>). Taken together, it is likely that maintenance of high intracellular ATP is critical to activate caspases. Further analysis on cytosolic ATP dynamics demonstrated that PANX1 channels play a major role in intracellular ATP depletion in apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, S4 and S5). It has been reported that PANX1 releases adenine and uridine nucleotides upon activation by cleavage of the C-terminal cytosolic region of the protein by effector caspases (caspase-3 and 7) and that the released nucleotides act as ‘find-me’ signals for attracting macrophages, which engulf apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamaguchi et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we show that the caspase-dependent cleavage of PANX1 is also crucial for the intracellular ATP depletion, meaning that intracellular ATP depletion in apoptotic cells is a ‘programmed’ process rather than a passive phenomenon. The depletion of intracellular ATP is most likely the result of the decrease in intracellular adenine nucleotide pool, caused by the release of AMP from the cytosol to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It should be noted that the intracellular ATP decrease in apoptotic cells could not be completely stopped by knockout of PANX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, there must be an additional mechanism of decreasing the intracellular ATP level in apoptotic cells, which is also likely to contribute to the kinetic variations in cytosolic ATP reduction among individual apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Metabolism is one of the major biological activity of living systems. The metabolic activity of cells is an indicator of ‘the state of being alive’. In other words, in order for a cell to ‘die a complete death’, metabolism must stop. However, it has not been well understood how metabolism of dead cells ceases. Our results showed that PANX1 plays a major role in stopping glycolysis, a central part of metabolism, of apoptotic cells, most likely through facilitating ATP loss. The suppression of glucose expenditure by apoptotic cells may benefit surrounding live cells because the resource of glucose for surrounding live cells would be limited if dying cells continued to consume glucose. Besides, macrophages that eat apoptotic cells may encounter a risk of energy deprivation if the eaten cells actively consume glucose inside the macrophages.</p><p>Because the removal of apoptotic cells by macrophages is critical to suppress inflammation and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagata, 2018</xref>), stimulating local macrophages by ATP and related nucleotides released through PANX1 channels should be a biologically important process in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is not clear why apoptotic cells use ATP and related nucleotides as major chemoattractants for macrophages over others, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ousman and David, 2000</xref>). Although it is difficult to say whether the primary function of PANX1 opening in apoptosis is to deplete intracellular ATP reserves or to release chemoattractant, or both, one possible scenario may be that cells first developed the function of PANX1 for depleting intracellular ATP, followed by effective utilization of the released adenine nucleotides as chemoattractants.</p><p>How does the intracellular ATP concentration change in other types of cell death, such as necrosis and pyroptosis? Because a forced decrease of intracellular ATP levels reportedly switches the cell death fate from apoptosis to necrosis, it is believed that the intracellular ATP level will decrease in the early stage of necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eguchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leist et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsujimoto, 1997</xref>). However, a precise investigation of when and how the intracellular ATP level changes in the necrotic process is still lacking, especially at single-cell resolution. In pyroptosis, gasdermin-D has been reported to form pores as large as 10 nm in diameter in the plasma membrane and to release adenine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Russo et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is not clear whether a drop in the intracellular ATP level coincides with the gasdamin-D pore formation. The techniques used in this study might be useful for uncovering the mechanism of how ATP decreases in other types of cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) and alexa647-annexin-V were purchased from Molecular Probes. Recombinant human Trail and anti-His tag antibody were purchased from R and D. Trail was dissolved in DPBS(-) supplemented with 0.1% BSA at a concentration of 20 µg/mL, and then stored at −80 °C. Anti-His antibody was dissolved in DPBS(-) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and then stored at −80 °C. 2-Deoxyglucose were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Other chemicals were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) unless otherwise noted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mammalian cell culture and gene knock out</title><p>The HeLa cell line was a kind gift from Prof. Shin Yonehara. The cell line was authenticated by short-tandem repeat profiling and was checked for mycoplasma infection. The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, 1 g/L glucose; Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich). The SW480 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were cultured in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) supplemented with 10% FBS. Apoptosis of HeLa cells was initiated either by adding anti-FAS antibody (125 ng/mL) and CHX (10 µM) or by adding staurosporine (1 µM). Apoptosis of SW480 cells was initiated by adding Trail (50 ng/mL) and anti-His tag antibody (1 µg/mL). Knockout of PANX1 gene was carried out using pre-designed PANX1-KO CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Briefly, cells were transfected with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids using PEI-Max (Polysciences Inc) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morciano et al., 2020</xref>). After 2 days, each individual cell with strong GFP fluorescence was sorted into a well in 96-well plates using a cell sorter (SH800S, Sony), and then was cultured. Knockout of PANX1 gene in each cultured line was verified by western blotting and by sequencing of the targeted region of the genomic DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The expression vector for the caspase-resistant AT1.03 (pcDNA-AT1.03CR) was constructed by introducing caspase-resistant mutations (D242N/D339G) into pcDNA-AT1.03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>) using PCR-based mutagenesis. O-DEVD-FR cDNA was constructed by fusing mKOκ and mKate2(V94S) through a Gly-Gly-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Gly-Thr linker using PCR. The amplified cDNA was cloned between XhoI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(-) (Thermo Scientific) to obtain a mammalian expression vector pcDNA-O-DEVD-FR. Human PANX1 cDNA (Riken Bioresource Center) was amplified by PCR, and was cloned between XhoI and EcoRI sites of pIRES2-Sirius, a custom made vector, in which EGFP cDNA of pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) was replaced by Sirius fluorescent protein cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tomosugi et al., 2009</xref>), to obtain a pIRES2-Sirius-hPANX1 plasmid.

For exogenous expression of PANX1, the plasmid encoding PANX1 cDNA was co-transfected with the AT1.03CR and the O-DEVD-FR plasmids. One day after transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated on a collagen-coated glass-bottom 4-compartment dish (0.16–0.19 mm thick; Greiner). Two days after transfection, cells cultured in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (HeLa) or phenol red-free Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (SW480) were subjected to imaging. For OXPHOS-dependent cell culture, phenol red- and glucose-free DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM sodium lactate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 mM sodium dichloroacetate (an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, Sigma-Aldrich) was used. Cells were visualized with a Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) using a Plan Apo 40×, 0.95 numerical aperture, dry objective lens (Nikon). Cells were maintained on a microscope at 37°C with a continuous supply of a 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide mixture by using a stage-top incubator (Tokai Hit). All filters used for fluorescence imaging were purchased from Semrock (Rochester, NY): for dual-emission ratio imaging of AT1.03CR, an FF01-438/24 excitation filter, an FF458-Di02 dichroic mirror, and two emission filters (an FF02-483/32 for CFP and an FF01-542/27 for YFP); dual-emission ratio imaging of O-DEVD-FR, an FF01-543/22 excitation filter, an FF562-Di02 dichroic mirror, and two emission filters (an FF01-585/22 for mKOκ and an FF01-660/52 for mKate2). Cells were illuminated using a 75 W xenon lamp through 25% and 12.5% neutral density filters. Fluorescence emissions from cells were imaged using a Zyla4.2 scientific CMOS camera (Andor Technologies). The microscope system was controlled by NIS-Elements software (Nikon). Image analysis was performed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). First, a background fluorescence intensity, which was measured from a region within image where no cell exist, was subtracted from an entire image. Next, the intensity of a donor fluorophore (YFP or mKate2) of a cell was divided by the intensity of an acceptor fluorophore (CFP or mKOκ) to obtain the emission ratio. The detailed method for the image analysis has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morciano et al., 2020</xref>). Because fluorescent biosensors were abruptly dissipated from the cell when the plasma membrane of the apoptotic cell was collapsed, data after fluorescence values from cells were less than half of the maximum were excluded from the analysis. Single-cell ATP traces were visualized using PlotTwist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goedhart, 2020</xref>).

that allows continuous real-time dual imaging of intracellular ATP level and caspase-3 activity in single apoptotic cultured human cells, the authors have gained detailed knowledge of the kinetics of the decline in cellular ATP relative to caspase activation. This allowed the authors to nail down that adenine nucleotide via caspase activation of pannexin-1 channels early in apoptosis not only recruits phagocytes to the apoptotic cells, but also makes a major contribution to the eventual arrest of energy-dependent functions in the dying cells.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Pannexin-1 mediates programmed intracellular ATP decrease during apoptosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: George Dubyak (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Your manuscript &quot;Pannexin-1 mediates programmed intracellular ATP decrease during apoptosis&quot; has been examined by four expert reviewers whose detailed comments are enclosed. As you can see, the reviewers were very appreciative of the means that you have established for monitoring the dynamics of changes in the cytosolic ATP concentration on a single-cell level during apoptosis. It is certainly a valuable addition to the analytical toolbox applied in the study of cell death. The reviewers were reserved, however, about the fact that too much of the paper (including its title) concerns the finding that Pannexin-1 mediates the decrease of ATP in apoptosis – a finding that has been already documented before. They also raised many questions and requests about the evidence for the new biological insights that the paper aimed to present.</p><p>Since the breath of the requests made by the reviewers is too wide to allow addressing them within the two month period allowed by <italic>eLife</italic>, I am unfortunately unable to recommend further handling of current submission. However, we do hope that you will submit the paper anew to <italic>eLife</italic> after addressing the comments of the reviewers.</p><p>A simpler and quicker alternative would be to resubmit the paper, not as Research Article, but in the Tools and Resources category (after adding more detailed description of the ATP monitoring technique). This category is appropriate for a new technique that will be generally useful to a field, and although new biological insight is not required in this category you should be able also to include your major observations in the &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; format.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Overall this is an interesting study that adds incremental insight to the original story from Chekeni et al., 2010, follow up study by Sandilos et al., 2012, and other more recent work. The use of imaging to assay ATP levels creates a potential for revealing spatial information but this potentially novel aspect is unfortunately not fully realized. Most importantly, clear interpretations of some of the key pieces of imaging data are hampered by the lack of controls, including controls demonstrating that the loss of signal is not a loss of cell area/cell collapse. Further, rather than relying primarily on the use of the blocker probenecid for a large portion of the study, the systematic use of a more complete genetic deletion model like Crispr Cas9, which should be readily feasible in the Hela model, would also make the interpretation and model more convincing. There are also some kinks in the logic/model that could be smoothened out (clarified) by more detailed explanations. In summary, there is potential here, but the manuscript seems premature.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>Abstract: I'm not sure this sentence in the Abstract makes sense (nor is it substantiated by the data) – &quot;Thus, the pannexin-1-mediated &quot;programmed intracellular ATP decrease&quot; of the apoptotic cell might benefit surrounding healthy cells by preserving environmental glucose.&quot;</p><p>Results first paragraph – Why is cell-specific information important? This isn't very well explained.</p><p>The first sentence should specify whether &quot;between cells&quot; means between cell types or between cells of a given cell type to emphasize the point being made.</p><p>Variable time interval range should be described in the text.</p><p>“It should be noted that the timing and the speed of the decreases in ATP did vary between cells, emphasizing the advantages of single-cell ATP analysis of apoptotic cells over the conventional cell population-based methods.” Great, but why is that precise information important?</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2 should include a negative control consisting of a cohort of cells treated with a control antibody to control for cell death due to imaging conditions (note that during ATP/apoptosis imaging it's not mentioned in the Materials and methods whether the cells are being maintained at 37°C and in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, however this is noted in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> level measurements section). Some minimal details of the imaging/acquisition should be provided in the main body of the text.</p><p>Figure 1: The data shown in B for a single cell could also be aggregated/averaged and shown for a larger cohort of cells by adjusting the data as in part C. Part C should be added to Figure 1—figure supplement 2 as is the same data presented with an adjusted time scale, not clear how this really adds anything to the story. The images in Part A are much too small to appreciate and spatial information.</p><p>Perhaps a more important point is that the images provided in Figure 1A suggest that cell has collapsed between minute 297 and 300, rather than lost ATP, as it appears the FRET signal and TMRE signal are both now (at minute 300) quite spatially restricted but it is not clear that the space where the signal is absent is still &quot;cell&quot;. Without a cell membrane marker like WGA (which can be used in live cells), or a DIC image (or similar) it is impossible to ascertain whether or not this is the case.</p><p>It seems that Figures 1 and 2 could be collapsed into one figure.</p><p>It seems that Figures 3 and 4 should be combined. To more convincingly show that PANX1 is the mediator of the caspase mediated ATP release, the authors should completely delete it using Crispr-Cas9 and then re-express the caspase resistant mutant (and compare with re-expressed WT). There should be at least 3 biological replicates and the traces from the individual biological replicates should be distinguishable from one another.</p><p>Figure S6: how many biological replicates here? Reporting on number of cells and number of biological replicates should be consistent throughout the figures.</p><p>Figure 5: The logic behind the interpretation of the results of Figure 5 isn't clear, please elaborate on &quot;Strikingly, extracellular AMP and ATP, but not ADP, suppressed the decrease in intracellular ATP levels of apoptotic cells (Figure 5). Thus, it is most likely that the intracellular ATP decrease of apoptotic cells is a result of a reduction in adenosine nucleotide pools inside apoptotic cells, which is caused, at least in part, by release of ATP and AMP from the cells.&quot;</p><p>Figures 6 and 7: Cytosolic free Mg<sup>2+</sup> and glucose consumption this also be assayed with Crispr-Cas9 deletion of Panx1, and the compared with wildtype and mutant caspase-defective PANX1 expression.</p><p>The conclusions drawn from Figure 7 don't make intuitive sense to me. While the cells aren't consuming the ATP they are still in effect losing ATP by releasing it, so less ATP is available for cellular processes, so they should still &quot;want to consume&quot; glucose.</p><p>Finally, given the nature of their studies the authors should take the following papers into consideration and add genetic models to strengthen their investigation of these aspects:</p><p>1) Probenecid interferes with renal oxidative metabolism: A potential pitfall in its use as an inhibitor of drug transport https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1572299/</p><p>2) Probenecid potentiates MPTP/MPP+ toxicity by interference with cellular energy metabolism. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23802648</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The major novelty of this paper is the generation of new probes to study intracellular ATP, and using this probe the authors address the involvement of Pannexin-1 in decreasing intracellular ATP (ATPi) during apoptotic cell death via FRET-based single cell imaging. Additionally, albeit in less detail, the authors begin to show that apoptotic cells can use glycolysis during the cell death process but the loss of intracellular ATP impedes this.</p><p>Overall usage of the probe to track single cells and their intracellular ATP and some of the controls are well done and the findings are backed up with experimental evidence. However, as the authors acknowledge and based this work on, it is known that ATP is released via pannexin channels during apoptosis and this occurs via caspase-mediated cleavage of the channel. What is potentially novel is the possible differential involvement of glycolysis and OXPHOS during apoptosis when Panx1 function is blocked – however, the data supporting this claim is weak and will require additional experiments to fully understand the contributions of these metabolic processes. Additionally, the authors do not begin to explore what impact this process has on the neighboring tissue, and what the larger importance of it could be. If the authors can successfully address the major concerns, especially major concern 1, 2, and 3, then this work would potentially be a strong candidate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as it adds another level to the understanding of cell death process.</p><p>1) Although the authors show intracellular ATP decreases during apoptosis, what is the importance of this process? They speculate that there will be more glucose for surrounding cells (which makes them healthier?) because the apoptotic cells cannot use it as they will have lost their ATPi. However, they never actually provide evidence for this and by mentioning it in the Abstract it is misleading. This needs to be addressed much more in detail.</p><p>2) This paper primarily addresses one form of death – anti-Fas + methotrexate treatment of HeLa cells. The authors make much larger claims on what this would mean for the larger process of apoptosis and the glycolysis vs. OXPHOS may be impactful for the tissue, etc. But these are not justified. At the minimum, the authors should use one or two other cell lines and another form of cell death.</p><p>3) Lastly, the authors provide some indirect evidence for the function of glycolysis during apoptosis. By inhibiting Panx1 channels, thereby increasing ATPi , the authors show an increase in glucose uptake. However, this does not necessarily indicate increased glycolysis. Can the authors measure lactate release to more directly show that there is increased glycolysis during Panx1 inhibition (or even better via Seahorse Assay)? Interestingly, this may indicate that glycolysis is still occurring during apoptosis even if Panx1 is active although it may be with lower levels of ATPi and therefore to a less extent. This is an important point and needs to be proven.</p><p>4) The authors attempt to rule-out the involvement of mitochondrial depolarization as a mechanism for decreased ATPi by treatment of CCCP on live cells and showing that ATPi does not decrease. However, this is not a fair comparison because this does not indicate that it cannot be occurring during apoptosis (or in dying cells). Can the authors more clearly rule out this issue? For example, can the authors induce cell death, but inhibit mitochondrial depolarization, and show that ATPi is still decreasing regardless of mitochondria membrane potential? Does this affect the dynamics of ATPi decrease?</p><p>5) The authors state that &quot;the ATP decrease in apoptotic cells is a caspase-3-dependent process&quot;, but they reach this conclusion based on timing events (correlational). Can the authors inhibit caspases with zVAD/QVD and show that ATPi levels do not decrease after anti-Fas treatment to directly prove this statement?</p><p>6) Can the authors show that a cellular ATPi levels still drop in a cell that endogenously/naturally uses OXPHOS and that this is still dependent on Panx1 activation? In this paper they use a system where glucose has been depleted and this can impact results. Also, does Panx1 inhibition still increase glycolysis in these cells? It would be interesting to know whether these cells attempt to switch their metabolism during cell death.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study describes a novel on-line optical probe to track the kinetics of intracellular ATP concentration in single HeLa cells during the induction/progression of apoptosis by Fas activation. HeLa are &quot;type II&quot; cells wherein extrinsic apoptotic (i.e., receptor-initiated) activation of the executioner caspase-3 is indirectly mediated by a caspase-8&gt; Bid &gt; mitochondrial permeabilization&gt; caspase-9 cascade. This contrasts with type I cells wherein extrinsic apoptosis involves a direct caspase-8 &gt; caspase-3 cascade. The major findings are that the decrease in intracellular ATP: 1) occurs shortly after collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and accumulation of active caspase-3; and 2) is mediated by caspase-3 mediated proteolytic activation of plasma membrane pannexin-1 channels as conduits for efflux of ATP and other adenine nucleotides. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological suppression of pannexin-1 function markedly delays the decrease in intracellular ATP even when mitochondrial function or ATP synthesis is inhibited. That proteolytically-gated pannexin-1 channels can be major determinants of intracellular and extracellular adenine nucleotide metabolism/ distribution basically confirms several previous studies with populations of apoptotic cells. However, extending such findings to the single cell level is a significant contribution. One major issue requires attention.</p><p>Major concern: In the Figure 7 experiments, the authors use 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) as a &quot;glycolysis inhibitor&quot; to conclude that ongoing ATP synthesis via glycolysis is sufficient to sustain the intracellular ATP levels of apoptotic HeLa cell for several hours when pannexin-1-mediated ATP efflux is blocked by probenecid. There's major problem with this interpretation. 2DG acts an intracellular ATP &quot;sink&quot;. Hexokinase readily phosphorylates 2DG, but 2DG-phosphate can't be further converted to fructose-6P. Thus, it's difficult to deconvolute the ATP-consuming action of 2DG from subsequent suppression of glycolytic ATP production. This needs to be addressed and alternative experimental support for the stated conclusion is required. Inhibition of glucose uptake by cytochalasins or other GLUT blockers might be an approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>Too much of this paper is dedicated to demonstration of the role of PANX1 cleavage in ATP release, and in the resulting depletion of the cellular ATP pool, which are, both, not new.

They speculate that there will be more glucose for surrounding cells (which makes them healthier?) because the apoptotic cells cannot use it as they will have lost their ATPi. However, they never actually provide evidence for this and by mentioning it in the Abstract it is misleading. This needs to be addressed much more in detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Metabolism is one of the major biological activity of living systems. The metabolic activity of cells is an indicator of &quot;the state of being alive&quot;. In other words, in order for a cell to &quot;die a complete death&quot;, metabolism must stop. However, it has not been well understood how metabolism of dead cells ceases. Our results showed that PANX1 plays a major role in stopping glycolysis, a central part of metabolism, of apoptotic cells, through facilitating ATP loss. This is the biological importance of ATP depletion in apoptosis that we want to emphasize in the revised work. We discuss this statement in the revised manuscript. We agree that the model that PANX1 stops the waste of glucose by apoptotic cells to benefit surrounding cells is a discussion/speculation. We have deleted this point from Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This paper primarily addresses one form of death – anti-Fas + methotrexate treatment of HeLa cells. The authors make much larger claims on what this would mean for the larger process of apoptosis and the glycolysis vs. OXPHOS may be impactful for the tissue, etc. But these are not justified. At the minimum, the authors should use one or two other cell lines and another form of cell death.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we analyzed staurospoine-induced apoptosis (Figure 2E-F, 4DE), as well as anti-FAS + cycloheximide-induced apoptosis for HeLa cells. In addition,</p><p>TRAIL-induced apoptosis was analyzed for SW480 cells (Figure 2—figure supplement</p><p>1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Lastly, the authors provide some indirect evidence for the function of glycolysis during apoptosis. By inhibiting Panx1 channels, thereby increasing ATPi , the authors show an increase in glucose uptake. However, this does not necessarily indicate increased glycolysis. Can the authors measure lactate release to more directly show that there is increased glycolysis during Panx1 inhibition (or even better via Seahorse Assay)? Interestingly, this may indicate that glycolysis is still occurring during apoptosis even if Panx1 is active although it may be with lower levels of ATPi and therefore to a less extent. This is an important point and needs to be proven.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Lactate release was also measured in the revised manuscript. Consistent with glucose consumption data, lactate release did not cease in PANX1-KO cells. To further support that existence of glycolytic activity, we showed that lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor sodium oxamate also reduces intracellular ATP, like hexokinase inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose does. Please note that we did not show that glycolysis is increased, just showed that glycolysis is retained at substantial levels in apoptotic cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors attempt to rule-out the involvement of mitochondrial depolarization as a mechanism for decreased ATPi by treatment of CCCP on live cells and showing that ATPi does not decrease. However, this is not a fair comparison because this does not indicate that it cannot be occurring during apoptosis (or in dying cells). Can the authors more clearly rule out this issue? For example, can the authors induce cell death, but inhibit mitochondrial depolarization, and show that ATPi is still decreasing regardless of mitochondria membrane potential? Does this affect the dynamics of ATPi decrease?</p></disp-quote><p>We have no idea to perform the suggested experiment. The relevant text and data have been removed in the revised version for clarity. We do not think that the removal of this result affects the major conclusion of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors state that &quot;the ATP decrease in apoptotic cells is a caspase-3-dependent process&quot;, but they reach this conclusion based on timing events (correlational). Can the authors inhibit caspases with zVAD/QVD and show that ATPi levels do not decrease after anti-Fas treatment to directly prove this statement?</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed that treatment with zVAD inhibit ATPi decrease after anti-FAS stimulation (Figure 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Can the authors show that a cellular ATPi levels still drop in a cell that endogenously/naturally uses OXPHOS and that this is still dependent on Panx1 activation? In this paper they use a system where glucose has been depleted and this can impact results. Also, does Panx1 inhibition still increase glycolysis in these cells? It would be interesting to know whether these cells attempt to switch their metabolism during cell death.</p></disp-quote><p>As far as we know, cultured mammalian cells that are generally used for apoptosis research predominantly use glycolysis for ATP synthesis rather than OXPHOS. Therefore, it is difficult to conduct experiments to solve this question at present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Major concern: In the Figure 7 experiments, the authors use 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) as a &quot;glycolysis inhibitor&quot; to conclude that ongoing ATP synthesis via glycolysis is sufficient to sustain the intracellular ATP levels of apoptotic HeLa cell for several hours when pannexin-1-mediated ATP efflux is blocked by probenecid.

The cause of this discrepancy is unknown at present. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have performed the same experiments again using PANX1 knockout cells and using different types of apoptotic stimulations.

It is also known that dATP/ATP is also important for the formation of apoptosomes (Li et al., 1997; Hu et al., 1997). Our results demonstrated that cytosolic ATP is retained at high level until caspase-3 is activated. Thus, it is very likely that maintenance of high ATP is required until the activation of caspases. We added the above points into the revised manuscript (Discussion paragraph one). We found that PANX1-KO did not affect phosphatidylserine exposure, indicating that ATP loss is not critical to this process (Figure 6B). Apoptotic PANX1-KO cells did not immediately die a complete death because they did not completely stop glycolytic metabolism (Figure 7B). Also, apoptotic PANX1-KO cells continued to waste environmental glucose for more than 32 hours, which potentially causes starvation of the surrounding cells (Figure 7F-G and Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Does the observed increase in glucose consumption indeed reflect enhanced glycolysis (just monitoring glucose levels does not suffice to tell that), and is this increase also occurring in other cell types, including ones that normally resort to oxidative phosphorylation, and in cells dying in response to other triggers?</p></disp-quote><p>Glycolytic activity of apoptotic cell is <italic>not</italic> enhanced, as evident from Figure 6E-G: Although apoptotic PANX1-KO cells retain glycolytic activity, the glucose consumption rate and the lactate release rate are slower than the wild-type cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Which of the various manifestations of apoptosis depend on the decrease of ATP.
