A well-studied type of QS common to a number of Proteobacteria species is mediated by acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals. AHLs are made by members of the LuxI family of signal synthases. The AHLs can diffuse in and out of cells. At sufficient cell densities, the AHLs accumulate to concentrations needed for expression of specific genes by binding signal receptors of the LuxR family of transcriptional regulators (for reviews of QS see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuqua et al., 1996</xref>)). In some bacterial species, QS controls just a few genes and in others it controls hundreds of genes. Genes for production of secreted or excreted products are overrepresented in AHL quorum sensing regulons. These extracellular products have at least in some cases been shown to serve as public goods. Any member of a group can benefit from the public good regardless of whether that individual has contributed its share of the good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">West et al., 2006</xref>). There is a metabolic cost associated with QS and QS-activation of gene expression. QS control of public goods has been studied in some detail in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Because QS activates production of extracellular proteases, QS signal receptor mutants have a fitness advantage over the wild type when growth is on milk protein as the sole carbon and energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diggle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sandoz et al., 2007</xref>). The receptor mutant fitness advantage presents a conundrum; how is QS-mediated cooperation preserved?</p><p>QS itself can be considered a cooperative trait, the QS signal is a public good, and QS is susceptible to exploitation by QS mutant social cheats. In <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> three mechanisms of QS cheater restraint have been demonstrated. The first is a direct benefit-based strategy called metabolic constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schuster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dandekar et al., 2012</xref>); Quorum sensing activates genes coding for public goods (such as extracellular proteases), as well as a limited set of privately utilized goods (such as a hydrolase that allows producing cells to utilize adenosine). When cells are supplied with both casein and adenosine, QS signal receptor (LasR) mutant cheats are penalized and constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dandekar et al., 2012</xref>). A second mechanism has been called metabolic prudence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xavier et al., 2011</xref>) where the QS-controlled public good is only made when it’s production is not costly. Metabolic prudence minimizes the cost of cooperation. Recently, a mechanism whereby <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cooperators punish or police cheats has been described. QS competent cooperators produce cyanide and are more resistant to cyanide than QS mutant cheats, and thus the cooperators can constrain cheats by slowing their growth with cyanide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> policing is a rare example of this sort of activity in bacteria, and because cyanide production and resistance has some semblance to a toxin-immunity-like mechanism we hypothesis that QS activation of toxin-immunity systems might have some generality as a policing mechanism where QS bacteria can control QS mutants.</p><p>We recently used RNAseq to identify genes in the <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> QS regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Majerczyk et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> has three AHL QS systems, BtaR1-I1, BtaR2-I2 and BtaR3-I3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ulrich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chandler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duerkop et al., 2009</xref>). Together, the QS systems control hundreds of genes. The BtaR1-I1 regulon appears to be the largest as BtaR1 regulates &gt;150 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Majerczyk et al., 2014</xref>). We queried the transcriptomics data and discovered that expression of several genes shown to encode Type VI secretion system (T6SS) substrates, including characterized toxins and their cognate immunity or antitoxin genes, are activated by QS. Expression of a toxin and its antitoxin results in a toxin-resistant producer cell, which can deliver toxins via the secretion apparatus via cell-cell contact to a sensitive cell thereby inhibiting growth of the sensitive cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Russell et al., 2014</xref>). We show that T6S provides wild-type <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> with an ability to constrain BtaR1 mutants in a contact-dependent manner. This supports the hypothesis that QS activation of toxin-immunity systems can serve as a policing mechanism to control QS mutants growing among QS competent wild-type cells. Our findings also reveal yet another role for T6S in bacteria. T6S has been shown to provide a competitive interspecies or interstrain advantage, and some T6Ss have been shown to play a role in bacterial virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2014</xref>). Here we describe intraspecific control of QS mutants. This provides a rationale for why T6S toxin and immunity genes might be under QS control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The BtaR1 mutant has a growth advantage over the wild type in LB broth cocultures</title><p>To assess the fitness of the <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> QS mutants in competition with their parent, we cocultured the wild type with signal blind QS mutants.

We attribute the slight influence on growth of the parent to the cost of BtaR1-mediated QS and QS-dependent gene expression.

Cell contact is minimal during growth in broth but does occur when cells are grown on a solid agar surface. This led us to ask if QS controls contact-dependent growth inhibition systems. We previously reported that QS-1 activated the contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) system encoded by the <italic>cdiAIB</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Majerczyk et al., 2014</xref>). However, CDI does not limit the outgrowth of the BtaR1<sup>-</sup> mutant during agar-grown cocultures. We next asked whether QS regulates other contact-dependent growth inhibitory factors. <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> contains five different T6SSs, at least one of which is used for interspecies competition (T6SS-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>). The T6SS-1 comprises a pathway that delivers effector proteins to neighboring cells upon direct cell contact. Some T6SS-1 effectors have been characterized and are toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Russell et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> is immune to the toxins because it produces cognate immunity proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Russell et al., 2014</xref>).

Although genes for the T6SS-1 apparatus are not QS-controlled, we observed that QS activates nine genes for T6SS-1 substrates, as well as an additional eight that are either adjacent to a substrate gene, fall within the same gene cluster, or include a putative T6SS-1 immunity gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14712.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Map of QS-controlled genes for T6SS-1 substrates and solid-surface competition experiments with T6SS-1 mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genes coding for known or putative T6SS-1 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Russell et al., 2012</xref>) are shaded grey and genes controlled by QS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Majerczyk et al., 2014</xref>) are outlined in red.

We also found that the BtaR1<sup>-</sup> mutant was impaired in inhibition of the effector and immunity mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The BtaR2<sup>-</sup> and BtaR3<sup>-</sup> mutants each showed wild-type levels of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We propose that the T6SS-1-mediated killing defect in the BtaR1<sup>-</sup> mutant results from its inability to fully activate expression of one or more T6S toxin genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The ability of wild-type <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> to compete with a BtaR1<sup>-</sup>mutant during agar growth depends on T6S</title><p>We hypothesized that the QS-activated T6SS-1 effector and immunity proteins in wild-type bacteria restrict the proliferation of BtaR1<sup>-</sup> mutants upon cell contact in cocultures.

During planktonic growth in broth where T6SS-1 does not function due to limited cell contact, BtaR1<sup>-</sup> mutants have a substantial fitness advantage over wild-type cells, presumably because of the cost associated with BtaR1-dependent activities. Policing of social deviants in <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Manhes and Velicer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sandoz et al., 2007</xref>). Here we describe a novel mechanism, for limiting quorum sensing mutant growth in bacterial groups.</p><p>Several functions have been ascribed to T6S. <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> T6S-mediated killing is active against Proteobacteria species other than <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> and is thought to be important for interspecies competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>). T6Ss occur in many species of Proteobacteria where they can provide an advantage over competing species (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Russell et al., 2014</xref> for review). We note that in other organisms including, <italic>Pectobacterium atrosepticum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lesic et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khajanchi et al., 2009),</xref> <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stauff and Bassler, 2011</xref>), <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), QS regulates genes for the T6S apparatus (not the effector and immunity factors as we describe for <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>). We suspect QS regulation of the T6S apparatus might play a role in policing QS mutants during polymicrobial competitions or in other scenarios where T6S might benefit the producing cell. Furthermore, we note that other types of toxin-antitoxin systems have been reported to be under control of other non-AHL-mediated quorum sensing systems, for example the <italic>E. coli mazEF</italic> encoded toxin-antitoxin genes are controlled by a linear pentapeptide quorum sensing signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Under the conditions of our experiments the BtaR1-BtaI1 QS system carries with it a metabolic cost, which is evident in broth culture competition experiments and to a lesser extent in pure broth culture grow curves. The BtaR2-BtaI2 and BtaR3-BtaI3 QS systems do not appear to carry this large cost. We describe a mechanism by which wild-type populations can mitigate the cost of BtaR1-BtaI1 gene regulation by hindering the growth of QS mutants via regulation of cell-contact-dependent toxin and immunity proteins. This is a form of microbial policing; QS-proficient bacteria are outcompeted in populations of signal blind non-cooperators in the absence of the T6S cell-contact growth inhibition system. It is interesting that BtaR1 also promotes aggregation of cells under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chandler et al., 2009</xref>). One can imagine that this system brings cells into close proximity where they can resist infiltration by other strains and species while at the same time protect themselves against social deviant BtaR1 mutant bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14712.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A policing model where QS control of T6S contact-dependent killing (effector and immunity proteins) enforces cooperation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The bacterium on the left depicts a situation where QS co-regulates a public good with the T6SS-1 effector and immunity factors.

The data demonstrate “T6S plays a role in Bt “policing” of QS-defective mutants, but it remains unknown which QS-controlled T6 effector and immunity factors are responsible for this policing activity.” Based on our current understanding of T6S and delivery of toxins to other bacteria we assume there are several secreted effectors involved in policing. This is the complication that led us away from the suggested experiments.</p><p>Our previously reported RNAseq data showed that QS controls a total of nine different proteins secreted by the T6S system, as well as an additional eight that may be associated with the activity of these secreted factors or their immunity. Of these 17 QS-controlled factors, only the activities of <italic>tle1</italic>and <italic>tli1</italic> have been characterized. For the others that are uncharacterized, we do not know which are truly toxins and which have cognate immunity factors.</p><p>The reviewers suggested an experiment to ectopically and constitutively express the <italic>tle1</italic> and <italic>tli1</italic> effector and immunity pair in the QS mutant and perform competition experiments with the wildtype. We decided against this approach because there are so many other (uncharacterized) toxin/immunity factors in the TSS-1 system. We would need to ectopically and constitutively express all QS-controlled T6S immunity factors and in doing so we would compromise the experiment by putting a heavy burden on the expressing strain. At the very least this sort of experiment would be technically challenging and require an enormous effort.</p><p><italic>2) The figures are not optimal and need the following revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>: Keys to each of the different strains or types of information should be provided in the Figure (especially if not all lines are defined in the figure legend as is the case for 1C).</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> have been modified to include keys.

We believe the CFU/mL data are important as they show the phase of bacterial growth. This is relevant as QS-controlled processes are regulated in a cell density-dependent manner and most are induced as cells enter post-exponential phase. We agree that it is perhaps a point for the expert, but one an expert would find problematic if missing.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>: This figure is so compressed that little useful information is presented.
