phenomenon referred to as <italic>neural tracking</italic>. In recent years, a large body of work has demonstrated the tracking of the acoustic envelope and abstract linguistic units at the phoneme and word levels, and beyond. However, the degree to which speech tracking is driven by acoustic edges of the signal, or by internally-generated linguistic units, or by the interplay of both, remains contentious. In this study, we used naturalistic story-listening to investigate (1) whether phoneme-level features are tracked over and above acoustic edges, (2) whether word entropy, which can reflect sentence- and discourse-level constraints, impacted the encoding of acoustic and phoneme-level features, and (3) whether the tracking of acoustic edges was enhanced or suppressed during comprehension of a first language (Dutch) compared to a statistically familiar but uncomprehended language (French). We first show that encoding models with phoneme-level linguistic features, in addition to acoustic features, uncovered an increased neural tracking response; this signal was further amplified in a comprehended language, putatively reflecting the transformation of acoustic features into internally generated phoneme-level representations. Phonemes were tracked more strongly in a comprehended language, suggesting that language comprehension functions as a neural filter over acoustic edges of the speech signal as it transforms sensory signals into abstract linguistic units. We then show that word entropy enhances neural tracking of both acoustic and phonemic features when sentence- and discourse-context are less constraining. When language was not comprehended, acoustic features, but not phonemic ones, were more strongly modulated, but in contrast, when a native language is comprehended, phoneme features are more strongly modulated. Taken together, our findings highlight the flexible modulation of acoustic, and phonemic features by sentence and discourse-level constraint in language comprehension, and document the neural transformation from speech perception to language comprehension, consistent with an account of language processing as a neural filter from sensory to abstract representations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural tracking</kwd><kwd>linguistic representations</kwd><kwd>acoustic edge</kwd><kwd>speech</kwd><kwd>language</kwd><kwd>MEG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lise Meitner Research Group &quot;Language and Computation in Neural Systems&quot;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Andrea E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Independent Research Group &quot;Language and Computation in Neural Systems&quot;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Andrea E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>016.Vidi.188.029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Andrea E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In order to achieve this, we likely capitalize on stored, previously-learned linguistic representations and other forms of knowledge. During this process, systematic changes shown by the acoustic signal are categorized by the brain as phonemes, while the similar ordering of consecutive phonemes creates words and, a certain ordering of words creates phrases and sentences. As these transformation occur, the phase of the neural signal is thought to align with temporal landmarks in both acoustic and linguistic dimensions; this phenomenon is referred to as neural tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daube et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luo and Poeppel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Liberto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodbeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broderick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daube et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keitel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donhauser and Baillet, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufeld et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weissbart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodbeck et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heilbron et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coopmans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Slaats et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ten Oever et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zioga et al., 2023</xref>). Neural tracking has been proposed as a mechanism to segment the acoustic input into linguistic units such as phoneme, syllables, morphemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghitza, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>) by aligning the neural excitability cycles to the incoming input. One way to quantify the degree of neural tracking of speech features is using a linear encoding modelling also known as Temporal Response Functions (TRF). Adding sub-lexical, lexical, and phrase- and sentence-level predictors, either quantified with information theoretic metrics (e.g. surprisal and entropy), or syntactic annotations, to the encoding model improves the reconstruction accuracy of neural responses on distinct sources in the brain (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodbeck et al., 2022</xref>), and surprisal and entropy predictors have been shown to modulate the neural response at different time intervals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donhauser and Baillet, 2020</xref>). However, whether acoustic features and higher level linguistic units are encoded with similar veracity during comprehension, and how they impact each other’s encoding is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of language comprehension in a first language (Dutch) on the tracking of acoustic and phonemic features, contrasted with a statistically familiar but uncomprehended language (French), during naturalistic story listening. Contrasting a comprehended language with a language that is familiar, but not understood, allows us to separate neural signals related to speech processing vs. those related to speech processing in the service of language comprehension. We asked three questions: (1) whether phoneme-level features contribute to neural encoding even when acoustic contributions are carefully controlled, as a function of language comprehension, (2) whether sentence- and discourse-level constraints on lexical information operationalized as word entropy impacted the encoding of acoustic and phoneme-level features, and (3) whether tracking of acoustic landmarks (viz., acoustic edges) was enhanced or suppressed as a function of comprehension. We found that acoustic features are enhanced when the spoken language stimulus is not understood, but that phonemic features are more strongly encoded when language is understood, consistent with an account where gain modulation, in the form of enhancement or suppression, expresses the behavioral goal of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin, 2020</xref>). We found that both phonemic and acoustic features are more strongly encoded when the context is less constraining, as exemplified by word entropy. Finally, and in contrast with extant arguments in the literature about the pre-activation or enhancement of low-level representations with the contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeLong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rumelhart and McClelland, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nieuwland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nieuwland, 2019</xref> ), we found that acoustic-edge processing appears to be suppressed when language comprehension occurs, compared to when it does not, and both acoustic and phonemic features are suppressed when entropy is low within a comprehended language (viz., the context is more constraining and a word is more expected). This pattern of results is consistent with acoustic edges being important for auditory and speech processing, but speaks against their functioning as computational landmarks during language comprehension, the behavioral and neural goal of speech processing.</p><p>During comprehension, contextual information from higher level linguistic units such as words, phrases, and sentences likely affects the neural representation and processing of lower level units like phonemes and acoustic features. A wealth of behavioral and neural data from both spoken and visual language comprehension contexts has been leveraged to illustrate the incremental processing of incoming perceptual input within existing sentence and discourse context. During spoken language comprehension, acoustic, phonemic, phonological, and prosodic information is dynamically integrated with morphemic, lexical, semantic, and syntactic information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaufeld et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaufeld et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marslen-Wilson and Welsh, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friederici, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagoort, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oganian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin, 2020</xref>). Models with top-down and bottom-up information flow have been invoked to account for how sensory information could be integrated with internally-generated knowledge or information, expressed in many forms in different models, as statistical priors, distributional knowledge, or as abstract structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rumelhart and McClelland, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Mumford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin and Doumas, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ten Oever and Martin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ten Oever et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ten Oever et al., 2022b</xref>). In word recognition, models such as the Interactive Activation Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981</xref>) and TRACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rumelhart and McClelland, 1982</xref>), feedback connections from word-level to phoneme-level enable a faster activation of phonemes in words than phonemes in nonwords by either enhancing the representation of expected phonemes or suppressing the competing phonemes. Even though these models can account for phenomena such as the word-superiority effect, faster detection of a letter on a masked visual image when presented in a word than in an unpronounceable nonword or in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reicher, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wheeler, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mewhort, 1967</xref>), they do not incorporate effects of sentence- and discourse- level constraints. It has also been demonstrated that mispronounced or ambiguous phonemes are more likely to be missed by participants during a detection task when the context is more constraining, indicating that top-down processing constraints interact with bottom-up sensory information to reduce the number of possible word candidates as the acoustic input unfolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marslen-Wilson and Welsh, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin and Doumas, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Even though the effects of sentence-level and word-level context on sub-lexical representations were widely studied with behavioral experiments, studies that investigated the neural readout of the perceptual modulation by the context are still very limited for non-degraded or naturally produced spoken stimuli. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin, 2020</xref> suggested that cues from each hierarchical level are weighted according to their reliabilities and integrated simultaneously by gain modulation in the form of selective amplification and inhibition. When the acoustic edges of the speech signal reach a threshold for the activation of a particular phoneme representation, the sensory representations of the acoustic edges are inhibited. On a slower timescale, the resulting representations of phonemes activate items in the lexicon which then, in turn, suppress the phonemic representations once lexical access is achieved. Intelligibility of the speech signal determines the reliability of the acoustic signal, and sentence- and discourse-level constraint determines the reliability of lexical access and structure formation. According to this theoretical model, when context is less constraining, sub-lexical representations are less inhibited compared to in a highly constraining context.</p><p>Linear encoding models have made it possible to investigate how certain features of phonemes and words affect the neural response during naturalistic language comprehension. However, one of the important challenges in this modeling method is the difficulty of understanding whether the features tracked by the brain are only acoustic changes or changes in linguistic units as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daube et al., 2019</xref>). For example, the beginning of a word may coincide with the beginning of a phoneme, that is also a sudden change in the envelope of the acoustic signal. It has also been argued that neural tracking reflects the convolution of evoked responses to the change in acoustic envelope referred to as acoustic edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oganian et al., 2023</xref>). To overcome this, features that can cause changes in brain signal should be modeled together as multivariate and to isolate the effect of each feature, features should be added to the models in an incremental way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodbeck et al., 2021</xref>). Most of the studies using the linear encoding models showed the tracking of either the envelope of the acoustic signal or linguistic units at both word and phoneme levels however only a few of them controlled the acoustic features. In this study, we added each phoneme feature on top of the acoustic base model incrementally and compared the reconstruction accuracies only explained by that feature.</p><p>Another limitation of linear encoding method is that only the linear relationship between the changes in the features and the amplitude of the brain signal can be observed. While modeling the linear relationship of the conditional probability of phonemes in words with the brain signal, the effect of phoneme features on the brain signal is assumed to be temporally and topologically constant. However, previous studies have shown that the intensity of the sound stimulus, and the constraints introduced on the words by the context of the sentence has an effect on the latency of the brain signal. Although it is not possible to continuously model this dynamic relationship with linear models, stimulus features can be separated according to certain properties and modeled separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drennan and Lalor, 2019</xref>). Thus, it is possible to model how sentence and discourse context affects the tracking over lower-level features by separating the predictors into high and low constraining context conditions, denoted by differences in word entropy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows predictors are separated into low and high word entropy conditions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of TRF models and features used in models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) All speech features are divided into high and low word entropy conditions (<bold>B</bold>) TRFs for each brain source are generated by the linear regression model that estimates the source localized MEG signal from speech features, then they are averaged over sources.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82386-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To this end, we made use of an MEG dataset of native Dutch speakers with no or minimal comprehension of French (i.e. self-report of no comprehension,&lt;1 year education in French, chance performance on comprehension questions) that was recorded while they listened to audiobooks in Dutch and French. We then used the linear encoding modeling method to predict the MEG signal from the acoustic and phoneme-level speech features including the spectrogram, acoustic edges, phoneme onset, phoneme surprisal and phoneme entropy, separately, for words with high and low word entropy. Word entropy was used to quantify the sentence- and discourse-level constraint for each word given the preceding 30 words. Phoneme surprisal quantifies the conditional probability of each phoneme in a word calculated according to the probability distribution over the lexicon weighted by the occurrence frequency of each word. Phoneme entropy reflects how constraining each phoneme is by quantifying the uncertainty about the next phoneme with each unfolding phoneme. If sentence comprehension modulates phoneme-level processing then the reconstruction accuracies should differ in two important contrasts. First, there should be an effect of comprehended language on whether words with high and low entropy affect phoneme processing, and within the comprehended language, high and low entropy words should differently affect phoneme features. For example, when participants are listening to an audiobook in a language they can understand, they can encounter a word like ‘interval’ or ‘internet’ in a high or low constraining sentence. The occurrence frequency of the word ‘internet’ is higher than ‘interval’ and the conditional probability of hearing the phoneme ‘n’ after ‘ɪnˈtɜː(r)’ is also higher than phoneme ‘v’. That means the surprisal of phoneme ‘n’ which is calculated by the negative log probability, is lower. Representations for phonemes might be different when the reliabilities of contextual cues are different. In a sentence such as ‘You can find anything on the internet’ phoneme features might be more important and more informative compared to a sentence like ‘On campus, you can connect to wireless internet’ because in the first sentence it is more difficult to predict which word is coming given the previous words before the word ‘internet’ in the sentence, so participants may rely more on the phoneme-level features.</p><p>Our aim in this current study was to investigate the following questions: (1) Can we measure neural tracking of phoneme- and word-level features when acoustic features are properly controlled? (2) Can we demonstrate that products of language comprehension (viz., words in a sentence and story context) modulate the encoding of lower-level linguistic cues (acoustic and phoneme level features) under normal listening conditions? And (3) does the encoding of acoustic information change as a function of comprehension, reflecting perceptual modulation of neural encoding in the service of behavioral goals? In order to address these questions, we chose to compare the neural response between a comprehended first language (Dutch) and an uncomprehended but acoustically familiar one (French). Having a high-familiarity, statistically known control language allows us to model the neural response to acoustic and phoneme-level features and contrast it to a case where there is comprehension versus where there is not. This is stronger control than examining the neural response to an unknown, statistically unfamiliar language, whose modulation of the neural response may mask the degree to which acoustic and phoneme-level processing dominate the neural signal during language comprehension.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral results</title><p>To evaluate if the stories were comprehended by participants, we compared the percentage of correct answers to comprehension questions after each story part.

To assess the individual contribution of each feature toward reconstruction accuracy, we conducted a stepwise analysis by fitting various TRF models. We added each feature sequentially to an acoustic base model, and then calculated the difference in accuracy between the model with the feature of interest and the previous model without that feature. Detailed information can be found in Table 11 in the Materials and methods section. We then fitted a linear mixed model for reconstruction accuracies with random intercept for subjects and a random slope for fixed effects. Independent variables were language (Dutch and French) and models (Acoustic, Phoneme Onsets, Phoneme Surprisal, Phoneme Entropy and, Word Frequency). Linear mixed model (LMM) with a random slope both for models and language did not converge as the reconstruction accuracies were highly correlated, so we only fitted a random slope for language. We used backward difference coding for the model contrasts, so each contrast shows the difference between consecutive models (e.g. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, Phoneme Onset row shows the contrast between the accuracies of Phoneme Onset model and Acoustic model.) To evaluate weather adding language and models and their interaction as fixed effect increased predictive accuracy, we compared LMMs with and without these effects using R’s anova() function.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>LMM results of reconstruction accuracies for Dutch and French stories.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">Estimate</th><th align="left" valign="top">Std.

TRFs including all features were estimated for each condition and language on each hemisphere. We compared the reconstruction accuracies of high and low entropy words by subtracting the reconstruction accuracy of the model which has all features except phoneme features from the full model which includes all features. Similarly, to isolate the effect of contextual constraint on acoustic edges, we compared the averaged reconstruction accuracies by subtracting the reconstruction accuracies of the model which has all features except acoustic edges from the full model which includes all features. To compare the reconstruction accuracies averaged over all brain sources in each hemisphere, we fitted a linear mixed model with random intercept for subjects and a random slope for word entropy, language and hemisphere. The LMM with a random slope for all effects did not converge, so we fitted a random slope for language, hemisphere. As we were interested in the interaction between language and word entropy, we evaluated whether adding language and word entropy interaction increased predictive accuracy. Model comparison between a model with and without interaction was done with ANOVA.

We used linear encoding models to quantify the degree of neural tracking while native Dutch speakers listened to audiobooks in Dutch and French. Participants were familiar with the prosodic and phonotactic statistical regularities of the French language, but did not comprehend the stories, allowing for the contrast of speech processing during and in the absence of comprehension in a statistically familiar auditory and perceptual context. First, we examined whether phoneme features are tracked by the brain signal even when acoustic features are controlled. Results showed that all phoneme features (i.e. phoneme onset, phoneme surprisal, phoneme entropy) and word frequency increased the averaged reconstruction accuracy for both Dutch and French stories when acoustic features were controlled, extending the findings of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodbeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodbeck et al., 2022</xref>). An interaction between language and encoding model showed that reconstruction accuracy improvement from the addition of phoneme-level features and word frequency was greater in Dutch stories, suggesting that when language is comprehended, internally-generated linguistic units, e.g., phonemes, are tracked over and above acoustic edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyer et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings contradict the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daube et al., 2019</xref>, who used articulatory features and phoneme onsets as phonetic features and showed that phoneme-locked responses can be explained by the encoding of acoustic features. It is possible that information theoretic metrics, such as surprisal and entropy, are better suited to capture the transformation of acoustic features into abstract linguistic units.</p><p>Comparison of the reconstruction accuracies on the source level showed that, for Dutch stories, accuracy improvement by the linguistic features were left lateralized. However, for uncomprehended French stories, we couldn’t find a significant lateralization effect. The Dutch-speaking participants we selected were familiar with the acoustics and phonotactics of French, and thus with the statistical distribution of those features, even though they cannot comprehend the language (as evidenced by their chance-level behavioral performance, educational background, and self-report). This comparison of neural signals in acoustically-familiar contexts set the bar higher for detecting neural sensitivity to phoneme-level features in a comprehended language, over and above any general statistical sensitivity the brain might show during perception and perceptual adaptation. The slight increase in reconstruction accuracy on the phoneme-level in French is likely due to the participants’ general familiarity with the phonotactic properties of the language, though, given the duration of the experiment, participants also could have learned the phonotactic distribution of the stories, as well as become sensitive to high-frequency words that they may recognize, but which do not lead to sentence and discourse comprehension (e.g. the most frequent words in the stories were <italic>le, la, un, une, les, des</italic> – all forms of the definite and indefinite determiner <italic>the/a</italic>); statistical regularities can be acquired very quickly even by naive listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saffran et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>We performed a word-level analysis to examine the second question: do higher level linguistic constraints, as formed during comprehension, interact with the neural encoding lower-level information (acoustic and phonemic features) under normal listening conditions? We operationalized constraint as word entropy, or the uncertainty around word predictability given the previous 30 words. When the word entropy is high, the next word is less reliably predictable given the previous words, so the context is less constraining. However, word frequency and predictability are known to be highly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen Priva and Jaeger, 2018</xref>; in our study, the correlation between entropy and word frequency was French stories: <italic>R</italic>=0.336, p&lt;0.00001; Dutch stories: <italic>R</italic>=0.343, p&lt;0.00001). To control for the responses correlated with word frequency, we also added word frequencies in our full model and compared the reconstruction accuracy improvement explained by acoustic and phoneme features. When we compared the reconstruction accuracies for low and high entropy words, we found that tracking performance of phoneme and acoustic features in high entropy words was higher in Dutch stories. This suggests that sentence and discourse constraint, as expressed in word entropy, modulates the encoding of sub-lexical representations, consistent with top-down models of language comprehension. Results showed that when context was more reliable (i.e. on low entropy words) the neural contribution of acoustic and phoneme-level features is downregulated, inhibited, or not enhanced. When sentence- and discourse-level context constrains lexical representations, sub-lexical representations are inhibited by gain modulation as they are no longer as important for thresholding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We also found an interaction between language comprehension and word entropy in the opposite direction for acoustic edges and phoneme features: the effect of sentence and discourse-level context was larger on phoneme features for a comprehended language, and it was larger on acoustic features for the uncomprehended language. In the uncomprehended language, low entropy words were also the most frequent words presented, such as <italic>le, la, un, une</italic>. Modulation of acoustic edges by context in this situation could be related to statistical 'chunking' of the acoustic signal for frequent words, essentially reflecting recognition of those single function words in the absence of language comprehension. In contrast, when a language is understood, contextual information strongly modulates the tracking of phoneme features. Yet, when the next word is predicted from the context, phoneme features are not as informative as when the context is less containing, and they are downregulated or suppressed such that their encoding does not contribute as much to the composition of the neural signal.</p><p>To investigate how language comprehension and word entropy modulated acoustic and phoneme-level linguistic features as they unfolded in time, we analyzed the weights of the TRFs. The amplitude of the power of weights were greater for phoneme-level features in Dutch stories than in French stories, however it was lower for acoustic edges. This suggests that when the language is not comprehended, acoustic features may be more dominant in the neural response, as linguistic features simply are not available. This pattern of results suggest that language comprehension might suppress neural tracking of acoustic edges, or it suppresses the neural representation of edges. If this is so, then language comprehension can be seen as a neural filter over sensory and perceptual input in service of the transformation of that input into linguistic structures. A similar effect was also shown for increasing speech rate; tracking performance of linguistic features decreased and tracking performance of acoustic features increased with decreasing intelligibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verschueren et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We also found that phoneme features generated a peak at around 80ms and between 200 and 600ms in the comprehended language, whereas in an uncomprehended language, they only peaked at around 80ms. This dual-peak pattern could be attributable to the internal generation of morphemic units or to lexical access in the comprehended language. Similar to the results we found in reconstruction accuracies, comparison of low and high entropy word TRFs showed that when the word entropy was higher (viz., in a low-constraining sentence and discourse context), the weights of acoustic edges and phoneme-level features were higher. This result suggests that when the higher level cues are not available or reliable, lower-level cues at the phoneme- and acoustic-level may be upregulated or enhanced, or allowed to propagate in order to comprise more of the neural bandwidth. While our results are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molinaro et al., 2021</xref>. – we provide support for a cost minimization perspective rather than the perception facilitation perspective discussed in Molinaro et al. – it is important to note that Molinaro et al. only examined the tracking of acoustic features, specifically the speech envelope, using the Phase Locking Value, and did not examine the contribution of lower-level linguistic features. Secondly, Molinaro et al. use a condition-based experimental design in contrast to our naturalistic stimulus approach. In our study, our aim was to investigate the dynamics of encoding both acoustic and linguistic features, and we utilized a multivariate linear regression method on low and high constraining words which ‘naturally’ occurred in our audiobook stimulus across languages. Our results revealed a trade-off between the encoding of acoustic and linguistic features that was dependent on the level of comprehension. Specifically, in the comprehended language, the predictability of the following word had a greater influence on the tracking of phoneme features as opposed to acoustic features, while in the uncomprehended language, this trend was reversed. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donhauser and Baillet, 2020</xref> showed that when sentence context is not reliable, phonemic features (i.e. phoneme surprisal and entropy) are enhanced. Here we examined the effects word entropy on acoustic and phonemic representations in comprehended and uncomprehended languages; we found that comprehension modulates acoustic edges for a shorter period of time than phoneme features when language is comprehended. The interaction between language comprehension and word entropy for acoustic edge encoding was located around auditory cortex in both hemispheres, whereas for phoneme features, it was located in left frontal cortex and right temporal cortex. The presence of a later interaction for phoneme onsets compared to acoustic edges could be due to the sustained representations of phonemes until lexical ambiguity is resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gwilliams et al., 2020</xref>) – when the sentence context is not very informative, phonemic representations transformed from acoustic features may persist or play a larger role in the neural response until the word is recognized or until a structure is built.</p><p>In this study, to disassociate the effects of word entropy and word frequency, we modeled word frequency with an assumption that entropy and frequency have linearly additive effects; however, previous studies have shown that they interact during late stages of word processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fruchter and Marantz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huizeling et al., 2022</xref>). In a naturalistic listening paradigm, even though it is an instrumental way to study language comprehension, it is not fully possible to control for word frequency or to completely dissociate it from any sentence context effects.</p><p>Another limitation of our study is that linear regression modeling does not allow the dissociation of the weights of highly correlated features. When we compared the TRF weights of phoneme onset, surprisal and entropy separately between the set of the first four and the second four Dutch story parts, we saw that TRF weights of these features showed differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, acoustic-edge features and averaged phoneme-level features were highly consistent between different story parts, as acoustic and averaged phoneme features are not as correlated as phoneme onset, phoneme surprisal and phoneme entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, it would be problematic to interpret how language comprehension and sentence and discourse level constraint affects these features separately. As alternative solution to this problem, we also fitted different models with varying time lags separated by 50ms with a 100ms sliding window between –100 and 800ms and also compared the reconstruction accuracies of these models instead of TRF weights. Results showed that word entropy modulated the encoding of phoneme onset and phoneme surprisal for a longer time, starting earlier compared to phoneme entropy.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we show that modeling phoneme-level linguistic features in addition to acoustic features better reconstructs the neural tracking response to spoken language, and that this improvement is even more pronounced in the comprehended language, likely reflecting the transformation of acoustic features into phoneme-level representations when a language is fully comprehended. Although acoustic edges are important for speech tracking, internally generated phonemes are more strongly encoded in comprehended language. This suggests that language comprehension can be seen as a neural filter over acoustic edges of the speech signal in the service of transforming sensory input into abstract linguistic units. We demonstrated that low sentence- and discourse-level constraints enhanced the neural encoding of both acoustic and phoneme features. When language is not comprehended, the neural encoding of acoustic features was stronger, likely due to the absence of comprehensive lexical access and interpretation, including higher level linguistic structure formation, in addition to the recognition of single, highly frequent function words (viz., the/a) in isolation. When a language is comprehended from speech, phoneme features were more strongly encoded in the neural response compared to when it is not comprehended. Only in the comprehended language, phoneme features aligned with the phase of neural signal between 200 and 600ms, and this is effect was stronger when the context was less constraining and more information must be extracted from the sensory signal. This pattern of results may reflect the persistence of phoneme-related neural activity before a word is recognized and phoneme-level information can be inhibited. Relying more on low-level features when high-level cues are not reliable, and suppressing low-level information when contextual cues are informative could be a strategy for the brain to utilize its resources in an efficient way toward its behavioral goal. In summary, our results support an account of language comprehension where the flexible modulation of the acoustic and phonemic features by lexical, sentential, and discourse-level information is instrumental in the transformation of sensory input into interpreted linguistic structure and meaning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We collected MEG data from 24 participants between 18 and 58 years old (average age: 31.17 years, 18 F and 6 M) while they were listening audiobooks in Dutch and French.

Bipolar Ag/AgCl electrode pairs were used to record electrooculogram (EOG) and electrocardiogram (ECG).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The aspects of the current results that are consistent with vs. different to prior arguments should be better clarified. As it stands, the theoretical advance of the current paper relative to much current thinking in the field is not always clear.</p><p>2) The treatment of the high-entropy vs. low-entropy contexts in the models was unclear; in particular, if separate TRFs were constructed for these groups of contexts (line 260), a single model (in which entropy was included as a factor) would seem preferable (this was suggested by the model in line 275). Please clarify the model construction and results that were obtained and which underlie the main conclusions (including how words were divided into high vs. low entropy).</p><p>3) The conclusions about listener responses to understood (Dutch) vs. not-understood (French) speech need to be tempered to account for the acoustic differences across language (and possibly across speaker – it was unclear whether the same talker was used for both languages). These points should be explicitly considered and clarified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 4 was very useful and I thought should appear earlier in the paper – I would put this first, so that readers see it as that.</p><p>I could not find data or analysis scripts, which would be useful to share.

As it stands, the theoretical advance of the current paper relative to much current thinking in the field is not always clear.</p></disp-quote><p>No previous studies compared comprehended and uncomprehended speech in a naturalistic context – this is a crucial comparison, in our view, in order to best estimate how much the brain response is driven purely by the acoustic dynamics and physical statistical properties of a natural speech stimulus. Estimating this allows us to then determine the neural responses that are associated with language comprehension over and above the demands on the brain by speech processing.</p><p>Furthermore, previous studies did not estimate the contribution of word entropy on the encoding of both acoustic (i.e., spectrogram and acoustic edges) AND linguistic lower-level features (i.e., phoneme entropy). It has of course previously been shown that word entropy explains neural response variance, but prior to our study the dynamic and interactive relationship between word-level features and low-level features was hypothesized, but not directly shown. Thus we can show that word entropy affects the encoding of both acoustic and linguistic features, which has not been shown before. We discuss later in this response letter and in the manuscript more specifically how our findings are different from particular studies in the literature. In short, our study uses a naturalistic spoken stimulus (audiobook) and compares the effect of word entropy on both acoustic and linguistic features, whereas previous research only looked at acoustic features in highly controlled experimental settings.</p><p>Because of these two key manipulations – manipulating language comprehension apart from speech processing, and directly comparing acoustic and linguistic feature encoding as a function of word entropy – we show for the first time a dynamic tradeoff between acoustic and linguistic features, which previous work focused on separately, and which was not addressed within the same study or analysis. Because we did address these issues all together, we could show that (1) Linguistic features are encoded more strongly during language comprehension than when comprehension is absent, and (2) that high word entropy enhances the encoding of lower-level acoustic and linguistic features while low word entropy suppresses it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The treatment of the high-entropy vs. low-entropy contexts in the models was unclear; in particular, if separate TRFs were constructed for these groups of contexts (line 260), a single model (in which entropy was included as a factor) would seem preferable (this was suggested by the model in line 275). Please clarify the model construction and results that were obtained and which underlie the main conclusions (including how words were divided into high vs. low entropy).</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out a new analysis, followed the suggestions of the Reviewers, and evaluated them in a single model, and we find the same effects.

These points should be explicitly considered and clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer concerns here and want to explain better why acoustic differences are already accounted for in our model comparison approach. We are not comparing acoustic models directly – if we were, we agree with the Reviewer that this would be problematic. However, we are comparing how much adding linguistic features to base models that have already taken into account acoustic differences results in more variance explained in the neural response. By comparing the addition of phoneme-level and word-level features to a base model that already takes into account acoustic differences, we can assess the differences between language over and above any acoustic differences. That said, we carried out additional analyses to control for speaker identity and gender differences (detailed below), and we found the same effects; no differences compared to our previously reported findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 4 was very useful and I thought should appear earlier in the paper – I would put this first, so that readers see it as that.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

Can the authors take this analysis further by assessing model accuracies as before, but this time changing the lags over which the regression is computed (e.g. in sliding time windows 0-50 ms, 25-75 ms, etc.)? This would give information on processing latencies unique to a particular speech feature, going beyond what is currently presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for this suggestion. We have now run new models with changing time lags and computed the model accuracy improvement by each feature by subtracting the reconstruction accuracy of a model from the previous model which doesn’t have the feature of interest as it was done in the first analysis where we showed the additional contribution of each feature to the reconstruction accuracy. Due to long computation time of boosting algorithm we used to compute the TRFs, we could use 17 different time lags separated by 50 ms with a 100 ms sliding window between -100 and 800 ms. We then compared the averaged reconstruction accuracies over whole brain of high and low word entropy conditions of each language (French and Dutch) with a cluster-level permutation test across time with 8000 permutations. Below graphs shows the reconstruction accuracy improvement by each feature for each time window. On x axis, accuracy of each time windows is shown on their center time. (For example, for the window between -100 ms and 0 ms, it’s shown on t = 0.05 seconds). Red bar below shows the time intervals when there was a significant interaction between language and word entropy. Analysis results shows that word entropy modulated the encoding of phoneme onset more in the comprehended language between 200 – 750 ms in LH and RH, between 150 and 650 ms in LH and between 0 and 600 ms in RH for phoneme surprisal, and it was between 550 ms and 650 ms in LH for phoneme entropy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors discuss what might explain their finding of specific phoneme tracking independent of acoustics, which is contra the findings of Daube et al.</p></disp-quote><p>We extended the discussion about the encoding of phonemic features beyond acoustic features in the discussion as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>“An interaction between language and encoding model showed that reconstruction accuracy improvement from the addition of phoneme-level features and word frequency was greater in Dutch stories, suggesting that when language is comprehended, internally-generated linguistic units, e.g., phonemes, are tracked over and above acoustic edges (Meyer, Sun, and Martin, 2020). Our findings contradict the results of Daube et al. (2019), who used articulatory features and phoneme onsets as phonetic features and showed that phoneme-locked responses can be explained by the encoding of acoustic features. It is possible that information theoretic metrics, such as surprisal and entropy, are better suited to capture the transformation of acoustic features into abstract linguistic units.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am unclear about linear mixed models presented for the 'Tracking performance of linguistic features' section (some of the issues described here apply elsewhere too).

We noticed that using the name for model for linear mixed effect models (LMMs) and also as the fixed effect in LMMs might be confusing, so we replaced the model with LMM for linear mixed effect models In Table 1,2 and 3. p values correspond to the contrasts Phoneme Onset – Acoustic, Phoneme Surprisal – Phoneme Onset, Phoneme Entropy – Phoneme Surprisal, Word Frequency – Phoneme Entropy. Names of the contrasts were revised in the manuscript too. We also made a mistake in the name of the contrast. It should be backward difference instead of forward. We revised it in the manuscript too. We used backward difference coding because we want to compare the accuracy improvement by each additional features on top of the previous model. For example, when we contrast Phoneme Onset – Acoustic models, Phoneme Onset model has both acoustic features (spectrogram and acoustic edges) and phoneme onset feature whereas Acoustic model only has acoustic features, so this contrast gives us the model accuracy improvement by phoneme onset feature.

We didn’t bin the words as they were in separate trials. After generation of the acoustic and phonetic features for continuous stimuli, we projected predictors into a higher dimensional space by multiplying them with a weight matrix that zeros out all the predictors of high entropy words in low entropy word condition and vice versa. However, MEG signal was intact. This creates sparser predictors for each condition to create a contrast between two conditions to account for the nonlinear changes in the response function (viz., it is also used for amplitude binning by Drennan and Lalor, 2019). We fitted 2 separate models for each condition to compare the accuracies of conditions. As you also mentioned, in separate models, when a model is predicting the response for high entropy words, it is also predicting the absence of a response in low entropy words which gives us the opportunity to contrast the effect word entropy between conditions.</p><p>Following your suggestion, we also fitted one single model for those predictors and predicted the reconstruction accuracies of high and low entropy word conditions by subtracting accuracies of models without those predictors from the full model which has all predictors. For example, to calculate the accuracy of phoneme features in low entropy word condition we used below method.</p><p>Full_model = [spectrogram_low, spectrogram_high, acoustic_edge_low, acoustic_edge_high, phoneme_onset_low, phoneme_onset_high, phoneme_surprisal_low, phoneme_surprisal_high, phoneme_entropy_low, phoneme_entropy_high, word_freq_low, word_freq_high]</p><p>Full_model_minus_low_word_entropy_phonemes = [spectrogram_low, spectrogram_high, acoustic_edge_low, acoustic_edge_high, phoneme_onset_high, phoneme_surprisal_high, phoneme_entropy_high, word_freq_low, word_freq_high]</p><p>R<sup>2</sup> of phonetic features in low entropy word condition = R<sup>2</sup> of Full_model – R<sup>2</sup> of Full_model_minus_low_entropy_phonemes</p><p>With this method, we calculated the accuracies of phoneme features in low entropy condition, phoneme features in high entropy condition, acoustic features in low entropy condition and acoustic features in high entropy condition.</p><p>To compare the reconstruction accuracies of each feature in each condition, we fitted a linear mixed effect model with the below formula to analyze the interaction between word entropy and language for acoustic and phonemic features.<inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>LMM results of reconstruction accuracies for Phoneme Features.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Estimate</th><th>Std.

As we have already included acoustic features as a base model and compared how much phonetic features increased the model accuracy relative to the base acoustic model rather than directly comparing the accuracies of acoustic models for our first question, and we investigated how sentence context modulated acoustic and phonetic features for our second and third question, these interaction effects are independent from the particular acoustic features which may be related to acoustic differences in stimuli. We agree with the reviewer that if we were only comparing the model accuracies of acoustic features, then acoustic differences related to speaker, language, or gender differences would be a confound in the model accuracy differences. We appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion that comparing French speakers to Dutch speakers listening to our stimuli might shed light on the problem, however, comparing two different group of participants (Dutch and French speakers) listening to the same Dutch stimuli would, rather than ameliorate the concern, lead to unsurmountable challenges in comparison of model accuracies between groups of participants with different language experience. In this case individual differences in signal-to-ratio of neural signal would be problematic when comparing the model accuracies of two groups, which are likely to be greater than the contribution of the any acoustic difference which are already modelled in the base models (Crosse et al., 2021).</p><p>We added a new table (Table 10) that shows which story part was read by different speakers in the revised manuscript. French stories were read by both a woman and a man speaker, however Dutch stories were read by women speakers only. In the first version of our manuscript, we compared the first 4 parts of Dutch stories read by the same woman with the 4 parts of French stories read by a woman and a man speaker in order to have similar amount of training data for both languages because the amount of training data is also factor for the model accuracy. Then we repeated the same analysis with the second group of four Dutch story parts that read by another woman speaker, and crucially, we find the same effects (see reported results in Figure 3 and Figure 4 in the manuscript). To test if gender difference has an impact on the results of our first question, we repeated the same analysis that presented in Table 1 and compared the first 2 part of Dutch stories (read by women 1 in Table 10 in the revised manuscript) with the first 2 parts of French stories (read by women 3). Then compared the first 2 parts of Dutch stories (read by women 1) with second 2 parts of French stories (read by man 1) Linear mixed effect model results are presented below. For each comparison we found the same interaction between languages and model accuracy improvement by phoneme level features.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table3" position="float"><label>Author response table 3.</label><caption><title>LMM results of reconstruction accuracies for Dutch (first 2 parts) and French (first 2 parts) stories.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Estimate</th><th>Std.

Adding a word frequency predictor will control for responses correlated with word frequency, but it will not control for other predictors' TRF shapes being modulated by word frequency.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful to the reviewer for pointing out this issue. We agree that adding word frequency as a predictor doesn’t control for the modulation of other predictors by word frequency. As we also mentioned in the Discussion, we still see the modulation of acoustic features in French stories, however in uncomprehended language we don’t expect to see the effect of context, so this modulation should be driven by the recognition of frequent words. We revised that part as following. To control for the responses correlated with word frequency we also added word frequencies in our full model and compared the reconstruction accuracy improvement explained by acoustic and phoneme features.</p></body></sub-article></article>
