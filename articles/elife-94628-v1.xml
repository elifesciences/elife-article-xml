Previous studies have shown that, in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, nitrogen and amino acid signals activate TORC1 via the highly conserved small GTPases, Gtr1/2, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding protein, Pib2. However, it was unclear if/how Gtr1/2 and Pib2 cooperate to control TORC1. Here, we report that this dual regulator system pushes TORC1 into at least three distinct signaling states: (i) a Gtr1/2 on, Pib2 on, rapid growth state in nutrient replete conditions; (ii) a Gtr1/2 inhibited, Pib2 on, adaptive/slow growth state in poor-quality growth medium; and (iii) a Gtr1/2 off, Pib2 off, quiescent state in starvation conditions. We suggest that other signaling pathways work in a similar way to drive a multilevel response via a single kinase, but the behavior has been overlooked since most studies follow signaling to a single reporter protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TORC1</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>nutrient</kwd><kwd>Gtr1/2</kwd><kwd>Pib2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Capaldi</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM136536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cecil</surname><given-names>Jacob H</given-names></name><name><surname>Padilla</surname><given-names>Cristina M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dual regulation of TORC1 by Gtr1/2 and Pib2 drives cells into three distinct signaling states, establishing a new paradigm for graded TORC1 signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex 1 (TORC1) is the master regulator of cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GonzÃ¡lez and Hall, 2017</xref>).

Specifically, when cells are grown in medium containing a high concentration of amino acids (or a high-quality nitrogen source), Gtr1/2 are in their GTP and GDP-bound forms, respectively, and bind to/activate TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubouloz et al., 2005</xref>). However, once amino acid/nitrogen levels fall, SEAC (a homolog of GATOR1/2) triggers GTP hydrolysis at Gtr1 to drive the complex into the Gtr1-GDP, Gtr2-GTP-bound state, and inhibit TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Panchaud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Neklesa and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laxman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Algret et al., 2014</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>TORC1 is also regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding protein, Pib2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatakeyama, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim and Cunningham, 2015</xref>). Much less is known about Pib2 than Gtr1/2, but several facts are clear: first, Pib2 binds directly to TORC1 and activates the complex via its highly conserved C-terminal domain (CAD) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim and Cunningham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Troutman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tarassov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanigawa and Maeda, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Michel et al., 2017</xref>). Second, Pib2 can repress TORC1 via its N-terminal inhibitory domain (NID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Michel et al., 2017</xref>). Third, Pib2 activates TORC1 in response to glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanigawa and Maeda, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ukai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tanigawa et al., 2021</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>Most data but how and why do Gtr1/2 and Pib2 work together to regulate TORC1?</p><p>Most data suggest that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 act in parallel (redundantly) to activate TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatakeyama, 2021</xref>). For example, yeast missing either Gtr1/2 or Pib2 grow well in nutrient-rich media, while <italic>gtr1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>Î<italic>pib2</italic>Î cells are sick/dead (a phenotype that can be rescued by a hyperactive TOR allele) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim and Cunningham, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>gtr1/2</italic>Î and <italic>pib2</italic>Î cells have strong TORC1 activity as measured by the downstream reporters phospho-Rps6 and Sch9, while transient repression of Pib2 in a <italic>gtr1/2</italic>Î cell line blocks TORC1 signaling to these same proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim and Cunningham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ukai et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>However, other data suggest that the impact that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 have on TORC1 signaling is more complex: First, <italic>gtr1</italic>Î, <italic>gtr2</italic>Î, <italic>gtr1/2</italic>Î, and <italic>pib2</italic>Î cells are all hypersensitive to the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Michel et al., 2017</xref>). Second, both <italic>gtr1/2</italic>Î and <italic>pib2</italic>Î cells fail to activate TORC1 when leucine or glutamine are added back to cells treated with rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Varlakhanova et al., 2017</xref>). Third, phosphorylation of the TORC1 target Npr1, and its substrate Par32, is sensitive to deletion of either Pib2 or Gtr1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim and Cunningham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brito et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we build on the previous studies by examining the impact that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 have on TORC1 signaling across the proteome using a combination of phosphoproteomics and standard reporter assays. The resulting data show that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 are both required for full TORC1 activation. Importantly, however, deletion of Gtr1/2 or Pib2 only blocks signaling to a subset of the TORC1 substratesâprimarily those involved in amino acid metabolism and nutrient transport. These observations lead us to propose a new model where partial starvation triggers metabolic reprogramming via TORC1 (by inactivating Gtr1/2 or Pib2) but does not block cell growth. And in follow-up experiments, we confirm that this is, indeed, the case. Specifically, we show that when yeast are first transferred from medium containing a high-quality nitrogen source, to medium containing a low-quality nitrogen source, TORC1 is completely inhibited to block growth and activate metabolic reprogramming. Then, as the cells adapt to the low-quality nitrogen source, Pib2 is turned on again to reinitiate growth, while Gtr1/2 remains inhibited, or partially inhibited, to ensure that the cells continue to activate the metabolic pathways and transporters necessary for adaptation/survival.</p><p>Thus, the TORC1 circuit in yeast uses two different amino acid/nitrogen signaling proteins to drive the cell into a rapid growth state, an adaptive growth state, or a quiescent state, depending on the environmental conditions. We argue that other signaling pathways probably work in a similar way, but multilevel responses are overlooked since most studies follow signaling to a single reporter.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reporter (pRps6)-based analysis of Gtr1/2- and Pib2-dependent signaling</title><p>Gtr1/2 and Pib2 are thought to transmit leucine, glutamine, and other amino acid signals to TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatakeyama, 2021</xref>).

However, we were left with a puzzle. Our data also revealed that Pib2 can transmit glutamine starvation signals to TORC1, but those signals have little to no impact on TORC1 activity in the presence of an intact Gtr1/2 complex.

To address this question, we examined our recently published interactome data for Kog1 (the major regulatory subunit in TORC1) and Pib2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wallace et al., 2022</xref>). This analysis revealed that Ser3 and Ser33 are two out of a total of six proteins that are captured at a significantly higher level in a Pib2 immunopurification than in a Kog1 immunopurification (out of &gt;200 proteins enriched in the Kog1 IP), suggesting that Ser3 and Ser33 bind to Pib2 and not TORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). In line with this, we found that Ser33-HA is enriched in a Pib2 purification (2.5-fold) but not a Gtr1/2 purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to see if the TORC1- and Pib2-dependent phosphorylation of Ser33 is important for cell function, we followed the growth of phosphonull (S7A) and phosphomimic (S7D) versions of Ser33 in medium missing serine and glycine (in a Ser3 delete background). These experiments showed that the phosphonull (but not the phosphomimic) strain has a significant delay exiting quiescence, but then grows at the same rate as the wild-type strain once it is dividing rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). These data suggest (but do not prove) that the TORC1- and Pib2-dependent phosphorylation of Ser33 helps drive serine and glycine synthesis as cells transition into a rapid growth state, but TORC1-dependent phosphorylation is not required to maintain basal Ser33 activity during log phase growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Multilevel signaling through TORC1</title><p>Our discovery that the deletion of Gtr1/2 or Pib2 leads to a change in TORC1 signaling through some substrates (particularly those involved in amino acid transport and metabolism), but not those involved in cell growth control, led us to hypothesize that the TORC1 pathway can take up at least three distinct signaling states (the first two of which are well known; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>): (I) a fully active state to promote cell growth and inhibit the Npr1-dependent amino acid starvation response. (II) An inactive state to block cell growth and activate the Npr1-dependent amino acid starvation response. (III) A partially active state to simultaneously promote cell growth and activate the Npr1-dependent amino acid starvation response.</p><p>To test this model (i.e., see if State III exists in a wild-type strain), we needed reliable reporters of the TORC1-dependent cell growth and amino acid starvation responses. We therefore turned to two well-established assays.</p><p>First, to follow the cell growth response, we monitored the phosphorylation of cleaved Sch9 using an SDS-PAGE mobility assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes Hallett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Urban et al., 2007</xref>). This assay follows the phosphorylation of several TORC1 target sites at the C-terminus of Sch9, known to play a key role in activating the kinase and protein synthesis. These C-terminal sites remain phosphorylated in the Gtr1/2 and Pib2 delete strains (Ser 723 and 726; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and right column <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Second, to follow the TORC1-dependent amino acid starvation response, we monitored the phosphorylation of full-length Par32 using an SDS-PAGE mobility assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes Hallett et al., 2014</xref>). Par32 regulates amino acid transporter activity and is a substrate/reporter for the key TORC1-dependent amino acid starvation response regulator, Npr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boeckstaens et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, both Par32 and Npr1 are highly sensitive to the deletion of Gtr1/2 or Pib2 (left columns; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In the case of Par32, some sites are dephosphorylated in rapamycin and the mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and left column, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), while others (targeted by Npr1, a kinase that is repressed by TORC1) are hyperphosphorylated in rapamycin and the mutant strains (left column, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). As a result, Par32 exists in a partially phosphorylated state in the SC medium and then shifts to a hyperphosphorylated (slow migrating) state during amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes Hallett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boeckstaens et al., 2015</xref>) and in <italic>gtr1</italic>Î and <italic>pib2</italic>Î cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Once we established the Par32 and Sch9 reporter assays, we looked to see if transferring a prototrophic strain from medium that contains an excess of all 20 amino acids (SC), to medium containing a single high-quality nitrogen source (glutamine) or a single poor-quality nitrogen source (leucine or proline), pushes the cell into the predicted Sch9 on and Par32 on, intermediate signaling state (State III). This was not the case: in glutamine medium, the intermediate signaling state was populated for a short time (2.5 and 5 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), but Par32 was dephosphorylated again after 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In leucine medium, we also saw transient population of the intermediate state, but here Sch9 was entirely dephosphorylated after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Finally, in proline medium, we saw a transition into the complete starvation state (State II), where Par32 is phosphorylated and Sch9 is dephosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we looked to see if the intermediate state is populated as cells transition from growth in a poor-quality nitrogen source (proline) to a high-quality nitrogen source (glutamine). This was the case, and to our surprise, TORC1 was already in the intermediate (Sch9 on, Par32 on) signaling state during steady-state growth in proline medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, it appeared that the TORC1 pathway is driven into a complete starvation state (State II) when cells are first exposed to a poor nitrogen source (2.5â60 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) but then transitions into the intermediate signaling state (State III) as the cells adapt to the poor growth conditions (time 0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>To test this model further, we grew a prototrophic strain in glutamine medium and transferred it to proline medium, but this time followed Par32, Sch9, (and Npr1) phosphorylation for 4 h. As predicted, Sch9 was dephosphorylated initially, but then reactivated (phosphorylated) over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast, Par32 and Npr1 remained in an active or partially active form (highly phosphorylated and dephosphorylated, respectively) during the entire time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>We also carried out the same experiment in an <italic>npr1</italic>Î strain to test the prediction that the adaptation to a poor-quality nitrogen source is driven by the activation of Npr1 and Par32.

Wild-type and <italic>npr1</italic>Î cells should grow at the same rate in SC and glutamine medium since the adaptive amino acid starvation response is off. However, in proline medium, where Npr1-Par32 signaling is active and presumably ensures that the cells can import/synthesize adequate amounts of nitrogen and each amino acid, the <italic>npr1</italic>Î cells should grow much slower than wild-type cells. This was also true (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Tod6 is activated in the intermediate signaling state</title><p>The growth curves we collected in SC, glutamine, and proline medium highlight an important fact: yeast grow about four times faster in SC medium than in proline medium (compare red and black lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, we see relatively little difference between the phosphorylation level of Sch9âthe presumed master regulator of cell growth downstream of TORC1âin those two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This observation led us to posit that one or more of the cell growth control factors is also part of the intermediate (State III) response and acts to slow cell growth in proline medium. The relevant cell growth regulators in yeast are (i) Sfp1, a TORC1-dependent activator of ribosome and protein synthesis gene expression (and thus growth) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marion et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LempiÃ¤inen et al., 2009</xref>); (ii) Tod6, a TORC1- and Sch9-dependent repressor of ribosome and protein synthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lippman and Broach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber et al., 2011</xref>); (iii) Stb3, another TORC1- and Sch9-dependent repressor of ribosome and protein synthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liko et al., 2007</xref>); and (iv) Maf1, a TORC1- and Sch9-dependent repressor of RNA Polymerase III and tRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soulard et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, to test our model, we searched our phosphoproteomics data to see if any of the aforementioned factors are sensitive to the deletion of Gtr1/2 or Pib2 (and thus likely activated/repressed in the intermediate state). We did not detect Sfp1 in our experiments, but found that Stb3 and Maf1 remain phosphorylated, while Tod6 is dephosphorylated, in the Gtr1/2 and Pib2 delete cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that TORC1 inhibition triggers the movement of Stb3 and Tod6 into the nucleus where they act to recruit the Rpd3L deacetylase to, and thus repress, the ribosome protein and ribosome biogenesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, to test if Tod6 is part of the intermediate (State III) response, we measured the localization of Tod6-GFP and Stb3-GFP in a prototrophic strain carrying the nuclear marker Htb2-RFP and growing in SC medium, SC medium + rapamycin, or proline medium.

In nutrient-rich medium, TORC1 is fully active and phosphorylates (i) Sch9 and other proteins to drive cell growth, and (ii) Npr1 to suppress the amino acid starvation response (left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In contrast, when cells are first transferred to medium containing a poor-quality nitrogen source like proline, TORC1 is inhibited (middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This blocks cell growth and triggers the activation of Npr1. Then, as cells adapt to the poor-quality nitrogen source (via Npr1), TORC1 is driven into an intermediate activity state where it phosphorylates Sch9 to reinitiate growth, but not Npr1, so that the cell continues to stimulate the increased amino acid transport and synthesis needed to support mass accumulation (right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Tod6 is also dephosphorylated in the intermediate state, presumably to slow the growth rate of the cell so that it matches the maximum rate achievable in the poor-quality nitrogen source (right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Three-state signaling through the TORC1 pathway.</title><p>Schema describing the three signaling states of the TORC1 pathway, as described in the text.

In nutrient-rich medium, Gtr1/2 and Pib2 are both on and push TORC1 into the fully active state. Then, when cells are first transferred to a poor-quality nitrogen source, Gtr1/2 and Pib2 turn off, or mostly off, triggering strong TORC1 inhibition. Finally, as the cells adapt to the new conditions, Pib2 is reactivated, so that TORC1 can phosphorylate most of the cell growth proteins but not Npr1, Tod6, and other proteins described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>This three-state signaling system provides an elegant solution to a problem facing yeast as they transition between nutrient sources. Specifically, when yeast cells grow in nutrient-rich medium they focus on rapid growth via the import of key amino acids using highly selective transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianchi et al., 2019</xref>). As a result, when amino acid levels fall, the cells do not know if there is a low-quality nitrogen source in the extracellular milieu and do not have the capacity to import it even if it is there. Thus, the cells have to inactivate TORC1 and slow/halt their growth. However, once Npr1 is activated, the cells build the capacity to import, and grow using, a wide range of nitrogen-containing compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmidt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Craene et al., 2001</xref>). Then, if an adequate nitrogen source is available, Pib2 is turned back on so that the cell restarts growth while keeping the Npr1-dependent starvation response (and the import of alternate nitrogen sources) active.</p><p>Important implications of this three-state model include that (i) yeast cells (likely including fungal pathogens) can be pushed to import alternative nitrogen sources, including toxic amino acid analogs and related compounds, by deletion or inhibition of Gtr1/2 or Pib2, and (ii) yeast cell growth on poor nitrogen sources can be halted by deletion of, or inhibition of, Pib2.</p><p>The data presented here also reveal another unique aspect of the Gtr1/2 and Pib2 control circuit, namely that the activity of Ser33 (and its homolog of Ser3) depends on signaling through TORC1-Pib2, and that this in turn appears to ensure that Ser33 is only phosphorylated in the presence of a high-quality nitrogen source. Our data suggests that this occurs due to direct binding of Ser33 to Pib2, leading to a model that is reminiscent of the RagC-dependent binding and regulation of TFEB in human cells, where TFEB is regulated in response to amino acid signals (via RagC), but not the hormone signals transmitted to TORC1 through Rheb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cui et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Napolitano et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesize that the TORC1-Pib2 connection to Ser33 is setup this way to couple Ser33 activity to the level of glutamate/glutamine in the cell (rather than overall amino acid levels and other stress signals that regulate Gtr1/2) since the second step in serine synthesis involves the transfer of an amine group from glutamate to the Ser33 product, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mattaini et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the implications this work has for understanding TORC1 signaling in yeast, our study also provides important insight into the design (and analysis) of other signaling pathways, including mTOR. Previous experiments examining TORC1 signaling in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, including our own, focused on measuring TORC1 activity using one or two downstream reporters (usually pRps6 or pSch9). This led to the view that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 act as redundant activators of TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatakeyama, 2021</xref>). In reality, however, Gtr1/2 and Pib2 are semi-redundant activators of TORC1, and drive TORC1 into a fully active, partially active, or inactive state via on/on, off/on, or off/off modes of Gtr1/2 and Pib2 signaling. Fully active TORC1 then phosphorylates all of its downstream targets, while partially active TORC1 phosphorylates a subset of its targets, to create a condition-dependent response. We argue that other stress and starvation signaling pathways likely work in a similar way; it is just that multilevel signaling has been overlooked since it is difficult to detect using standard reporter assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain construction</title><p>All of the strains in this study were made in haploid (W303) <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Storici and Resnick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Storici et al., 2001</xref>), are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> (note there are two tabs), and are available upon request.

At this point, the digestion supernatant and the extraction supernatant were pooled, split into two tubes, and concentrated using vacuum centrifugation. One tube was further digested with thermolysin (Promega) by resuspending the tryptically digested peptides with a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and 0.5 mM calcium chloride and adding 1 Î¼g of thermolysin.

However, we still do not understand how each upstream regulatory branch contributes to TORC1 activity under different nutrient conditions. The authors set out to answer this question using budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) as a model eukaryote. Yeast TORC1 is activated by two upstream regulators: the highly conserved GTPases Gtr1/2 and the PI3P-binding protein Pib2. The cooperation of these regulators towards TORC1 activation has been unclear, with some studies suggesting that they act in parallel (i.e. redundantly), and others suggesting a more complex picture. By exploring the dependence of different TORC1 substrates on Gtr1/2 and Pib2 activity, the authors have discovered that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 do not act redundantly, but instead are part of a mechanism that drives the TORC1 pathways into three distinct activity levels: (i) both Gtr1/2 and Pib2 ON in rich nutrients (leading to the highest TORC1 activity), (ii) Gtr1/2 OFF and Pib2 ON in poor quality nitrogen sources (intermediate TORC1 activity), and (iii) both Gtr1/2 and Pib2 OFF under starvation conditions (lowest TORC1 activity).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The relation between Gtr1/2 and Pib2 has remained a mystery for a long time, making it difficult to interpret the results of experiments in which one of the two regulators is inactive or missing. By employing a phosphoproteomics assay, the authors were able to monitor the phosphorylation of multiple TORC1 substrates in response to TORC1 inhibition (via rapamycin) and in mutants carrying deletions of Gtr1/2 or Pib2. In this way, they could identify two groups of substrates: those that require the activity of both regulators, and those that remain active when a single regulator is active. These data clearly demonstrate the non-redundancy of the Gtr1/2 and Pib2, especially since the different groups of substrates seem to correspond to groups of proteins with distinct functions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The first section of the Results contains an analysis of Gtr1/2- and Pib2-dependent signaling using Rps6 as a TORC1 reporter. I do not think that Rps6 is an appropriate readout for this type of work, as it is not a direct TORC1 substrate, and it also lies downstream of TORC2 [Yerlikaya et al. 2016]. The authors obtain several puzzling results with Rps6, and later on (pg. 8) remark that the level of Rps6 phosphorylation does not always correspond to TORC1 activity. While this is an interesting finding in its own right and will certainly be interesting for the yeast TOR community, I do not see why the Results need to open with such a confusing section, and why Rps6 features so prominently throughout the manuscript.</p><p>- There is very large ambiguity regarding the types of media and strains that are used (prototrophic vs auxotrophic). The authors use SC medium which, if I understand correctly, contains ammonium and a supplement of amino acids. They then use single amino acid dropouts (e.g. SC -gln and SC -leu) to probe TORC1 activity under &quot;partial starvation&quot; conditions. However, the cells are anything but starved in these experiments, and I do not know how to interpret results obtained with such media. Even when amino acids are completely removed, the cells are still able to grow on ammonium. The matter gets further complicated because it appears that the authors use prototrophic strains with single nitrogen source media, but not with complete or &quot;partial starvation&quot; media. Since this study aims to elucidate the roles of nutrient-sensing regulators upstream of TORC1, I would expect that matters related to media composition and strain usage should be addressed more carefully and described more explicitly in the text, especially since nutritional complementation of auxotrophic strains is not always equivalent to genetic complementation [Pronk, 2002].</p><p>- A recent publication (Zeng et al. 2023, doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2023.113599) identified Ser33 and Ser3 as TORC1 substrates and examined their dependence on Pib2 activity. More importantly, the publication addressed a question that is very similar to the one addressed here (i.e. how different amino acids require Gtr1/2 or Pib2 to activate TORC1). I would recommend that the authors cite that publication and compare their findings with the results reported there.</p><p>- The GO analysis of TORC1 substrates (from Fig.4) is mentioned in the text but is not shown. The authors should present the GO analysis more explicitly, e.g. in a supplementary table.</p><p>- Similar to Rps6, it should be kept in mind that Par32 is not a TORC1 substrate. While I understand the rationale behind the choice of Par32 as a readout, this point needs to be emphasized more. Additionally, previous work [Brito et al. 2019, doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2019.09.025] has suggested that Npr1 and Par32 are implicated in a feedback loop with Pib2. The potential relevance of that work should be discussed more here.</p><p>- Besides Sch9, Tod6 phosphorylation is also regulated by PKA [Huber et al. 2011, doi: 10.1038/emboj.2011.221]. This point should be discussed and taken into account in the interpretation of the Tod6 results. I also find it puzzling that Tod6 persists one hour after rapamycin treatment, because the protein seems to be unstable and gets quickly degraded when TORC1 activity is lost [Kusama 2022, doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2022.103986].</p><p>- Given the points raised above, I remain skeptical about the three-state model proposed by the authors. On a conceptual level, the intermediate activity state of TORC1 proposed here seems to depend absolutely on Pib2 (since Gtr1/2 appear to be off in that state). The authors make a similar point in the Discussion, where they claim that yeast growth on poor nitrogen sources can be halted by deletion of Pib2. However, they do not test this conjecture experimentally.</p><p>- Fig. 6F compares the growth of different strains on different media, but the doubling times are not quantified.</p><p>- The Introduction describes regulatory pathways of mTORC1, several of which do not exist in budding yeast. The transition from the second to third paragraph is very abrupt and confusing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94628.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This work examines the roles of Gtr1/Gtr2 and Pib2 in activation of TORC1 in S cerevisiae and proposes they are non-redundant in activating TORC1. Previous work from many groups has suggested that the Gtr complex and Pib2 activate TORC1 in a parallel manner. One contribution of this study is the suggestion that using the standard readout(s) of TORC1 activation are not sufficient to assess the separate roles of these two components in the complex network of amino acid and starvation response signaling. The overall conclusion of the work, based on phosphoproteome analyses of deletion strains and comparison to rapamycin treatment, with some supporting experimentation, is that Pib2 signaling sustains the starvation response in poor amino acid/nitrogen sources, whereas the additional activation of the Gtr complex is required for the full spectrum of TORC1 effects on growth.</p><p>At first, the authors recapitulate and extend studies on TORC1 inactivation using the Rps6 reporter. Here, Pib2 could inactivate TORC1 on glutamine starvation only if the Gtr complex is partially compromised. The authors speculated that Gtr and Pib2 do lead to different responses, but these cannot be detected by monitoring the phospho state of Rps6.</p><p>The authors determined the phosphoproteome in wild type cells and a variety of knockout strains, in rich media and in the presence of rapamycin. The authors identified 175 phosphosites that are downregulated on rapamycin treatment, at least under these conditions. Many were dependent on both Pib2 and the Gtr complex but, of particular interest for this work , were the phosphosites on Ser33, that were dependent on the presence of Pib2 but not the Gtr complex. The authors noted that phosphosites not dependent on Pib2 or Gtr1/2 included Sch9 and other common readouts of TORC1 activation.</p><p>Focusing on Ser33, the authors next show that rapamycin, amino acid and nitrogen starvation result in loss of Ser33 phosphorylation. Further analysis showed that the Ser33 phosphorylation status depends on the quality of the amino acid and nitrogen source.</p><p>Then the authors use this to develop a model where TORC1 has three states depending on whether either Gtr1/2, or Pib2, or both are active in signaling to TORC1, depending on the nutrient state and quality of amino acids/nitrogen available. The new state is state III, where TORC1 is active to promote growth and the starvation response remains active, via the Npr1/Par32 branch. The remainder of the work involves developing tools to assess the growth (Sch9) and starvation (Par32) branches under various amino acid/nutrient states. While moving from media with an excess of all amino acids to glutamine or leucine led to only transient occupation of state III, the new state was already occupied when the cells were in a poor amino acid/nitrogen source and moved to a better one. In other words, the Pib2 signalling permitted aspects of a starvation response to be maintained in the background of a Sch9 growth signal.</p><p>Finally, the authors address a puzzle: Sch9 phosphorylation does not have the dynamic range to account for the difference in growth rates of yeast cells in SC or proline medium. Tod6 was dephosphorylated in the absence of Gtr1/Gtr2 or Pib2 in the phosphoproteomics and is the likely connection, as it moves to the nucleus on growth on proline media (or on rapamycin), where it may control the chromatin accessibility of ribosome growth and biogenesis genes.</p><p>Overall, the core of this work, the phosphoproteome analyses, convincingly demonstrates that activation of TORC1 relies on a nuanced interplay of signaling pathways and that to fully appreciate and dissect the consequences of the Gtr- and Pib2-responsive signaling pathways a more comprehensive range of readouts is required. The work elegantly shows a scenario where Pib2-based signaling is active, required to sustain some growth even when the amino acid/nitrogen mix is poor.</p><p>There are some areas, however, where the work could be strengthened. The model proposed in this work is based on nuanced signaling responses to various states of nitrogen/amino acid starvation. However, the phosphoproteome was determined in a synthetic rich background, supplemented with rapamycin where relevant, and comparing the phosphoproteome of pib2 del and gtr1 del/gtr2 del to this. The phosphoproteome is by far the strongest data in this work suggesting multi-level regulation so an appropriately matched phosphoproteome condition screen would likely significantly substantiate the model: the conditions used might miss all the nuanced signaling responses the authors develop throughout the paper. Not unrelated, the authors show that Pib2 can transmit glutamine starvation signals to TORC1 in the presence of a partial Gtr1/2 complex (gtr1 del or gtr2 del) but not a complete deletion of the complex (Fig. 2). Similar to the above comment, the phosphoproteome was determined only with full loss of the gtr complex, and then only in a rich background, which may miss this entire branch of Pib2 signaling. Perhaps in support of this, Pib2Ser113 phosphorylation apparently decreased significantly on rapamycin treatment but not on loss of the Gtr complex (TableS1), whereas other Pib2 phospho sites were not similarly affected by rapamycin treatment. Adding to the notion of complexity, the other sites may themselves be subject to other signaling pathways that could regulate Pib2 - and these may change on nutrient starvation.</p><p>The data showing the enrichment of Pib2 with Ser33 is weak (Fig. 5G, mostly because of the significant precipitation of Ser33 in the absence of Pib2), particularly without the contribution of the immunopurifications of Fig5S1. Assessing the binding of Ser3 may be a better candidate?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94628.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This work addresses an important question of how Gtr1/2 small GTPases and Pib2, two major regulators of the TORC1 cell growth controller, differentially operate in yeast. They found not all the TORC1 downstream targets respond to Gtr1/2 and Pib2 equally. In fact, they demonstrate that TORC1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser33, a 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, is responsive to only Pib2. They attributed this specificity to the physical interaction between Ser33 and Pib2. This part is novel and important, revising the canonical view in the field that Gtr1/2 and Pib2 branches act towards the same TORC1 downstream targets. Of note, this claim largely agrees with a recent independent study (PMID: 38127619).</p><p>Moving on, the authors describe different behaviors of TORC1 downstream readouts in intermediate nutrient conditions with a poor nitrogen source, with some readouts still active while others inactive. They argue that selective activation of certain TORC1 downstream targets reflects the &quot;Gtr1/2 off, Pib2 on&quot; state. However, this claim is not sufficiently supported by the presented data.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The data presented in this paper has high value to the TOR community. In particular, a rigorous and comprehensive phospho-proteomic dataset that compares the Gtr1/2- and Pib2-dependency of diverse TORC1 downstream targets is very informative, potentially stimulating follow-up studies on each target.</p><p>Identification of Ser33 as a Pib2-specific TORC1 downstream is important and convincing (although whether Ser33 is a direct substrate of TORC1 was not addressed in this work). Physical interaction between Ser33 and Pib2 could represent a novel layer of TORC1 signaling regulation, in line with the mammalian Rag-TFEB interaction model, as discussed by the authors.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors' three-state model, particularly the claim that cells are in the &quot;Gtr1/2 off, Pib2 on&quot; state in a poor nitrogen condition (e.g., proline medium), is not convincing enough because of the following reasons.</p><p>1. The &quot;Pib2 on&quot; claim contradicts with the observation that Ser33, Pib2-specific readout, is hypo-phosphorylated in proline medium (Fig 5F).</p><p>2. In the genetic experiments (Figure 8), the authors compare pib2D with Gtr1/2OFF. This is not appropriate, because GTR1/2OFF (GTR1-GDP and Gtr2-GTP) actively inhibits TORC1, differing from the null nature of pib2D. pib2D should be compared with gtr1/2D instead.</p><p>3. In general, diverse behaviors of TORC1 targets are not unexpected because their phosphorylation levels should have different dynamic ranges depending on how &quot;good&quot; they are as TORC1 substrates, with some requiring a higher TORC1 activity than others to be detectably phosphorylated. Although this aspect can be physiologically meaningful, and it is indeed important to look at multiple substrates as the authors suggest, this approach does not inform whether the signal is coming from Gtr1/2 or Pib2. An informative way in this context would be to look at the Gtr1/2- or Pib2-specific targets, but the former has not been identified, and observations on the latter, Ser33, do not support the &quot;Pib2 on&quot; claim as mentioned in the above 1.</p><p>4. In addition, comparisons made between direct TORC1 substrates (e.g., Sch9) and indirect downstream targets (e.g., Rps6 and Par32) are not very informative, because indirect targets can be impacted by TORC1-independent regulation of the mediating factors (e.g., Ypk3 for Rps6 and Npr1 for Par32).</p><p>In summary, the presented data do not tell us which of the two branches (Gtr1/2 or Pib2) is &quot;more active&quot; in the poor nitrogen condition. Their observations do not necessarily prefer their 3-state on/off model (Figure 8) over the more natural assumption that both branches have the gradation of activity depending on the nutrient status.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94628.2.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cecil</surname><given-names>Jacob H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Arizona</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tucson</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Padilla</surname><given-names>Cristina M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Arizona</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tucson</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lipinski</surname><given-names>Austin A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Arizona</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tucson</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Langlais</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Arizona</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tucson</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Xiangxia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Arizona</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tucson</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Capaldi</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Arizona</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tucson</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback. As the reviewers noted, dissecting the contributions of Gtr1/2 and Pib2 to TORC1 signaling across diverse nutrient states is a technically and conceptually challenging problem. Indeed, many of the issues raisedâincluding the interpretation of non-canonical TORC1 readouts (e.g., Rps6, Par32), the influence of strain auxotrophy and media composition, and the limitations of phosphoproteomic analysis performed under a single growth conditionâunderscore the challenges of working with the TORC1 signaling system.</p><p>In response to the reviewersâ comments, we have undertaken a broader and more systematic analysis of TORC1 regulation across defined nitrogen transitions, building directly on the signaling framework established in Figures 6 and 8 of this manuscript. This work, which includes expanded phosphoproteomic profiling and the use of refined genetic tools, supports and extends the key conclusions of Cecil et. al. Specifically, it reinforces the existence of a Pib2-dependent TORC1 output under nitrogen-limited conditions and further clarifies the physiological relevance of the intermediate TORC1 activity state. Due to the scope and depth of this expanded work, we are reporting those findings in a separate publication. Nonetheless, we view the data presented here as a key foundational step in establishing a non-redundant framework for Gtr1/2- and Pib2-dependent control of TORC1.</p><p>We have therefore made minor changes to the manuscript to clarify our use of different growth media and to temper our conclusions where appropriate. These changes, together with the context of ongoing work, should reinforce the value of Cecil et. al. in advancing our understanding of TORC1 and nutrient signaling in eukaryotes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
