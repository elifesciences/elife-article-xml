ACE is a heavily glycosylated dimer, containing four analogous catalytic sites, and exists in membrane-bound and soluble (sACE) forms. ACE inhibition is a frontline, FDA-approved, therapy for cardiovascular diseases yet is associated with significant side effects, including higher rates of lung cancer. To date, structural studies have been confined to individual domains or partially denatured cryo-EM structures. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the glycosylated full human sACE dimer. We resolved four structural states at 2.99 – 3.65 Å resolution which are primarily differentiated by varying degrees of solvent accessibility to the active sites and reveal the full dimerization interface. We also employed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and heterogeneity analysis in cryoSPARC, cryoDRGN, and RECOVAR to elucidate the conformational dynamics of sACE and identify key regions mediating conformational change. We identify differences in the mechanisms governing the conformational dynamics of individual domains that have implications for the design of domain-specific sACE modulators.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>angioten-I converting enzyme</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>amyloid peptide</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>all-atom MD simulations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM121964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Wei-Jen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and computational approaches uncover the molecular basis for dimerization, open-closed conformational transitions, and the dynamic behavior of the human angiotensin-I converting enzyme dimer.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) is an M2 clan zinc metalloprotease (EC3.4.15.1) located on the plasma membrane and in the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lubbe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turner and Hooper, 2002</xref>). ACE plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin system by converting angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, and in the kinin-kallikrein system by degrading bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Inhibiting ACE is a primary approach for treating hypertension and is a proven therapy for heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and other cardiovascular and renal dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herman et al., 2024</xref>). However, ACE inhibition has known side effects, e.g., dry cough and angioedema, and has been linked to higher rates of lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yao et al., 2023</xref>). This is partly because ACE also degrades a diverse range of peptides, resulting in complex physiological outcomes due to the interplay in altering levels of these peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herman et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Semis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Danziger et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, ACE degrades amyloid β (Aβ), which is associated with the progression of Alzheimer’s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hampel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hemming and Selkoe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Overexpression of ACE in myelomonocytes substantially reduced Aβ load and prevented Alzheimer’s disease-like cognitive decline in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2014</xref>). However, the brains of some Alzheimer’s disease patients showed upregulation of the renin-angiotensin system, which led to deleterious effects, and ACE inhibition was beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gouveia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wright et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>). These studies indicate that global ACE inhibition could be either beneficial or harmful for individual Alzheimer’s patients and underscore a need for better understanding the molecular mechanisms governing ACE function and substrate selectivity to develop more selective, improved ACE inhibitors and expand ACE-based therapies.</p><p>ACE is a 180 kDa heavily N-linked glycosylated type 1 transmembrane protein with two homologous catalytic domains residing at the N- and C-terminal ends (ACE-N and ACE-C) in its extracellular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turner and Hooper, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riordan, 2003</xref>). The ACE extracellular region can be released via proteolytic cleavage near the transmembrane region by ADAM (<italic>a d</italic>isintegrin <italic>a</italic>nd <italic>m</italic>etalloproteinase) family protease(s), generating soluble ACE (sACE) and ACE dimerization can regulate this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">English et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hooper and Turner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kost et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Webers et al., 2024</xref>). ACE belongs to the cowrin (cowry-like) family of zinc metallocarboxypeptidases because its catalytic domain is ellipsoidal and contains a long, deep, yet narrow catalytic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomis-Rüth, 2008</xref>). ACE is known to cleave short peptides, such as angiotensin I (decapeptide) and bradykinin (nonapeptide) by removing the C-terminal two amino acid residues. Different from the funnelin family of metallocarboxypeptides that contains a funnel-like cavity, the catalytic cleft of ACE can accommodate entire oligopeptides and ACE has been shown to cleave multiple discrete sites on Aβ outside the C-terminal end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is more accurate to refer to ACE as an endopeptidase with dipeptidyl carboxylase activity.</p><p>Extensive crystallographic studies of ACE-N or ACE-C alone and in complex with various inhibitors and a catalytic product, angiotensin-II, have elucidated the overall structures of ACE catalytic domains and molecular details of the catalytic pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lubbe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corradi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masuyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Natesh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2003</xref>). The structures indicate that each domain is comprised of three sub-domains and offer insight for the substrate preferences around cleavage sites and the promiscuity of each domain toward short peptide substrates. Furthermore, they reveal the orientation of substrate binding sites around the scissile bond, indicating that the entire oligopeptide substrates need to be engulfed into the catalytic chamber of ACE catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masuyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Natesh et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>However, the catalytic pocket of ACE in the closed state is not large enough to accommodate the entrance of all its known substrates, particularly Aβ, to permit the observed cleavage pattern. Thus, similar to other Aβ-degrading proteases, such as insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), presequence protease (PreP), and neprilysin (NEP), ACE must undergo a large-scale open-closed transition to capture and degrade larger peptide substrates such as Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Recent open state structures of sACE-N, sACE monomer, and a sACE-N dimer, along with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of sACE-C, have begun to reveal ACE conformational dynamics, though they remain under-studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cozier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lubbe et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The extracellular domains of ACE are readily dimerized in the membrane-bound and soluble forms. Both the ACE-N and ACE-C domains within the ACE monomer are catalytically active and each has its own substrate preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Semis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2011</xref>). For example, ACE-N can convert Aβ1–42 to Aβ1–40, which is less amyloid fibril-prone than Aβ1–42 but ACE-C cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2009</xref>). Accumulating evidence supports a complicated interplay between ACE-N and ACE-C within the ACE dimer. Enzyme kinetics analysis suggests negative cooperativity between two catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binevski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rice et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Skirgello et al., 2005</xref>). However, ACE also exhibits positive synergy toward Aβ cleavage and allostery to enhance the activity of its binding partner, bradykinin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erdös et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, cryo-EM structures of soluble dimeric apo-sACE were reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lubbe et al., 2022</xref>; however, due to the poor resolution/denaturation of sACE-C, only full-length sACE monomer or dimeric sACE-N was reported yet the conformations preclude full-length sACE dimerization due to the severe steric crash between sACE-C domains. Here, we present four discrete cryo-EM structures of full-length human sACE that contain all four catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is followed by cryo-EM heterogeneity analysis and all-atom MD simulations. Together, our analyses provide structural insights into domain interactions, open-closed transitions of the catalytic domain, and conformational dynamics of soluble dimeric ACE.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM analysis of human sACE dimer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram for the key features of domain on primary sequence of human ACE.

Successive rounds of 2D classification were used to trim the particle number down to 577,123 particles. Ab initio reconstruction followed by heterogeneous refinement yielded a full sACE dimer map (214,893 particles), a map representing only the N/N dimer (268,471 particles), and 93,759 particles that mapped to an uninterpretable junk class. The particles mapping to the full-length sACE structure were then transferred to PCA-based 3D classification. 103,507 particles mapped to low-resolution partial structures that could not clearly be assigned structural significance and were discarded as junk. Of the remaining particles, 20,533 particles mapped to a three-domain sACE structure. The remaining 88,930 particles mapped to a full-length sACE structure that was refined to 3.65 Å (sACE-3.65).

After motion correction and CTF estimation, the dataset was trimmed to include only micrographs with a max CTF value lower than 4 Angstroms. The sACE-3.65 structure was used to generate 2D templates for particle picking. 10,708,232 particles were originally picked. This number was trimmed to 2,580,990 based on quality metrics and visual observation. The resulting particles were used in successive rounds of 2D classification to eliminate junk particles, reducing the particle count to 662,219. Ab initio reconstruction followed by heterogeneous refinement revealed four classes: 165,395 particles mapped to a class we interpret as the sACE-C/C dimer, 140,038 particles mapped to a class we interpret as the sACE-N/N dimer, 50,647 particles mapped to a 3-domain sACE class, and the remaining 306,139 particles mapped to a full-length sACE class. PCA-based 3D classification was used to eliminate junk particles, and the remaining ~170 k particles were refined with C2 symmetry to 2.8 Angstroms. The D1 domains in the C2 reconstruction displayed poor density, likely resulting from molecular motion, so a final round of 3D classification and refinement with C1 symmetry was performed to finalize three states of full-length sACE.

The sACE-C domain was shown to be less stable than the sACE-N domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voronov et al., 2002</xref>), so we hypothesized that repeated exposure to the air-water interface could cause preferential denaturation of sACE-C. We have previously shown that preferential denaturation of human PreP occurred in one of its two homologous domains and that faster vitrification using Chameleon significantly prevented such preferential denaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we collaborated with the National Center for CryoEM Access and Training (NCCAT) to prepare sACE grids using Chameleon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darrow et al., 2019</xref>). Chameleon preparation reduced the time the sample spends on the grid before freezing by more than 10-fold. We collected a new dataset of ~18,000 micrographs, and our 2D classification revealed a higher percentage of particles for four-domain classes than those prepared using the Vitrobot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, our 3D classification still showed the existence of structures of the sACE-N only dimer and those containing two sACE-N and one sACE-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This indicates that the reduction in vitrification time using Chameleon reduced but did not prevent preferential denaturation.</p><p>From these data, we obtained a map for a consensus ACE structure that achieved a resolution of 2.8 Å. However, while the core region showed excellent map quality, the map quality for the dynamic regions corresponding to the open-close transition of ACE catalytic domains was poor, suggesting multiple discrete conformational states exist. We thus performed 3D classification and reconstructed three distinct conformational states of full-length apo-ACE at resolutions of 2.99 Å, 3.05 Å, and 3.15 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2 fig1video3 fig1video4">Figure 1—videos 2–4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

These three subdomains in either sACE-N or sACE-C form a catalytic chamber. The catalytic zinc ion is coordinated by the canonical HEXXH motif residing in the D1b and D3b subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Four sACE dimer structures manifest as pseudo-symmetric C2 homodimers across the dimer interface.

We observed consistent, global agreement between our cryo-EM data and MD simulations, both with and without glycans present. This consistency is particularly noticeable in several key mobile regions (denoted 1–4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) that demonstrate high degrees of Cα displacement from our cryo-EM data along with correlating higher RMSF during subsets of our MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B and D</xref>). The RMSF variation between stable and mobile regions in our MD simulations is dampened, relative to the cryo-EM data when the entire trajectories were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, C and E</xref>). This is due to the open state regions closing relatively early in the simulation and remaining closed for the duration of the simulation. We then performed principal component analysis (PCA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) to compare our MD simulation data with our cryo-EM data. Both methods of analysis indicate that the conformational space sampled by our cryo-EM structures represents a fraction of the conformational space sampled by our MD simulations.</p><p>The dynamics observed in our MD simulations of sACE are highly complex, arising from a combination of both interdomain and intradomain motions. To summarize these simulations in simpler terms, individual sACE domains transition from a more open state to a closed state without reopening, while sACE-N/N and sACE-C/C primarily move relative to each other as rigid bodies. As outlined previously, PCA was employed to reduce the complexity of these motions and to identify dominant trends in conformational changes within the dataset. Visualizing the conformational changes captured by the principal component vectors in the MD simulations (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3 fig4video4">Figure 4—videos 3–4</xref>) revealed that the majority of conformational variability within the MD data is driven by substantial interdomain motion occurring between sACE-N/N and sACE-C/C. Consistent interdomain motion was observed along all principal component vectors, regardless of the presence or absence of intradomain motion. However, no principal components were identified that exclusively described significant intradomain motion without associated interdomain motion. The PCA further revealed that glycosylation significantly enhances the degree of interdomain motion in sACE, as evidenced by the glycosylated simulation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video4">Figure 4—video 4</xref>) compared to the non-glycosylated simulation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>). This suggests that glycosylated sACE exhibits greater global dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Notably, principal components 5 and 6 from the glycosylated MD simulations (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video4">Figure 4—video 4</xref>) highlight a striking difference, where sACE-N/N and sACE-C/C appear to move independently and exhibit a decoupled interaction. We postulate that this inter-domain motion may be the reason we observe preferential denaturation of sACE-C during cryo-EM grid preparation. The relatively harsh conditions that the protein is exposed to during the grid-making process may damage specific conformations of particles and subsequently restrict the amount of information that could be obtained solely from cryo-EM analysis. This highlights the importance of integrating multiple approaches to investigate protein dynamics.</p><p>The MD simulations of glycosylated sACE provide additional structural insights into the structure and functions of N-linked glycosylation of sACE. Glycosylation is shown to affect the folding, secretion, and stability of ACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kost et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sadhukhan and Sen, 1996</xref>). Our MD simulation reveals that the dynamics of 12 N-linked glycans cover a large surface area of sACE, shielding it from environmental insults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Consistent with observations from our Coulomb potential density maps and previously published data, we observed a substantial and persistent inter-subunit interaction between glycans from N82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). From RMSF analysis, glycosylation was found to increase the overall dynamicism of sACE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Furthermore, while there are N-linked glycans near the catalytic chamber, particularly those at the tip of D1a and D3a, they were highly dynamic and did not occlude access to the catalytic chamber. This is consistent with the observation that deglycosylation only modestly increases the enzymatic activity of ACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baudin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orth et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The comparison of sACE-N in its open and closed states reveals the structural basis for the open-to-closed transition of this domain. Our structures show that when the bottom of the D1a subdomain (region of interest 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) moves away from the D2 subdomain, resulting in the open state, the top of the D1a subdomain (region of interest 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) moves closer to the D2 subdomain, as if the helix were balanced upon a fulcrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Detailed structural analysis indicates that the fulcrum is primarily formed by the salt bridge between two highly conserved residues: E66 in the D1a subdomain and R108 in the D2 subdomain. To stabilize the open state, additional salt bridges are formed, with D189 in the D2 subdomain pairing with K73 in all cases and occasionally with R96 in the D1a subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The loss of this salt bridge in the closed state is compensated for by the formation of a network of van der Waals interactions between the D1a and D2 subdomains that stabilize the closed state. The closed state of sACE-C is also stabilized by a network of van der Waals contacts between the D3a and D4 subdomains. The transition between open and closed states is likely influenced by the binding of substrates and reaction products during the ACE catalytic cycle. Although a similar fulcrum mechanism is not evident in the sACE-C domain, the connection between the D3a and D2 subdomains would act as a lever to pivot sACE-C from the closed to the open state, and we speculate that this may form the structural basis for allosteric communication between sACE-N and sACE-C.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Structural mechanism of the sACE open/close transition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) sACE-N overlay comparing the open (left panel) and closed (right panel) states in detail.

In sACE-N, the D1a subdomain is at the N-terminal end of sACE, allowing for a greater range of motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), while the fulcrum and stabilization mechanisms can maintain sACE-N in a more widely open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Conversely, in sACE-C, the motion of the D3a subdomain is constrained by its connection to the D2 subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Additionally, there are sequence differences at the interface between the three subdomains of sACE-N and sACE-C. In the most closed state—the B chain sACE-C domain of the sACE-3.05 structure—residues from all three subdomains, including I649, V724, V926, and V927, form a hydrophobic latch that stabilizes the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The hydrophobic latch in sACE-N is weaker because the residue corresponding to V724 has been replaced with a threonine (T124; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These structural insights are supported by our RMSF analysis of our MD simulations and alpha carbon displacement analysis of our cryo-EM structures, which reveal a correlation between mobile regions and the ‘fulcrum’ mechanism of opening for sACE-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Furthermore, our slowest closing MD simulation revealed that the K73-D189 interaction was maintained for the entire time that sACE-N adopted an open conformation, yet this interaction was lost when sACE-N transitioned to the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>We also performed three MD simulations on the non-glycosylated sACE monomer (&gt;1 microsecond each) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We observed the expected intra-subdomain open-closed motions in sACE-N and sACE-C that were also observed in the simulations of ACE dimer. We also observed that the motion of sACE-C relative to sACE-N was significantly greater in our monomer simulations compared to our dimer simulations. This suggests that dimerization places significant constraints upon the conformational dynamics of sACE. Previous work has defined the conformational dynamics of sACE from cryo-EM data where both sACE-C domains were not resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang et al., 2022</xref>). Given our observations from the monomeric and dimeric MD simulations, we endeavored to understand the conformational heterogeneity present within our cryo-EM data to better understand the impact of dimerization on sACE dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cryo-EM heterogeneity analysis of sACE</title><p>Cryo-EM structures are ensemble averages of many aligned particle images. Recently, there have been many approaches developed to understand the particle heterogeneity present within a cryo-EM structure as a proxy for molecular motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). We employed three methods of heterogeneity analysis: cryoDRGN, RECOVAR, and 3D Variability Analysis (3DVA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Punjani and Fleet, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilles and Singer, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>). CryoDRGN employs neural networks to resolve structural heterogeneity in a nonlinear, multidimensional latent space, while RECOVAR and 3DVA both employ linear subspace methods. 3DVA finds the linear subspace by an alternating optimization scheme to capture image variations, while RECOVAR utilizes a regularized covariance estimator to identify subspaces that best capture the distribution of states.</p><p>We conducted this analysis and observed global agreement between the results of both of our datasets. As we observed substantial particle damage in our Vitrobot-prepared dataset, we thought it unwise to utilize that dataset for in-depth analysis and therefore, we focus on the larger and higher-resolution dataset collected at NCCAT below. For analysis, the entire particle set, prior to 3D classification and consisting of ~170 k particles, was utilized. The particle alignments from the same C1 consensus refinement were used as input for each of the three methods as current methods to investigate particle heterogeneity are highly dependent upon initial pose assignment of individual particles. Globally, all three methods agreed with our ensemble structures, in that the dominant source of structural variability within our particle population could be described by the open-closed transition of individual domains, and that sACE-N displayed more variability than sACE-C.</p><p>Initially, we performed 3D variability analysis (3DVA) in cryoSPARC to provide a direct comparison to the previously published analysis of the partial ACE cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Punjani and Fleet, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Trajectories were reconstructed along the top 5 principal components of variance (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the trajectory describing the variance along the first principal component vector suggests a dominant interdomain motion, where the sACE-N/N region bends towards the sACE-C/C region, similar to what we observed for trajectories along the top principal component vectors in analysis of our MD simulations (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3 fig4video4">Figure 4—videos 3–4</xref>), yet this variance is not reflected in our ensemble structures. The trajectories along the remaining principal component vectors comprise varying combinations of individual domains undergoing the open-close transition. Consistent with our previous observations, the range of presumptive motion in these trajectories is greater in sACE-N than sACE-C. Previous 3DVA performed on the sACE monomer structure revealed 4 types of potential motion, termed bending, pivoting, breathing, and jumping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lubbe et al., 2022</xref>). The breathing motion matches the open-close transition that dominates most of our principal component vectors, while the bending motion appears to correlate with the variance described by our top principal component vector. We did not observe any potential motions reminiscent of the jumping or pivoting motions in our 3DVA. Furthermore, the magnitude of the bending motion in our 3DVA is substantially less than previously reported for the partial dimeric sACE structure, which likely suffered from substantial denaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lubbe et al., 2022</xref>). Together, this highlights a significant difference in the conformational dynamics between our sACE dimer and previously reported cryo-EM structures. While there is disagreement between the 3DVA results for the two datasets, it should be noted that our MD simulations display a greater range of motion than either cryo-EM dataset offers, and the varieties of motion described previously are clearly observed within the PCA trajectories, especially when sACE is glycosylated (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video4">Figure 4—video 4</xref>). As mentioned above, this type of cryo-EM analysis is sensitive to artifacts introduced by particle damage and denaturation, underscoring the importance of preserving protein integrity via sample preparation and the use of Chameleon to reduce the exposure to air-water interface. This also suggests dimerization functions as a key constraint to the conformational dynamics of sACE.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM heterogeneity analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Visualization of the structural changes revealed by cryoSPARC 3DVA trajectories calculated along two principal components (PCs) of structural variance.

Trajectories generated along five principal component vectors of structural variance were dominated by the open-close transition, primarily in sACE-N (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>). We observed little variance in sACE-C and, unlike 3DVA, cryoDRGN did not reveal any substantial interdomain motions. Faced with this discrepancy between the 3DVA and cryoDRGN results, we employed a third method, RECOVAR, to further analyze our data. Similar to cryoDRGN, RECOVAR revealed that our data formed a singular cluster across multiple dimensions of analysis. Volumes representative of k-means cluster reconstructions were similarly consistent with our cryoDRGN results. RECOVAR indicated that the primary source of structural variance could be explained by the open-close transition, primarily of the sACE-N domains. With this in mind, we repeated the RECOVAR analysis with a focus mask around the sACE-N/N region. We then estimated the conformational density by deconvoluting the multidimensional latent space with a two-dimensional principal component analysis. The resulting density plot revealed four clusters that corresponded to different conformations of the sACE-N/N region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The most populous cluster corresponded to a state where both sACE-N subunits adopted an open conformation. The second largest cluster, and the smallest cluster, corresponded to a state where one sACE-N was open and the other was closed. The discrepancy in population size between these clusters is likely due to bias in the initial particle orientation, rather than a subunit-specific preference for the open state. As the O/C state and the C/O state are 180 degree rotations of each other, particle assignment to either cluster is likely influenced by the initial particle orientation of the complete dimer, and we currently lack the data to discern any allosteric implication to the orientation assignment. The final cluster corresponded to a state where both sACE-N subunits adopted the closed conformation. We then used RECOVAR to generate a trajectory through the latent space to predict a potential transition pathway from the closed-closed state to the open-open state (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3">Figure 6—video 3</xref>). This trajectory revealed that one subunit would open, followed by the second, and raised the question of potential allostery or coordinated motion between the adjacent sACE-N domains.</p><p>To investigate coordination between the sACE-N domains, we performed 3D classification in cryoSPARC with a focus mask on a single sACE-N domain and requested two classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The particles were split roughly evenly between the two classes, one resulting in an open state and the other being closed. We then used these classes for another round of 3D classification with a focus mask on the opposite sACE-N domain and again asked for two classes. Again, these particles were split roughly evenly among the classes, leaving us with four similarly sized classes adopting the same conformations as the clusters revealed by RECOVAR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our cryo-EM and MD simulations analysis of the extracellular regions of dimeric ACE (sACE) offers insights into the stability of sACE catalytic domains. We show that the sACE dimer interface consists of three major components, protein-protein interfaces between sACE-N, glycan-glycan interaction between sACE-N, and protein-protein interface between sACE-C. The interface between sACE-N, in general, is 50% larger and has higher numbers of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges than that between sACE-C. The necessity for the stronger interaction between sACE-N is likely due to the fact that sACE-N is distal to the transmembrane helix so that the additional reinforcement is required. The weaker interaction and lack of contribution from glycans in the interface between sACE-C could also contribute to the observed preferential denaturation of sACE-C despite the high structural similarity between sACE-N and sACE-C. The denaturation is likely due to the exposure to air-water interface during vitrification, a common issue in single particle cryo-EM analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glaeser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noble et al., 2018</xref>). We have partially overcome the denaturation issue of sACE-C by optimizing the buffer pH to increase the melting temperature and using the faster plunging time during vitrification afforded by Chameleon to reduce the exposure to air-water interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, we did not completely prevent the preferential denature of sACE-C during vitrification.</p><p>ACE is part of a family of proteases capable of effectively degrading Aβ. This family includes M16 metalloproteases like IDE and PreP, and M13 metalloproteases such as neprilysin and endothelin converting enzyme. Integrative structural analysis has demonstrated how IDE employs conformational dynamics, charge, and secondary structure complementarity to selectively capture peptide substrates into its sizable catalytic chamber, subsequently unfolding and degrading amyloidogenic peptides such as insulin and Aβ, without degrading structurally similar yet non-amyloidogenic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang, 2016</xref>). The other mentioned enzymes also belong to this group of chamber-containing proteases, known as cryptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liang et al., 2021</xref>). Similar to cryptidases, structural analysis reveals that ACE must undergo an open-closed transition to capture, engulf, and degrade its oligopeptide substrates, such as angiotensin 1 and bradykinin.</p><p>Our apo-sACE structures and MD simulations identify a fulcrum mechanism that governs the open-closed transition of sACE-N, while the interplay between sACE-N and the D3a domain likely plays a crucial role in the corresponding transition in sACE-C. Analogous to how the binding of MB60, a PreP inhibitor, to the hydrophobic pocket triggers the open to closed transition, factors such as binding of substrates and ACE inhibitors may alter the balance, leading to the regulation of ACE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang et al., 2022</xref>). We also observe that the catalytic pocket of each sACE catalytic domain is not large enough to engulf the entire Aβ. Additionally, the distances between the domains (sACE-N to sACE-C, sACE-N to sACE-N, or sACE-C to sACE-C) are too large for these domains to bind Aβ simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, ACE likely employs a different mechanism from IDE and PreP to selectively bind and degrade Aβ. Future integrative structural studies await to reveal how ACE selectively recognizes and degrades a diverse array of substrates.</p><p>Globally, we observed that sACE-N is both more open and more dynamic than sACE-C in the absence of substrate. We speculate that the increased dynamicism of sACE-N may be due to a weakening of the hydrophobic latch region relative to sACE-C, which renders the closed state more thermodynamically favorable in sACE-C, along with increased stabilization of the sACE-N open state through the fulcrum mechanism described above. These factors result in sACE-N demonstrating a preference for the open state, while sACE-C appears to prefer the closed state, in the absence of substrate. The preference of sACE-C towards the closed state may explain why it displays a greater catalytic activity compared to sACE-N for substrates such as angiotensin-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The difference in dynamics between sACE-N and sACE-C also offers new pathways forward in the development of domain-specific inhibitors to better modulate ACE function. The fulcrum-associated region centered on the K73-D189 interaction stands out as a promising new druggable target to modulate the openness of sACE-N independent of sACE-C. Additionally, given the range in size of ACE substrates, that is amyloid β (42 residues) vs bradykinin/angiotensin-I (9/10 residues), it is likely that the openness of individual ACE domains functions as a key mediating step in substrate recognition and altering the open-to-close dynamics of ACE domains may prove an effective strategy to modulate ACE activity towards specific subsets of substrates. These insights come with the caveat that they are derived from the apo-state dynamics of sACE, and it remains unknown how sACE dynamics are influenced by the presence of substrate. Studies in the presence of substrate will be especially vital in exploring potential mechanisms of ACE allostery.</p><p>The interplay between ACE-N and ACE-C within the ACE dimer has complicated consequences for ACE function, showing negative cooperativity for enzymatic activities while exhibiting positive synergy in Aβ cleavage by ACE-N and activity at the bradykinin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binevski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rice et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Skirgello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erdös et al., 2010</xref>). Understanding the conformational dynamics in both inter- and intradomain motions of the extracellular regions of the ACE dimer holds promise for designing ACE modulators to improve and broaden the therapeutic use of ACE modulation. Our cryo-EM heterogeneity analysis of sACE alone has revealed coordinated yet complicated pattern of open-closed transitions across four catalytic domains using cryoDRGN and cryoSPARC 3DVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1 fig6video2">Figure 6—videos 1–2</xref>). RECOVAR analysis further illustrates the distribution of open-closed states within the sACE-N dimer and the potential pathways for such transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Additionally, focused classification using cryoSPARC suggests no bias in the conformational state of sACE-N within a dimer, irrespective of the state of its counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Altogether, these findings establish a framework for understanding how the complex open-closed transitions within the four catalytic domains of the sACE dimer contribute to its allosteric behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binevski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rice et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Skirgello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erdös et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>3DVA, cryoDRGN, and RECOVAR all appeared to display varying degrees of coordinated motion between sACE domains. However, this type of analysis lacks an explicit time component, so it is not possible to draw concrete conclusions regarding coordinated motion. Likewise, while MD simulations contain an explicit time factor, most of our MD simulations closed quickly and did not reopen. While we observed an apparent association between intradomain and interdomain motion in our PCA (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3 fig4video4">Figure 4—videos 3–4</xref>), the analysis removes time dependency. Furthermore, the aforementioned allostery of ACE was observed under the condition where substrate is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binevski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Skirgello et al., 2005</xref>). Complicating matters further, this conformational heterogeneity appears to stem partially from subtle yet significant conformational differences between the two chains within an ACE dimer and the inability of cryoSPARC to accurately align these conformationally distinct chains, likely due to particle pseudo-symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, CryoDRGN and RECOVAR revealed smaller magnitudes of potential interdomain motions than cryoSPARC 3DVA, and they were often accompanied by various combinations of individual domains opening and/or closing. This suggests that the apparent discrepancy in the magnitude of inferred interdomain motion could be a result of the different theoretical approaches of dimensionality reduction and trajectory generation employed by the respective methods of analysis and underscores the importance of incorporating multiple methods of analysis in the absence of a singular ‘gold-standard’ of heterogeneity analysis. Conversely, it is possible that the interpretation of any potential interdomain motion is complicated by the preferential denaturation of sACE-C. PCA of our MD simulations revealed the dominant source of motion to be alterations in the position of sACE-C/C relative to sACE-N/N. We speculate that many of these relative orientations cannot tolerate the rigors of the cryo-EM grid-making process and may be the source of the observed preferential denaturation of sACE-C. Future studies will need to focus on cryo-EM analysis of ACE in the presence of substrates, ideally using data in which partial denaturation is substantially minimized.</p><p>Single particle cryo-EM holds promise for revealing the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules from embedded heterogeneity. Consequently, cryo-EM heterogeneity analysis is an active and rapidly evolving field providing insights into the conformational dynamics and allostery of macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). However, many challenges exist in using cryo-EM heterogeneity analysis due, in part, to the low signal-to-noise ratio in observed micrographs. Often, these analyses address questions difficult or impossible to tackle experimentally, leaving no ground truth for validation. We encounter such challenges in our heterogeneity analysis as well. Consistent with our single particle cryo-EM structural analysis, we observed the expected intradomain open-closed transition using cryoDRGN, cryoSPARC 3DVA, RECOVAR, and all-atom MD simulation. Surprisingly, we did not observe such motion using cryoSPARC 3DFlex, a neural network-based method analyzing our cryo-EM data of sACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Punjani and Fleet, 2023</xref>). Central to the working of cryoSPARC 3Dflex is the generation of a tetrahedral mesh used to calculate deformations within the particle population. Proper generation of the mesh is critical for obtaining useful results and must often be determined empirically. Despite several attempts, we were unable to obtain results from 3Dflex comparable to what we observed with our other methods. Even using the results from our 3DVA as prior input to 3Dflex, the largest conformational change we observed was a slight wiggling at the bottom of the D3a subdomain (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video4">Figure 6—video 4</xref>). The authors of 3Dflex note that 3Dflex struggles to model intricate motions, and the implementation of custom tetrahedral meshes currently requires a non-cyclical fusion strategy between mesh segments. Given these limitations, and the complexity of sACE conformational dynamics, it appears that sACE, as a system, is not well-suited to analysis via 3Dflex in its current implementation. Similarly, MDSPACE holds tremendous promise as a method for investigating conformational dynamics from cryo-EM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vuillemot et al., 2023</xref>). MDSPACE integrates cryo-EM particle data with short MD simulations to fit atomic models into each particle image through an iterative process which extracts dynamic information. However, the lack of GPU-enabled processing for MDSPACE requires either a dedicated computational setup that diverges from most other cryo-EM software, or access to a CPU-based supercomputer, which severely limits the accessibility of such software. Despite these challenges, both 3Dflex and MDSPACE use promising approaches to study protein conformational dynamics. We look forward to exploring effective methods to incorporate these strategies into our future research.</p><p>Advances in single-particle cryo-EM analysis have enabled detailed structural examination of the sACE dimer. Beyond its implications for future drug discovery efforts aimed at enhancing ACE-based therapies, sACE can serve as a valuable model of a multi-domain glycoprotein for studying methods to preserve sample integrity, particularly due to the high propensity of sACE-C to denature during vitrification. Furthermore, considering the aforementioned challenges and caveats, we propose that, due to its size, biomedical importance, and the complexity of its motions, sACE also represents an excellent model system for evaluating and improving cryo-EM heterogeneity analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression of human sACE</title><p>Human 293T and 293 F cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-3216) and Thermo Fisher (R79007), respectively. Cell lines were subjected to re-authentication on a regular basis to ensure no cross-contamination. All cells are routinely screened for the presence of mycoplasma using the ATCC Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Catalogue # 30–1012 K). These cells were maintained in DMEM +10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The lentiviral plasmid for the expression of the extracellular domain of human ACE (sACE, aa 1–1235) that contains a 6-histidine tag at its C-terminus was made by Vectorbuilder and co-transfected with helper plasmids to human 293T cells for lentiviral production. Human 293 F cells were infected with the resulting virus and selected for stable sACE expression. 293 F that stably expressed sACE grew poorly in Free-style 293 media (ThermoFisher 12338018). Thus, for ACE production, 293 F cells that stably expressed sACE were first grown in DMEM +10% FCS at 37 °C and gradually shifted into Free-style 293 media by reducing FCS by first in Free-style 293 media +2% FCS and then to media without FCS.

Excess sample was blotted for 1 s, blot force 2, and grids were plunge frozen in liquid ethane. All images were acquired using a Titan Krios microscope (FEI) operated at 300 KeV with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector. A dataset of ~3600 micrographs was collected at The University of Chicago Advanced Electron Microscopy facility.

Several rounds of 2D classification were used to remove junk particles.~577 K particles were processed in successive rounds of <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction and heterogeneous refinement. sACE grids were also prepared using Chameleon and collected a dataset of ~19,000 micrographs at the National Center for Cryo-EM Access and Training. For those, Quantifoil Active R 1.6/0.9 Cu/Rh 300 was coated with gold using a Safematic CCU-010 Compact Coating Unit. Briefly, grids were placed nanowire side down on a glass slide, gold disks were sputtered with a 35 nm target thickness at 1.5x10<sup>–2</sup> Torr, and a process current of 30 mA. Grids were glow discharged with air at 12 mA for 80 s using the internal Chameleon glow discharger. The grids were plunged at 160–180 ms. All images were acquired using a Titan Krios microscope (FEI) operated at 300 KeV with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector (Gatan).

This dataset was processed in cryoSPARC version 4.5.1 and 4.6.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Briefly, templates were generated from our full-length ACE structure described above using vitrobot-prepared grids. Micrographs with a CTF fit resolution worse than 4 Å were removed from the dataset, leaving ~12,000 micrographs for template picking, which yielded 10.7 million particles. The particle set was trimmed to ~2.8 million based on quality metrics, particles were extracted with a box size of 256 pixels and run through 2 rounds of 2D classification, reducing the particle number to ~660,000. 2D classes were dominated by 4 domain views and yielded a much greater diversity of views, indicating that Chameleon preparation produced a dramatic improvement in particle quality. Initial 3D homogeneous refinement reached 3.6 Å, matching the previous final structure. Four maps from 3D classes that contain all four catalytic domains of ACE, one from particles derived from grids prepared by using vitrobot and three from those prepared by using Chameleon, were used for structure building using Chimera and Coot, and the structure was refined using Phenix real space refinement.

Initially, cryoSPARC 3DVA was performed on both the NCCAT- and UChicago-collected datasets, and results were found to be consistent, so the NCCAT-collected dataset was used for further analysis, given its higher particle number and quality. Input particle poses for each method of heterogeneity analysis were derived from the same C1 refinement job in cryoSPARC, which reached 2.88 Å. 3DVA was used to solve the top 5 modes of variance with a filter resolution of 6 Å. Particles were downsampled to a box size of 128 pixels in cryoDRGN 3.3.1 to speed up processing. The same downsampled particle set was used for both cryoDRGN and RECOVAR. CryoDRGN was run with default parameters and the analysis was performed on the top 5 principal components for direct comparison to cryoSPARC 3DVA. RECOVAR pipeline.py was initially run on the full sACE structure. Reconstructions representative of k-means cluster centers revealed the dominant source of structural variability to be the open-close transition in sACE-N. As a result, RECOVAR was run again with a focus mask on sACE-N/N and a zdim = 4. Conformational density was estimated with a two-dimensional PCA, and an index value of 3 was chosen for further analysis. The points in latent space representing the top 12 stable conformational states were estimated from the top 20% of particles and representative volumes were generated. The generated states populated four clusters, and the 12 states were simplified to 4 distinct conformations where sACE-N/N adopted the open-open (OO), open-closed (OC), closed-open (CO), and closed-closed (CC) states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

ACE is a protease capable of effectively degrading Aβ. The four structures are C2 pseudo-symmetric homodimers and provide insight into sACE dimerization. These structures were obtained using discrete classification in cryoSPARC and show different combinations of open, intermediate, and closed states of the catalytic domains, resulting in varying degrees of solvent accessibility to the active sites.</p><p>To deepen the understanding of the gradient of heterogeneity (from closed to open states) observed with discrete classification, the authors performed all-atom MD simulations and continuous conformational analysis of cryo-EM data using cryoSPARC 3DVA, cryoDRGN, and RECOVAR. cryoDRGN and cryoSPARC 3DVA revealed coordinated open-closed transitions across four catalytic domains, whereas RECOVAR revealed independent motion of two ACE-N domains, also observed with cryoSPARC focused classification. The authors suggest that the discrepancy in the results of the different methods for continuous conformational analysis in cryo-EM could results from different approaches used for dimensionality reduction and trajectory generation in these methods.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an important study that shows, for the first time, the structure and the snapshots of the dynamics of the full-length sACE dimer.

This moves forward the structural understanding of ACE, as previous analysis yielded partially denatured or individual ACE domains. By performing a heterogeneity analysis, the authors identify three structural conformations (open, intermediate open, and closed) that define the openness of the catalytic chamber and structural features governing the dimerization interface. They show that the dimer interface of soluble ACE consists of an N-terminal glycan and protein-protein interaction regions, as well as C-terminal protein-protein interactions. Further heterogeneity mining and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations show structural rearrangements that lead to the opening and closing of the catalytic pocket, which could explain how ACE binds its substrate. These studies could contribute to future drug design targeting the active site or dimerization interface of ACE.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors make significant efforts to address ACE denaturation on cryo-EM grids, testing various buffers and grid preparation techniques. These strategies successfully reduce denaturation and greatly enhance the quality of the structural analysis. The integration of cryoDRGN, 3DVA, RECOVAR, and all-atom simulations for heterogeneity analysis proves to be a powerful approach, further strengthening the overall experimental methodology.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>No weaknesses noted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106044.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mancl</surname><given-names>Jordan M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Xiaoyang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Minglei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Wei-Jen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><p>We would like to thank you and your chosen reviewers for the diligent work and insightful comments.

The negative values occur because this display shows the difference in RMSF values from the MD simulations of glycosylated versus non-glycosylated ACE. To avoid similar confusion, we have split Figure S12 into three panels. Panels A and B show the RMSF values for each residue in the glycosylated and non-glycosylated sACE MD simulations, respectively, and all values here are positive. Panel C (the original Figure S12) now includes expanded labeling to clarify that it depicts the difference in RMSF values between the presence and absence of glycans. In this panel, a negative value indicates that the residues exhibit higher RMSF in simulations where glycans are present. The figure legend has been revised to accurately describe the updated figure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
