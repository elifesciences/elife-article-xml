Following collision with a RFB, replication proteins can dissociate from the stalled fork (fork collapse) rendering it incapable of further DNA synthesis unless recombination intervenes to restart replication. We use time-lapse microscopy and genetic assays to show that recombination is initiated within ∼10 min of replication fork blockage at a site-specific barrier in fission yeast, leading to a restarted fork within ∼60 min, which is only prevented/curtailed by the arrival of the opposing replication fork. The restarted fork is susceptible to further collapse causing hyper-recombination downstream of the barrier. Surprisingly, in our system fork restart is unnecessary for maintaining cell viability. Seemingly, the risk of failing to complete replication prior to mitosis is sufficient to warrant the induction of recombination even though it can cause deleterious genetic change.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04539.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04539.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04539.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a cell can divide to form two new cells, it must duplicate its DNA to ensure the newly formed cells have the same genetic information as the original. This genetic material is made up of two single strands of DNA that are paired to form a double-stranded helix. Certain groups of proteins separate these two DNA strands to form a two-pronged structure known as a ‘replication fork’. This occurs at different points along the length of the DNA double helix. Groups of proteins then travel down the DNA strands, separating them as they go, and using them as templates for making copies of the DNA.</p><p>DNA replication is finally completed when different replication forks meet and merge. This process does not always occur smoothly because some regions of DNA contain obstacles that impede the movement of the replication machinery. In most cases, the replication proteins briefly stall and then restart. However, occasionally the machinery can fall off the DNA; this event is known as a ‘replication fork collapse’.</p><p>Nguyen et al. have now used a method called time-lapse microscopy to visualise this process inside a species of yeast—called fission yeast—as it occurs in real time. Fission yeast's genetic material is known to contain a specific site that blocks the replication machinery. Nguyen et al. found that a protein called Rad52 arrives at this specific site within 10 minutes of a replication fork being blocked. This protein enables recovery of the replication fork within an hour via a process known as ‘DNA recombination’.</p><p>Nguyen et al. also unexpectedly found that the restarted fork is susceptible to further collapse. It is known from previous work that the mechanisms that repair broken DNA and rescue replication forks can also introduce errors into the DNA. This implies that if fork collapse occurs frequently, it can lead to the introduction of numerous errors that can be detrimental to cells. Thus, the rescue of fork collapse is like a double-edged sword; it is required for replication to proceed, but can lead to genetic changes inside cells. The failure to faithfully replicate genetic material drives the development of diseases such as cancer. Therefore, insights gained from Nguyen et al.'s findings may provide an improved understanding of how genetic alterations occur in both normal and cancerous cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04539.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04539.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>replication fork barrier</kwd><kwd>replication restart</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>090767/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitby</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Homologous recombination is the default response to replication impedance by the <italic>RTS1</italic> barrier, leading to restarted replication forks that suffer frequent collapse, triggering further rounds of recombination downstream of the barrier.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The completion of eukaryotic DNA replication relies on the merging of replication forks that emanate from multiple origins distributed along each chromosome. The failure of even one pair of replication forks to merge results in a region of unreplicated DNA, which can lead to chromosome missegregation and/or DNA breakage during mitosis, and ultimately genomic changes that can drive the development of diseases such as cancer.</p><p>The progression of replication forks, from origin to point of merging, is frequently hindered by obstacles in and on the DNA template, including various DNA lesions and protein–DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lambert and Carr, 2013</xref>). In many cases, these cause only a transient stalling of replication during which the replication proteins (replisome) remain engaged with the DNA by a fork protection mechanism mediated by the intra-S-phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Errico and Costanzo, 2012</xref>). However, the replisome can sometimes dissociate to produce a collapsed fork, which may also be associated with breakage of the DNA, and this is especially prevalent following oncogene activation in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halazonetis et al., 2008</xref>). Homologous recombination (HR) can restore fork integrity and restart replication, via a process termed break-induced replication (BIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costantino et al., 2014</xref>). BIR has mainly been studied in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> away from the context of DNA replication, using systems that generate a site-specific DNA double-strand break (DSB) that is repaired by recombination with a donor DNA molecule containing sequence homology to only one side of the break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2013</xref>). It is, therefore, unclear to what extent these studies reflect how recombination acts to repair stalled and broken replication forks during S-phase.</p><p>In BIR, the DSB is resected to generate a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail, which is bound firstly by Replication Protein A (RPA) and then Rad52. Rad52 mediates the subsequent loading of Rad51, which catalyses the key steps of homologous DNA pairing and strand invasion to form a displacement (D) loop. The 3' end of the invading DNA strand primes DNA synthesis by polymerase δ, and replication then proceeds in a conservative manner involving migration of the D-loop, dependent on the Pif1 DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to other modes of DSB repair by HR, the initial steps of BIR from DSB resection to strand invasion occur within ∼30 min of DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hicks et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the transition from strand invasion to DNA replication is delayed for several hours by a checkpoint that senses whether both ends of the DSB can engage with the same donor DNA sequence in a manner that is productive for completing repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malkova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jain et al., 2009</xref>). However, once initiated DNA synthesis proceeds at a rate of 3–4 kb/min, which is comparable with normal DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malkova et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Unlike normal DNA replication, BIR is highly error-prone with greatly increased rates of polymerase errors that remain uncorrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deem et al., 2011</xref>). There are also frequent dissociations of the elongating strand from the D-loop within a 10 kb window downstream of the DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stafa et al., 2014</xref>), which results in multiple rounds of strand re-invasion increasing the risk of recombination between ectopic homologous DNA sequences that can give rise to gross chromosome rearrangements and copy-number variations. This feature of BIR is thought to reflect an inherent drive to repair the DSB by synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). However, beyond 10 kb the D-loop appears to be stabilized, and BIR proceeds without the continual interruption of D-loop dissociation.</p><p>Whilst it is clear that a broken replication fork requires HR for DNA repair, it is less certain that it would be needed at a collapsed, yet unbroken, fork where replication could be completed most simply by convergence with the opposing fork. However, replication fork collapse at a site-specific protein–DNA fork barrier called <italic>RTS1</italic>, in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, has been shown to provoke DSB-independent recombination-dependent replication (RDR), which is required for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lambert et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2010</xref>). Similar to BIR, <italic>RTS1</italic>-induced RDR is error-prone, at least within the first 2.4 kb downstream of the barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iraqui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mizuno et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is unknown whether it suffers the same tendency for D-loop dissociation as BIR. It also remains unclear whether recombination is a default response to replication fork blockage at <italic>RTS1</italic>, how quickly it initiates, and whether it only plays a role in restart at the blocked fork, or is also needed to promote fork merging.</p><p>To address these questions, we have used time-lapse microscopy to obtain single-cell resolution of RDR in response to replication fork blockage at <italic>RTS1</italic>, in combination with genetic assays to assess restarted fork fidelity. We show that Rad52 is recruited to <italic>RTS1</italic> in the majority of cells within minutes of fork blockage and seemingly gives rise to RDR without the long delay in progressing from strand invasion to DNA synthesis that is characteristic of BIR. However, like BIR the restarted fork is prone to multiple rounds of strand disengagement and reengagement, implying that even at a blocked replication fork during S-phase the default response is to attempt SDSA. Unlike BIR, this continues for more than 10 kb downstream of the barrier with little sign of abating, giving rise to a dramatic increase in recombination in this region. We also find that fork convergence, rather than inducing recombination, acts to prevent or curtail it. Surprisingly, despite the high frequency of the recombination response and contrary to previous reports, we find no evidence that it is required for cell viability. Seemingly, the risk of failing to complete DNA replication in a timely fashion is sufficient to warrant the initiation of RDR as a default response to replication fork collapse, even though in many cases it may be unnecessary and even cause deleterious genetic change.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental system</title><p>We have previously shown that replication fork blockage at the replication terminator sequence <italic>RTS1</italic> is sufficient to induce HR between a direct repeat of <italic>ade6</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> heteroalleles in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>RTS1</italic> is a unidirectional replication fork barrier (RFB), which consists of cis-acting DNA sequence elements and trans-acting factors including the myb domain-containing protein Rtf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Codlin and Dalgaard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eydmann et al., 2008</xref>). Replication of the <italic>ade6</italic> locus is essentially unidirectional due to the relative position of replication origins that flank it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consequently, only one orientation of <italic>RTS1</italic> causes replication fork blockage at this site, which we will refer to as the active orientation (AO). The opposite orientation, which does not block replication, will be referred to as the inactive orientation (IO). Native two dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis analysis of replication intermediates in an EcoNI fragment containing <italic>RTS1</italic> confirms that <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> strongly blocks replication forks, whereas <italic>RTS1-IO</italic> does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

that Rad52 restarts replication at <italic>RTS1</italic> (positioned at the <italic>ura4</italic> locus and under inducible Rtf1 control) includes the observation that there is more fork convergence at the barrier in a <italic>rad52∆</italic> mutant than in wild type, as judged by the accumulation of double Y-shaped DNA molecules on 2D gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>). However, in previous work from our laboratory, we failed to detect such an increase at <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> suggesting that RDR does not occur at appreciable levels in our experimental system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorenz et al., 2009</xref>). The method of DNA extraction for 2D gel analysis can have a significant effect on the ability to detect different types of replication intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liberi et al., 2006</xref>). Our standard protocol is based on mechanical cell disruption to extract nuclei, DNA purification by caesium chloride density gradient centrifugation, and enrichment for replication intermediates on benzoylated napthoylated DEAE (BND) cellulose columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorenz et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambert et al. (2010)</xref> enzymatically lyse cells embedded in agarose plugs prior to enrichment of replication intermediates on BND cellulose. To determine whether these differences could account for our failure to detect an increase in converging forks, we compared replication intermediates in the EcoNI fragment containing <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> from wild-type and a <italic>rad51∆ rad52∆</italic> double mutant using the same protocol of DNA extraction as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambert et al. (2010)</xref>. A <italic>rad51∆ rad52∆</italic> double mutant was used instead of a <italic>rad52∆</italic> single mutant because of the latter's susceptibility to acquire suppressor mutations that enable Rad51 to catalyse HR in the absence of Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osman et al., 2005</xref>). Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambert et al.

However, the reduction in large Ys was even greater (∼sixfold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), such that their ratio to double Ys decreased more than threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data indicate that Rad52 plays an important role in promoting replication past <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>. We suspect that a <italic>rad51∆ rad52</italic>∆ mutant fails to manifest an increase in double Y-shaped molecules because the effect of an increased frequency of fork convergence at <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> is offset by a faster rate of fork merging, due to the absence of recombination proteins that could impede this process.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04539.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Recombination proteins are needed for replication past <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 2D gel analysis of replication intermediates in the EcoNI fragment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

The later appearance of Rad52 foci at <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> that is observed in many cells (ranging mainly from 30 to 55 min post-anaphase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), likely reflects the later blockage of forks that emanate from more distal origins (i.e., <italic>ori-1338</italic>, <italic>ori-1342</italic>, and <italic>ori-1371</italic>), which would arrive at the barrier from 7.7 to 18.5 min after the start of S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

However, as these estimates are based on images taken every 5 min, we cannot be certain that Rad52 does not dissociate and then re-associate with the site in between points of image acquisition. The percentage of cells with PCNA foci begins to decline approximately 40–45 min after anaphase (i.e., 30–35 min after the start of S-phase) and by 70 min they are detectable in less than 20% of all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

By comparing the timings of when Rad52 co-localizes with <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI with those when PCNA foci are detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), we conclude that in most cells Rad52's association with <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> ends before the disappearance of PCNA foci, that is, during S-phase or early G2-phase. Indeed, when Rad52-YFP and CFP-PCNA are imaged simultaneously, the co-localization of Rad52 with <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI terminates before the disappearance of PCNA foci in ∼71% of cells with <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

If forks emanating from this origin prevent and curtail HR at <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>, then there should be an increase in both the frequency and duration of Rad52 foci co-localizing with <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI. Indeed, this is exactly what we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The percentage of <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>-containing cells exhibiting a Rad52 focus co-localizing with <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI increased from ∼60 to ∼80%, and the average duration of these foci increased from 3.4 time points (12 to &lt;17 min) to 5.8 (24 to &lt;29 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Together, these data indicate that recombination operates in the interval between fork blockage and convergence, and if this is too short there will be insufficient time for recombination proteins to act. Moreover, we can conclude that fork convergence is capable of terminating ongoing recombination and does not itself normally induce HR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Restarted replication forks suffer frequent collapse and further rounds of recombination</title><p>Replication forks restarted following blockage at <italic>RTS1</italic> are prone to perform a U-turn at small inverted repeats positioned within 2.4 kb downstream of the barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mizuno et al., 2013</xref>).

More than 80% of these recombinants are deletions; however, gene conversions also increase substantially by ∼89-fold over spontaneous levels. This is significant because, unlike deletions that can be formed without Rad51, gene conversions depend on Rad51 catalysing the invasion of a donor duplex by a homologous ssDNA tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorenz et al., 2009</xref>).

Importantly, in wild-type cells breakage of forks blocked at <italic>RTS1</italic> is not a frequent event and therefore cannot account for the recruitment of Rad52 in the majority of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mizuno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>). Additional evidence that fork breakage is an uncommon event at <italic>RTS1</italic> comes from unpublished data showing that replication fork breakage induced by a site-specific single-strand break, placed at the same position as <italic>RTS1</italic>, causes a quite different frequency of recombinants in a <italic>rad51∆</italic> mutant than <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>.

This is broadly in line with the kinetics of Rad52 focus formation following exposure of cells to γ-irradiation, which occurs within 30 min of break formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlow and Rothstein, 2009</xref>). However, it takes a further 40 min for DNA synthesis to start, which suggests that the assembly of the replication machinery is quite slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hicks et al., 2011</xref>). In the case of BIR, DNA synthesis is delayed even longer (a further 2–4 hr) by a recombination execution checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malkova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jain et al., 2009</xref>). We estimate that Rad52-YFP focus formation can occur as early as 7.4–12.4 min after replication fork blockage at <italic>RTS1</italic>, which is comparable with the kinetics of DSB repair in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, bearing in mind that Rad52 precedes Rad51 in loading onto RPA-coated ssDNA. It is likely that the blocked replication fork would need to undergo remodelling, including DNA strand resection, prior to Rad52 recruitment and therefore RDR probably initiates even earlier.</p><p>Although we have not directly measured the timings of the next phases of RDR (i.e., strand invasion and DNA synthesis), we can estimate an upper limit for the total time that these would take based on the heightened direct repeat recombination at sites A and B downstream of <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> being an indicator of restarted fork progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our observation that deleting <italic>ori-1253</italic> dramatically increases recombinant frequency at site B indicates that progression of the restarted fork is constrained by fork convergence. Therefore, the fact that we detect recombination at sites A and B means that some restarted forks reach these sites before the opposing fork emanating from one of the four centromere proximal origins (assuming that at least one of these origins fires in every cell cycle) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The most distant of these origins (<italic>ori-1141</italic>) lies ∼186 kb away from site A and ∼174 kb away from site B, which means that RDR would have up to ∼60 min from the point of fork blockage at <italic>RTS1</italic> to reach these sites, assuming a normal replication fork velocity of 3 kb/min and similar firing times for the origins that flank the RFB. Based on these estimates, it would appear that the overall temporal kinetics of RFB-induced RDR in <italic>S. pombe</italic> are either similar or faster than those of DSB-induced HR at the mating-type locus in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and much faster than BIR, presumably due to the absence of a recombination execution checkpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A hypothetical model for RFB-induced RDR</title><p>We have previously proposed that reversal of the collapsed replication fork together with strand resection would generate a ssDNA tail onto which RPA, Rad52, and Rad51 would sequentially load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

Previous studies have shown that RFB-induced RDR is prone to template slippage/switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iraqui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mizuno et al., 2013</xref>), and based on our work we can conclude that a major part of this infidelity must derive from an instability of the restarted fork, which enables the frequent engagement of HR proteins such as Rad51 that can then catalyse ectopic recombination. We suspect that this is because mechanistically RFB-induced RDR is similar to BIR involving a migrating bubble or D-loop at which conservative replication occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). One key difference, however, is that the invading DNA strand may remain connected to the reversed fork structure from where it originated. Lagging strand synthesis would convert the reversed fork into a fully ligated four-way DNA/Holliday junction, which could branch migrate behind the D-loop. This might be advantageous during convergence with a normal replication fork, which could drive dissociation of the D-loop through the action of the replisome's accessory DNA helicase Pfh1 translocating on the lagging template strand, thereby converting the restarted 'fork' back into a reversed fork at which fork merging could occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In contrast, early resolution of the Holliday junction could result in a one-ended DSB during fork convergence and even a failure of fork termination leading to over-replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04539.020</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model for RFB-induced RDR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RDR initiates within 10 minutes of replication fork blockage at <italic>RTS1</italic> and gives rise to a restarted fork within 60 min.

For example, any impedance of the D-loop's migration might result in the Holliday junction ‘catching up’ with it, driving its dissociation and thereby reforming a reversed fork. This would allow the reloading of HR proteins, which could then catalyse ectopic recombination at sites distant from the original RFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). The high frequency of ectopic recombination downstream of the RFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) suggests that dissociation of the putative migrating D-loop within <italic>ade6-M375</italic> frequently gives rise to strand invasion of <italic>ade6-L469</italic>. The high proportion of deletions suggests that the newly established D-loop tends to migrate beyond <italic>ade6-L469</italic> rather than dissociating a second time to trigger the possibility of re-invasion into <italic>ade6-M375</italic> and the formation of a <italic>ade6</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> gene conversion. The extended tracks of Rad52 focus co-localization with <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI, which are especially prevalent in <italic>ori-1253∆</italic> cells and can last for more than 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), might be representative of multiple rounds of recombination caused by the frequent collapse of the restarted 'fork' as it moves away from <italic>RTS1</italic>. However, it is also possible that Rad52 remains associated with the restarted 'fork', enabling more rapid recovery of any subsequent collapse.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RDR as a default response to replication fork collapse</title><p>From an evolutionary standpoint, the rapid induction of HR following replication fork collapse may make sense if no checkpoint response is induced, as it would ensure that RDR commenced without unnecessary delay thereby maximizing the chance that genome duplication is completed in a timely manner. This would be especially important given that the initiation of RDR appears to have some kinetically slow steps. A failure to complete DNA replication prior to mitosis would result in DNA breakage and chromosome missegregation, and may account for pathologies such as micronuclei formation and chromothripsis that can drive cancer development in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crasta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beuzer et al., 2014</xref>). Presumably in our experimental system, RDR is unnecessary for maintaining cell viability because passive replication from one of the centromere proximal origins is sufficient to complete replication on time. However, the same may not be true at the <italic>ura4</italic> locus in <italic>S. pombe</italic> where replication fork blockage by <italic>RTS1</italic> imposes a definite requirement for HR to maintain cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lambert et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2010</xref>). Although it should be noted that, unlike in our study, Lambert et al. made use of an inducible promoter to drive the overexpression of the fork barrier protein Rtf1, which might alter the nature of the RFB and the requirement for recombination proteins. One example where RDR most likely is needed to ensure that DNA replication is completed on time is at common fragile site loci in human cells, which replicate late in S-phase and with greater distances between active origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ozeri-Galai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mankouri et al., 2013</xref>). This creates a scenario where the irreversible stalling of two converging replication forks would result in mitosis proceeding with a region of unreplicated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mankouri et al., 2013</xref>). As discussed by others, the consequences of this may be far worse than the risks associated with RDR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> strains and PCR primers are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3 tbl4">Tables 3 and 4</xref>, respectively.

1991</xref>). The complete and minimal media were yeast extract with supplements (YES) and Edinburgh minimal medium plus 3.7 mg/ml sodium glutamate (EMMG) and appropriate amino acids (0.2475 mg/ml), respectively. Ade<sup>+</sup> recombinants were selected on YES lacking adenine and supplemented with 200 mg/l guanine to prevent uptake of residual adenine. Indicated amounts of thiamine were included where appropriate to repress expression from the <italic>nmt</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Live cells were mounted with soybean lectin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in a glass bottom culture dish (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) containing liquid media (EMMG with 1 <italic>μ</italic>M thiamine and without histidine) in a thermally insulated temperature-controlled chamber at 30°C. Cells were imaged on an inverted Olympus IX71 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) controlled by a DV Elite Core using DeltaVision softWoRx 5.5.0 software using CFP/YFP/mCherry filters (Applied Precision Inc., Issaquah, WA). Images were taken with an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) using an oil-immersed Olympus 100X UPlanSApo objective with a NA of 1.40. A stack of 16 focal planes at a step-size of 0.3 μm was taken for 'snapshot' analysis. For time-lapse analysis, stacks were taken every 5 min for up to 4 hr. Brightfield images of cells and LacI-tdKatushka2 were imaged with a 100 ms exposure time and 10% neutral density filter. Rad52-YFP was imaged with a 100 ms exposure time and either 5% (time-lapse) or 10% (snapshot) neutral density filter, CFP-PCNA with a 25 ms exposure time and 2% neutral density filter, ECFP-Rad51 with a 200 ms exposure time and 10% neutral density filter, and Rad54-GFP with a 100 ms exposure time and 10% neutral density filter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image processing and analysis</title><p>Images from the DV Elite Core were denoised using a patch-based denoising algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kervrann and Boulanger, 2006</xref>) and deconvolved with softWoRx 5.5.0 software (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Foci were scored manually and separately for each fluorescent channel. Foci were distinguished as being a minimum of three to five times brighter than background intensity levels with a minimum of a 2×2 pixel volume. Co-localization was manually assessed and scored as foci in separate channels overlapping in xyz by a minimum of 2 pixels. Fluorescent signals were quantified using Volocity (Improvision, Coventry, England) or Imaris (Bitplane, South Windsor, CT).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Recombination assays</title><p>Direct repeat recombination was assayed by measuring the frequency of Ade<sup>+</sup> recombinants as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osman and Whitby, 2009</xref>). Recombinant frequencies represent the mean value from at least 15 colonies for each strain. All statistical analysis was performed on SPSS Statistics (IBM, Armonk, NY). Data were tested for normal distribution by the Shapiro–Wilk normality test. In accordance with the distribution of the data, mean values were compared by the appropriate independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-test. p values below 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Colony forming and spot assays</title><p>Cells were grown in EMMG at 30°C to mid-exponential phase and were then harvested, washed, and counted using a haemocytometer and resuspended in water at an appropriate density (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells per millilitre for the spot assay and 2.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per millilitre for the viability assay). For the spot assay, the suspension was serially diluted in fivefold steps to 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells per millilitre, and a 10 µl aliquot of each suspension was spotted onto a EMMG plate. The plate was photographed after 4 days at 30°C. For the viability assay, suspensions were recounted to confirm cell densities, and then serial dilutions plated on EMMG in triplicate. Colonies were counted on the appropriate dilution plates after 5–6 days growth at 30°C. The assay was repeated three times to obtain mean values for the percentage of colony forming cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>2D gels</title><p>Genomic DNA was prepared from asynchronously growing yeast cultures either by mechanical disruption of cells followed by caesium chloride density gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huberman et al., 1987</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) or by enzymatic lysis of cells embedded in agarose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Your article has been favourably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Nguyen and colleagues have submitted a very elegant study on replication restart by recombination in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. The manuscript is well written and the data is of high quality. In brief, the authors show by live single cell analysis that the Rad52 recombination mediator is recruited to an <italic>RTS1</italic> blocked fork in almost every S-phase cell. However, many of the conclusions of the study are based on the assumption that Rad52 foci reflect ongoing recombination. While this may be true for repair of a DSB, it may not be the case for a transiently stalled/blocked replication fork. Therefore, it remains crucial to evaluate to what extent the observed Rad52 foci reflect ongoing recombinational restart of replication.</p><p>Based on these results, the authors propose that recombination-dependent replication (RDR) is a major pathway of replication restart in their system. Surprisingly, however, they find that RDR is dispensable for the viability of cells experiencing a block in replication. Another significant observation is that the RDR observed by authors is highly unstable, which makes it similar to the BIR mechanism.</p><p>Although the observations are interesting and important, the collective major comments that need to be addressed prior to publication are:</p><p>1) It is essential that you determine whether the observed Rad52 foci reflect ongoing recombinational restart of replication or they are simply associating with the ssDNA at the replication fork. This issue bears on the recruitment of HR proteins and the involvement of HR at stalled forks as explained by your model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). You can address this issue by one or both of the additional experiments:</p><p>A) Analysing Rad52 foci in a mutant that cannot complete recombination. If the kinetics and frequency of the majority of Rad52 foci remain unchanged in a recombination deficient mutant, then it would indicate that Rad52 foci do not reflect ongoing recombination but perhaps rather Rad52 associating with RPA bound to ssDNA at the stalled fork. If on the other hand, the duration and frequency of the majority of Rad52 foci dramatically increase in a recombination mutant, it would indicate that the observed Rad52 foci reflect ongoing recombination that is required for the fork to recover/restart. It is not trivial to decide which recombination mutant(s) to analyse, because some mutant might have secondary effects; however, one possibility could be to analyze a rad51∆ mutant. A more elegant approach would be to analyze one of the previously described point mutants of Rad52 that are defective in recombination (Mortensen et al. 2002). Ideally, this analysis should be performed in the oriIII-1253∆ background to reduce rescue from the adjacent replication fork.</p><p>B) Alternatively, if the HR intermediate proposed is a common structure at stalled forks, it should be possible to see a Rad52-dependent structure by 2D gel analysis, or at least to see a difference in fork progression in wild-type and <italic>rad52∆</italic> cells. Such an experiment would also address the consequences of RAD52 loss; whether there is cell cycle arrest, or increased fork stalling; and whether Rad52 plays more important role in the absence of origin 1277 (the absence of a timely converging fork).</p><p>2) The recruitment of Rad52 to stalled/collapsed forks at the <italic>RTS1</italic> locus is an interesting observation. You used a 115 repeat <italic>lacO</italic> array, inserted next to <italic>RTS1</italic>, coupled with expression of LacI as a marker for stalled forks and followed the kinetics of tagged Rad52 foci formation. The only negative of this experimental set up is that <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI was demonstrated by many groups to block a replication fork itself. Thus on top of the <italic>RTS1</italic>, an additional potentially fork blocking region was inserted to follow the kinetics of HR protein recruitment. It seems that insertion of the <italic>lacO</italic> array has little impact on gene conversion frequencies between ade6 alleles next to <italic>RTS1</italic>; however, replication fork progression was not evaluated by 2D gels. It was somewhat surprising that about 20% of cells with <italic>RTS1-IO</italic> (in inactive orientation) show co-localization of LacI and Rad52. This might suggests that <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI indeed itself is at least a weak fork barrier? You need to clarify whether the <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI interaction does or does not act as RFB. It would seem that the best way to address this question is by 2D gel electrophoresis. Such analysis would also permit measurement of the kinetics of fork stalling at <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>, in relationship to the kinetics of Rad52 foci formation. Therefore, this important issue needs to be resolved by a direct method such as, for example, 2D gel electrophoresis.</p><p>3) The high (unchanged) viability of recombination-defective yeast cells following replication collapse should be measured by using more quantitative approaches. The results from spot tests measuring viability of cells undergoing replication collapse are not sufficiently compelling (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and in the subsection headed “RDR is not always required for cell viability following replication fork blockage at <italic>RTS1</italic>”).</p><p>4) You must show the “data not shown” referred to in the subsection of the Results entitled “Experimental system”. This is not a request for additional experimentation, but rather to provide the data that you already have. In presenting these unpublished data, you need to explain how you estimated, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the following statement: “It also shows that ∼ 50% of forks remain blocked at <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> long enough for replication to be completed by the opposing fork resulting in fork merging at <italic>RTS1</italic>”.</p><p>5) The following are important clarifications that are required in the manuscript; none of these clarifications require additional experimentation.</p><p>A) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-C</xref>. It is unclear why you claim that a replication fork converging with a D-loop would dissociate the D-loop. Why should Mcm2-7 migrating on the leading strand template displace an invading/extended 3' strand that is on lagging strand template?</p><p>B) While discussing your results, you propose that Rad52 is recruited to the position of fork collapse, but not breakage. However, it remains unclear how you can distinguish between these two events in your experimental conditions. For example, it appears that frequent formation of deletions that was frequently observed in this and also in your previous paper (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et. al., 2005</xref>) could be explained by SSA repair, and therefore induced by DNA breakage. Importantly, approximately a half of such deletions were independent of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et. al, 2005</xref>), which is consistent with SSA. In addition, it remains unclear how you explain the increase of the fraction of deletions (which also could be SSA) among secondary recombination events induced by RDR.</p><p>C) You often use “majority”, “minority”, “few”, etc., instead of exact numbers. You need to provide actual values throughout the paper to provide some quantitative context for these relative descriptors. Just a few examples are:</p><p>i) In the subsection “Live cell imaging of RDR at <italic>RTS1</italic>”: “The majority of cells exhibited a single Rad52 focus” means 51% or 99%. Please provide an exact number.</p><p>ii) In the subsection “Timing of Rad52 recruitment following replication fork blockage”: “In a few cells…”. Please provide the number instead of “few”. By eye it looks like at least 1/4 of all cells with co-localization.</p><p>iii) The words “rapid” and “early” in the Title and Abstract are not informative, unless it is clear which quantity they being compared to. I suggest rephrasing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04539.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is essential that you determine whether the observed Rad52 foci reflect ongoing recombinational restart of replication or they are simply associating with the ssDNA at the replication fork.

Such an experiment would also address the consequences of RAD52 loss; whether there is cell cycle arrest, or increased fork stalling; and whether Rad52 plays more important role in the absence of origin 1277 (the absence of a timely converging fork)</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers make a very valid point. To address this we initially analyzed Rad52 foci in a <italic>rad51∆</italic> mutant as suggested by the reviewers. Contrary to expectation we observed no significant change in the timing or frequency of Rad52 co-localization with <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI when <italic>rad51</italic> was deleted. However, a caveat to this experiment is that the overall frequency and number of non-co-localizing Rad52 foci increases markedly in a <italic>rad51∆</italic> mutant, which could result in less protein being available for recruitment to the <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> site. Consequently we have not included these data in our revised manuscript. Instead we have focused on: 1) analyzing replication intermediates surrounding <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> in a <italic>rad51∆ rad52∆</italic> double mutant by 2D gel analysis (in line with the second experiment proposed by the reviewers); and 2) further imaging experiments to determine whether other recombination proteins in addition to Rad52 are recruited to the barrier. The new 2D gel analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and described in a new Results section entitled “Rad52 is required for replication past <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>”. Consistent with Rad51 and/or Rad52 being required for RDR at <italic>RTS1</italic> we observe a loss of large Y-shaped DNA molecules past the barrier in a <italic>rad51∆ rad52∆</italic> double mutant. In the new imaging experiments (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and described in a new Results section entitled “Both Rad51 and Rad54 are recruited to <italic>RTS1-AO</italic>” we observe that both Rad51 and Rad54 co-localize with the <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI array adjacent to <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> at similar frequencies as Rad52. Importantly more than 90% of Rad52 foci that co-localize with <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI in <italic>RTS1-AO</italic> cells also co-localize with a Rad51 focus (indicating that Rad52 remains associated with the site after Rad51 has loaded, which could explain why we don’t see an increase in Rad52 foci at the barrier in a <italic>rad51∆</italic> mutant). The presence of three core recombination proteins (Rad51, Rad52 and Rad54) at the <italic>RTS1</italic> barrier provides strong evidence of ongoing recombination activity.</p><p><italic>2) The recruitment of Rad52 to stalled/collapsed forks at the</italic> RTS1 <italic>locus is an interesting observation. You used a 115 repeat</italic> lacO <italic>array, inserted next to</italic> RTS1<italic>, coupled with expression of LacI as a marker for stalled forks and followed the kinetics of tagged Rad52 foci formation. The only negative of this experimental set up is that</italic> lacO<italic>-LacI was demonstrated by many groups to block a replication fork itself.

It would seem that the best way to address this question is by 2D gel electrophoresis. Such analysis would also permit measurement of the kinetics of fork stalling at</italic> RTS1-AO<italic>, in relationship to the kinetics of Rad52 foci formation. Therefore, this important issue needs to be resolved by a direct method such as, for example, 2D gel electrophoresis</italic>.</p><p>We have done the requested 2D gel analysis of replication intermediates across the <italic>lacO</italic> array under conditions with no LacI and with the same low-level of LacI as in our imaging experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). We observe no significant difference in the Y-arc with and without LacI, and therefore conclude that the low-level of LacI used in our imaging experiments does not unduly perturb fork progression. It is worth pointing out that among the 20% of <italic>RTS1-IO</italic> cells that exhibit a Rad52 focus that co-localizes with <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI, ∼60% show co-localization in only a single time point, and so far we have never seen more than three time points of co-localization in 90 minutes following anaphase. We suspect that most or all of these co-localizations represent Rad52 recruitment to other problems that will occur stochastically in this region of chromosome 3 (note that events 50 kb on either side of <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI will probably appear to co-localize with it).</p><p><italic>3) The high (unchanged) viability of recombination-defective yeast cells following replication collapse should be measured by using more quantitative approaches.

In presenting these unpublished data, you need to explain how you estimated, from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>, the following statement: “It also shows that ∼ 50% of forks remain blocked at</italic> RTS1-AO <italic>long enough for replication to be completed by the opposing fork resulting in fork merging at</italic> RTS1<italic>”</italic>.</p><p>The data and quantification are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> of the revised manuscript.

It is unclear why you claim that a replication fork converging with a D-loop would dissociate the D-loop. Why should Mcm2-7 migrating on the leading strand template displace an invading/extended 3' strand that is on lagging strand template</italic>?</p><p>We speculate that D-loop dissociation may come from the Pif1 family helicase Pfh1 translocating on the lagging template strand. Pfh1 has been shown to associate with the replisome and we have previously published evidence that it plays a role during replication fork convergence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steinacher et al. 2012</xref>). To clarify this we have added the following text to the subsection headed “A hypothetical model for RFB-induced RDR” of our revised manuscript: “This might be advantageous during convergence with a normal replication fork, which could drive dissociation of the D-loop through the action of the replisomes’s accessory DNA helicase Pfh1 translocating on the lagging template strand, thereby converting the restarted “fork” back into a reversed fork at which fork merging could occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>)”. In addition, we have included question marks in the diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) to emphasize the speculative nature of our model.</p><p><italic>B) While discussing your results, you propose that Rad52 is recruited to the position of fork collapse, but not breakage. However, it remains unclear how you can distinguish between these two events in your experimental conditions. For example, it appears that frequent formation of deletions that was frequently observed in this and also in your previous paper (see</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"><italic>Ahn et. al., 2005</italic></xref><italic>) could be explained by SSA repair, and therefore induced by DNA breakage. Importantly, approximately a half of such deletions were independent of Rad51 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"><italic>Ahn et. al, 2005</italic></xref><italic>), which is consistent with SSA. In addition, it remains unclear how you explain the increase of the fraction of deletions (which also could be SSA) among secondary recombination events induced by RDR</italic>.</p><p>The following text additions have been made in the Discussion:</p><p>“Importantly, in wild-type cells breakage of forks blocked at […] DSB-independent single-strand annealing that could occur during fork convergence.”</p><p>“The high frequency of ectopic recombination downstream of the RFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) […] to trigger the possibility of re-invasion into <italic>ade6-M375</italic> and the formation of a <italic>ade6</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> gene conversion.”</p><p><italic>C) You often use “majority”, “minority”, “few”, etc., instead of exact numbers. You need to provide actual values throughout the paper to provide some quantitative context for these relative descriptors. Just a few examples are</italic>:</p><p><italic>i) In the subsection “Live cell imaging of RDR at</italic> RTS1<italic>”: “The majority of cells exhibited a single Rad52 focus” means 51% or 99%. Please provide an exact number</italic>.</p><p><italic>ii) In the subsection “Timing of Rad52 recruitment following replication fork blockage”: “In a few cells…”. Please provide the number instead of “few”.
