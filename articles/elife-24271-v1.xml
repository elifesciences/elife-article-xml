results in synaptic dysfunction in mice, flies and worms. Our studies at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction indicate that many synaptic defects in <italic>unc-104-null</italic> mutants are mediated independently of Unc-104’s transport function, via the Wallenda (Wnd)/DLK MAP kinase axonal damage signaling pathway. Wnd signaling becomes activated when Unc-104’s function is disrupted, and leads to impairment of synaptic structure and function by restraining the expression level of active zone (AZ) and synaptic vesicle (SV) components. This action concomitantly suppresses the buildup of synaptic proteins in neuronal cell bodies, hence may play an adaptive role to stresses that impair axonal transport. Wnd signaling also becomes activated when pre-synaptic proteins are over-expressed, suggesting the existence of a feedback circuit to match synaptic protein levels to the transport capacity of the axon.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24271.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Each nerve cell, or neuron, has a long nerve fiber – called an axon – that forms specialized sites for information exchange – called synapses – with other cells. Many molecules work at synapses to coordinate the exchange of information. These molecules are largely made in the central part of the neuron – known as the cell body – and are then transported along the axon to the synapses.</p><p>The transport of these molecules is carried out by proteins known as molecular motors. One molecular motor, called KIF1A in humans and Unc-104 in fruit flies, is thought to be a major transporter of synaptic molecules. Mutations that hinder this molecular motor result in neurons failing to form synapses and, instead, synaptic components accumulate in the cell body. However, it was not clearif Unc-104 does actually carry all of the components needed to assemble synapses along axons, or if it influences synapse formation in another way.</p><p>Now, Li, Zhang et al. report new evidence that supports the second of these two hypotheses. The experiments made use of fruit flies in which the gene for Unc-104 had been deleted, and revealed that inhibiting enzymes in a specific signaling pathway could reverse the synaptic problems caused by the loss of Unc-104. The signaling pathway, which is conserved between flies and humans, involves an enzyme that is called Wnd in flies and DLK in humans. The Wnd/DLK signaling pathway was previously known to regulate how neurons respond when their axons are damaged (either by growing new axons or dying, depending on the context).</p><p>Further investigation by Li, Zhang et al. revealed that signaling via the Wnd enzyme becomes triggered whenever the Unc-104 molecular motor is impaired. This activation correlates with the build-up of synaptic proteins in the cell body. Once activated, the pathway then reduces the total amount of synaptic proteins that the cell makes. This reduction matches the neuron’s reduced ability to transport them along the axon, and may help the neuron to adapt when axonal transport is impaired. However, the reduction in synaptic proteins also impaired the exchange of information at the synapses.</p><p>These findings suggest how DLK could be behind problems with synapses in diseases in which transport along axons is impaired. These diseases include hereditary spastic paraplegia, which has been linked to mutations in human KIF1A, and may also include ALS and Alzheimer’s disease, which have recently been linked to DLK.</p><p>DLK has received recent attention as a candidate drug target because it contributes to the deterioration of damaged neurons. These new findings further expand that interest by suggesting that inhibiting DLK may help neurons to maintain working synapses, which is more useful than simply preventing damaged neurons from dying.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axonal transport</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 NS069844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Catherine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RA 1804/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rasse</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chica and Heinz Schaller Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jahn</surname><given-names>Thomas Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Synaptic defects previously attributed to loss of kinesin function are found to be mediated by the Wnd/DLK axonal injury signaling pathway, which restrains the total levels of presynaptic proteins in response to their accumulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synapse development, maintenance and plasticity involve highly orchestrated trafficking events in both pre and postsynaptic cells. In contrast to postsynaptic receptors, whose trafficking and organization has been studied extensively in many different synapse types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choquet and Triller, 2013</xref>), much less is known about the mechanisms that regulate the assembly and maintenance of the neurotransmitter release machinery in the presynaptic neuron. This machinery includes the active zone (AZ), an electron-dense complex of structural proteins that scaffold both calcium channels and synaptic vesicles (SV) for the coordination of calcium-regulated exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Südhof, 2012</xref>). The protein components of the AZ are synthesized in cell bodies and trafficked together in association with vesicles (known as piccolo-bassoon transport vesicles (PTVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shapira et al., 2003</xref>). SV precursors are also synthesized in cell bodies, and carried by kinesin motors to synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall and Hedgecock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Okada et al., 1995</xref>). Regulation of synapse development likely involves a global coordination of the synthesis and transport of both AZ and SV components. However the mechanisms that regulate these important steps in synapse development and maintenance are poorly understood.</p><p>A critical role in synapse development has been assigned to the kinesin-3 family of motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall and Hedgecock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kern et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Niwa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pack-Chung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yonekawa et al., 1998</xref>). Mutations in mammalian <italic>Kif1a</italic> and its <italic>unc-104</italic> orthologues in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (also known <italic>as imac, Klp53D and bris in Drosophila</italic>) cause severe defects in synapse development. In <italic>Drosophila unc-104-null</italic> mutants, synaptic boutons fail to form, SV and AZ components fail to traffic to nascent synapses, and concomitantly, SV and AZ associated proteins accumulate in the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pack-Chung et al., 2007</xref>). It is broadly accepted that Unc-104 protein functions as a molecular motor to physically deliver presynaptic components to their destinations in the synaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldstein et al., 2008</xref>). However, while there is biochemical evidence that KIF1A can interact with and ‘carry’ SV precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Okada et al., 1995</xref>), there is little evidence that KIF1A (or Unc-104) carries AZ components. The mechanistic role of Unc-104 in AZ transport and assembly remains unclear.</p><p>In this study we found that synaptic defects in embryonic <italic>unc-104-null</italic> mutants, including the failure to form synaptic boutons and AZs, arise not from direct loss of Unc-104 transport function, but via an indirect mechanism, which involves activation of the Wnd/DLK axonal damage signaling pathway. The Wnd/DLK mixed lineage kinase has recently received intense interest for its roles in regulating both regenerative and degenerative responses to axonal damage in vertebrate and invertebrate neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerdts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hao and Collins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li and Collins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</xref>). We found that the Wnd/DLK signaling pathway becomes activated when Unc-104’s function is impaired, and then promotes synaptic dysfunction by restraining expression of multiple pre-synaptic AZ and SV protein components. This restraint concomitantly reduces protein buildup in cell bodies, which may play an adaptive role to stresses that disrupt intracellular transport, and contribute to pathologies that arise when transport is disrupted.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Roles for the Unc-104 kinesin in AZ transport and synaptic bouton growth can be functionally separated from SV transport</title><p>Previous studies of NMJ development in <italic>unc-104-null</italic> mutant animals have revealed essential roles for this kinesin in synaptic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall and Hedgecock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kern et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pack-Chung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yonekawa et al., 1998</xref>). At the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ), <italic>unc-104-null</italic> mutants are severely defective in the formation of presynaptic boutons, fail to localize SVs to NMJ terminals and show strong reductions in AZ localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pack-Chung et al., 2007</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found that disrupting the axonal damage signaling kinase Wnd (<italic>wnd<sup>3</sup></italic> single mutants) had no significant effect on bouton formation, AZ number, or presynaptic protein localization, but double mutants with <italic>unc-104-null</italic> alleles (<italic>unc-104<sup>P350</sup></italic>, <italic>unc-104<sup>170</sup>,</italic> and <italic>unc-104<sup>52</sup></italic>), gave a very informative phenotype: in <italic>unc-104<sup>null</sup>;wnd<sup>3/3</sup></italic> double mutants the synaptic bouton formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>), AZ number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>), and synaptic levels of the AZ protein Brp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>) were restored to a wild type phenotype. In contrast, the synaptic levels of SV proteins (VGlut, SytI and CSP) remained negligible, as in the <italic>unc-104<sup>null</sup></italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>). These results are consistent with previous findings that Unc-104 functions as an essential molecular motor to transport SV precursors to synaptic terminals. However our findings indicate that transport of AZ precursors and bouton formation can occur independently of Unc-104. These defects are mediated by a second and separable mechanism, which depends upon the function of the Wnd kinase.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24271.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AZ transport and Synaptic bouton formation but not SVP transport defects in <italic>unc-104-null</italic> mutants are rescued by mutations in <italic>wnd</italic>.</title><p>Representative images of ISNb neuromuscular junction (NMJ) terminals at muscles 6, 7, 12 and 13 at embryonic stage 17 (20–21 hr AEL).

This correlation of Wnd localization with signaling activation is interesting to note, since Wnd and its DLK homologue are known to physically associate with vesicles that are transported in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>), and this transport appears to be important for its ability to mediate axon-to-cell body retrograde signaling.</p><p>Does the cell body localization of Wnd reflect a role for Unc-104 in transporting Wnd-associated vesicles?

However, they may be explained by an action of the Wnd pathway within a feedback circuit to reduce the build-up of SV and AZ components in neuronal cell bodies. As a nuclear signaling cascade, we hypothesized that Wnd signaling may achieve this effect by down-regulating the expression levels of SV and AZ components. In this case, such reduction in global levels could account for the reduced levels at synaptic terminals in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants. To test this hypothesis, we carried out quantitative immunohistochemistry to estimate the total cellular levels of Brp and VGlut in motoneurons based on respective intensities in cell body, axonal and synaptic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We found that compared with wildtype animals, the total levels of Brp and VGlut are reduced by 65% and 80% respectively in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

We suspect that the fact that motoneurons are only a fraction of neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system prohibited our detection of global changes in these proteins by Western blot (data not shown). However we observed this trend in total levels of VGlut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). This may be facilitated by the fact that most of the glutamatergic neurons in larval VNCs are motoneurons.</p><p>These observations, combined with the observations that Wnd activation reduces the levels of Brp and VGlut at NMJs, suggest a model in which activated Wnd signaling leads to a down-regulation of the expression levels of multiple pre-synaptic proteins in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants. This response may serve to counteract their buildup in neuronal cell bodies while causing the observed defects in synapse structure and function.

Moreover, many studies have noted a role for DLK signaling in mediating structural changes in neurons downstream of manipulations that disrupt cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bounoutas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Marcette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Massaro et al., 2009</xref>).

While disruption of cytoskeleton should impair transport by many motor proteins, mutations that impair kinesin-1 and dynein do not lead to activation of Wnd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>). This specificity suggests that disruption of Unc-104 mediated transport, potentially via mislocalization of Unc-104’s cargo, mediates Wnd/DLK’s activation after cytoskeletal disruption and potentially after axonal injury.</p><p>This line of reasoning leads to further consideration of Unc-104’s cargo. Our live imaging data do not support a simple model that Wnd is a cargo of Unc-104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Known cargo of Unc-104 are important for the assembly and function of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldstein et al., 2008</xref>), so does Wnd activation occur in response to an impairment in synaptic assembly or function?

When Unc-104’s function is impaired/reduced, presynaptic components accumulate in cell bodies. However Wnd signaling activation reduces the accumulations by reducing total expression levels of presynaptic components. This reduction eventually manifests as a reduction in synapse number and mismatched pre- and postsynaptic structures.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-24271-fig9-v1"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Wnd/DLK signaling restrains the expression of presynaptic proteins: mechanism and relevance</title><p>While previous studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yan et al., 2009</xref>) have suggested that DLK activation may impair synaptic development (altering the size and spacing of active zones), the regulation of total levels of presynaptic proteins and the relationship with Unc-104 provides a new view into Wnd/DLK’s function and mechanism. In addition to VGlut, SytI, CSP-1, Brp, Liprin-α and Cac, we suspect that Wnd signaling restrains the expression of a cohort of presynaptic proteins. Regulation of multiple targets required for synapse development and maintenance can explain the severe defects in <italic>unc-104-hypomorph</italic> mutants, and the dramatic suppression by disruption of the Wnd pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In support of this idea, presynaptic defects in <italic>unc-104-hypomorph</italic> mutants can be partially rescued by overexpressing Brp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kern et al., 2013</xref>) or Rab3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to consider that the targets of Wnd regulation are also abundant presynaptic proteins, and are thought to be major cargo for axonal transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Down-regulation of these proteins in response to defects in their transport or after axonal damage may comprise a stress response mechanism to prevent unwanted buildup or wasted cellular resources. This role may allow neurons adapt to stresses that impair axonal transport by counteracting cargo buildup. But the resulting reduction in synaptic protein levels can also be maladaptive, leading over time to synapse failure and/or loss. This feature may contribute to synaptic pathologies associated with defects in axonal transport.</p><p>How does Wnd signaling regulate presynaptic proteins? The regulation of the <italic>vglut</italic>-promoter-DsRed reporter and requirement for the Fos transcription factor suggests the involvement of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>), and we also noticed mildly increased levels of Brp, VGlut and Cac transcripts in <italic>unc-104;wnd</italic> double mutants (data not shown). However we are limited in our ability to detect total changes in mRNA and protein levels from whole nerve cord preparations by the fact that the Wnd signaling pathway may not be acting in all cell types. It is also possible that additional post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as regulation of protein stability or translation, or bulk turnover via autophagy, factor into the regulation of presynaptic proteins by Wnd. A recent study has suggested that DLK may activate the integrated stress response pathway in mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Larhammar et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, previous studies have separately linked Unc-104, Wnd signaling and AP-1 (Fos) to autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shen and Ganetzky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stavoe et al., 2016</xref>). It will be interesting to determine whether translation and/or autophagy contribute to the regulation of presynaptic proteins by Wnd signaling.</p><p>Many previous studies have reported links between JNK signaling and kinesin-driven transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Verhey and Hammond, 2009</xref>), with some observations suggesting that JNK signaling may directly regulate the function of kinesin-1, modulating its cargo binding, affinity for microtubules and its processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu and Holzbaur, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Horiuchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morfini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stagi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Our finding of a separate role for JNK signaling in regulating the abundance of transported cargo adds a new layer of complexity to interpreting phenotypes of axonal transport defects. A commonly described defect is the presence of accumulations of cargo within axons, referred to as ‘traffic jams’. These defects have been noted for many different mutations, including kinesin-1 and dynein subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gindhart et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hurd and Saxton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Martin et al., 1999</xref>), and also in mutants for <italic>wnd</italic> and other members of JNK signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Horiuchi et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2007</xref>). Does a failure to regulate excess protein cargo contribute to the presence of the jams? Intriguingly, <italic>unc-104</italic> mutations do not cause this type of ‘traffic jams’ in axons, but instead leads to accumulations of synaptic proteins in cell bodies, which correlates with the activation of Wnd signaling.</p><p>Finally, it is interesting to compare Wnd’s role in tuning levels of presynaptic proteins with previously identified roles for DLK in promoting cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Welsbie et al., 2013</xref>). While <italic>Kif1a</italic> mutant mice show early signs of neuronal death and degeneration, which may potentially be mediated by activation of DLK, <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> lack hallmarks of cell death and synaptic degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall and Hedgecock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kern et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pack-Chung et al., 2007</xref>). In analogy with other stress response pathways, regulation of presynaptic proteins may comprise a first order response that may facilitate adaptation to stress, while cell death could be the consequence when compensatory mechanisms fail. Inhibition of synaptic proteins is, alone, a pathology that becomes relevant for long term maintenance of synapses and their function over time, since synthesis and transport of new synaptic proteins likely needs to occur throughout the long lifespan of a neuron. Interestingly, previous studies have linked activation of JNK signaling to synapse loss in aged animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sclip et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Voelzmann et al., 2016</xref>).

Based on the exciting finding that loss of wnd suppresses the reduced presynaptic active zone (AZ) protein accumulation and associated functional deficits of unc-104 hypomorphic mutants, the authors propose a model in which the Wnd pathway 'senses' levels of presynaptic proteins in the cell body and acts as a brake on expression when levels exceed the ability of the cell to transport these proteins to synapses. The experiments are generally carefully done and individual experiments serve the purpose of supporting the genetic interaction. However, as a whole, the paper worryingly feels like a catalog of correlative connections, missing conceptual depth. A consistent term used throughout the paper is &quot;modest effect&quot; or &quot;modest role&quot;, suggesting ambiguity of the observations and the conclusions.

Yet, when we asked if these concerns were addressed whether the model proposed and data presented would be acceptable despite 'mechanistic' gaps, we were not persuaded.

Based on the exciting finding that loss of wnd suppresses the reduced presynaptic active zone (AZ) protein accumulation and associated functional deficits of unc-104 hypomorphic mutants, the authors propose a model in which the Wnd pathway 'senses' levels of presynaptic proteins in the cell body and acts as a brake on expression when levels exceed the ability of the cell to transport these proteins to synapses. While this is an interesting model, it is not fully supported by the data presented as detailed below.</p><p>1) Support for their model:</p><p>A) The authors propose that unc-104 function can be divided into a transport role for SVs that is independent of Wnd and a Wnd/DLK pathway-dependent role in regulating AZ proteins. The differentiation between Brp and SV proteins is based on the finding that reduced synaptic levels of Brp in unc-104 nulls are suppressed by wnd but SV protein levels are not, in contrast to their findings in unc-104 hypomorphs. Simpler models should be considered. For example, the observation that wnd suppresses the loss of SV proteins at synapses in hypomorphs with residual Unc-104 activity but not nulls is more easily explained by the model that SV transport, but not Brp transport, is fully dependent on Unc-104, consistent with prior observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Pack-Chung et al., 2007)..</p><p>B) The strongest evidence for activation of Wnd in Unc-104 mutants comes from the puc-LacZ experiments in unc-104 RNAi lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Given the importance of this finding, it this experiment should be conducted in unc-104 null and hypomorphic mutants. It's not clear how the proposed model leads to the specificity for unc-104 reported here. Have the authors investigated if cell body levels of presynaptic proteins are increased in these other mutants?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the authors show that GFP-tagged Wnd MiMIC lines show increased Wnd in unc-104 mutants when well-characterized antibodies to Wnd (Collins et al., 2006) fail to show an increase. If they are going to include this data, the authors should provide an explanation for why the MiMIC data might provide a better indication of the underlying biology.</p><p>C) The evidence that Wnd regulates the levels of presynaptic protein levels and in particular that it acts at the level of transcription is somewhat inconsistent. Upon Wnd overexpression, the authors observed decreased protein levels at active zones as predicted. However, in wnd null embryos they see increased levels in some proteins at some stages, but decreases in other proteins (e.g., Brp). This and the absence of a consistent effect on the timing or expression, weakens their conclusion that wnd controls the levels and timing of expression of AZ and SV components.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, the authors present RT-PCR data that shows no decrease in transcription of synaptic proteins in unc-104 mutants as predicted by their model.</p><p>Other major concerns:</p><p>1) Much of the wnd, unc-104 interaction data was obtained using a previously published hypomorphic alleles of unc-104. Given their central role in this work, the authors should provide some information on the nature of these alleles. In the analysis of interactions between null mutants presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, it is important to include an analysis of wnd mutants alone (as in 6C-G) to rule out additive effects. Have the authors analyzed dominant suppression of unc-104 phenotypes by wnd, which would strongly support the conclusion that the two genes function in a linear pathway?</p><p>2) An electrophysiological analysis was conducted in hiw mutants (where Wnd levels are increased), but should be completed in wnd overexpression lines to more directly test the hypothesis that increased Wnd explains functional defects in unc-104 mutants. Here, the authors present the surprising result that wnd suppresses the physiological defect in hiw mutants. This is in contrast to results published in an earlier paper with overlapping authors (Collins et al., 2006). They suggest the difference may be due to the use of different wnd alleles, but this needs to be addressed experimentally given the importance of wnd suppression phenotypes to this work and the high impact of the previously published result that is called into question.</p><p>3) Given that synaptic function is fully suppressed in hypomorphs, it is surprising that locomotion and viability show little improvement. This disconnect should be further addressed by evaluating the relevant allelic combinations, not just RNAi. Relatedly, how is there so much movement in double null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) when there is essentially no SV transport to AZs?</p><p>4) It was cumbersome to parse through the data as presented in 21 figures (9 main plus 12 supplemental) including 2 separate model figures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> was presented in a way that made it especially difficult to compare genotypes.

Collins, Rasse and colleagues reveal an unexpected novel role for Unc-104 in regulating synaptic development and bouton composition in a manner not directly related to its long-range transport functions.</p><p>Synaptic vesicle precursor proteins and active zone proteins are synthesized in neuronal cell bodies and transported to synapses. Kinesin motors (Unc-104) transport SV precursors. AZ components are reduced at the synaptic terminals of the unc-104 mutants, but their transport has never been shown to be driven directly by unc-104. Through an exhaustive set of experiments (using diverse mutant and RNAi combinations), the authors show that defects in unc-104 lead to the activation of the Wnd signaling pathway (via Bsk and Fos), which in a cell-autonomous manner regulates AZ protein levels in neuronal cell bodies and synaptic terminals. Suppressing Wnd signaling in unc-104 strong hypomorphs or in RNAi knockdowns significantly reduces the defects in AZ at the synapse, defects in synaptic transmission, larval mobility and viability, but only partly rescues SV protein levels. Furthermore, puckered expression and axonal regeneration, both of which require enhanced Wnd signaling, are enhanced in unc-104 mutants.</p><p>Crucially, through genetic interaction studies with null mutants of unc-104 (as opposed to hypomorphs) the authors revealed two separable functions for unc-104: one for trafficking SV associated proteins to the synapse (VGlut1, Syt1, Csp) and one for activating the Wnd pathway, which in unc-104 mutants lead to the decrease of multiple synaptic proteins.</p><p>While these represent important, transformative, and convincing advances in our understanding of unc-104 and Wnd/DLK signaling in synapse formation, the one weakness of the paper is that it does not uncover HOW Unc-104 regulates Wnd signaling, or how Wnd signaling constrains synaptic protein levels. Filling this gap is likely beyond the scope of the current work and not necessary to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but there are several points that the authors could address based on their current approaches:</p><p>1) It is important for the authors to quantify Wnd-MiMIC levels in the neuronal cell bodies (akin to the way they quantified UAS-WnkKD in supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). They should also explain why they used the kinase dead version and whether they believe it behaves differently from wild type Wnd.</p><p>2) The authors present hiw data but do not address hiw function in their model or discussion. The authors should measure hiw RNA and/or protein levels in Unc-104 mutants to ask if hiw is contributing to the phenotype. If hiw protein (but not RNA) is downregulated in the unc-104 mutant, it might suggest that autophagy-mediated degradation of Hiw (as per Shen et al., 2009), and perhaps other synaptic proteins, underlies the regulatory mechanism by which unc-104 constrains synaptic protein levels in response to cell body accumulation of cargo. This could be simply tested by evaluating the amount and distribution of an autophagy flux marker such as ATG8-GFP-mCherry.</p><p>3) The observation that ectopic overexpression of Brp, SytI and VGlut leads to increased puc-lacZ reporter signal begs the question whether this also triggers changes in Wnd (or hiw) levels or localization, as these results could provide more insight into the mechanism via which Unc-104 deficits lead to Wnd activation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper describes a genetic interaction between the Unc-104 motor protein and the Wnd DLK kinase. The authors presented impressive amount of data from synapse cell biology to physiology with an attempt to conclude that Wnd activation is sensitive to disruption of unc-104 mediated transport of some axonal components. The measurement for Wnd activity mostly relied on induction of a puc-LacZ reporter in the soma, and morphological changes of NMJ terminals. While experiments are generally carefully done, individual experiment serves the purpose of supporting the genetic interaction. However, as a whole, the paper feels like a catalog of correlative connections, missing conceptual depth. A consistent term used throughout the paper is &quot;modest effect&quot; or &quot;modest role&quot;, suggesting ambiguity of the observations and the conclusions. Some of the issues could be addressed by re-writing, others need additional data.</p><p>Their observation that Wnd suppresses the lethality of unc-104 mutants is the key observation led to this study. But it is not clear whether this suppression is directly caused at the level of presynaptic transport. Does inhibition of Wnd downstream factors, <italic>JNK</italic> and FOS, also suppress unc-104 lethality? In subsection “Wnd inhibits synapse assembly independently of cargo transport downstream of Unc-104” the final sentence of the second paragraph seems to state that &quot;most or all&quot; unc-104; wnd mutants actually die. Is the suppression of lethality rather minor?</p><p>In axon regeneration analysis in unc-104 mutants, the observed effects should be rescued using wild type unc-104.</p><p>Subsection “Activation of the Wnd signaling pathway in neurons is sufficient to impair presynaptic structure and synaptic transmission”: first paragraph, the authors state &quot;ectopic activation of Wnd should mimic the unc-104 mutant phenotypes&quot;.

Your letter of appeal has been considered by a Senior Editor in discussion with the reviewers, and we are prepared to consider a revised submission with no guarantees of acceptance.</p><p>While we are happy to consider a revised manuscript, you will see that we have some serious concerns that need careful attention. We see merit in the author's rebuttal letter that the most concerns can be addressed with rewriting and some additional experiments and key issues addressed. The overall impact of the work, if these points are well-addressed, can be strong, since it provides a fundamentally new model for how unc-104 contributes to neuronal function, by activating an axonal injury pathway. However, the data and model also need to be explained more clearly to be digestible by a broad readership such as at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In response to the concerns raised about inconsistent results in their wnd loss-of-function analysis, the authors are dismissive, imploring us to &quot;Note that our model is NOT that Wnd functions as a major restraint on these proteins during normal conditions or during development,&quot; yet their subheading describing these results is &quot;Wnd restrains the expression of presynaptic proteins at early stages of synaptogenesis.&quot; In a second example, the authors dismiss concerns about their analysis of MiMIC-GFP instead of endogenous Wnd levels by simply stating that the Wnd antibody does not work well for immunohistochemistry without addressing the fact that they have previously published analogous experiments using their Wnd antibody for immunohistochemistry (Collins et al., 2006). The authors may want to pay particular attention to these points.</p><p>The authors should measure puc-LacZ expression in additional unc-104 mutants. Also, rescue of additional phenotypes aside from NMJ morphology and active zone apposition to PSD (e.g. lethality or synaptic function) by BSK and FOS would provide strong support for the model. However, I was not concerned that the Mimic tool showed an increase in Wnd while the western blot did not, since the Mimic tool accounts for changes in subcellular distribution – this point can be addressed better by the authors in the manuscript. However, it is absolutely essential that the MIMIC phenotype be quantified and use of the Kinase Dead explained in the text.</p><p>The effect of wnd on the timing and expression of presynaptic proteins needs to be much more clearly explained, as discussed in the rebuttal. As it stands this section is very distracting and confusing. The authors should also clarify their model for how synaptic protein levels are regulated in the unc-104 mutants (though the authors do discuss the RT-PCR data and I agree with them that RT-PCR detects transcripts from all the cell types in all the tissues used for the mRNA prep, and does not account for specific defects in protein levels and localization at the neuronal cell bodies and synaptic terminals). The main point of the paper does not hinge on a particular model of synaptic protein level control, but the authors do need to clarify their explanations, either in the text or with more experiments.</p><p>Wnd null mutants alone should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> for comparison in this specific assay. However, though phenotypes in transheterozygotes can be informative, lack of a dominant transheterozygote phenotype might just reflect gene dose requirements, and so we did not put as much weight on that particular experiment.</p><p>Electrophysiological analysis (and synaptic vesicle protein levels) in wnd overexpression lines would provide strong corroboration that increased Wnd explains functional defects in unc-104 mutants. Addressing the discrepancy with previous results (Collins 2006) on Wnd suppression of the hiw phenotype will be also be important.</p><p>On the other hand, experiments to address the cellular function of hiw would be nice but are not essential to the main interesting points of the paper. If the authors have the data or a more clear model of the role of hiw, it would be helpful to include, but we don't think it's necessary.</p><p>The rescue of the axon regrowth phenotype are not critical for the main conclusions of the paper and could take a lot of time.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Restraint of presynaptic protein levels by Wnd/DLK signaling mediates synaptic defects associated with the kinesin-3 motor Unc-104&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Based on the exciting finding that loss of wnd suppresses the reduced presynaptic active zone (AZ) protein accumulation and associated functional deficits of unc-104 hypomorphic mutants, the authors propose a model in which the Wnd pathway 'senses' levels of presynaptic proteins in the cell body and acts as a brake on expression when levels exceed the ability of the cell to transport these proteins to synapses. While this is an interesting model, it is not fully supported by the data presented as detailed below.</p> </disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer recognizes the novelty and strength of our findings and the model we propose. With a careful and much appreciated eye on the data, the reviewer summarizes below some concerns about individual observations.

Please see the clarifications below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The differentiation between Brp and SV proteins is based on the finding that reduced synaptic levels of Brp in unc-104 nulls are suppressed by wnd but SV protein levels are not, in contrast to their findings in unc-104 hypomorphs.</p> </disp-quote><p>To clarify, in <italic>unc-104; wnd</italic> double mutants compared to <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants alone, we see a major increase in total levels (across the sum of the cell body, axon and synaptic compartments) for <italic>both</italic> AZ and SV proteins. This is evident for both <italic>unc-104-</italic>hypomorph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> C) and null mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A-B</xref>, &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> A-B). These observations lead to our major interpretation that the Wnd pathway, which becomes activated in <italic>all of the unc-104 mutants</italic>, down-regulates the levels of <italic>both AZ and SV</italic> proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Simpler models should be considered. For example, the observation that wnd suppresses the loss of SV proteins at synapses in hypomorphs with residual Unc-104 activity but not nulls is more easily explained by the model that SV transport, but not Brp transport, is fully dependent on Unc-104, consistent with prior observations in Drosophila (Pack-Chung et al., 2007).</p></disp-quote><p>This explanation is indeed incorporated within our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This explanation accounts for the suppression of AZ but not SV localization in the <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants. However it is not the full picture, since this explanation does not account buildup of both AZ and SV components in the cell bodies of <italic>unc-104-null; wnd</italic> and <italic>unc-104-hypomorph;wnd</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The most important part of the model is that the Wnd pathway, which becomes activated when unc-104 function is lost, promotes a decrease the total cellular levels of many AZ and SV proteins. This effect is an important element of the synaptic phenotypes in both <italic>unc-104-hypomorph</italic> and <italic>null</italic> mutants. Our findings with <italic>unc-104-null</italic> mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> show that this effect for Wnd signaling can be genetically and mechanistically separated from a transport role of Unc-104.</p><p>We originally interpreted that the reviewer may be cautioning us to be careful about implying precise motor-cargo relationships. It is indeed possible that Unc-104 plays some partial role in AZ localization – we simply need to be precise in our language. However our primary point is not about which motor carries which cargo. Instead, our findings explicitly reveal the pitfalls to interpreting motor cargo relationships from standard phenotypic analysis. Our finding that an axonal injury pathway is activated in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants provides a new view with alternative interpretations for other published studies in the field. Several relevant previous observations along with the exciting implications are discussed in Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) The strongest evidence for activation of Wnd in Unc-104 mutants comes from the puc-LacZ experiments in unc-104 RNAi lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Given the importance of this finding, it this experiment should be conducted in unc-104 null and hypomorphic mutants.</p> </disp-quote><p>We agree that evidence for Wnd’s activation in the <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants is an important part of the paper. We show this for two independent RNAi lines, which show similar phenotypes to the multiple hypomorphic alleles (<italic>bris</italic> and <italic>O3.1</italic>) used in this paper across other assays. The suggestion to show this for additional alleles is do-able. We already have <italic>puc</italic>-lacZ combined into <italic>unc-104</italic>-hypomorph lines so we think it would be straight-forward to include this additional data.</p><p>Importantly, we already present additional support that the Wnd pathway is activated. In <italic>unc-104-hypomorph</italic> mutant and RNAi lines we see synaptic over-branching phenotypes that are hallmark of Wnd activation, and these are dependent upon Wnd and downstream <italic>JNK</italic> and Fos signaling components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, and also data not shown). We are thinking to move this data to the main part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> instead of supplemental data for the revision.</p><p>We also show in hypmorph/null mutants that Wnd protein is physically altered in levels and localization by immunohistochemistry using two independent reagents: the GFP-tagged MiMIC-Wnd line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) which tags endogenous Wnd with GFP, and also for transgenically expressed GFP-Wnd-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), which has been used in previous studies of Wnd’s regulation (Collins et al., 2006; Xiong et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2016).</p><p>And finally, our epistasis experiments with <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants suggests strongly that the Wnd pathway is responsible for synaptic phenotypes in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants, hence functions downstream. This analysis in late-staged embryos is technically challenging – only a few labs in the world can do it and it represents 9 months of effort on our part. The results were important for reaching an understanding of the relationship.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's not clear how the proposed model leads to the specificity for unc-104 reported here. Have the authors investigated if cell body levels of presynaptic proteins are increased in these other mutants?</p> </disp-quote><p>We see cell body accumulations of presynaptic proteins in multiple hypomorph and null <italic>unc-104</italic> mutant combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: <italic>bris/P350</italic> and <italic>P350/P350</italic>; Unpublished: <italic>bris/d11204; o3.1/P350; 170/170; 52/52</italic>), and also for <italic>unc-104</italic> RNAi knockdown in neurons (pan-motoneurons, using OK6-Gal4 or single motoneuron, using m12-Gal4). More importantly, under all these different conditions, when activation of the Wnd signaling is reversed/suppressed via wnd RNAi-knockdown or in <italic>wnd, unc-104</italic> double mutants, the cell body accumulation is dramatically enhanced.</p><p>Upon reviewing the manuscript after reading the reviewer’s queries, we realize it would be helpful to provide more background information about the different ‘hypomorph’ alleles, and clarify/explain in more detail how all of the alleles show similar synaptic phenotypes and relationships with Wnd to that of simple knock-down of Unc-104 with RNAi.</p><p>In contrast to the multiple mutations that reduce Unc-104 function, mutations that impair kinesin-1 function show accumulations of presynaptic proteins within segmental nerves rather than in the cell bodies, and also do not significantly induce the puc-lacZ reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the authors show that GFP-tagged Wnd MiMIC lines show increased Wnd in unc-104 mutants when well-characterized antibodies to Wnd (Collins et al., 2006) fail to show an increase. If they are going to include this data, the authors should provide an explanation for why the MiMIC data might provide a better indication of the underlying biology.</p> </disp-quote><p>To examine Wnd protein levels, we employed multiple approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The Wnd antibody works great for Western Blots but not well for immunohistochemistry. The GFP epitope within the MiMIC-GFP-Wnd line allows for some detection by immunohistochemistry (which we show controls for here), hence an examination of protein localization. We were not able to detect a global increase in the levels of Wnd protein within brain extracts by Western Blot, but we were able to see changes in the enrichment of MiMIC-GFP-Wnd in cell bodies (but not in axons and synapses). In addition, we observe changes in the levels and localization of transgenically expressed GFP-Wnd-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), which has been used in previous studies of Wnd’s regulation (Collins et al., 2006; Xiong et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2016).</p><p>The observation that a global increase in endogenous Wnd levels was not detected by Western Blot may benefit from some further clarification and discussion. The Western Blots are necessarily carried out with extracts made from dissected larval CNS/brains, pooled in entirety. We cannot isolate individual neurons for this analysis. We’ve observed that the activation of Wnd and the regulation of presynaptic proteins by Wnd appears most striking in motoneurons. The potential specificity to motoneurons makes it harder to detect simple biochemical evidence for the relationship using standard biochemical methods from whole larval brains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) The evidence that Wnd regulates the levels of presynaptic protein levels and in particular that it acts at the level of transcription is somewhat inconsistent. Upon Wnd overexpression, the authors observed decreased protein levels at active zones as predicted. However, in wnd null embryos they see increased levels in some proteins at some stages, but decreases in other proteins (e.g., Brp). This and the absence of a consistent effect on the timing or expression, weakens their conclusion that wnd controls the levels and timing of expression of AZ and SV components.</p> </disp-quote><p>An important but overlooked point here is that Wnd signaling is normally highly restrained in wild type, uninjured animals. If its role is primarily to respond to injury or stress, then it is expected that <italic>loss-of-function</italic> phenotypes in an uninjured background should be mild. With an original motivation to understand whether there is also a role for Wnd during normal synaptic development, we examined these phenotypes carefully during development. We found that the <italic>wnd loss-of-function</italic> phenotypes are indeed mild. However, strikingly, we did notice some elevation in VGlut and Syt protein co-incident with the onset of expression for these proteins. Note that our model is NOT that Wnd functions as a major restraint on these proteins during normal conditions or during development. Rather, Wnd restrains these proteins when it is substantially activated. In normal conditions this may occur only at extremely low levels to keep total synaptic protein levels in balance.</p><p>The fact that we did not observe an increase in Brp does not negate the model. Very little is currently known about how the expression of AZ and SV proteins are regulated developmentally –this is an interesting topic for future studies. It is likely that multiple mechanisms exist for different proteins, and that Brp levels are not sufficiently high during these stages of normal development to detect a role for Wnd in uninjured animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, the authors present RT-PCR data that shows no decrease in transcription of synaptic proteins in unc-104 mutants as predicted by their model.</p> </disp-quote><p>As discussed above for point B, studies with whole brain extracts (for Western Blot or RT-PCR analysis, referenced here) are likely to miss the cell specific regulation which is occurring in motoneurons. It is a future direction to profile the responses in motoneurons specificially. This requires some additional technical innovations since cell sorting causes axotomy, which activates the Wnd pathway on its own.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other major concerns:</p> <p>1) Much of the wnd, unc-104 interaction data was obtained using a previously published hypomorphic alleles of unc-104. Given their central role in this work, the authors should provide some information on the nature of these alleles.</p> </disp-quote><p>We agree and can provide further clarification in the text. An important clarification point is that we see similar suppression by <italic>wnd</italic> mutants for multiple hypomorphic allele combinations of <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants (See point B above and subsection “The Wnd signaling pathway mediates presynaptic defects in unc-104 mutants”), and also when Unc-104 protein levels are simply reduced by RNAi-knockdown. So we think that any manipulation that impairs Unc-104’s basic function leads to activation of Wnd signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the analysis of interactions between null mutants presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, it is important to include an analysis of wnd mutants alone (as in 6C-G) to rule out additive effects.</p> </disp-quote><p>We have indeed included detailed analysis of <italic>wnd</italic> mutants alone at the embryonic stages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. We should be able to include for reference some of the relevant data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref> for comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors analyzed dominant suppression of unc-104 phenotypes by wnd, which would strongly support the conclusion that the two genes function in a linear pathway?</p> </disp-quote><p>We’ve observed that partial knockdown of Wnd signaling by RNAi can suppress <italic>unc-104</italic> phenotypes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). We feel that experiments with <italic>wnd</italic> heterozyogotes would not really add much more to this paper, especially since it is not clear in our data that removal of one copy of <italic>wnd</italic> leads to a 50% reduction of Wnd levels in all cell types.</p><p>The reviewer may instead be referring to double-heterozygote experiments, which can be helpful for revealing relationships in a linear pathway via their sensitivity to gene dosage of both factors. This kind of analysis is more do-able when both genes have similar loss-of-function phenotypes. However <italic>unc-104</italic> and <italic>wnd</italic> mutants have opposite <italic>loss-of-function</italic> phenotypes, so we’re not sure what we would learn from a double heterozygote.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An electrophysiological analysis was conducted in hiw mutants (where Wnd levels are increased), but should be completed in wnd overexpression lines to more directly test the hypothesis that increased Wnd explains functional defects in unc-104 mutants. Here, the authors present the surprising result that wnd suppresses the physiological defect in hiw mutants. This is in contrast to results published in an earlier paper with overlapping authors (Collins et al., 2006). They suggest the difference may be due to the use of different wnd alleles, but this needs to be addressed experimentally given the importance of wnd suppression phenotypes to this work and the high impact of the previously published result that is called into question.</p> </disp-quote><p>The main point to communicate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is that ectopic activation of Wnd alone is sufficient to induce defects in synapse structure and function. We think that the suggested physiology characterization for <italic>wnd</italic> over-expression could further and more simply support this point. These experiments should be complete-able in a relatively short time frame, so we will aim to add this data to the revised manuscript. If we can indeed include this data, then we may then want to move the <italic>hiw</italic> data to supplemental data, where the partial differences with the 2006 study are less distracting.</p><p>While <italic>hiw</italic> mutants (and <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants) show mild reductions in quantal content, they are significantly reduced for mini frequency. The observation that <italic>wnd</italic> mutations suppress <italic>hiw</italic>’s defect in mini frequency are actually conserved between both our observations and the previous 2006 study. The single difference is that the 2006 study did not reveal a suppression of the defect in quantal content, while ours does. We would indeed like to understand this better – resolving the differences will require repeating exactly the same allele combinations in our own conditions for comparison. This is do-able and we are willing to do it. The main point of this would be to provide further context for previous observations in the field rather than to further validate the observations we have made here in this paper (which we see for two allelic combinations and are consistent with the morphological data).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given that synaptic function is fully suppressed in hypomorphs, it is surprising that locomotion and viability show little improvement. This disconnect should be further addressed by evaluating the relevant allelic combinations, not just RNAi. Relatedly, how is there so much movement in double null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) when there is essentially no SV transport to AZs?</p> </disp-quote><p>Actually, neither of these results are surprising.</p><p>Our study indicates that the effects of Wnd signaling (which is activated in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants and is responsible for many interesting synaptic phenotypes) are separable from a primary function for Unc-104 in transporting SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, Unc-104/KIF1A has many other proposed roles, including regulation of autophagy (Stavoe et al., 2016), lysosome transport (Guardia et al., 2016), insulin secretion (Cao et al., 2014), and cell migration (Carabalona et al., 2016). It would be presumptuous to assume or expect that we could completely rescue lethality in these animals, which are quite defective in many aspects. Likewise for locomotion: while we see strong phenotypes at the NMJ synapse, this is not the only synapse that animals need for locomotion. It is remarkable that we see ANY improvement in locomotion and viability.</p><p>For the <italic>unc-104-null</italic> mutants, the rescue is also extremely mild and we state this in the text (Subsection “Wnd inhibits synapse assembly independently of cargo transport downstream of Unc-104”). Perhaps the strong difference in bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref> give an impression there is a stronger suppression. However note that this is simply the “percentage of animals showing muscle movement” not the actual ‘degree’ of movement, and the movement is observed only immediately after the animals hatch. They die soon thereafter.</p><p>We worry based on these points and also the summary statement that these ‘modest’ or ‘inconsistent’ effects upon lethality and motility were a primary criticism for the paper. Therefore it is important to clarify that these effects are consistent with the model we present in the paper (if they were stronger they would actually argue against it). The ‘modest’ rescue of lethality should not diminish the importance of our findings, which identify specific cellular roles for Wnd in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It was cumbersome to parse through the data as presented in 21 figures (9 main plus 12 supplemental) including 2 separate model figures.</p> </disp-quote><p>We appreciate the efforts from the reviewer to evaluate all of the data, and their feedback has helped us see how we might be able to improve the writing to make the paper less cumbersome to read.

Filling this gap is likely beyond the scope of the current work and not necessary to merit publication in eLife, but there are several points that the authors could address based on their current approaches:</p> </disp-quote><p>We are glad that reviewer 2 shares the same point of view with us in both strengths and one weakness. We also agree that this weakness is beyond the scope and not necessary for our current work to be published. The reviewer’s suggestions listed below are fair and we are ready to address all of these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) It is important for the authors to quantify Wnd-MiMIC levels in the neuronal cell bodies (akin to the way they quantified UAS-WnkKD in supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). They should also explain why they used the kinase dead version and whether they believe it behaves differently from wild type Wnd.</p></disp-quote><p>The quantification of Wnd-MiMIC levels can certainly be included in the revised manuscript. Ectopic expression of Wnd (lacking the kinase mutation) leads to lethality and technical complications. We can also add additional information about the Wnd-kinase-dead (KD) transgene, which has been used in previous studies to uncover biologically important mechanisms of regulation (Collins et al., 2006; Xiong et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2016). See also our discussion to reviewer 1’s point B, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors present hiw data but do not address hiw function in their model or discussion. The authors should measure hiw RNA and/or protein levels in Unc-104 mutants to ask if hiw is contributing to the phenotype. If hiw protein (but not RNA) is downregulated in the unc-104 mutant, it might suggest that autophagy-mediated degradation of Hiw (as per Shen et al., 2009), and perhaps other synaptic proteins, underlies the regulatory mechanism by which unc-104 constrains synaptic protein levels in response to cell body accumulation of cargo. This could be simply tested by evaluating the amount and distribution of an autophagy flux marker such as ATG8-GFP-mCherry.</p> </disp-quote><p>These interesting suggestions center around the goal of understanding whether Hiw, a major known regulator of Wnd, plays a role in Wnd’s activation in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants. Based on several observations thus far (some in the manuscript and some yet unpublished), we think that loss of Hiw function is unlikely to explain or mediate the activation of Wnd in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants.</p><p>1) The effects of <italic>hiw</italic> and <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants upon the levels and localization of Wnd are strikingly different: in <italic>hiw</italic> mutants, the levels of Wnd are strongly elevated throughout the animal and this elevated Wnd protein is observed to localizes to synapses and neuropil (Collins et al., 2006, and also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants cause more modest changes to Wnd protein and levels, and these changes are only observed in cell bodies, not synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and supplements).</p><p><italic>2) hiw</italic> mutants show a strong delay in axonal degeneration (Xiong et al., 2012; Babetto et al., 2013). However we found no delay to degeneration in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants (unpublished).</p><p>3) Western blot results did not show an obvious reduction in Hiw protein level when <italic>unc-104</italic> is knocked down (unpublished).</p><p>The potential role of autophagy is an interesting topic to further understand. Thus far we have found that null mutations in <italic>atg7</italic> and knock-down of atg13 or Fip200 in neurons, which are critical for different stages of autophagy (Fougeray and Pallet, 2015), did not alter Wnd signaling using <italic>puc</italic>-lacZ as a reporter (unpublished). This runs a bit counter to predications suggested by the Shen et al., 2009 study. So more needs to be done to sort this out and this is a topic for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The observation that ectopic overexpression of Brp, SytI and VGlut leads to increased puc-lacZ reporter signal begs the question whether this also triggers changes in Wnd (or hiw) levels or localization, as these results could provide more insight into the mechanism via which Unc-104 deficits lead to Wnd activation.</p> </disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion but a negative or mild result could occur simply because the effect of overexpressing a single pre-synaptic protein does not activate the pathway to the same extent, so would not be useful in ruling out a model. We appreciate that the reviewer acknowledges that filling the gap of HOW Unc-104 regulates Wnd signaling ‘is likely beyond the scope of the current work and not necessary to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>’.

We propose an idea that Wnd pathway activation is sensitive to build-up of Unc-104’s cargos. However this is the speculative idea in the paper, which is framed as a model for thinking about the data as a whole, combined with other observations in the field. It is not the primary goal of the paper to reach this idea as a ‘conclusion’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The measurement for Wnd activity mostly relied on induction of a puc-LacZ reporter in the soma, and morphological changes of NMJ terminals.</p> </disp-quote><p>In addition we showed an induction of Wnd protein levels and localization in motoneurons using two independent reagents/methods (endogenous MiMIC-tagged Wnd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B-C</xref>) and ectopically expressed GFP-Wnd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>), and extensive genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> with accompanying supplements). Importantly, the genetic interactions include suppression of NMJ phenotypes in <italic>unc-104</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and accompanying supplement), which suggests that Wnd functions downstream of Unc-104 to mediate major aspects of the synaptic phenotype.

However the point that “the paper feels like a catalog of correlative connections, missing conceptual depth” is not well explained with sufficient points for us to understand how this conclusion is reached.

However all of these data are helpful for reaching our understanding of the relationship between Unc-104 and Wnd. Importantly, all of these “modest” effects are consistent with the model we propose, and none are essential for the primary conclusions of the paper. Reasons for “modest effects are discussed in points C and 3 from reviewer 1. Due to the misunderstandings reflected in the comments, we plan in revision to do a better job with the writing to make these reasons clear up front, so that is easier for readers to follow the expectations for individual experiments and how they build upon one another.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Their observation that Wnd suppresses the lethality of unc-104 mutants is the key observation led to this study. But it is not clear whether this suppression is directly caused at the level of presynaptic transport. Does inhibition of Wnd downstream factors, JNK and FOS, also suppress unc-104 lethality? In subsection “Wnd inhibits synapse assembly independently of cargo transport downstream of Unc-104” the final sentence of the second paragraph seems to state that &quot;most or all&quot; unc-104; wnd mutants actually die. Is the suppression of lethality rather minor?</p> </disp-quote><p>There is a significant misunderstanding here: the suppression of lethality data is NOT a ‘key observation’ in this study!

However we already have other data that more directly shows this point, so we could simply remove this data without impacting our conclusions for this paper. It may still be useful for the field have the regeneration data included for information that it may add to other published studies.

All of our data, combined with other data in the field for Wnd/DLK function in flies and worms, suggest its activity is restrained to very low levels in ‘normal’ wild type uninjured animals. Most previous work in the field has focused on Wnd/DLK’s role in injured neurons (when it is activated). There has previously been no supporting data (in flies or worms) to indicate that Wnd also functions in uninjured animals.

Because of the major transport defects in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants, it is unlikely that Wnd localization and levels in the double mutant would resemble the <italic>hiw</italic> single mutant. Instead it is quite likely that one would observe increased levels of Wnd (due to loss of <italic>hiw</italic> function) AND an in increase in levels of Wnd in the cell body which occurs in the <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants. This kind of data would not help us distinguish whether Unc-104 and Hiw regulate Wnd through a common pathway or parallel pathways.</p><p>However to address the general question we could include some more discussion about potential relationships between Hiw and Unc-104.

We wondered whether Wnd signaling ever plays a similar role in wild type animals.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that while Wnd/DLK signaling becomes activated in injured neurons, it is normally highly restrained in uninjured animals (Collins et al., 2006; Xiong et al., 2010), and, in contrast to its essential role in responses to axonal injury, roles for Wnd in developmental axonal outgrowth or synapse formation have not been previously described (Collins et al., 2006). Importantly, the function of the Wnd signaling pathway had not previously been examined at the critical developmental stages of synapse formation, due to the technical challenges of dissecting late-stage embryos (whose diameter is approximately the size of two human hairs).

We argued in our appeal that this difference does not negate the model: since very little is known about how different AZ and SV proteins are regulated developmentally, there is no reason to predict or expect that Brp levels would be sufficiently high in stage 15-17 animals to be subject to restraint by Wnd signaling.</p><p>Since our observations with Brp did not negate the model but instead opened up new questions, we realized that it is more distracting than it is useful given our current state of knowledge.

It will be interesting to determine whether translation and/or autophagy contribute to the regulation of presynaptic proteins by Wnd signaling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Wnd null mutants alone should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> for comparison in this specific assay.</p> </disp-quote><p>Our revision includes these controls side-by-side in the figures for comparison.

[…]Taken together with the rescue of <italic>unc-104</italic> synaptic defects by <italic>wnd</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), these data indicate that activation of Wnd signaling leads to strong perturbations in presynaptic structure and function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Addressing the discrepancy with previous results (Collins 2006) on Wnd suppression of the hiw phenotype will be also be important.</p> </disp-quote><p>First, it is important to clarify that our cumulative electrophysiological observations in the paper suggest that activation of the Wnd pathway does not strongly impair quantal content. Instead, the strongest and most salient defect caused by Wnd pathway activation is a reduction in spontaneous mEJP frequency. The frequency of detectable mEJP events was reduced in <italic>unc-104<sup>bris/P350</sup></italic> and <italic>hiw<sup>ΔN</sup></italic> mutants by ~70% and ~80%, respectively, and this defect was fully suppressed by mutations in <italic>wnd</italic> as well as downstream signaling components <italic>bsk</italic> and <italic>fos</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Also, mEJP frequency becomes strongly reduced when Wnd is ectopically expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>). We also observed modest but statistically significant reductions in mEJP amplitude mediated by Wnd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations are consistent with the data reported for Wnd-mediated synaptic transmission defects in <italic>hiw<sup>ND8</sup></italic> mutants in the 2006 study. The 2006 study did not quantify mEJP frequency, but the effect is apparent in the published traces, and is now quantified in our partial repeat of that data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The only difference between our findings and the 2006 study was that the 2006 study showed that <italic>wnd</italic> mutations failed to suppress <italic>hiw</italic> defects in quantal content, while our data suggested that quantal content defects may be partially suppressed by <italic>wnd</italic> mutations. The two studies used different alleles of <italic>hiw</italic> and <italic>wnd</italic>, so to understand the basis for the differences, we carried out additional electrophysiology recordings for multiple allele combinations for side-by-side comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Confirming/repeating the 2006 result, <italic>hiw<sup>ND8</sup>; wnd<sup>1/2</sup></italic> double mutants showed the same defects in quantal content as <italic>hiw<sup>ND8</sup></italic> mutants alone. The partial rescue by <italic>wnd<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>/Df</italic> mutations in <italic>hiw<sup>ΔN</sup></italic>mutants is only of borderline significance (it was more significant when we used higher calcium bathing solution in our first submission). We noted that <italic>hiw<sup>ΔN</sup></italic>, which is a true null allele (Wu et al., 2005) showed a slightly lower quantal content than <italic>hiw <sup>ND8</sup></italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests the potential for a modest role of Wnd in the <italic>hiw<sup>ΔN</sup></italic> quantal content phenotype, however further controls would be needed to fully address this possibility.</p><p>As discussed above, in contrast with the reduced mEJP frequency and mEJP size, altered quantal content is not a strong feature of Wnd pathway activation. So we have focused our conclusions in this study to the effect of Wnd pathway upon spontaneous rather than evoked neurotransmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, experiments to address the cellular function of hiw would be nice but are not essential to the main interesting points of the paper. If the authors have the data or a more clear model of the role of hiw, it would be helpful to include, but we don't think it's necessary.</p> </disp-quote><p>We have provided a more clear discussion of the differences between <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants and <italic>hiw</italic> mutants:</p><p>Quoting from subsection “Wnd protein is mislocalized to the cell body in unc-104 mutants”:</p><p><italic>… “</italic>Mutations in <italic>hiw</italic> lead to strongly elevated levels of Wnd protein whose localization can be detected in neurites and at synapses (Collins et al., 2006). […] These observations suggest that the mechanism of Wnd signaling activation in <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants is unlikely to occur via Hiw.”</p><p>Interestingly, the activation of Wnd signaling in mutants for the spectroplakin shortstop (<italic>shot)</italic>(Valakh et al., 2013) bears more resemblance to <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants. (That is, in contrast to <italic>hiw</italic> mutants, and similarly to <italic>unc-104</italic> mutants, <italic>shot</italic> mutants also do not cause global increases in Wnd protein levels (Valakh et al., 2013)). Another recent study suggests that <italic>shot, unc-104</italic>, and <italic>tau</italic> mutants may influence a similar pathway (Voelzmann et al., 2016). This suggests a possibility that <italic>unc-104</italic> and <italic>shot</italic> mutants (which likely disrupt neuronal cytoskeleton) may share a similar mechanism of Wnd signaling activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The rescue of the axon regrowth phenotype are not critical for the main conclusions of the paper and could take a lot of time.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point.
