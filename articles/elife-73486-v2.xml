Essential components include collagen IV and laminins, which are affected by human genetic variants leading to a range of debilitating conditions including kidney, muscle, and cerebrovascular phenotypes. We investigated the dynamics of BM assembly in human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids. We resolved their global BM composition and discovered a conserved temporal sequence in BM assembly that paralleled mammalian fetal kidneys. We identified the emergence of key BM isoforms, which were altered by a pathogenic variant in <italic>COL4A5</italic>. Integrating organoid, fetal, and adult kidney proteomes, we found dynamic regulation of BM composition through development to adulthood, and with single-cell transcriptomic analysis we mapped the cellular origins of BM components. Overall, we define the complex and dynamic nature of kidney organoid BM assembly and provide a platform for understanding its wider relevance in human development and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Basement membranes (BMs) surround tissues providing cells with an interface for physical and signaling interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jayadev and Sherwood, 2017</xref>). They are composed of laminins, collagen IV, nidogens, heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kruegel and Miosge, 2010</xref>), and many minor components that combine to form biochemically distinct BMs across different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Randles et al., 2017</xref>). BMs play active morphogenic roles that are critical for tissue and cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kyprianou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2003</xref>), and variants in BM genes are associated with a broad range of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chew and Lennon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatseva et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the increasing knowledge of BM composition and function, there is limited understanding about BM regulation, yet this is required for new mechanistic insights into BM-associated human disease.</p><p>BMs form early in embryogenesis through binding interactions with cell surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miner and Yurchenco, 2004</xref>) and typically an initial laminin network is required for further incorporation of collagen IV, nidogen, and perlecan into nascent BMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jayadev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsubayashi et al., 2017</xref>), thus following an assembly hierarchy for <italic>de novo</italic> BM formation. BMs are also highly dynamic, remodeling during morphogenesis to form tissue-specific BMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnans et al., 2014</xref>), such as the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidney, which functions as a size-selective filter. Situated between podocytes and endothelial cells in the glomerular capillary wall, the GBM is formed by the fusion of separate podocyte and endothelial BMs, and further remodeled into a mature GBM. This involves replacement of laminin α1β1γ1 (termed laminin-111) and collagen IV α1α1α2 networks by laminin-511 then -521, and collagen IV α3α4α5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abrahamson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamson and St John, 1993</xref>). These transitions are important for long-term GBM function, and genetic variants in <italic>COL4A3, COL4A4,</italic> and <italic>COL4A5</italic> or the laminin gene <italic>LAMB2</italic> cause defective GBMs and human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zenker et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The study of BM assembly is challenging due to the technical difficulties in tracking large, spatiotemporally regulated components. Most understanding about vertebrate BMs comes from immunolocalization and genetic knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abrahamson et al., 2013</xref>), and for composition, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has enabled global analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Naba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randles et al., 2015</xref>). Proteomics also allows time course studies, which have provided insight into matrix dynamics during development and in disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hebert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lipp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Naba et al., 2017</xref>). However, proteomics lacks the spatial context that is captured by localization studies, including fluorescent tagging of endogenous proteins. Such investigations in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> have unraveled dynamic features of BM assembly in embryogenesis and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keeley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsubayashi et al., 2020</xref>). The development of a system to study human BM assembly would thereby facilitate investigation of both morphogenesis and disease.</p><p>Kidney organoids generated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) contain self-organized 3D structures with multiple kidney cell types and represent an attractive system for investigating early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Combes et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takasato et al., 2015</xref>). Organoids derived from induced PSCs (iPSCs), reprogrammed from patient somatic cells, have further use in personalized disease modeling and therapy screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Czerniecki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forbes et al., 2018</xref>). The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, and during differentiation, kidney organoids pattern into early nephron structures with clusters of podocytes and endothelial cells, and a complex tubular epithelial system. Furthermore, organoids show transcriptomic homology to the first trimester human fetal kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takasato et al., 2015</xref>), and differentiation is further advanced by in vivo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bantounas et al., 2018</xref>). Whilst understanding about cell types in kidney organoids has progressed significantly, there is a knowledge gap about extracellular matrix (ECM) and BM assembly during differentiation.</p><p>We investigated BM assembly during kidney development using organoids and fetal kidney tissue. With proteomics, we defined a complex sequence of BM assembly during organoid differentiation and demonstrated the utility of this experimental system for investigating BM remodeling in both early development and human disease. Furthermore, we compared by proteomics the organoid matrix to embryonic day (E19) mouse kidney and adult human kidney matrix, and defined the cellular origins of BM components through transcriptomic analyses. Overall, we demonstrate that kidney organoids represent a high-fidelity system to study the dynamics of human BM assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kidney organoids form BM networks that are altered with defective <italic>COL4A5</italic></title><p>To improve the understanding of BM assembly and regulation, we investigated human kidney organoids. We differentiated wild-type iPSCs into intermediate mesoderm cells in 2D culture, and then to 3D kidney organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We confirmed differentiation to glomerular clusters (WT1<sup>+</sup>/NPHS1<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>+</sup>) and CDH1<sup>+</sup> tubular structures in day 18 organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and comparable morphology to mouse and human fetal kidney tissues. Day 11 organoids had cell clusters amongst mesenchymal tissue, and at day 14, discernible nephron-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At day 18, organoids had regions resembling the nephrogenic zone found at E19 in the mouse and between 8 and 10 weeks post conception (wpc) in human, but lacked distinct corticomedullary differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). By immunofluorescence, we verified the localization of BM integrin receptors adjacent to laminin<sup>+</sup> BM-like structures at day 25 of organoid differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Principal component analysis highlighted discreet clustering for the organoid timepoints based on matrix protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). There was an increase in abundance of matrix components from day 14 to 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and 203 of all matrix proteins found in the organoids (~90%) were detectable at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This initial analysis thus confirmed a gradual assembly of matrix during organoid differentiation. To address global BM composition, we identified BM proteins using the comprehensive BM gene network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jayadev et al., 2021</xref>) curated in <italic>basement membrane</italic>BASE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bmbasedb.manchester.ac.uk/">https://bmbasedb.manchester.ac.uk/</ext-link>). The organoid extracellular fraction was enriched for BM proteins compared to the cellular fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which was expected as these are large, highly cross-linked proteins, and hence, difficult to solubilize. Furthermore, we observed an increasing trend for BM protein levels through day 14 to 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), again indicating BM deposition over time and corroborating our immunofluorescence findings. In total, we identified 78 BM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), including abundant components that are deposited early in kidney morphogenesis (e.g., COL4A1, COL4A2, LAMA1, LAMB1, LAMC1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

These included 83 BM proteins, and the most abundant were those seen early (COL4A1, COL4A2, COL18A1, LAMB1, LAMC1) and later (LAMA5) in kidney BM assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As with kidney organoids, we found an enrichment for BM proteins in the ECM fraction obtained from the mouse fetal kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We next compared these findings to an E18.5 mouse kidney proteomic dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lipp et al., 2021</xref>) and found considerable identification overlap, with a further 130 matrix protein detected in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), including key GBM components COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5, and also COL4A6. We then compared the BM proteins detected in each organoid time point with the E19 mouse kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and found the highest overlap (58.4%) between E19 and day 25 kidney organoids. In line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hale et al., 2018</xref>), this comparison highlighted later expression of TINAG and TINAGL1 in day 25 organoids, also detected in the E19 mouse kidneys but not in day 14 or day 18 organoids.

In addition, the overlap of other structural and matrix-associated proteins was lower than for BM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which highlights conservation of BM composition between mouse and kidney organoids. To further verify similarities, we performed a Spearman’s rank correlation and found that E19 mouse kidneys had the higher correlation with more differentiated organoids (i.e., days 18 and 25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Basement membranes in mouse fetal kidneys are comparable to kidney organoids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the E19 mouse kidney sampled for mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, and a Venn diagram showing the overlap for matrix proteins identified in the cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) fractions.

Many of these processes require spatiotemporal assembly and remodeling of BMs throughout nephrogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Here, we demonstrate the fidelity of human kidney organoids as a system for investigating assembly and regulation of kidney BMs in health and disease with the following key findings: (1) the identification of a conserved sequence of BM component assembly during kidney organoid differentiation, (2) evidence of global BM dynamics during organoid differentiation with high correlation to fetal kidney BM composition, and (3) the diversification of the cellular origin of BM components during kidney development.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Overview of the developmental milestones in human and mouse kidney morphogenesis and a comparison to human kidney organoids.</title><p>Differentiation is dated in in weeks post conception (wpc) for human, embryonic days (E) for mouse, and in days of differentiation for kidney organoids; and measures (cm or mm) indicate specimen size in each model. Three sets of embryonic kidneys develop in mammals in a temporal sequence: from the pronephros to the mesonephros (both temporary), and then to the metanephros (permanent). Metanephric nephron formation (nephrogenesis) commences in humans at 5 wpc, in mice at E10.5, and in kidney organoid from day 11, when laminin starts to deposit as basement membrane networks. Following the same developmental stage in human and mouse kidneys, kidney organoids start to form discernible renal vesicles at day 14, and distinct comma- and S-shaped bodies at day 18; day 25 organoids, which most closely resemble late capillary loop stage nephrons in vivo, comprise more mature structures including glomeruli with capillary lumens, proximal tubules, and distal tubules. Meanwhile, a conserved sequence of basement membrane assembly is detected in kidney organoids, and laminin and collagen IV developmental isoform transitions are identified between day 14 and day 25.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73486-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>BMs are complex structures, and proteomic studies have highlighted this complexity in homeostasis and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lennon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randles et al., 2015</xref>). During development, BMs are also highly dynamic and undergo intense remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kyprianou et al., 2020</xref>), but understanding of BM assembly and regulation is limited by the lack of appropriate systems to track components that are spatiotemporally regulated and undergo turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naylor et al., 2021</xref>). Human fetal tissue has limited availability and developmental studies are restricted to static time points, and the technical limitations of imaging in mouse models also difficult the investigation of the dynamic BM environment in vivo. However, BM studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> have provided important insights into BM dynamics and turnover using fluorescent tagging of endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keeley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsubayashi et al., 2020</xref>), and these studies highlight the power of studying BM dynamics.</p><p>Despite the developmental limitations with iPSC-derived kidney organoids, including lack of features such as directional cues, vascularization, and cortical-medullary segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romero-Guevara et al., 2020</xref>), this system has morphological and molecular features comparable to fetal kidney tissue that overcome species differences and provides a complex in vitro environment to examine BM assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bantounas et al., 2018</xref>). We demonstrated that kidney organoids differentiate into glomerular structures containing the cells required for GBM assembly, andother single-cell transcriptomic studies have also shown over 20 other distinct cell populations present in kidney organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Combes et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Cross-talk between different cell types is essential for BM assembly and influences its composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Byron et al., 2014</xref>), hence, the multiple cell types in the organoid system enable BM formation and remodeling. A key finding from this study is that organoids form BMs early during differentiation and, more importantly, recapitulate a sequence of BM assembly events with initial deposition of laminin followed by incorporation of collagen IV, nidogen, and perlecan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasaki et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Kidney organoids have also provided new insights into disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rooney et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanigawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian and Lennon, 2019</xref>). We found that kidney organoids with a pathological missense variant in <italic>COL4A5</italic> differentiated and deposited core BM proteins, including a collagen IV α3α4α5 network, which is described in missense variant cases. In one study, 64 out of 146 patients with X-linked AS had the collagen IV α5 chain in the GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamamura et al., 2020a</xref>). Despite evidence of protein secretion, the GBM fails to maintain function in these patients. Interestingly, we found increased deposition of LAMB2 in extraglomerular BMs in our Alport organoids. Dysregulation of glomerular laminins, including LAMB2, in patients with AS and animal models has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrahamson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kashtan et al., 2001</xref>), but the mechanisms for this are unclear. Our findings in Alport organoids demonstrate the utility of this system to dissect abnormal mechanisms of BM assembly.</p><p>To define global BM composition in kidney organoids, we used MS-based proteomics and identified 78 BM proteins dynamically expressed throughout the kidney organoid differentiation time course. Core GBM components including laminin-521 and collagen IV α3α4α5, which only appear in mature glomeruli, were also detected. Developmental isoform transitions in the GBM involving laminin and collagen IV are described in humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamson and St John, 1993</xref>), and in the current understanding, immature glomeruli assemble a primary GBM containing laminin-111 and collagen IV α1α2α1 that is later replaced, respectively, by laminin-521 and collagen IV α3α4α5 in mature glomeruli. In keeping with these observations, we found a temporal and spatial emergence of mature collagen IV and laminin isoforms within glomerular structures in kidney organoids, and in a reanalysis of publicly available scRNA-seq data, we confirmed podocyte expression of mature GBM markers. These findings demonstrate that kidney organoids can efficiently recapitulate the spatiotemporal emergence of GBM components. The triggers for GBM isoform switching remain unknown, but two regulators, LMX1b and EPB41L5, have been implicated in this. Studies in <italic>Lmxb1</italic> knockout mice suggest that podocyte expression of this transcription factor is not essential for initial GBM assembly but is linked to <italic>Col4a3</italic>/<italic>Col4a4</italic> expression during glomerulogenesis as demonstrated by reduced collagen IV α3α4α5 network in the GBM in null <italic>Lmxb1</italic> newborn mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morello et al., 2001</xref>). We found podocyte-specific expression of <italic>LMX1b</italic>/<italic>COL4A3</italic>/<italic>COL4A4</italic> in day 25 kidney organoids and, moreover, confirmed deposition of COL4A3/COL4A4 in a GBM pattern within NPHS2<sup>+</sup>-glomerular structures in these organoids. In addition, podocyte expression of EPB41L5, a component of the podocyte integrin adhesion complex, was linked to GBM assembly in vivo and incorporation of laminin-511/521 into podocyte-derived extracellular BM networks in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maier et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we detected EPB41L5 in kidney organoid and mouse proteomic datasets, with cell expression patterns matching that of <italic>LAMA5</italic>, indicating the potential for this system to unravel further insights into GBM regulation.</p><p>There are a few proteomic studies addressing the spatiotemporal changes in BM during development. One study of mouse kidney development defined the global ECM composition through development to adulthood and described a sequence of changes in the interstitial matrix over development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lipp et al., 2021</xref>). With our sample fractionation strategy and analytical pipeline, we detected a further 130 matrix proteins, including key GBM components (COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5) and BM regulators such as PAPLN and HMCN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keeley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morrissey et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings further demonstrated that late-stage kidney organoids (at day 25) and mouse kidneys at E19 share a very comparable BM protein profile. We also verified similar patterns of BM gene expression between kidney organoids and human and mouse fetal kidneys, especially for collagen IV and laminin isoforms. Overall, these data demonstrate the high fidelity with which kidney organoids recapitulate BM gene expression and protein composition seen in vivo. Thus, we conclude that kidney organoids are a highly tractable model that can be used to study the dynamic nature of human BM assembly in both health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Whole-blood PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll-Paque (GE17-1440, GE Healthcare) and grown in StemSpan Erythroid Expansion Medium (02692, STEMCELL Technologies) for 8 days before being transduced using CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai virus (A16517, Invitrogen) and grown on vitronectin (A14700, Gibco)-coated plates in ReproTeSR medium (05926, STEMCELL Technologies). When large enough, colonies were manually isolated and grown in TeSR-E8 medium (05991, STEMCELL Technologies). iPSCs derived from patients with AS (see ‘Clinical presentation’) were generated at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, in collaboration with the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative (HipSci, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hipsci.org/">https://www.hipsci.org/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kilpinen et al., 2017</xref>). Following ethical approval (REC reference 11/H1003/3) and patient consent, dermal fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies and programmed to iPSC. For this study, we investigated three members of the same family: a male index patient and his mother carrying a likely pathogenic <italic>COL4A5</italic> variant (c.3695G&gt;A; p.Gly1232Asp, PM1_strong, PM2_moderate, PM5_moderate, PP3_moderate, posterior probability 0.988) and a <italic>COL4A4</italic> variant of uncertain significance (c.3286C&gt;T; p.Pro1096Ser, PM2_moderate, PP3_moderate, posterior probability 0.5), and his sister carrying only the <italic>COL4A5</italic> variant. All human cell lines have been authenticated using short tandem repeat profiling. All experiments were performed with mycoplasma-free cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Clinical presentation</title><p>The male index patient, aged 4, presented with recurrent episodes of macroscopic hematuria and persistent microscopic hematuria, and his mother also exhibited microscopic hematuria. He underwent a kidney biopsy, which had normal appearances by light microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis did not show glomerular deposition of immunoreactants. By electron microscopy, the GBM was thinned in some glomerular capillary loops. In one or two others, the GBM was irregularly thickened with lamination. There were also electron-lucent lacunae between the laminations, some of which contained electron-dense regions, and the ultrastructural changes, in combination with the highly suggestive presentation and family history, confirmed a diagnosis of AS. The patient subsequently developed hypertension and was treated with antihypertensive medications, including renin-angiotensin system blockade, and exhibited slow decline in his kidney function. He eventually progressed to end-stage kidney disease and received a preemptive kidney transplant from his healthy father at the age of 19. Subsequent genetic testing identified a likely pathogenic missense variant in <italic>COL4A5</italic> (c.3695G&gt;A; p.Gly1232Asp) and a variant of unknown significance in <italic>COL4A4</italic> (c.3286C&gt;T; p.Pro1096Ser). Further genetic testing in the family confirmed that both the patient’s mother and sister carried one or both variants. His mother had both the <italic>COL4A5</italic> and <italic>COL4A4</italic> variants and exhibited persistent microscopic hematuria and urine protein:creatinine ratios (uPCRs) ranging from 17 to 30 mg/mmol and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) steady between 74 and85 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area over 5 years to most recent follow-up aged 55. The index patient’s sister shared only the <italic>COL4A5</italic> variant and exhibited persistent hematuria with proteinuria (uPCR 264 mg/mmol falling to 45–89 mg/mmol on institution of renin-angiotensin system blockade aged 25). Serum creatinine was normal with eGFR &gt; 90 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area at last follow-up aged 30. The <italic>COL4A4</italic> variant was also detected in the index case’s healthy maternal grandmother (in whom urinalysis was normal), but the <italic>COL4A5</italic> variant was absent from both maternal grandparents, suggesting a <italic>de novo</italic> variant in his mother. Pathogenicity was assessed following ACMG coding criteria (<italic>COL4A5</italic> variant: PM1_STR, PM2_MOD, PM5_MOD, PP3_MOD; <italic>COL4A4</italic> variant: PM2_MOD, PP3_MOD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Kidney organoid differentiation</title><p>We differentiated human iPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) to 3D kidney organoids as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takasato et al., 2015</xref>). iPSCs were maintained at 37°C in TeSR-E8 medium with 25× Supplement (05991, 05992, STEMCELL Technologies) in six-well plates (3516, Corning) coated with vitronectin (A14700, Gibco).

Intermediate mesoderm induction was performed by changing medium after 24 hr to STEMdiff APEL 2 (05270, STEMCELL) with 3% protein-free hybridoma medium (12040077, Gibco) and 8 μM CHIR99021 (4423/10, Tocris Bioscience) for 4 days. On day 5, CHIR99021 was replaced by 200 ng/ml FGF-9 (100-23, PeproTech) and 1 μg/ml heparin (H3393, Sigma-Aldrich). On day 7, cells were dissociated with TrypLE, counted and pelletized into organoids (250,000 cells each) by centrifuging them at 400 × <italic>g</italic>/min four times. Organoids were carefully placed on 0.4 μm Millicell Cell Culture Insert in six-well plates (PICM0RG50, Millipore) and cultured for 1 hr in APEL 2 medium with 5 μM CHIR99021 and subsequently in APEL 2 medium supplemented with 200 ng/ml FGF9 and 1 μg/ml heparin until day 11. From day 12, organoids were grown in STEMdiff APEL 2 without growth factors, with medium changed every 2 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mice</title><p>All mouse handling and experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences (ICB), University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil (reference 019/2015).

Mating occurred overnight, and females were checked for vaginal plugs on the next morning to determine if mating had occurred and gestation was timed accordingly (E1). Pregnant dams were separated and kept in individual cages (30 × 20 × 13 cm) under the same conditions mentioned previously. Fetuses were collected on E19, following C-section surgery in the pregnant mice under anesthesia with 25 mg/kg avertin (T48402, Sigma-Aldrich). Fetal kidneys were dissected and processed for histological analysis or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for proteomic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Whole-mount immunofluorescence</title><p>Whole organoids were fixed with 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 20 min, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; D8537, Sigma-Aldrich) and blocked with 1× casein blocking buffer (B6429, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2  hr at room temperature. Samples were incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. After thoroughly washing with 0.3% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in PBS, the samples were incubated at 4°C overnight with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 solution (B2261, Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were mounted in glass-bottomed dishes (P35G-1.5-10C, MatTek) with ProLong Gold Antifade mountant (P36934, Invitrogen) and imaged with a Leica TCS SP8 AOBS inverted confocal microscope using hybrid detectors with the following detection mirror settings: FITC 494–530 nm; Texas red 602–665 nm; Cy5 640–690 nm. When it was not possible to eliminate fluorescence cross-talk, the images were collected sequentially. When acquiring 3D optical stacks, the confocal software was used to determine the optimal number of Z sections. Only the maximum intensity projections of these 3D stacks are shown in the results. 3D image stacks were analyzed with ImageJ v 1.53g software (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>, 1997–2018).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology and immunofluorescence</title><p>For light microscopy, FFPE sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for morphological analysis.

Sections were collected onto sticky 0.5 ml microtube caps (Molecular Machines and Industries) and stored at –80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Trypsin digestion</title><p>For in-gel digestion, protein samples from E19 mouse kidneys were briefly subjected to SDS-PAGE to concentrate proteins in the gel top and stained with Expedeon InstantBlue (Z2, Fisher Scientific). After distaining, gel-top protein bands were sliced and transferred to a V-bottomed perforated 96-wells plate (Proxeon) and incubated with 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in digestion buffer (25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifuging (1500 rpm for 2 min), gel pieces were shrunk with 50% ACN and completely dried by vacuum centrifugation for 20 min at –120°C. After rehydrating gel pieces, proteins were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT; D5545, Sigma-Aldrich) in digestion buffer for 1 hr at 56°C and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IA; I149, Sigma-Aldrich) in digestion buffer for 45 min at room temperature in the dark and spun down. Gel pieces were shrunk with 100% ACN and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Protein digestion with 1.25 ng/l trypsin (V5111, Promega) was carried out at 37°C overnight, followed by centrifugation to collect the resulting peptides. Finally, samples were dried by vacuum centrifugation and resuspended in 50% ACN in 0.1% formic acid. For in-solution digestion, samples were sonicated in lysis buffer (5% SDS in 50 mM TEAB pH 7.5) using a Covaris LE220+ Focused Ultrasonicator (Covaris), reduced with 5 mM DTT for 10 min at 60°C, and alkylated with 15 mM IA for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. After quenching residual alkylation reaction with 5 mM DTT, samples were spun down, acidified with 1.2% formic acid, and transferred to S-Trap Micro Spin columns (Protifi). Contaminants were removed by centrifugation, and protein digestion with 0.12 g/l trypsin (in 50 mM TEAB buffer) was carried out 1 hr at 47°C. Trapped peptides were thoroughly washed with 50 mM TEAB, spun down, washed with 0.1% formic acid, and eluted from the S-trap columns with 30% ACN in 0.1% formic acid solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Offline peptide desalting</title><p>Peptide samples were incubated with 5.0 mg Oligo R3 reverse-phase beads (1133903, Applied Biosystems) in 50% ACN in a 96-well plate equipped with 0.2 m polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter (3504, Corning). After centrifuging, the bead-bound peptides were washed twice with 0.1% formic acid, spun down, and eluted with 30% ACN in 0.1% formic acid.

Peptides were separated on a CSH C18 analytical column (Waters) using a gradient from 93% A (0.1% formic acid in water) and 7% B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) to 18% B over 57 min followed by a second gradient to 27% B over 14 min both at 300 nl/min. Peptides were selected for fragmentation automatically by data-dependent acquisition. Raw spectra data were acquired and later analyzed using Proteome Discoverer software v.2.3.0.523 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS data were searched against the SwissProt and TrEMBL databases (v. 2018_01; OS = <italic>Mus musculus</italic> for mouse samples; OS = <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> for kidney organoids) using SEQUEST HT and Mascot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.matrixscience.com/">https://www.matrixscience.com/</ext-link>) search tools. Tryptic peptides with <underline>&lt;</underline>1 missed cleavage were considered for the search, and mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions were 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was as fixed modification, oxidation of methionine, proline, and lysine, and N-terminal acetylation as dynamic modifications. False discovery rate (FDR) for peptide/protein identifications was set to 1%, and protein validation was performed using Target/Decoy strategy. Label-free protein abundances were determined based on precursor ion intensity and relative changes in protein abundance by calculating abundance ratios accordingly. Results were filtered for significant FDR master proteins identified with <underline>&gt;</underline>1 unique peptide detected in 2/3 of replicates.

We first removed the low-quality cells from the dataset to ensure that the technical noise does not affect the downstream analysis. We also removed the lowly expressed genes as they do not give much information and are unreliable for downstream statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourgon et al., 2010</xref>). In order to account for the various sequencing depth of each cell, we normalized the raw counts using the deconvolution-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lun et al., 2016a</xref>). We then identified the genes that had high variance in their biological component and used these genes for all downstream analysis. We then applied PCA and took the first 14 components of PCA as input to tSNE and used the first 2 components of tSNE to visualize our cells. The cells were then grouped into their putative clusters using the dynamic tree cut method. We used the <italic>findMarkers</italic> function from <italic>Scran</italic> package to identify the marker genes for each of the clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lun et al., 2016b</xref>). <italic>findMarkers</italic> uses <italic>t</italic>-test for the statistical test and reports <italic>p</italic>-value of the high-rank genes that are differentially expressed between the group and all other groups. These marker genes were then used to manually annotate the cell types of a cluster (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for clustering annotation details). We also applied SingleR to define the cell types based on matched with annotated bulk datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aran et al., 2019</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Martin Pollak as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Yurchenco (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add a figure showing the ultrastructure of day 25 glomeruli by EM.</p><p>2) Please add immunostaining data of the late-stage organoids to demonstrate the distribution pattern of integrins and dystroglycan.</p><p>3) The discussion needs to be expanded to address the following points:</p><p>a) It should more clearly explain what is truly novel here---what is significantly new compared to earlier studies including a 2018 study co-authored by Dr. Lennon.</p><p>b) It should review the strengths and weaknesses of the organoid model, including consideration of the issue of an apparent lack of cell-type specificity of Lma5, Lmb2 and Col-IV a3/a4/a5 staining as it appears in the organoids.</p><p>c) Please comment on what degree the organoid kidney replicates differentiation in mice and humans.</p><p>4) Please add either text and/or a figure that reviews the developmental milestones in kidney morphogenesis, describing/showing how the organoid and in vivo developmental systems compare.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is too long – the Method is far too detailed. Can you please shorten it? For example I don't think you need to include the washing steps or the method for western blots…</p><p>We want to know if you were able to demonstrate an abnormal GBM in the Alport organoid? What did the basement membrane look like?</p><p>Is the organoid a model only for the capillary network or what else does it comprise?</p><p>The Discussion could be more informative. The manuscript does not include a lot of discussion – for example, you do not compare your strategy with what others have done and shown the novelty and the advantage of your method. You also do not consider the limitations of your approach? What were its weaknesses?</p><p>We already know a bit about the expression of the different basement membrane component and the switch – can you emphasise what is novel in your work? The expression of the components is not very novel – it is now available on line in KIT? What do your results add to this?</p><p>You probably do not need to abbreviate basement membrane to BM. Usually we now refer to collagen IV α3 chain rather than collagen α3(IV) chain.</p><p>A diagram of the different stages of kidney development would be useful…with the proteins in control and expressed in each.</p><p>Usually we do not refer to people with a disease as a 'case'. This description of the boy could be much shorter. You have not indicated that you had ethics approval for this?</p><p>You need to describe pathogenic variants using the ACMG criteria to indicate that they are pathogenic. If P1096S is pathogenic then that complicates matters…</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My key suggestion would be to bring out an emphasis that this is a model that best correlates and is applicable to kidney disease, as kidney BMs will have variation from other BMs. This is not a detraction from this work, I think this creates a new stimulus to investigate BMs across tissues and to create tractable models similar to the kidney organoids presented here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The current submissions addresses temporal and tissue-specific BM changes during organoid kidney development. Day 25 kidney organoids contained tubules, stroma, and glomeruli with partial resemblance to (mouse) E19 kidney. Tubular and glomerular BMs are seen to form, the latter showing the expected switch from α-1/β-1 laminins to α-5/β-2 laminins, and alpha1/2 type IV collagens to alpha3-containing type IV collagens required for glomerular maturation.</p><p>Specific questions/comments:</p><p>1. Figure 2 and text: [a] Figure 2A, Microvascular endothelium: A key feature of the study in the replacement of Lm111 by Lm521 and Col-IV alpha1/2 by Col-IV α 3/4/5 in the developing glomerulus. This occurs in normal maturation as the glomerulus gains a vascular tuft. In this study, a regent specific to CD31 (PECAM-1; found on endothelial cells, but also on macrophages, granulocytes) is used to detect endothelial cells. Figure 2A shows increasing CD31 staining at days 11, 18 and 25. While most of the staining at day 25 appears between or at the edges of tubular-like structures, a single narrow stained-streak that co-localizes with laminin is present within a glomerulus. This may reflect the early appearance of a vascular tuft with a laminin coat. Are similar entities present in other glomeruli? If so, it would help to show this. Further, this reviewer feels it is important to show the ultrastructure of such glomeruli to gain insight into the organization (e.g. adjacent cells forming lumens) and surrounding structures of the C31-positive cells. Is there an early electron-dense BM structure lining these cells and, in particular, Are there both podocyte-derived and endothelial cell derived BMs?</p><p>2. If vascular-tuft invasion of day 25 organoid glomeruli is only just beginning to occur (as suggested by the images), does it not follow that this organoid stage corresponds to an earlier mouse stage than that of the E19 mouse fetus? Given mice are born around E19.5 fully capable of forming urine, it is hard to imagine the implied correspondence. Perhaps the day 25 organoids reflect an earlier stage corresponding to the start of vascular invasion of the glomerulus (about E16.5).</p><p>3. Figure 1G: An Alport patient iPSC line with an X-linked missense variant of COL4A5 was also evaluated and it was found that LAMB2 expression was increased in extra-glomerular BM. Such laminin compensation can apparently be seen in patients. The laminin beta2 increase appears to occur in all BMs of the organoids, not just the glomeruli. Is this what is seen in human patients?</p><p>4. Figure 4. Distribution of BM components: [a] By day 18, laminin beta2 is seen to be present in the BMs of glomeruli and tubules. However, the expectation is that beta2 should largely be confined to glomeruli and blood vessels. BMs do not assemble on all cell surfaces as a generality (e.g. compare the basal side of epithelia with stromal fibroblasts). Further, specific BM components are only incorporated into select BMs. Such specificity can be a consequence of a lack of cognate receptors (especially relevant for laminins), other binding sites, and/or a consequence of a barrier to diffusion of secreted BM components from the source cells. So why is there a difference between mouse kidneys and organoid kidneys?</p><p>[b] Laminin α 5 (Lma5) also appears to be widely distributed within the kidney organoid structures. During kidney development, Lma5 is strongly capillary loop/developing GBM localized (and also in blood vessels), although on can see some around tubules as well. In the organoids, the distribution appears quite even for glomerular, tubular and other structures.</p><p>[c] One therefore has to wonder whether the same receptors (integrins, dystroglycan, other) are expressed in normal developing kidney as compared to organoid kidneys.</p><p>[d] Collagen-IV alpha3 appears to be as widely distributed as collagen IV alpha1. Normally, Col4a345 is strongly localized to the capillary loops and GBM. The mechanism for the more restricted assembly of these subunits is not well understood as far as I am aware. Discussion of this would be helpful.</p><p>5. Lines 70-72 of text. The authors state that &quot;there is limited understanding about BM assembly&quot;. This reviewer would argue that actually there is a substantial body of published evidence derived from biochemical, cell biological and genetic approaches. This body is relevant to interpret the organoid/proteomic findings. In any case, different approaches address different aspects of BM assembly, extending from elucidation of binding interactions among components and with receptors to site-specific turnover. Renal organoid differentiation can reveal a host of new information; however, it probably is not the best tool to establish which components bind to each other via specific domain interactions, or the molecular mechanisms that underlie the interactions. To this reviewer, the real kidney advance of the study is a new way to understand the dynamic changes that occur during assembly in a temporal and cell-type specific manner.</p><p>6. It would be useful to enumerate both what the authors consider the strengths and limitations of the organoid kidney/proteomic system. It would also be useful to more explicitly state the advances achieved since the 2018 publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73486.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add a figure showing the ultrastructure of day 25 glomeruli by EM.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted additional electron microscopy of Day 25 organoids and we have included the images in a revised Figure 1 (panel 1D), and a dedicated Figure 1—figure supplement 2.

What did the basement membrane look like?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. In Figure 1G, we show increased deposition of a LAMB2 within glomerular-like structures in both wild-type and Alport kidney organoids, but no apparent change in basement membrane structure at the level of light microscopy. Since the focus of this first paper is on normal basement membrane assembly, we have not included electron microscopy data on the Alport organoids, and this is the major focus of another project in our laboratory. However, we conducted additional electron microscopy of healthy Day 25 organoids and we have included these images in a revised Figure 1 (panel 1D), and a new dedicated Figure 1—figure supplement 2. We observed basement membrane-like structures, but these are not as established as a typical glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in vivo. The development of a mature GBM is likely to require capillary blood flow. Indeed, we and others have shown further GBM maturation following organoid implantation into immunodeficient mice (PMID: 29429961, PMID: 2950308).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the organoid a model only for the capillary network or what else does it comprise?</p></disp-quote><p>Through the differentiation protocol kidney organoids pattern into both glomerular and tubular structures with markers of multiple cell types from within these distinct compartments.

The expression of the components is not very novel – it is now available on line in KIT? What do your results add to this?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment on the basis that aspects of the temporal and spatial expression of some basement membrane components during kidney development have been characterized in vivo (reviewed in PMID: 10594777, PMID: 23774818). The advance in our work is the global context with proteomics, which allows the comparative analysis of multiple basement membrane and other cellular components. This in turn allows the generation of hypotheses to explore the underlying mechanisms of developmental transitions and basement membrane regulation. We are also very familiar with the Kidney Interactive Transcriptomics (KIT) and these datasets have been extremely valuable to our developmental biology and kidney communities. In this manuscript we provide a comparative analysis across of single cell transcriptomic data from kidney organoids and in vivo mouse and human kidney samples. This is not possible by searching online interactive resources, and it required reanalysis of raw data. Therefore, our single cell data analysis will be of value to other researchers with a matrix and basement membrane focus</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>You probably do not need to abbreviate basement membrane to BM.

Day 25 kidney organoids contained tubules, stroma, and glomeruli with partial resemblance to (mouse) E19 kidney. Tubular and glomerular BMs are seen to form, the latter showing the expected switch from α-1/β-1 laminins to α-5/β-2 laminins, and alpha1/2 type IV collagens to alpha3-containing type IV collagens required for glomerular maturation.</p><p>Specific questions/comments:</p><p>1. Figure 2 and text: [a] Figure 2A, Microvascular endothelium: A key feature of the study in the replacement of Lm111 by Lm521 and Col-IV alpha1/2 by Col-IV α 3/4/5 in the developing glomerulus. This occurs in normal maturation as the glomerulus gains a vascular tuft. In this study, a regent specific to CD31 (PECAM-1; found on endothelial cells, but also on macrophages, granulocytes) is used to detect endothelial cells. Figure 2A shows increasing CD31 staining at days 11, 18 and 25. While most of the staining at day 25 appears between or at the edges of tubular-like structures, a single narrow stained-streak that co-localizes with laminin is present within a glomerulus. This may reflect the early appearance of a vascular tuft with a laminin coat. Are similar entities present in other glomeruli? If so, it would help to show this. Further, this reviewer feels it is important to show the ultrastructure of such glomeruli to gain insight into the organization (e.g. adjacent cells forming lumens) and surrounding structures of the C31-positive cells. Is there an early electron-dense BM structure lining these cells and, in particular, Are there both podocyte-derived and endothelial cell derived BMs?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. Overall, we conducted several immunofluorescence experiments, and the sequence and localization of basement membrane components was consistent. We also conducted additional electron microscopy of Day 25 organoids and we have included the images in a revised Figure 1 (panel 1D), and a dedicated Figure 1—figure supplement 2. These new images show both glomerular and tubular structures within the organoids and highlight basement membrane structures adjacent to podocyte primary processes. Regarding maturation of glomerular basement membrane structures in kidney organoids, we consider that this is limited by the absence of capillary blood flow. Indeed, we and others have shown further GBM maturation, including separate endothelial and podocyte basement membranes following organoid implantation into immunodeficient mice (PMID: 29429961, PMID: 2950308).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. If vascular-tuft invasion of day 25 organoid glomeruli is only just beginning to occur (as suggested by the images), does it not follow that this organoid stage corresponds to an earlier mouse stage than that of the E19 mouse fetus? Given mice are born around E19.5 fully capable of forming urine, it is hard to imagine the implied correspondence. Perhaps the day 25 organoids reflect an earlier stage corresponding to the start of vascular invasion of the glomerulus (about E16.5).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that overall, the day 25 organoid stage is closer to the earliest appearance of vascular invasion of the glomerulus and therefore E16 onwards. However, at E19 glomeruli are at different stages of development since the maturation process is not synchronized across all nephrons. This was our rationale for selecting the E19 time point in mouse development, since we expected to see a broader range of developing glomeruli. We then applied spatial proteomics using laser-capture to select consistent stages of glomerular development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 1G: An Alport patient iPSC line with an X-linked missense variant of COL4A5 was also evaluated and it was found that LAMB2 expression was increased in extra-glomerular BM. Such laminin compensation can apparently be seen in patients. The laminin beta2 increase appears to occur in all BMs of the organoids, not just the glomeruli. Is this what is seen in human patients?</p></disp-quote><p>An important question but very difficult to answer due to the paucity of relevant human tissue samples. Diagnostic genetic testing in Alport syndrome has superseded kidney biopsy in many Centres and although we have examined kidney biopsies from paediatric patients with Alport syndrome (PMID: 34049963) we have not examined laminin beta2 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The single cell transcriptomic data we present in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 highlights the variability in gene expression across cell types in kidney organoids. LAMB2 is expressed in several cell types but enriched in podocytes. The same is observed in the mouse and human kidney single cell sequencing analysis. Our immunofluorescence data also support enrichment over exclusivity of laminin beta2. A future analysis of the BM receptors in parallel with the BM ligands could help to further understand the predominant cell types responsible for BM component secretion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[b] Laminin α 5 (Lma5) also appears to be widely distributed within the kidney organoid structures.
