immunity. Changes in their composition across lymphoid organs are a consequence of B-cell selection and migration events leading to a highly dynamic and unique physiological landscape of antibody repertoires upon antigenic challenge (e.g., vaccination). However, to what extent B cells encoding identical or similar antibody sequences (clones) are distributed across multiple lymphoid organs and how this is shaped by the strength of a humoral response remains largely unexplored. Here, we performed an in-depth systems analysis of antibody repertoires across multiple distinct lymphoid organs of immunized mice and discovered that organ-specific antibody repertoire features (i.e., germline V-gene usage and clonal expansion profiles) equilibrated upon a strong humoral response (multiple immunizations and high serum titers). This resulted in a surprisingly high degree of repertoire consolidation, characterized by highly connected and overlapping B-cell clones across multiple lymphoid organs. Finally, we revealed distinct physiological axes indicating clonal migrations and showed that antibody repertoire consolidation directly correlated with antigen specificity. Our study uncovered how a strong humoral response resulted in a more uniform but redundant physiological landscape of antibody repertoires, indicating that increases in antibody serum titers were a result of synergistic contributions from antigen-specific B-cell clones distributed across multiple lymphoid organs. Our findings provide valuable insights for the assessment and design of vaccine strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>antibody repertoire</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>679403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reddy</surname><given-names>Sai T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_197941</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reddy</surname><given-names>Sai T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Systems analysis of antibody repertoires reveals that strong humoral responses lead to extensive B-cell overlap across multiple lymphoid organs, indicating physiological axes of B-cell migration and a direct correlation with antigen specificity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>B cells exert their protective functions via their B-cell receptors (BCRs) (and secreted version: antibodies), which are capable of recognizing a plethora of antigenic epitopes and structures. Hematopoietic precursors differentiate into immature B cells in the bone marrow, which then migrate and mature to naive B cells in secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, which are distributed throughout the body and are interconnected through the circulatory and lymphatic systems. Naive B cells, which are continuously circulating and screening for antigens, can become activated upon an encounter with a cognate antigen (BCR binding to antigen), which results in differentiation into memory B cells and plasma cell subsets that eventually migrate to supportive niches for their long-term survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellyard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilmore and Allman, 2017</xref>). Thus, the composition of antigen-specific B cells throughout the body is highly dynamic on a molecular, cellular, and spatio-temporal level, resulting in a highly diverse and unique physiological landscape of antibody repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batista and Harwood, 2009</xref>).</p><p>To assess antigen-induced B-cell responses, measurements of serum antibody titers can be performed, which are mainly reflective of circulating antibodies (immunoglobulins [Ig]) secreted from long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) that reside in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellyard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Slifka et al., 1998</xref>). However, it is still unknown how the strength of humoral immunity, which is correlated with serum antibody titers (e.g., IgG), is reflected in the physiological composition of antibody repertoires present across multiple lymphoid organs.</p><p>Thus far, only a few systematic studies have profiled antibody repertoires across multiple organs within the same individuals. In humans, due to limited organ accessibility, most studies performed antibody repertoire analysis on B cells derived from peripheral blood, with a few notable exceptions analyzing more than two organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Domínguez Conde et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mandric et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). For example, Meng et al. constructed an atlas of B-cell clonal distribution uncovering distinct evolution of clonal lineages in human tissues such as blood-rich compartments versus the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meng et al., 2017</xref>). Yang et al. reported shared antibody repertoires across human tissues and inferred antigen specificity based on similarity to previously reported pathogen-specific antibody sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). In the context of mice, Mathew et al. analyzed antigen-specific B cells in the draining lymph nodes, spleen, and lungs after influenza infection, which revealed distinct organ-specific antibody repertoire features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathew et al., 2021</xref>). However, similar to other studies across tissues in mice, they performed small-scale sequencing on specific B-cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mesin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riedel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tas et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it remains an open question how the degree of clonal overlap across physiological compartments relates on repertoire scale and whether each lymphoid organ represents an exclusive or redundant (class-switched IgG) antibody repertoire upon antigenic challenge.</p><p>Here, we map the physiological landscape of antibody repertoires in mice following immunization. We used a systems-based approach that included deep and single-cell sequencing, bioinformatic and statistical analysis, and high-throughput antibody specificity screening to comprehensively profile antibody repertoires from six distinct lymphoid organs. Our analysis uncovered that strong humoral responses (high antibody titers due to repeated immunizations) led to the physiological consolidation of antibody repertoires (a high fraction of clones shared across multiple lymphoid organs). Additionally, clustering and phylogenetic analysis revealed connections between organs such as the spleen and bone marrow at the repertoire level, suggesting B-cell migration events that contribute to substantial repertoire consolidation. Notably, we observed a correlation between the clonal overlap across organs and antigen-binding specificity. These findings, which demonstrate that strong humoral immunity corresponds to a more uniform and homogenous physiological antibody repertoire, may provide important insights for the assessment and design of vaccine strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Systems analysis of the physiological landscape of antibody repertoires</title><p>To profile the physiological landscape of antibody repertoires, we performed a comprehensive systems analysis that included murine models of immunization, antibody repertoire sequencing, bioinformatic repertoire analysis, and high-throughput antibody specificity screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a</xref> and 5a and g). The study was designed around two cohorts of mice that either received a single immunization (cohort- 1x, consisting of mice 1x-A, 1x-B, and 1x-C) or multiple booster immunizations (cohort-3x, mice 3x-D, 3x-E, and 3x-F).

In order to reveal the physiological landscape of antibody repertoires following immunization, we performed targeted deep sequencing of six lymphoid organs in all three mice of both cohorts (total of 36 organs). Variable heavy (VH) chain IgG sequencing libraries were prepared according to our previously established protocol that incorporates unique molecular identifiers for error and bias correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khan et al., 2016</xref>). Focusing on the IgG-class-switched repertoire allowed for a pooled analysis of mainly plasmablasts and plasma cells due to their higher rate of antibody gene transcription. Consequently, our study characterizes the distribution and repertoire features of mainly expanded B-cell clones. Deep sequencing (Illumina MiSeq, paired-end 2 × 300 bp) and preprocessing resulted in an average of 6 × 10<sup>5</sup> reads per organ and up to 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> quality processed and merged reads per organ were used as input for the error-correction pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Antibody repertoire analysis across lymphoid organs</title><p>First, we aimed to characterize common antibody repertoire features (i.e., clonal diversity, expansion, and germline V-gene usage) in each lymphoid organ for both immunization cohorts. For this, we defined B-cell clones as antibody sequences possessing identical germline V- and J-genes and 100% CDRH3 amino acid (a.a.) identity and length. For investigation of groups of clonally related B-cell variants (here referred to as clonotypes), antibody sequences were clustered together in the same manner with the exception of using 90% CDRH3 a.a. identity (similar ratios between clones and clonotypes were observed when using 80% or 85% CDRH3 a.a. identity, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>Quantification of the total number of unique clones within each organ repertoire showed that lymph nodes displayed less diverse antibody repertoires (55–1055 unique clones) than bone marrow (1252–1846 unique clones) and spleen (2475–3166 unique clones) across all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; for diversity of unique clonotypes, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Although lymph nodes are comparatively small, the lower diversity of IgG+ clones observed may not be a consequence of their size, as the clonal diversity of IgM+ clones in lymph nodes was not reduced compared to spleen and bone marrow in untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). In cohort-1x mice, the left lymph nodes (side of immunization) displayed slightly higher diversities compared to the right lymph nodes. This difference was not visible in cohort-3x mice, which exhibited comparable diversities in lymph nodes from both sides. Moreover, while the bone marrow repertoires of cohort-3x mice displayed an increase in clonal (but not clonotype) diversity, the spleen repertoires displayed a decrease in both clonal and clonotype diversity. Pooling all clones/clonotypes derived from all six lymphoid organs and quantifying all unique clones/clonotypes within each mouse revealed that cohort-3x mice had a reduced antibody repertoire diversity per mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). To account for differences in sequencing input across each organ, subsampling analysis was performed with varying sequence input into the error-correction pipeline, which confirmed the observed differences in diversity profiles across organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f and g</xref>).</p><p>Next, we assessed the state of clonal expansion in all organ repertoires using Hill-based evenness profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>) – a diversity measure derived from mathematical ecology and commonly used in immune repertoire analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greiff et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greiff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hill, 1973</xref>). Hill-based evenness profiles indicate the distribution of clonal frequencies within each repertoire and enable comparison of the extent of clonal expansion across multiple repertoires (evenness values range from 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 representing a uniform clonal frequency distribution, while values closer to 0 indicate the prevalence of one or a few highly expanded clones; for more details, see ‘Materials and methods’). The analysis revealed the highest degree of clonal expansion in lymph nodes (mean Shannon evenness <sup>α=1</sup>E of 0.06) compared to spleen (mean Shannon evenness <sup>α=1</sup>E of 0.17), and bone marrow (Shannon evenness <sup>α=1</sup>E of 0.33) in cohort-1x mice. By contrast, a high degree of clonal expansion was uniformly found across all organs in cohort-3x mice (with mean Shannon evenness <sup>α=1</sup>E values of 0.12, 0.10, and 0.10 in lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow, respectively).</p><p>To further dissect what fraction of clones contributed to the observed clonally expanded (polarized) repertoires, we visualized the frequencies for specific proportions of clones present in each organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Notably, both left and right lymph node repertoires of cohort-1x mice were dominated by a few highly expanded clones (indicated in orange and yellow). For instance, the three most frequent clones comprised 33% to 71% of the whole repertoire in all three mice. This stands in contrast to the spleen and bone marrow, in which the three most frequent clones occupied only up to 13% and 10%, respectively. Strikingly, compared to cohort-1x, expansion profiles in cohort-3x were more uniform across all organs, with the three most expanded clones displaying frequencies ranging from 15% to 32% in lymph nodes and up to 19% and 29% in spleen and bone marrow, respectively. Lymphoid organs of untreated mice did not show such degree of expansion within IgM+ clones in lymph nodes and bone marrow, with the three most frequent clones displaying frequencies ranging from 1.2% to 6.8% in lymph nodes and 3.9% to 7.9% in bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). The spleens of untreated mice displayed reduced clonal diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>), while exhibiting increased clonal expansion compared to lymph nodes and bone marrow, with the three most frequent clones showing frequencies of 9.1%, 13.9%, and 11.3% in mouse 1, 2, and 3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><p>Next, quantification of germline V-gene usage of cohort-1x and cohort-3x mice revealed that clones from spleen and bone marrow contained more unique V-genes (99–115) compared to clones from lymph nodes (31–92), in line with the observed reduction of clonal diversity in lymph nodes of all mice. Hierarchical clustering of Pearson correlation coefficients for each mouse showed that spleen and bone marrow displayed the highest correlation in germline V-gene usage across both cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). In two out of three mice per cohort, the left lymph nodes as well as right lymph nodes clustered together, respectively, possibly reflecting a physiological axis upon immunization. Moreover, we observed cohort-specific differences in germline V-gene usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In cohort-1x mice, the same organs of different mice clustered together, with the spleen and bone marrow displaying the highest similarity. By contrast, in cohort-3x mice, organs within the same mouse clustered together, reflecting a physiological consolidation of germline V-gene repertoires.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Strong humoral responses result in highly connected and overlapping clones</title><p>In addition to clonal expansion, antigen immunization drives affinity maturation by somatic hypermutation, which results in production of clonal variants.

Cohort-1x mice shared only 1–3 clones, while cohort-3x mice shared 49–71 clones across all six organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Next, by quantifying shared clones across organs within each mouse (requiring identical clones in at least two organs), we observed that in cohort-1x mice the majority of clones were found in a single organ (organ-exclusive). In contrast, cohort-3x mice displayed a substantial fraction of clones shared across lymphoid organs, particularly in lymph nodes (indicated in gray by pie charts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To reveal the extent of shared clones between organ pairs, we calculated the pairwise Jaccard index (by dividing the number of unique clones shared between two organ repertoires by the total number of unique clones present in both repertoires; indicated by the thickness of the connective lines; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>) as well as pairwise cosine indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast to the Jaccard index, which is only based on clonal identity, the cosine similarity takes into account clonal overlap as well as clonal frequency (repertoires with cosine indices near to 1 indicate high pairwise repertoire similarity based on both clonal overlap and clonal frequency). Both similarity measurements revealed that cohort-3x mice showed a greater degree of repertoire similarity across all organs. This is consistent with the observation of higher similarities in germline V-gene usage across organs in cohort-3x mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Physiological segregation of clones was observed with the left lymph nodes, right lymph nodes, as well as the spleen and bone marrow displaying increased repertoire similarities (based on germline V-gene usage [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>] and clonal overlap [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>]) compared to other organs across both cohorts. Of note, mouse 1x-C showed high pairwise cosine similarity between the right inguinal and axillary lymph nodes because both organs contained an identical clone (CDRH3: CARSLYGAFDYW) representing 47% and 49% of the repertoire, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

A greater than expected proportion of transitions in a particular direction along lineage trees can be indicative of cellular migration patterns. We found that lineage trees in all cohort-1x mice had a significantly greater proportion of transitions from spleen to bone marrow than expected with random switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In contrast, we found that lineage trees of all cohort-3x mice had a significantly higher proportion of transitions both from spleen to bone marrow, and from bone marrow to spleen. This indicates a close association between these organs in cohort-3x trees that is not biased in a particular direction. Repeating these analyses using only clonal sequences from spleen and bone marrow confirmed these patterns: cohort-1x mice had significantly more transitions from spleen to bone marrow, while cohort-3x mice did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). To detect associations between lymphoid organs within lineage trees, we repeated the SP test but permuted organ labels among trees within each mouse and quantified transitions in either direction between tissues. Consistent with prior results, we found a significantly greater proportion of switches between spleen and bone marrow in all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We also observed a distinct left/right axis among lymph nodes, with five of six mice having a significantly greater proportion of transitions among left axillary and inguinal lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In contrast, only two of six mice (both in cohort-1x) had a significantly greater proportion of switches between right-side lymph nodes. Because all mice were immunized on the left side, the greater connectivity among left-side lymph nodes may be due to stronger localized immune responses on the left side. Overall, these phylogenetic analyses provide further evidence that B-cell clonotypes are more segmented along left, right, and spleen/bone marrow axes upon a single immunization (at the left lateral flank), but are more widely dispersed following multiple immunizations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Physiological consolidation of antibody repertoires correlates with antigen specificity</title><p>After uncovering that a strong humoral response in cohort-3x mice induced physiological consolidation of antibody repertoires, we next aimed to determine how this finding translates to antigen specificity.

Importantly, 88–95% of these binding clones were shared between at least two organs out of which 24–41% were overlapping across all six lymphoid organs within the corresponding mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Since binding clones were experimentally derived from bone marrow RNA, the fact that the vast majority of clones (74–86%) were also observed in spleen confirmed the high degree of repertoire similarity in these two organs; additionally, a substantial fraction of binding clones was also observed in lymph nodes (51–68%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, the binding clones that were shared across all six organs occupied on average 24%, 24%, and 22% of the corresponding organ repertoire in each mouse, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). When quantifying all clonal variants of clonotypes that were associated with the binding clones, left lymph nodes displayed comparable or even higher numbers of unique clonal variants than right lymph nodes, whereas the spleen and bone marrow showed consistently the highest numbers of clonal variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Of note, we detected a shared (public) binding clonotype present in all six lymphoid organs of all three mice, thus hinting toward physiological consolidation and sequence convergence of antibody repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p><p>By also accounting for clonal expansion (clonal frequencies), we observed that the extent of organ sharing in binding clones positively correlated with higher clonal frequencies; that is, clones shared across more organs were more clonally expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Finally, by calculating the ratio of binding clones to all clones, we could show a clear positive correlation between organ overlap and antigen specificity, where 15–27% of shared clones across all organs could be confirmed as antigen-binding clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>).</p><p>While our combinatorial scFv yeast display libraries could positively detect a substantial number of antigen-binding clones, it comes with the experimental limitation of random pairing of VH and VL chains. Therefore, in order to reconstruct the natural pairing of VH and VL chains, we performed single-cell antibody repertoire sequencing (10x Genomics, see ‘Materials and methods’) on IgG+ B cells and plasmablasts/plasma cells from lymphoid organs (bone marrow, spleen, and left axillary and inguinal lymph nodes) of a mouse with a strong humoral immune response from receiving multiple booster immunizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Single-cell antibody sequencing recovered a range of 443–3416 IgG+ B cells per organ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Clonal repertoire analysis was performed using both VH and VL chains and clones were defined by identical germline V- and J-genes and 100% a.a. identity of CDRH3-CDRL3. This revealed once again substantial clonal overlap across lymphoid organs, including 26 clones shared across at least three organs and 157 clones shared in at least two organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). Antibody (scFv) expression and binding experiments confirmed that a substantial fraction (33%; 6 out of 18) of tested single-cell clones shared across organs were indeed antigen-specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A central pillar of antibody repertoires is their inherently high diversity (estimated to be &gt;10<sup>13</sup> in mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greiff et al., 2017a</xref>). Therefore, each lymphoid organ may be populated with an exclusive repertoire of naive B cells, which following a single immunization will induce independent B-cell activation, diversification, and germinal center reaction events. To investigate how these dynamic processes shape antibody repertoires across lymphoid organs during an immune response, we performed deep sequencing of antibody repertoires using two cohorts of mice that were immunized either once or three times.</p><p>Analysis of antibody repertoires in the single immunization cohort revealed extensive clonal expansion in lymph nodes from both left and right sides, suggesting antigen-induced selection and expansion of an IgG-class-switched subset of B cells. These may be comprised of early germinal center B cells and short-lived plasmablasts, the latter being generated within the first days after an immunization or infection and are considered as transient precursors of plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kallies et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palm and Henry, 2019</xref>). A recent study reported similar findings of highly expanded germinal center B cells in draining lymph nodes 7 days after influenza infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathew et al., 2021</xref>). Overlap analysis of the most expanded clones revealed distinct physiological axes: inguinal and axillary lymph nodes from the left side shared the majority of their expanded clones, whereas the same was true for right-side lymph nodes, with minimal overlap across left and right lymph nodes. This may reflect migration of antigen-activated B cells and/or antigen transport across the circulatory network, and lymphatic connections between inguinal and axillary lymph nodes have been well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harrell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nham et al., 2012</xref>). A majority of clones that were expanded in lymph nodes were also found in spleen and bone marrow, however, exhibiting lower frequencies. This may indicate early homing of B cells to the spleen and bone marrow where they reside as terminally differentiated plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Slifka et al., 1998</xref>). Previous studies examining early B-cell responses in immunized mice have reported the presence of antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in the spleen and bone marrow as early as 5–10 days after immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Slocombe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 1998</xref>). Our findings, including observed clustering and phylogenetic tree analysis showing significant transitions from the spleen to the bone marrow in cohort-1x mice, are consistent with these earlier observations and suggest that antigen-specific ASCs can be detected in both organs at the repertoire level 10 days after a single immunization. Performing analysis on all clones, however, revealed limited clonal diversification and low overlap across all lymphoid organs, demonstrating that a primary and weak humoral response is characterized by clonal expansion and segregation of a few clones to particular organs while exhibiting mostly lymphoid organ-exclusive repertoires.</p><p>Strikingly, a strong humoral response resulted in a substantial number of shared clones in all mice, exhibiting an up to 70-fold increase in clonal overlap across all six lymphoid organs. Global repertoire similarity measurements confirmed high degrees of pairwise clonal overlap between organs, with shared clones exhibiting similar frequencies. Two mechanisms may be contributing to this high clonal overlap and repertoire similarity in lymphoid organs: (i) subcutaneous injection of soluble antigen results in drainage from interstitial space into lymphatic vessels and is transported directly to lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reddy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reddy et al., 2006</xref>), with eventual transport into systemic circulation, including the spleen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Irvine et al., 2013</xref>; and (ii) migration of antigen-presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Worbs et al., 2017</xref>) and antigen-specific memory B cells via lymphatic and systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hampton and Chtanova, 2019</xref>). Network-based analysis revealed extensive clonal diversification, which is consistent with the refueling of ongoing germinal center reactions (which usually subside after 30 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mesin et al., 2020</xref>). This supports antigen transport to all secondary lymphoid organs and B cells, re-entering or still residing in germinal centers, undergoing multiple rounds of selection and affinity maturation, which was reflected by high levels of somatic hypermutation across all organs. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate if physiological consolidation across lymphoid organs was a consequence of B-cell migration and indeed revealed significant clonal lineage transitions between spleen and bone marrow as well as from spleen to left lymph nodes (side of immunization). Antibody repertoire studies in humans provide evidence for this connection, as shared B-cell clones have been identified across blood-rich tissues including the bone marrow, spleen, lung, and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Domínguez Conde et al., 2022</xref>). Performing three rounds of immunization with a 21-day interval allows for the reactivation of memory B cells present in secondary lymphoid organs and provides sufficient time for LLPCs to home to the bone marrow, which represents a physiological niche that supports long-term residency of LLPCs and immunological memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Slifka et al., 1995</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Slifka et al., 1998</xref>). However, recent studies have challenged the conventional view that all LLPCs exclusively reside in the bone marrow; instead, these cells may recirculate between multiple bone marrow niches and can even migrate to the spleen, suggesting the presence of a shared reservoir of LLPCs throughout the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaron and Fooksman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benet et al., 2021</xref>). This dynamic behavior may contribute to the observed transitions in both directions between spleen and bone marrow as well as the high degree of repertoire consolidation observed across all lymphoid organs in cohort-3x mice.</p><p>By performing high-throughput screening using yeast surface display, we confirmed that a major fraction of shared clones across organs was antigen-specific. Also, we observed that spleen and bone marrow exhibited the highest repertoire similarity by sharing the majority of their detected binding clones. Moreover, we uncovered that shared binding clones displayed relatively high clonal frequencies, which is in line with reports showing that antigen-specific serum titer responses are mainly a result of a few expanded B-cell clones, reflecting oligoclonal B-cell responses upon vaccination or infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lavinder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reddy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Voss et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have systematically uncovered that strong humoral responses induce a high degree of physiological consolidation of antibody repertoires and antigen-binding clones, observed across multiple distinct lymphoid organs, which is also associated with an overall reduced clonal diversity. Although these findings are dependent on immunization parameters (i.e., antigen delivery [viral-based, protein, mRNA] and adjuvant types), they provide important implications for vaccinology. For example, multiple immunization schemes are often employed clinically (e.g., mRNA vaccinations for Covid-19 and hepatitis B subunit vaccines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lederer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">West and Calandra, 1996</xref>) to induce strong humoral responses (based on antigen-binding serum titers); however, this may come at the expense of reducing antibody repertoire diversity across lymphoid organs. Future vaccine strategies may benefit by attempting to balance the strength of the induced humoral response with the physiological landscape of clonal repertoire diversity, as more diverse antibody repertoires in lymphoid organs may facilitate greater breadth of antigen coverage and perhaps enhance resistance to viral escape mutations (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and influenza).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse immunizations and lymphoid organ harvest</title><p>All mouse experiments were performed under the guidelines and protocols approved by the Basel-Stadt cantonal veterinary office (Basel-Stadt Kantonales Veterinäramt, Tierversuchsbewilligung #2582).

Shannon evenness with α = 1 is commonly utilized to assess clonal expansion of immune repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amoriello et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Csepregi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greiff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greiff et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jost, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rosenfeld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Venturi et al., 2007</xref>).

BALB/c IGHV germline reference sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jackson et al., 2022</xref>) were obtained from OGRDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lees et al., 2020</xref>) on 29 April 2022. Because BALB/c IGHJ and IGHD sequences were not available from OGRDB (and were not used to calculate somatic hypermutation), IGHD and IGHJ sequences from the IMGT GENE-DB v3.1.24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giudicelli et al., 2005</xref>) mouse immunoglobulin database were used. Sequences were aligned to this combined immunoglobulin database using IgBlast v1.18.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ye et al., 2013</xref>). The level of SHM for each sequence was initially calculated as its length-normalized Hamming distance from its predicted germline sequence along the IGHV region (IMGT positions 1–312) using <italic>shazam</italic> v1.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yaari et al., 2013</xref>). Incorrect germline reference sequences are expected to result in a higher estimated level of SHM. To assess the accuracy of our germline reference database, we compared the level of SHM in each sequence when aligned to the BALB/c IGHV reference database and the IMGT IGHV mouse reference database. Only 1.2% of sequences had a higher SHM level when aligned to the BALB/c database. These possibly represented alleles not included in the published BALB/c germline database and were removed. By contrast, 24.4% of sequences had lower level of SHM when aligned to the BALB/c database, confirming its accuracy.</p><p>Before building phylogenetic trees, it is important to identify clonal clusters, which represent B cells that descend from a common IGHV, D, and J rearrangement. Sequences from all tissue samples within each mouse were clustered into clones by partitioning based on common IGHV gene annotations, IGHJ gene annotations, and junction lengths. Within these groups, sequences differing from one another by a length normalized amino acid Hamming distance of 0.1 within the CDRH3 were defined as clonotypes by single-linkage clustering using <italic>scoper</italic> v1.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nouri and Kleinstein, 2018</xref>). This Hamming distance threshold and use of amino acid Hamming distance were used for consistency of clonotype definition in other analyses within this manuscript.

Within each mouse, sequences from the same tissue differing only by ambiguous nucleotides were collapsed. For computational efficiency, large clones were randomly down-sampled to a maximum size of 100 sequences. Clones containing sequences from only one organ, or fewer than 10 sequences total, were removed. Lineage tree topologies and branch lengths were estimated using <italic>IgPhyML</italic> v1.1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoehn et al., 2019</xref>) and visualized using <italic>ggtree</italic> v3.0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). The SP permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoehn et al., 2022</xref>) was used to assess whether lineage trees showed signs of migration among organs in a particular direction. Briefly, given the set of organ labels at the tips of each phylogenetic tree, a maximum parsimony algorithm implemented in <italic>IgPhyML</italic> was used to reconstruct the set of internal node organ labels, resulting in the fewest number of organ changes along the tree. For all trees within each mouse, the number and direction of organ changes along all trees were recorded and normalized by the total number of changes to give the SP statistic. Organ states were then randomized within each tree, and the resulting SP statistic was calculated for these permuted trees. The difference between observed and permuted SP statistics (δ) was recorded, and this process was repeated for 1000 replicates. The p-value for enrichment of changes between tissues (i.e., <italic>δ</italic> &gt; 0) is the proportion of replicates in which <italic>δ</italic> ≤ 0. If p&lt;0.05 and <italic>δ</italic> &gt; 0 for a given pair of tissues, this indicates a significantly more biased ancestor/descendant relationship from one tissue to the other than expected by chance in the lineages surveyed. Tree topologies were not re-estimated throughout permutation replicates; however, to control the false-positive rate of the SP test, all trees were randomly down-sampled to a maximum tip-to-state change ratio of 20 for each repetition. Clusters of internal nodes separated by zero-length branches (polytomies) were reordered using nearest-neighbor interchange moves to minimize the number of changes along the tree and appropriately represent possible directions of migration. For analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>, the SP test was repeated as above but node organ labels were permuted among trees within each mouse. Further, tissue changes were quantified in either direction among tissues. This modified SP test more directly quantifies association among organs, rather than biased ancestor–descendant relationships.

Cells were incubated with the antibody mix including LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain (1:10,000, Life Technologies L34975) for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were washed twice before cell sorting with FACSAria.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Single-cell sequencing and analysis of antibody repertoires</title><p>Single-cell sequencing libraries were prepared from sorted cells according to the provided 10x Genomics’ protocol (‘Direct target enrichment – Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits’ [CG000166 REV A]). Briefly, sorted single cells were co-encapsulated with gel beads (10x Genomics 1000006) using four lanes of one chromium single-cell chip by loading 1.474–13.000 cells per reaction. V(D)J library preparation was performed using the Chromium Single Cell 5’ Library Kit (10x Genomics 1000006) and the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Mouse B Cell (10x Genomics 1000072) according to the manufacturer’s manual. Final libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform (mid output, 151 cycles, paired-end reads) using an input concentration of 1.6 pM with 1% PhiX.</p><p>Raw sequencing files from multiple corresponding Illumina sequencing lanes were merged and BCR sequence reads were processed using Cell Ranger version 3.1.0 (10x Genomics, with murine V(D)J reference GRCm38 [mm10]). Only cells with productive heavy and light chain sequences were retained; in case there was more than one productive heavy or light chain present per cell, the most abundant sequence was kept. Cells with IgG subtypes were used for overlap analysis and clones were defined based on V-, J-gene identity and identical combinations of CDRH3 + CDRL3 amino acid sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Generation and screening of monoclonal antibodies by yeast display</title><p>For the detection of antigen-binding clones with known natural pairing of VH and VL chains, we used organ-shared antibody sequences obtained by single-cell antibody repertoire sequencing. We expressed a subset of the 26 overlapping IgG+ antibody sequences that were at least present in three organs. Clonal grouping of the 26 IgG+ antibody sequences resulted in 17 clonal groups out of which at least one variant was chosen to be expressed as scFv. The selection criteria for choosing sequences were based on their prevalence across most organs and highest abundance in the bone marrow within the corresponding clonal group. Briefly, full-length sequences were extracted from the bone marrow (or spleen) filtered_contig.csv files and aligned with IgBlast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ye et al., 2013</xref>) before assembling full-length scFvs containing VL and VH separated by a (Gly<sub>4</sub>Ser)<sub>3</sub> linker and 30 bp homology overhangs on each side, which were ordered from Twist Bioscience. Gibson assembly for each scFv was performed using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB E2621L) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with BamHI linearized pYD1 vector and scFv fragment in 1:4 ratio (in molarity). 5 µl of each reaction including a negative control without scFv was subsequently transformed into 100 µl Fast Transformation of Mix &amp; Go Competent Cells (Zymo T3001) each and plated on LB plates containing Ampicillin. After overnight incubation at 37°C, all plates, except the negative control, had &gt;100 of colonies of which 2 were picked per plate to confirm correct insertion and sequence of scFvs via Sanger sequencing. After confirmation of successful scFv integration into pYD1-BamHI, plasmid DNA was extracted for each sample from a 1 ml overnight culture using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN 27104). Next, plasmid DNA was transformed into yeast cells using frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II kit (Zymo T2001). Briefly, 0.2 µg of DNA was mixed with 25 µl of competent cells and 250 µl EZ3 solution. After a 45 min incubation at 37°C, cells were plated onto SD-CAA + 2% glucose plates and incubated at 30°C for 3 days. Per plate, two colonies were inoculated in YNB-CAA + 2% glucose medium overnight at 30°C, followed by 24 hr induction in YNB-CAA + 2% galactose medium prior to flow cytometry screening. Staining of monoclonal scFv yeast cells was performed as described in ‘Screening yeast display antibody libraries for antigen binding by FACS’. Briefly, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were stained with 0.02 μg/μl anti-FLAG-PE and 0.01 μg/μl RSV-F-AF647. Yeast cells expressing the RSV-F binding monoclonal antibody palivizumab as scFv were used as positive control (AF647+/PE+) as well as negative control (PE+ only) to set the gates. Flow cytometry scanning to screen for double-positive (AF647+/PE+) cells was performed on BD LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data visualization and statistical analysis</title><p>Clonal expansion profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) displaying the frequencies of clones and clonal fractions were generated using tcR R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nazarov et al., 2015</xref>).

The findings show that strong humoral responses lead to a high degree of repertoire consolidation, correlating with antigen specificity and B-cell migration between organs.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Betty Diamond as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Tomoharu Yasuda (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Considering that many biologists are supposed to be interested in this manuscript, authors should try to make the manuscript more easily be understood by the readers. From this points, reviewer request two types of revision. First, bioinformatics analysis should be tried to be more easily understood for readers. Second, authors should discuss the several important points raised by the current analysis.</p><p>Reviewers describe requests (in the recommendations for the authors).</p><p>In regard to the first point, additional comments of (1), (2) of the reviewer 1, comments (1), (4), (7), (8) of the reviewer 2, and comment (2) of the reviewer 3 should be carefully revised.</p><p>In regard to the discussion points, authors should discuss comments (3), (5), (6), and (9) of the reviewer 2, and comments (1) and (4) of the reviewer 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors did in-depth systems analysis of IgG antibody repertoire in immunized mice, and beautifully demonstrated that a limited number of shared clones become dominant in multiple lymphoid organs. However, clonal expansion of antigen-specific memory B cells by multiple immunization, and migration of memory B cells and plasmablasts from one lymphoid tissue to others are known. Extent of clonal expansion of shared clones may depend on immunization protocols that may affect distribution of the antigen to multiple lymphoid organs as the authors discussed. Therefore, the conclusion of this study may not be generalized without testing other immunization protocols.</p><p>In this study, the authors showed expansion of overlapping clones across multiple lymphoid organs after repeated immunization. The authors raised distribution of antigens to multiple lymphoid organs and migration of antigen-activated B cells as possible mechanisms for generation of overlapping clones.</p><p>It is known that memory B cells are present in circulation as well as various lymphoid organs and home to lymph nodes, and expand by immunization. These previous findings showed migration of memory B cells to different lymphoid organs and their clonal expansion after multiple immunization. Plasmablasts are also known to migrate from spleen and lymph nodes to bone marrow. Therefore, presence of overlapping clones in multiple different lymphoid organs may not be surprising. Although the authors claim a surprisingly high degree of repertoire consolidation, characterized by highly connected and overlapping B-cell clones across multiple lymphoid organs after repeated immunization, extent of clonal expansion may depend on immunization protocols. Overall, it is not so clear what is the novel findings in this study, and whether the findings of this study can be applicable to vaccination in human.</p><p>Additional comments</p><p>(1) This study generally lacks statistical analyses. Statistical analyses are required when the authors compare two samples and describe that one is lower or higher than the other.</p><p>(2) Some figures are similar but different, and how and why they are different are not clearly indicated. Examples are Figure 3c and Supplemental Figure 4b.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>By examining the post-vaccination BCR repertoires in specific lymphoid organs, Csepregi and coworkers provide a fresh look a migration patterns of specific B cell clones. They attempt to convey a vast amount of information through various statistical metrics and data visualization methods developed for repertoire analysis. While this analysis may be a bit heavy and, perhaps even overwhelming, the experimental demonstration that antigen specificity correlates with inter-organ migration convincingly justifies their analysis methods. While the internal consistency of the wet and dry data was impressive, there appears to be room for drawing upon previous work in the literature.</p><p>• Summary of what the authors were trying to achieve</p><p>This work contains an in-depth analysis of BCR repertoires at the level of multiple lymphoid organs upon vaccination. The results are primarily comprised of bulk sequence analysis, but a single cell sequence dataset is also presented. Moreover, yeast display is used to select antigen binders, and a strong correlation between antigen specificity and inter-organ sharing is observed.</p><p>• Major strengths and weaknesses of the methods and results</p><p>The main strength was the connection between the first part of the paper (repertoire sharing across organs) and the second part (antigen specificity).</p><p>Weaknesses: The bioinformatics analysis is very detailed and took a while to digest. Some of the graphs seemed overly complex for what is actually a pretty intuitive set of results.</p><p>• An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions</p><p>I think that, with the inclusion of the antigen specificity, the authors met or exceeded their aims.</p><p>• Likely impact of the work on the field, and the utility of the methods and data to the community</p><p>This approach should work for other mouse studies. The antigen specificity aspect may work for human antibody discovery using PBMCs. If sampling is an issue, perhaps pooling of different vaccinated donors' sequence data can be used.</p><p>• Any additional context you think would help readers interpret or understand the significance of the work</p><p>The data visualization is challenging and probably could use a tutorial. This was my only serious criticism of the work-that I spent a lot of time trying to understand the bioinformatics figures.</p><p>I appreciate the novelty and significance of this work, and my impression is overall quite positive. The main area where I see room for improvement is in the descriptions of the bioinformatics analysis. My reading slowed down a lot as I tried to digest some of the figures. It would be nice if the reader could grasp the point of these figures without struggling to understand what is being plotted.</p><p>1. Diversity and organ size. You mention that lymph nodes are less diverse but also smaller than the other organs. Since you show, further down in the paragraph, that not only the raw numbers but also the distribution of clone size is skewed toward dominant clones in the LN, it might be helpful to explicitly state that the observed diversity in LN can not explained by their smaller size.</p><p>2. Figure 1d. After I worked out what the colors meant, the figure was quite clear. There is a lot going on in the figure: clones are ranked by size, and then binned as noted in the legend, and then the population, as a proportion is plotted. Some explanation to this effect rather than jargon like &quot;repertoire space&quot; or &quot;repertoire polarization&quot; would have helped me a lot.</p><p>3. In figure 1e, the difference between 1x (left) and 3x (right) is striking. You refer to this phenomenon as &quot;physiological consolidation&quot;. One interpretation is that migration has simply mixed the B cells within the 3x mice creating a more homogeneous repertoire across organs within given mouse than in the 1x cohort. But why do the spleen and BM cluster together in the 1x cohort? Is it correct that this similarity in 1x BM/spleen is not due CDRH3 but to CDR1-2/framework?</p><p>4. In figure 2, I found the pie charts to be a little confusing. The colors did not make sense to me. The largest 1x-B aLN-L cluster is mostly orange, which, according to the legend, means &quot;spleen&quot; and &quot;BM&quot;. Is the fact that the &quot;aLN-L&quot; color (light blue) does not appear in the pie chart due to there being only 1 or a few aLN-L sequences?</p><p>5. Figure 2 is yet another unfamiliar (to me) way of representing data that slowed me down. For example, I could not understand why you say: &quot;in cohort-3x mice clones were frequently shared across lymphoid organs, particularly the lymph nodes (Figure 3a).&quot; Does &quot;frequently shared&quot; refer to the line thickness?</p><p>6. You observed &quot;we found that lineage trees of all cohort-3x mice had a significantly higher proportion of transitions both from spleen to bone marrow, and from bone marrow to spleen&quot;. It would be helpful from a reader's perspective to put this and other similar observations into context of prior literature. Is this expected? Surprising?</p><p>7. In Figure 4, it was hard to distinguish between blue/green colors</p><p>8. In Figure 5d, it appeared as if some of the CDRH3 sequences with a given mouse were quite similar. I'm curious as to whether there was convergence across mice. If you compute the clonotype overlap between two mice and then quantified this overlap overall (as a fraction of all clonotypes) and as a fraction of all binders, do you see that the binders overlap more?</p><p>9. Could you comment on the extent to which the paired BCR CDRH3 repertoire overlaps with the bulk data? I'm wondering how many of the binders were observed in the 10x dataset.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Performing the systemic profiling of antibody repertoires across multiple organs within the same individual is important to understand how immune response is regulated to fight against pathogens. In the manuscript entitled &quot;The physiological landscape and specificity of antibody repertoire is consolidated by multiple immunizations&quot;, the authors tried to analyze antibody clonality and dynamics upon RS virus antigen immunization to mice by comparing between early time point, 1x immunization, and later time point, 3x immunization. I understood a major finding of this study is a repertoire consolidation across organs after multiple immunizations. Such phenomenon was explained by clonal migration across multiple lymphoid organs, which is directly correlated with antigen specificity. It is interesting and seems important findings contribute to progress in the research field.</p><p>The following points should be addressed or improved:</p><p>1. p4, Figure 1b, and c; Values of &quot;Unique clones per organs&quot; and &quot;Unique clones per mouse&quot; maybe both mislead readers. Unique clones per organ in Figure 1b is probably not the number per organ. Is not it just counts per input of the arbitrary number of templates from each organ? In addition, how authors were able to calculate unique clones per mouse in 1c? Please clarify the process and reason for calculated values for the accuracy of data.</p><p>2. p5, line 144-149; Figure 1d, For the analysis of clonal expansion, authors show clonal frequency rank in which profiles of LN or SP/BM are oppositely changed. However, it makes me hard to interpret data because of the missing unimmunized mouse organ profile. Authors should provide the clonal proportion of unimmunized ones to judge where the baseline is, otherwise, the conclusion here can be speculative.</p><p>3. p33 Supplementary Figure 2a; This is not kind for general readers to understand what really figure means. What do Evenness values and α values mean? How should we interpret data to understand the difference between cohort-1x and cohort-3x?</p><p>4. Figure 4a and supplementary Figure 2C; Authors described in the method section that Balb/c mice were used in the study. In contrast to C57BL/6 strain, immunoglobulin genes of Balb/c strain have not been well-sequenced, and therefore the database is not completed. Roughly 40% of Ig genomic region is still missing. In IMGT database, many of Balb/c IGHV sequences are not or partially identified. Are authors really sure that SHM was counted on Balb/c reference sequences, not on B6 or other strain? Otherwise, counts and data will be wrong.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The physiological landscape and specificity of antibody repertoires is consolidated by multiple immunizations&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Betty Diamond (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The strength of this study is a systems-based approach that included deep and single-cell sequencing, bioinformatic and statistical analysis, and high-throughput antibody specificity screening to comprehensively profile antibody repertoires from six distinct lymphoid organs. The weakness of this study is that it does not consider the binding properties of major BCR clones, such as affinity for antigen, or the clonal selection of B cells that are broadly reactive to diverse viral variants.</p><p>1. The authors properly addressed my concerns by adding untreated mouse profiles, descriptions, figure legend, and updating the analysis based on recently published reference data that strengthened the conclusion of this study and is beneficial for readers.</p><p>2. For Figure 1b, &quot;Unique clones per organ&quot; in the y-axis is misleading. I recommend changing the axis such as &quot;Number of unique clones per 135,000 IgG cDNAs&quot;.</p><p>3. For Figure 1c, &quot;Unique clones per mouse&quot; in the y-axis is misleading. I recommend changing the axis such as &quot;Number of unique clones from 6 organs&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors did in-depth systems analysis of IgG antibody repertoire in immunized mice, and demonstrated that a limited number of shared clones become dominant in multiple lymphoid organs. Although migration of memory B cells is known, the authors beautifully demonstrate consolidation of the antibody repertoire across different lymphoid organs by multiple immunization. Because the changes in antibody repertoire by immunization may depend on immunization protocols, it is not yet clear whether the findings in this study can be generalized.</p><p>In the point-to-point response to the concern of this reviewer on the novelty of the study, the authors listed several findings described in this manuscript as novelty, and mentioned that they edited the manuscript accordingly. However, the introduction and Discussion sections are not much changed. Could the authors make it clear how they edited the manuscript accordingly?</p><p>The authors did statistical analyses in some of the data. However, the analyses in Figure 1b, Supplementary Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 2b and Supplementary Figure 4b are not appropriate. There are more than three data (bars) in each figure, and the authors discuss the comparison of more than three data in the result section. Therefore, the authors should have analyzed the data by multiple comparison test.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92718.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) This study generally lacks statistical analyses.

For bone marrow there was a minor statistically significant increase in regard to clonal (p=0.048) but not clonotype diversity.</p><p>Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 1d: We utilized Welch’s t-test to compare clonal (Figure 1c) and clonotype (Supplementary Figure 1d) diversities within mice across cohorts, depicting only P values &lt;0.05.

Both spleen and bone marrow of cohort-3x mice show statistically significant increases in clonal expansion with p values of 0.034 and 1.7e-04, respectively.</p><p>Supplementary Figure 4b: We performed Welch’s t-test to compare mean SHM frequencies of organs per cohort.

For instance, the Jaccard index calculates similarity based on identical clonal overlap across two organ repertoires, while the cosine similarity considers both clonal overlap and clonal frequency (cosine indices near 1 imply high pairwise similarity). Comparing cosine similarities (Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure 6) and Jaccard indices (Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure 5b), we demonstrate consistent patterns of repertoire similarity between two organs, irrespective of the measurement used.</p><p>We also restated the corresponding sections to better explain the reasoning of using both approaches, see p.8, first paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

One interpretation is that migration has simply mixed the B cells within the 3x mice creating a more homogeneous repertoire across organs within given mouse than in the 1x cohort. But why do the spleen and BM cluster together in the 1x cohort? Is it correct that this similarity in 1x BM/spleen is not due CDRH3 but to CDR1-2/framework?</p></disp-quote><p>We examined the organ repertoire similarities based on V-gene usage (thus including CDR1, CDR2, framework, Figure 1e and Supplementary Figure 2d) as well as CDRH3 identity (see Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure 5b). Both analyses revealed that spleen and bone marrow clustered together, with both organs showing increased diversity based on clonal identity (CDRH3) and unique V-genes compared to lymph nodes in cohort-1x mice. These observations were also confirmed by phylogenetic tree analysis, which additionally indicated a significantly greater proportion of transitions from spleen to bone marrow in cohort-1x mice (Figure 4b and Supplementary Figure 8b).</p><p>We believe that the greater proportion of transitions from spleen to bone marrow are the result of B-cell migration from the spleen to the bone marrow, which are physiological connected through the circulatory system. It is well described that plasma cells from secondary lymphoid organs home to the bone marrow which provides a supportive niche allowing long-lived plasma cells to survive and to continuously secrete antibodies (Benner et al., 1981; Slifka et al., 1995). Blink et al. studied the dynamics of an early B-cell response in mice immunized intraperitoneally with protein antigen (NP coupled to KLH) (Blink et al., 2005). They detected NP-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), including high affinity NP-specific ASCs, in the spleen and bone marrow as early as seven days after immunization. Similarly, other studies also showed the presence of NP-specific ASCs in spleen and bone marrow around five and ten days after primary immunization with NP- protein conjugates, respectively (Slocombe et al., 2013; Takahashi et al., 1998). Here, the observed clustering of the spleen and bone marrow in cohort-1x mice support these findings and indicate, at repertoire level, that antigen-specific ASCs may be present in both the spleen and bone marrow ten days after a single immunization. However, it is important to note that repertoire dynamics may vary depending on type of immunogens (e.g., T-cell dependent or independent) and immunization routes. Furthermore, even though these mice were housed under specific-pathogen free conditions, it is possible that previous B-cell responses, e.g., induced by exposure to environmental antigens, could also contribute to the IgG repertoire similarity between the spleen and bone marrow.</p><p>Along this line, please also see our response to comment 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In figure 2, I found the pie charts to be a little confusing. The colors did not make sense to me.

All clones (nodes) derived from one organ always display at least one color, namely the color of its corresponding organ within the pie chart; if more colors are visible, that means this exact clone is also shared across other organs. We edited the colors for better discrimination of clonal organ origin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 2 is yet another unfamiliar (to me) way of representing data that slowed me down. For example, I could not understand why you say: &quot;in cohort-3x mice clones were frequently shared across lymphoid organs, particularly the lymph nodes (Figure 3a).&quot; Does &quot;frequently shared&quot; refer to the line thickness?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that this section needs clarification. Both the pie chart as well as the line thickness indicate the degree of clonal sharing / repertoire similarity. While the pie chart depicts the proportion of clones within the corresponding organ that are shared with any other of the six organs within the mouse, the line thickness represents the repertoire similarity between organ pairs (by calculating the Jaccard index between two organs). Both the proportion of shared clones (pie chart) as well as the repertoire similarity (line thickness) are increased in cohort-3x mice, thus indicating increased clonal sharing across organs within these mice.</p><p>We restated the corresponding section and added additional explanation for better understanding (p. 8, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. You observed &quot;we found that lineage trees of all cohort-3x mice had a significantly higher proportion of transitions both from spleen to bone marrow, and from bone marrow to spleen&quot;. It would be helpful from a reader's perspective to put this and other similar observations into context of prior literature. Is this expected? Surprising?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, performing phylogenetic tree analysis (Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 8) revealed a significantly higher proportion of transitions from spleen to bone marrow in cohort-1x mice, whereas cohort-3x mice showed lineage trees with a significantly greater proportion of transitions both from spleen to bone marrow, and from bone marrow to spleen.</p><p>The bone marrow has been identified to be the primary site for (long-lived) plasma cells originating from multiple tissues of the body (Manz et al., 2005, 1997; Slifka et al., 1998). Here, cohort-3x mice were immunized three times within 21 day intervals with a highly immunogenic protein antigen. This immunization schedule enabled sufficient time for the generation of memory B cells as well as affinity-matured long-lived plasma cells to be homing to the bone marrow as well as to the spleen and possibly other lymphoid organs (Fooksman et al., 2010).</p><p>Additionally, a recent study has challenged the traditional view that all long-lived plasma cells remain resident in the bone marrow (Aaron and Fooksman, 2022; Benet et al., 2021). This study revealed that plasma cells are capable of recirculating between multiple bone marrow niches and even from the bone marrow to the spleen, suggesting that there may be a shared pool of long-lived plasma cells throughout the body (Benet et al., 2021). These findings could offer an additional explanation of the observed transition from spleen to bone marrow as well as from bone marrow spleen and the high degree of repertoire consolidation in cohort-3x mice.</p><p>Lastly, in light of prior antibody repertoire studies in humans, the observed connection between spleen and bone marrow is consistent. Meng et al. demonstrated two networks of overlapping B-cell clones – one encompassing blood, bone marrow, lung, and spleen, indicating blood-rich tissue distribution, and another in the gastrointestinal tract (Meng et al., 2017). Similarly, Domínguez Conde et al. found that clones restricted to two tissues, were typically found between the spleen and the liver or bone marrow and enriched in plasma cells, while those spanning over five tissues, including lymph nodes, were abundant in memory B cells (Domínguez Conde et al., 2022). They suggest that tissue-restricted clones may reflect long term immunological memory maintained by long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver.</p><p>Collectively, our findings support the spleen / bone marrow axis on a repertoire scale, suggesting B-cell migration through the circulatory and lymphatic systems, antigen drainage, refueling of germinal center responses by repeated antigen exposure, and reactivation of memory B cells (Mesin et al., 2019; Phan and Tangye, 2017) as potential factors contributing to the observed clonal equilibration across all organs, particularly across the spleen and bone marrow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 4, it was hard to distinguish between blue/green colors</p></disp-quote><p>We edited the colors and used different shapes to better distinguish organ origin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 5d, it appeared as if some of the CDRH3 sequences with a given mouse were quite similar. I'm curious as to whether there was convergence across mice. If you compute the clonotype overlap between two mice and then quantified this overlap overall (as a fraction of all clonotypes) and as a fraction of all binders, do you see that the binders overlap more?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this interesting comment. We indeed tested for convergence of clonotypes and binding variants (binding clonotypes) across cohort-3x mice. Briefly, we quantified shared clonotypes across all three mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, left venn diagram), as well as the fraction of shared binding clonotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, right venn diagram). Due to the relatively low number of total binding clonotypes (49) it is difficult to make a direct comparison of the overlapping fractions of all clonotypes versus binding clonotypes. However, as convergence is a well reported observation after infection or immunization (Akbar et al., 2021; Ehrhardt et al., 2019; Parameswaran et al., 2013; Trück et al., 2015), we assume if more binders would have been screened, more overlap across binders would have been detected.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>left: Venn diagram depicting numbers of shared clonotypes across cohort 3-x mice.</title><p>Percentages indicate the ratio of overlapping clones for the corresponding mouse repertoire.

We were analyzing the overlap between the bulk (cohort-3x mice) and single-cell data (Sc-3x). Indeed, we found only one overlapping binding clone across bulk cohort-3x and single-cell (Sc-3x) datasets.

In the manuscript entitled &quot;The physiological landscape and specificity of antibody repertoire is consolidated by multiple immunizations&quot;, the authors tried to analyze antibody clonality and dynamics upon RS virus antigen immunization to mice by comparing between early time point, 1x immunization, and later time point, 3x immunization. I understood a major finding of this study is a repertoire consolidation across organs after multiple immunizations. Such phenomenon was explained by clonal migration across multiple lymphoid organs, which is directly correlated with antigen specificity. It is interesting and seems important findings contribute to progress in the research field.</p><p>The following points should be addressed or improved:</p><p>1. p4, Figure 1b, and c; Values of &quot;Unique clones per organs&quot; and &quot;Unique clones per mouse&quot; maybe both mislead readers. Unique clones per organ in Figure 1b is probably not the number per organ. Is not it just counts per input of the arbitrary number of templates from each organ? In addition, how authors were able to calculate unique clones per mouse in 1c? Please clarify the process and reason for calculated values for the accuracy of data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that this part requires clarification.</p><p>In order to ensure accurate and comparable input of material from all 36 organ samples, digital droplet PCR was utilized in the sequencing library preparation protocol to quantify cDNA and intermediate PCR products for each step of the workflow. We used 135.000 cDNA molecules for each sample as input for each sequencing library. Using the same number of molecules within the workflow ensured that we could accurately compare clonal diversity across organs.</p><p>After sequencing, all sequences were pre-processed (e.g., removal of low quality sequences, length trimming), error-corrected and annotated. All antibody sequences that possessed the identical V- and J-genes as well as 100% CDRH3 similarity were assigned to one unique B-cell clone. For analysis of clonal diversity per organ, we quantified all unique clones (based on identical V- and J-genes and 100% CDRH3 similarity) present in the corresponding organ repertoire. For analysis of the clonal diversity per mouse, we pooled all clones from the six organs and extracted only the number of unique clones.</p><p>For clarification of clonal diversity analysis, we added the clonal definition into the figure legend of Figure 1b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. p5, line 144-149; Figure 1d, For the analysis of clonal expansion, authors show clonal frequency rank in which profiles of LN or SP/BM are oppositely changed. However, it makes me hard to interpret data because of the missing unimmunized mouse organ profile. Authors should provide the clonal proportion of unimmunized ones to judge where the baseline is, otherwise, the conclusion here can be speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We added the analysis of IgM repertoires of untreated Balb/c mice, showing that in particular lymph nodes and bone marrow did not exhibit such degrees of clonal expansion [the three most frequent clones occupied 1.2% to 6.8% in lymph nodes and 3.9% to 7.9% in bone marrow of the IgM repertoire]. The spleen of untreated mice exhibited increased clonal expansion compared to lymph nodes and bone marrow with the three most frequent clones showing frequencies of 9.1%, 13.9%, and 11.3% in mouse 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We added this figure in Supplementary Figure 2c and modified the corresponding text section accordingly (p. 6, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. p33 Supplementary Figure 2a; This is not kind for general readers to understand what really figure means. What do Evenness values and α values mean? How should we interpret data to understand the difference between cohort-1x and cohort-3x?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that this section needs further clarification. We added a detailed explanation of the Hill-based Evenness analysis into the corresponding Methods section (p. 19-20) and restated the main text accordingly, see p. 5, third paragraph. We also added another figure (see Supplementary Figure 2b) to better visualize the differences across cohort-1x and cohort-3x (using Shannon evenness).</p><p>We analyzed clonal expansion by using Hill-based Evenness profiles which are adapted from mathematical ecology and allow for comparison of clonal frequency distribution across multiple repertoires (Greiff et al., 2015b; Hill, 1973).</p><p>Briefly, Hill-based evenness analysis uses a continuum of diversity indices with the parameter α determining the impact of high frequency clones: with increasing α values, higher frequency clones are weighted more for example, α = 1 represents the Shannon evenness which is commonly used to assess the state of clonal expansion in immune repertoires (Amoriello et al., 2021; Csepregi et al., 2020; Greiff et al., 2017, 2015a; Jost, 2006; Rosenfeld et al., 2018; Venturi et al., 2007). Evenness values range from 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 representing a uniform frequency distribution of clones, while values closer to 0 indicate the prevalence of one or a few highly expanded clones, resulting in a polarized repertoire (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><p>Thus, Hill-based evenness profiles allowed us to compare clonal frequency distributions across multiple organ repertoires. It revealed increased clonal expansion in lymph nodes in contrast to spleen and bone marrow in cohort-1x mice, while cohort-3x mice showed high clonal expansion in all organs (Supplementary Figure 2a, b).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Exemplary Hill-based evenness profiles.</title><p>Evenness profiles allow visualization of the state of clonal expansion within antibody repertoires. The green line depicts an even (uniform) repertoire in which all clones are equally abundant, while the purple line represents a clonally expanded (polarized) antibody repertoire with one or few highly expanded clones. The dotted line indicates the Shannon evenness (α = 1); with the repertoire indicated in purple showing a low Shannon Evenness <sup>α=1</sup>E value, resembling a polarized repertoire compared to the green repertoire.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92718-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 4a and supplementary Figure 2C; Authors described in the method section that Balb/c mice were used in the study. In contrast to C57BL/6 strain, immunoglobulin genes of Balb/c strain have not been well-sequenced, and therefore the database is not completed. Roughly 40% of Ig genomic region is still missing. In IMGT database, many of Balb/c IGHV sequences are not or partially identified. Are authors really sure that SHM was counted on Balb/c reference sequences, not on B6 or other strain? Otherwise, counts and data will be wrong.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated all SHM and phylogenetic tree analyses using a recently published BALB/c IGHV reference database (Jackson et al., 2022). Compared to the previously used IMGT database, we found that using this reference set reduced SHM estimate in ~24.5% of sequences, and increased the SHM estimate in only ~1% of sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). This is consistent with the BALB/c reference set being more accurate than the IMGT reference. Because 1% of sequences with higher SHM under the BALB/c reference may belong to alleles not included in the published BALB/c reference set, we excluded them. We used the remaining sequences to update Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 4 (previous Supplementary Figure 2c), and Supplementary Figure 8 (previous Supplementary Figure 7). Overall, our results did not change with respect to our major conclusions. In particular, our results in Supplemental Figure 8c are clearer, with the left/right (especially the left) lymph node axes standing out more. We have updated the Methods and Results sections to reflect these new changes, and included a link to the source code for reproducing the analyses.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>SHM and junction length estimates using the BALB/c reference versus the IMGT reference databases.</title><p>Using the BALB/c reference produces overall lower SHM estimates without affecting junction lengths.
