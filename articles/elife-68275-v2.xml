Previously, we identified a novel Gi/Go protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Moody, as a key factor in BBB formation at the embryonic stage. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Moody signaling in BBB formation and maturation remain unclear. Here, we identify cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) as a crucial antagonistic Moody effector that is required for the formation, as well as for the continued SPG growth and BBB maintenance in the larva and adult stage. We show that PKA is enriched at the basal side of the SPG cell and that this polarized activity of the Moody/PKA pathway finely tunes the enormous cell growth and BBB integrity. Moody/PKA signaling precisely regulates the actomyosin contractility, vesicle trafficking, and the proper SJ organization in a highly coordinated spatiotemporal manner. These effects are mediated in part by PKA’s molecular targets MLCK and Rho1. Moreover, 3D reconstruction of SJ ultrastructure demonstrates that the continuity of individual SJ segments, and not their total length, is crucial for generating a proper paracellular seal. Based on these findings, we propose that polarized Moody/PKA signaling plays a central role in controlling the cell growth and maintaining BBB integrity during the continuous morphogenesis of the SPG secondary epithelium, which is critical to maintain tissue size and brain homeostasis during organogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>GPCR signaling</kwd><kwd>PKA</kwd><kwd>apical-basal polarity</kwd><kwd>septate junction</kwd><kwd>epithelium development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01EY011560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiaoling</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaul</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaul</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Alexander von Humboldt-Professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaul</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaul</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaul</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A polarized Moody/protein kinase A pathway plays an unrecognized central role in controlling the enormous cell growth and blood–brain barrier integrity in a highly coordinated spatiotemporal manner in brain homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a complex physical barrier between the nervous system and the peripheral circulatory system that regulates <italic>central nervous system (CNS)</italic> homeostasis to ensure proper neuronal function. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> BBB is established by a thin epithelium of subperineural glia (SPG), which ensheath and insulate the nervous system against the potassium-rich hemolymph by forming intercellular septate junctions (SJs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bainton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edwards et al., 1993</xref>). The SPG epithelium is formed as a result of a mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET), similar to other secondary epithelia such as heart and midgut. SPG cells only increase in number in embryogenesis but not in larval development, and rather increase their size by polyploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>). Polyploidy in SPG is necessary to coordinate cell growth and BBB integrity either by Notch signaling or miR-285–Yki/Mask signaling during CNS development at the larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Von Stetina et al., 2018</xref>). SPG cells lack the apical markers present in primary epithelia (Crumbs, Bazooka), they have no contiguous zonula adherens and therefore rely on their SJ belt for epithelial cohesion, preventing paracellular diffusion and sealing the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwabe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stork et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tepass et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>SJs are the crucial barrier junctions in invertebrates and functionally equivalent to vertebrate tight junctions (TJs); both junctions share claudins as key components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izumi and Furuse, 2014</xref>). Structurally and molecularly, SJs are homologous to the vertebrate paranodal junction that forms between axons and myelinating glial cells adjacent to the node of Ranvier (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salzer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salzer et al., 2008</xref>). They consist of a core mutual interdependence protein complex, including transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins, such as Neurexin-IV (Nrx-IV), Neuroglian (Nrg), the Na/K-ATPase (ATPα and Nrv2), the claudin Megatrachea (Mega), Sinous, Coracle (Cora), and the tetraspan Pasiflora protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oshima and Fehon, 2011</xref>). In addition to the above-listed proteins, several GPI-anchored proteins, including Ly6-domain proteins Boudin, Crooked, Crimpled, and Coiled, Lachesin, Contactin, the tetraspan Pasiflora protein family, and Undicht, which are all found to be required for the SJ complex formation and proper membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deligiannaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faivre-Sarrailh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hijazi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hijazi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llimargas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tempesta et al., 2017</xref>). The intracellular signaling pathways that control the assembly and maintenance of SJs are just beginning to be elucidated.</p><p>We have previously identified a novel GPCR signaling pathway that is required for the proper organization of SJ belts between neighboring SPG at the embryonic stage, consisting of the receptor Moody, two hetero-trimeric G proteins (Gαiβγ, Gαoβγ), and the RGS protein Loco. Both gain and loss of Moody signaling lead to non-synchronized growth of SPG cells, resulting in disorganized cell contacts and shortened SJs and, therefore, a leaky BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwabe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwabe et al., 2017</xref>). The phenotype of Moody is weaker than that of downstream pathway components including Loco and Gβ13F, suggesting that additional receptors provide input into the trimeric G protein signaling pathway. Gγ1 signaling has been shown to regulate the proper localization of SJ proteins in the embryonic heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yi et al., 2008</xref>). Despite its critical role in BBB formation, the underlying mechanisms connecting G protein signaling to continued SPG cell growth and the proper SJ organization during the development and maturation of BBB are still poorly understood.</p><p>One of the principal trimeric G protein effectors is adenylate cyclase (AC). AC is inhibited by the G proteins Gαi/Gαo and Gβγ, leading to decreased levels of the second messenger cAMP. The prime effector of cAMP, in turn, is cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), a serine/threonine kinase. PKA is inactive as a tetrameric holoenzyme, which consists of two identical <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis">catalytic</ext-link> and two regulatory subunits. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory units releases and activates the catalytic subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 1990</xref>). PKA transmits the signal to downstream effectors by phosphorylating multiple substrates that participate in many different processes, from signal transduction to regulation of cell shape and ion channel conductivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shabb, 2001</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PKA has been studied as a component of GPCR signaling in the Hedgehog pathway during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marks and Kalderon, 2011</xref>), and in neurotransmitter receptor pathways during learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Ganetzky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Renger et al., 2000</xref>). PKA also regulates microtubule organization and mRNA localization during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lane and Kalderon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lane and Kalderon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lane and Kalderon, 1995</xref>). In vertebrates, cAMP/PKA signaling is known to play a central role within different subcellular regions, including the regulation of actomyosin contractility and localized cell protrusion in directional cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tkachenko et al., 2011</xref>); intracellular membrane trafficking (exocytosis, endocytosis, and transcytosis) in relation to the dynamics of epithelial surface domains in developmental processes and organ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wojtal et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, cAMP/PKA signaling regulates endothelial TJ with diverse actions and unclear mechanisms in different endothelial cells models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cong and Kong, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report results from a comprehensive in vivo analysis of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Moody signaling in the SPG. We show that PKA is a key downstream effector responsible for the salient phenotypic outcomes, and that it acts by modulating actomyosin contractility via MLCK and Rho1. The strong phenotypic effects of PKA gain- and loss of function permit a detailed dissection of the organization of cell–cell contacts as driven by Moody/PKA signaling and allow us to track its role in the continued growth of the SPG during larval stages. We observe asymmetric and opposing subcellular distributions of Moody and PKA, providing novel insight into the establishment of apical–basal polarity in the SPG as a secondary epithelium, as well as its morphogenetic function. We present a 3D reconstruction of SJ ultrastructure using serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) under different PKA activity levels. This new analysis reveals a strict coupling of total cell contact and SJ areas, but also suggests that it is the continuity of individual SJ segments and not total SJ width that is essential for normal BBB insulation. Altogether, our data reveal a previously unrecognized role of GPCR/PKA in maintaining enormous SPG cell growth and its sealing capability by regulating actomyosin contractility and the proper SJ organization in BBB formation and maturation, which touches the fundamental aspects of remodeling cytoskeletal network spatiotemporally – a common process but with different mechanisms in morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PKA is required for Moody-regulated BBB formation</title><p>To identify molecules that act downstream of Moody signaling in BBB formation, we examined genes known to be involved in GPCR signaling, such as PkaC1, PI3K, PTEN, PLC, and Rap1. We tested BBB permeability in genomic mutants or transgenic RNAi knockdowns of these GPCR effectors by injecting a fluorescent dye into the body cavity and determining its penetration into the CNS using confocal imaging. We found that zygotic mutants of the PKA catalytic subunit PkaC1 (originally named DC0 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), namely, the two null alleles <italic>PkaC1<sup>B3</sup></italic> and <italic>PkaC1<sup>H2</sup></italic> as well as the hypomorphic allele <italic>PkaC1<sup>A13</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kalderon and Rubin, 1988</xref>), show severe CNS insulation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), similar in strength to zygotic mutants of the negative regulator <italic>loco</italic>.

Moreover, the complete closure of the SPG epithelium is delayed compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Again, the defects observed in PKA loss of function are similar to those in Moody pathway mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwabe et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that <italic>PkaC1</italic> is required for BBB integrity, proper SJ organization, and SPG epithelium formation, in all cases closely mimicking the phenotypes observed for known Moody signaling components. Given these similarities, we sought to determine whether PKA participates in the Moody pathway by performing dominant genetic interaction experiments. Notably, we found that embryos heterozygous for <italic>PkaC1</italic> null alleles, which are known to have ~50% of wildtype PkaC1 activity, show mild BBB permeability defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

During the larval stage, no additional SPG cells are generated, instead the existing SPG cells grow enormously in size to maintain integrity of the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>). By third instar, they have roughly doubled in size and are accessible via dissection of the CNS, which greatly facilitates the microscopic analysis. PKA activity in larvae can be manipulated specifically using the SPG-specific driver <italic>moodyGAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bainton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwabe et al., 2005</xref>), which becomes active only after epithelial closure and BBB sealing are completed in stage 17 embryos. PKA can be reduced by expression of transgenic RNAi targeting the PKA catalytic subunit C1 (<italic>moody&gt;PkaC1</italic> RNAi). On the other hand, PKA can be elevated by expression of a mouse constitutively active PKA catalytic subunit (<italic>moody</italic>&gt;<italic>mPkaC1*</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). We first examined whether normal Moody/PKA activity is required for BBB integrity during larval stages. To address this question, we developed a dye penetration assay to measure BBB permeability in cephalic complexes of third instar larval. This assay is similar to the one we performed in the late embryo, but with some important modifications (for details, see Experimental procedures). Interestingly, both elevated and reduced activity of Moody (<italic>moody&gt;LocoRNAi</italic> and <italic>moody&gt;moodyRNAi</italic>) and PKA (<italic>moody&gt;mPKAC1*</italic> and <italic>moody&gt;PKAC1</italic> RNAi) in SPG resulted in severe BBB insulation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>).

Most core SJ components show interdependence for correct localization and barrier function, with removal of one component sufficient to abolish SJ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genova and Fehon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hijazi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oshima and Fehon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore asked whether PKA activity levels affect the distribution of different SJ components. Using both live imaging (<italic>NrgGFP, LacGFP, NrxIVGFP</italic>) and immunohistochemistry (Mega), we found that the circumferential SJ belts and outlines of SPG were marked nicely in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Strikingly, upon either reduction of Moody activity or elevated PKA activity, the SJ belt staining became much broader and more diffuse than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests extensive plasma membrane overlap between neighboring SPG cells. To confirm this idea, we introduced the membrane marker <italic>gapGFP</italic>, and indeed observed increased membrane overlap compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely, both elevated Moody activity and reduced PKA activity resulted in thinner SJ belts and reduced membrane contacting area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). To quantify these changes, we measured the mean width of the SJ belts under different PKA activity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; Experimental procedures). The mean width of SJ belts increased with elevated PKA activity/reduced Moody activity and decreased under inverse conditions compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data demonstrate that Moody and PKA are required for the continued growth of the BBB and the proper organization of SJs during larval stages. Unlike the barrier defect, these morphological data reveal a monotonic relationship between PKA activity, membrane overlap, and the amount of SJ components in the area of cell contact. The fact that the cellular defects of reduced Moody activity match those of elevated PKA activity, and vice versa, provides further evidence that PKA acts as an antagonistic effector of Moody signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PKA regulates the cytoskeleton and vesicle traffic in SPG</title><p>We had previously reported that the Moody pathway regulates the organization of cortical actin and thus the cell shape of SPG during late embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwabe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwabe et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, we proposed, based on the developmental timeline, that this in turn affects the positioning of SJ material along the lateral membrane. Given that the most striking phenotype caused by altered PKA activity is the extent of membrane overlap, we sought to further explore if PKA functions by regulating the cytoskeleton in SPG.</p><p>For this purpose, we examined the intracellular distribution of the actin cytoskeleton in the SPG at different PKA levels.

In response to changes in PKA activity, all markers showed altered distributions similar to those observed with SJ markers. Specifically, elevated PKA activity caused all markers to become enriched at the cell cortex area, consistent with the broader membrane contacting area between neighboring SPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, middle column). Conversely, upon reducing PKA activity, all markers were reduced or depleted from the cell cortex, consistent with reduced contact area between neighboring SPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, right column). Thus, PKA signaling profoundly reorganizes the actin and MT cytoskeleton, which may affect the membrane contacting area between neighboring SPG.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Protein kinase A (PKA) regulates the cytoskeleton and vesicle distribution in subperineural glia (SPG).</title><p>Under different PKA activity levels, the actin cytoskeleton is visualized by GFPactin (<bold>A</bold>), the microtubule cytoskeleton by the general MT marker TauGFP (<bold>B</bold>), the plus-end marker EB1GFP (<bold>C</bold>), and the minus-end marker NodGFP (<bold>D</bold>), the cellular distribution of vesicles by the early endosome markers Rab4RFP (<bold>E</bold>) and Rab11GFP (<bold>F</bold>) with the septate junction (SJ) marker NrgGFP labeling the cell periphery of the SPG (<bold>E</bold>).

In this case, both the mean total length of SJs (1.49 ± 0.08 µm vs. 2.16 ± 0.14 µm, p=0.000878) and the mean length of individual SJ segments (0.67 ± 0.14 µm vs. 2.16 ± 0.14 µm, p&lt;0.0001) were significantly shorter than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Intriguingly, the ratio of total SJ area to cell contact area remains constant at about 30% under all PKA activity conditions, despite the variable interdigitations between contacting SPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, SPG send apical protrusions into the neural cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These protrusions are much longer (2.01 ± 0.01 µm vs. 1.47 ± 0.09 µm, p=0.000230) upon elevated PKA activity and shorter than in WT (0.68 ± 0.09 µm vs. 1.47 ± 0.09 µm, p&lt;0.0001) upon reduced PKA activity, suggesting that PKA activity more generally controls membrane protrusions and extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our ultrastructural analyses and new 3D models support the light microscopic findings, and they provide superior quantification of the relevant parameters. Importantly, cell contact and SJ area, as well as total SJ content, are monotonically correlated with PKA activity, while individual SJ segment length is not. This suggests that the discontinuity of the SJ belt is the main cause for the observed BBB permeability defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The Moody/PKA signaling pathway is polarized in SPG</title><p>The SPG are very thin cells, measuring around 0.2 µm along the apical–basal axis.

PkaC1 lost its basal intracellular localization and appeared spread out throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that Moody is required for Pka-C1 polarized localization.

In addition, under gain of function of Moody signaling (moody&gt;Gαo-GTP), PKA remains basally localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), regardless of Moody’s mis-localization, suggesting that Gαo signaling is sufficient for PKA enrichment at the basal side of SPG.

This work also revealed that besides the GPCR Moody two heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαiβγ, Gαoβγ) and the RGS Loco participate in this pathway. Here we provide a comprehensive molecular and cellular analysis of the events downstream of G protein signaling using a candidate gene screening approach. We present new, more sensitive methods for phenotypic characterization and extended the analysis beyond the embryo into larval stages. This work identifies PKA, together with some of its targets, as crucial antagonistic effectors in the continued cell growth of SPG and maintenance of the BBB sealing capacity. This role is critical to ensure proper neuronal function during BBB formation and maturation.</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate a role of PKA for proper sealing of the BBB: loss of PKA activity leads to BBB permeability defects, irregular growth of SPG during epithelium formation, reduced membrane overlap, and a narrower SJ belt at SPG cell–cell contacts. The role of PKA as an effector of the Moody signaling pathway is further supported by dominant genetic interaction experiments, which show that the dye penetration phenotype of <italic>PkaC1</italic> heterozygous mutant embryos was partially rescued by removing one genomic copy of <italic>G</italic>β<italic>13F</italic> or <italic>loco</italic>. Moreover, the analysis of the larval phenotype with live SJ and cytoskeleton markers shows that PKA gain of function behaved similarly to Moody loss of function. Conversely, PKA loss of function resembled the overexpression of GαoGTP, which mimics Moody gain-of-function signaling.</p><p>Our results from modulating PKA activity suggest that the total cell contact and SJ areas are a major function of PKA activity: low levels of activity cause narrow contacts, and high levels give rise to broad contacts. Moreover, the analysis of various cellular markers (actin, microtubules, SJs, vesicles) indicates that the circumferential cytoskeleton and delivery of SJ components respond proportionately to PKA activity. This, in turn, promotes the changes in cell contact and junction areas coordinately at the lateral side of SPG. Our experiments demonstrate that the modulation of the SPG membrane overlap by PKA proceeds, at least in part, through the regulation of actomyosin contractility, and that this involves the phosphorylation targets MLCK and Rho1. This suggests that crucial characteristics of PKA signaling are conserved across eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marks and Kalderon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>At the ultrastructural level, our ssTEM analysis of the larval SPG epithelium clarifies the relationship between the inter-cell membrane overlaps and SJ organization and function. Across different PKA activity levels, the ratio of SJ areas to the total cell contact area remained constant at about 30%. This proportionality suggests a mechanism that couples cell contact with SJ formation. The primary role of Moody/PKA appears in this process to be the control of membrane contacting area between neighboring cells. This is consistent with the results of a temporal analysis of epithelium formation and SJ insertion in late embryos of WT and Moody pathway mutants, which shows that membrane contact precedes and is necessary for the appearance of SJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwabe et al., 2017</xref>). The finding that the surface area that SJs occupy did not exceed a specific ratio, irrespective of the absolute area of cell contact, suggests an intrinsic, possibly steric limitation in how much junction can be fitted into a given cell contact space. While most phenotypic effects are indeed a major function of Moody and PKA activity, the discontinuity and shortening of individual SJ strands is not. It occurred with both increased and decreased signaling and appears to cause the leakiness of the BBB in both conditions. Our ssTEM-based 3D reconstruction thus demonstrates that the total area covered by SJs and the length of individual contiguous SJ segments are independent parameters. The latter appears to be critical for the paracellular seal, consistent with the idea that Moody plays a role in the formation of continuous SJ stands.</p><p>The asymmetric localization of PKA that we observed sheds further light on the establishment and function of apical–basal polarity in the SPG epithelium. Prior to epithelium formation, contact with the basal lamina leads to the first sign of polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwabe et al., 2017</xref>). Moody becomes localized to the apical surface only after epithelial closure and SJ formation, suggesting that SJs are required as a diffusion barrier and that apical accumulation of Moody protein is the result of polarized exocytosis or endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwabe et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we now show that the intracellular protein PKA catalytic subunit-PkaC1 accumulates on the basal side of SPG, and that this polarized accumulation requires (apical) Moody activity. Such an asymmetric, activity-dependent localization has not previously been described for PKA in endothelium, and while the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown, the finding underscores that generating polarized activity along the apical–basal axis of the SPG is a key element of Moody pathway function.</p><p>An intriguing unresolved question is how increased SPG cell size and SJ length can keep up with the expanding brain without disrupting the BBB integrity during larva growth. We found that the SJ grows dramatically in length (0.57 ± 0.07 µm vs. 2.16 ± 0.14 µm, about 3.7-fold) from the late embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) to third instar larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), which matches the increased cell size of SPG (about fourfold; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babatz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>). During the establishment of the SPG epithelium in the embryo, both increased and decreased Moody signaling resulted in asynchronous growth and cell contact formation along the circumference of SPG, which in turn led to irregular thickness of the SJ belt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwabe et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, a similar relationship may exist during the continued growth of the SPG epithelium in larvae, with the loss of continuity of SJ segments in Moody/PKA mutants resulting from unsynchronized expansion of the cell contact area and an ensuing erratic insertion of SJ components. Since SJs form relatively static complexes, any irregularities in their delivery and insertion may linger for extended periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babatz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deligiannaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oshima and Fehon, 2011</xref>). The idea that shortened SJ segments are a secondary consequence of unsynchronized cell growth is strongly supported by our finding that disruption of actomyosin contractility in MLCK and Rho1 mutants compromises BBB permeability.</p><p>Collectively, our data suggest the following model: polarized Moody/PKA signaling controls the cell growth and maintains BBB integrity during the continuous morphogenesis of the SPG secondary epithelium. On the apical side, Moody activity represses PKA activity (restricting local cAMP level within the apial-basal axis in SPG) and thereby promotes actomyosin contractility. On the basal side, which first adheres to the basal lamina and later to the PNG sheath, PKA activity suppresses actomyosin contractility via MLCK and Rho1 phosphorylation and repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Throughout development, the SPG grow continuously while extending both their cell surface and expanding their cell contacts. Our data suggest that the membrane extension occurs on the basolateral surface through insertion of plasma membrane and cell-adhesive proteins, with similar behavior in epithelial cell, but regulated by a distinct polarized Moody/PKA signaling in SPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wojtal et al., 2008</xref>). In analogy to motile cells, the basal side of the SPG would thus act as the ‘leading edge’ of the cell, while the apical side functions as the ‘contractile rear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nelson, 2009</xref>). According to this model, Moody/Rho1 regulate actomyosin to generate the contractile forces at the apical side to driving membrane contraction, which directs the basolateral insertion of new membrane material and SJs. In this way, differential contractility and membrane insertion act as a conveyor belt to move new formed membrane contacts and SJ from the basolateral to apical side. Loss of Moody signaling leads to symmetrical localization of PKA and to larger cell contact areas between SPG due to diminished apical constriction. Conversely, loss of PKA causes smaller cell contact areas due to increased basal constriction.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of Moody/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in the glial blood–brain barrier (BBB).</title><p>Schematic depicting polarized Moody/PKA signaling along the apical–basal axis and its cellular function in controlling subperineural glia (SPG) continued cell growth (<bold>A</bold>) and BBB integrity (<bold>B</bold>) by differentially regulating actomyosin contractility and septate junction (SJ) organization spatiotemporally.

Specifically, we used Imaris 4.0 to perform 2D segmentation of the GFP-marked SJs. For each of the markers, an optimal threshold for the pixel intensity was chosen by fitting the obtained segmented pattern with the raw fluorescence signal. To evaluate the average thickness of the SJs, we splitted the SJ segments into sections of 3–4 µm in length. An approximation of the diameters of the single sections was then obtained by extracting their ellipticity parameters along the axis perpendicular to their main axis. A mean diameter of the SJ was calculated by averaging over the diameters of all single sections. For quantification, random images were chosen with each marker and the distribution of all live markers was measured by Fiji software. To calculate the changes of the distribution of markers, plot profiles of fluorescence intensities along the nucleus to the membrane in each cell were divided into two compartment, membrane area and nucleus area (half to half). Then we calculated the ratio of mean pixel intensity between these two areas (membrane/nucleus) under different PKA activity with each marker.

The statistical analysis was performed using Brown–Forsythe and Welch’s ANOVA with multiple comparisons test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>none</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>None</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68275-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in Dyrad generic databases with DOI <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fj6q573tx">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fj6q573tx</ext-link>.

Understanding how the BBB is established and functions is relevant to all animals with a BBB including humans, where it is critically important for regulating drug/small molecule access to the brain. Previous work from this lab and others have shown that the BBB is composed of a specialized type of glia called the subperineurial glia (SPG), which enwrap the entire central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, they previously identified the Moody G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) as being specifically expressed in SPG and required for BBB formation and maintenance. Here they show that Moody protein is localized to the apical membrane domain (facing the CNS) while Protein Kinase A (PKA) is localized to the complementary basal membrane domain (facing the hemolymph of the body cavity). Not only do Moody and PKA have non-overlapping subcellular localization, but genetic interactions show that Moody and PKA act antagonistically in BBB maintenance. They find that both too little and too much PKA activity disrupts the BBB. The authors also generate a serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) volume to analyze wild type, PKA hyperactivity, and PKA loss of function animals. They find that loss of BBB function is due to gaps in the BBB, rather than thinning of the BBB. This conclusion is somewhat weak, however, because they did not analyze a genotype that has thin BBB structure but normal BBB function. Their work raises the question of how does PKA promote BBB integrity. They analyze two potential PKA targets (myosin light chain kinase [MLCK], and Rho1), finding that reduced Moody levels lead to disrupted subcellular localization of both proteins in SPG; that reducing MLCK or Rho1 levels causes failure of BBB function; and that reducing Moody can rescue these phenotypes. They conclude that Moody acts antagonistically to PKA/MLCK/Rho1 to establish distinct apical and basal membrane domains in SPG which are required for BBB function.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The cAMP effector PKA mediates Moody GPCR signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood-brain barrier formation and maturation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Chris Doe as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marc Freeman (Reviewer #2); Sarah Ackerman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) On page 10 the authors say &quot;Thus, PKA signaling profoundly reorganizes the actin and MT cytoskielotn, thereby regulating the membrane overlap formed between neighboring SPG.&quot; Yet Figure 3 to me does not conclusively show membrane overlap. The figure shows surface views of the CNS, whereas overlap occurs on the Z-axis in this orientation. The figure shows nothing about the overlap, and the legend merely describes the markers without guidance on how to interpret the staining relative to overlap (if possible). Thus, I think relevant data should be newly provided on overlap, or the wording toned down in the Results section and the legend improved.</p><p>2) The study needs to be strengthened by more rigorous quantification. There is no quantification in figure 3. This is a primary point in the manuscript-that cytoskeletal markers change (in a claimed &quot;monotonic&quot; way) in SPGs when PKA is altered. There is also no quantification or statistics in Figure 5, which is among the most interesting observations. This is essential. It is also difficult to understand how to do this most reasonably and rigorously. The nucleus provides a spot to see a nice separation of apical and basal membranes, but is this asymmetric localization true across the entire BBB? This is challenging, but finding a way would make the claims more convincing.</p><p>While the authors note the percentage of animals that show BBB penetration defects (Figure 1B,G; Figure 2D,G; Figure 6A,E; Figure S1), it is not apparent whether the statistics were applied only to animals that exhibited BBB defects, or to the entire cohort of animals. Additionally, while the authors give a range of N values per experiment, what N signifies is not clearly defined (animals, septate junctions, etc). These comments could easily be addressed by text. Finally, it is now standard in the field to show individual data-points within bar graphs to show the spread of the data more precisely. Changing the format of the graphs throughout to display the raw data would improve our understanding of the comparisons made (re: first point above).</p><p>3) Given their beautiful supplemental live imaging experiments, Figure 3 could be greatly improved by live imaging of vesicle dynamics to see if the PKA-induced changes in localization are progressive, or impaired from the start.</p><p>4) In Figure 5, while it is clear that Moody and PKA are not co-localized, it is difficult to conclude that they are localized at the apical versus basal side of the cell without membrane markers. Additional analyses with membrane markers would greatly clarify this result.</p><p>5) As PKA signaling is also known to interact with the small GTPase Rac, and Rac is also known to modify cytoskeletal dynamics, Figure 6 would be improved by epistasis experiments with PKA and Rac mutants; if these are not readily available, the experiment could be mentioned in the Discussion as a future direction.</p><p>6) In the manuscript, the authors note that PKA has an unexpected role in dictating cell polarity, and in membrane protrusion. These features of PKA are also true for Schwann cells during development (reviewed in PMC5181106, PMC4526746). The authors should highlight these similarities, which would expand the scope and general readership for this article.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68275.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) On page 10 the authors say &quot;Thus, PKA signaling profoundly reorganizes the actin and MT cytoskielotn, thereby regulating the membrane overlap formed between neighboring SPG.&quot; Yet Figure 3 to me does not conclusively show membrane overlap.

However, we did show the extent of membrane overlap in response to different PKA activity levels by two methods: (1) The membrane marker GapGFP was introduced to show the plasma membrane overlap between neighboring SPG cells under different Moody/PKA activities by confocal microscopy in Figure 2C, but only with limited information due to the resolution of light microscopy; (2) And we further performed serial section TEM (ssTEM), followed by computer-aided reconstruction of TEM stacks to resolve the 3D ultrastructure of cell contacts and SJs under different PKA activity levels in third instar larva. These results, presented in Figure 4C-E, clearly show the membrane overlap between neighboring cells at the ultrastructural level (magenta and green shaded) upon different levels of PKA activity. In response to the reviewer’s comments, we changed the wording in both the result section and the legend accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The study needs to be strengthened by more rigorous quantification.

We further examined the subcellular distribution of Moody and Pka-C1 under gain- or loss-of-function of Moody/PKA signaling in SPG, including Moody knockdown (moody&gt;MoodyRNAi), PkaC1 Knockdown (moody&gt;Pka-C1-RNAi), GPCR gain-of-function (moody&gt;Go-GTP), and PKA overexpression (moody&gt;mPka-C1*). We provide lateral views of the CNS/hemolymph border, in each condition, and did line scans of fluorescence intensities for each channel along the apical-basal axis to visualize the subcellular distributions along the apical-basal axis of SPG and the results clearly demonstrated that this polarization of Moody and PKA depends on the activity of Moody/PKA signaling pathway, please see the detail in the figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors note the percentage of animals that show BBB penetration defects (Figure 1B,G; Figure 2D,G; Figure 6A,E; Figure S1), it is not apparent whether the statistics were applied only to animals that exhibited BBB defects, or to the entire cohort of animals.

In the dye penetration assay, only a small number of animals did not show defects. Therefore, we list the percentage of animals that had no BBB permeability defects and average the mean intensity of the dye penetrated into the brain in the whole group (including the ones with normal BBB function).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given their beautiful supplemental live imaging experiments, Figure 3 could be greatly improved by live imaging of vesicle dynamics to see if the PKA-induced changes in localization are progressive, or impaired from the start.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank for the suggestion! Unfortunately, we did not succeed in live imaging vesicle dynamics for this point. The live imaging experiments in the supplemental material was done on whole animals at the end of embryogenesis (stage 17). However, the vesicle maker used in Figure 3 was used in third instar larvae, driven by moody-gal4. This marker is not sufficiently expressed for live imaging the embryonic stages; this stage is too early to visualize all the markers used for the larval experiments in Figure 3. We also tried a stronger driver (Repo-Gal4) to express vesicle markers in the embryo (stage 17), including Rab4-RFP and Rab11-GRP. However, they formed aggregates and did not mimic in vivo protein distribution in SPG. As pointed out in the paper, the reason we did this analysis in third instar larvae is that SPG double in size and are accessible via dissection of the CNS, which greatly facilitates the microscopic analysis with all live markers. Considering this situation and to make this data more convincing, we did quantification of all the markers to demonstrate the changes of vesicle markers in response to different PKA levels; this information is provided in Figure 3E and 3F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 5, while it is clear that Moody and PKA are not co-localized, it is difficult to conclude that they are localized at the apical versus basal side of the cell without membrane markers. Additional analyses with membrane markers would greatly clarify this result.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously demonstrated that Moody localizes at the apical side of SPG by co-labeling with membrane marker GapGFP and SJ marker NrgGFP (Schwabe et al., 2017)(Figure 5). This polarized distribution of Moody depends on SJ organization, and Moody is excluded from the lateral membrane compartment and the basal membrane. We added this information in the revised version. In addition, we further examined the subcellular distribution of Moody and Pka-C1 under gain- or loss-of-function conditions of Moody/PKA signaling in SPG. WE also performed plot profiles of lateral compartments around the nucleus of SPG to visualize the subcellular distribution along the apical-basal axis of SPG. Our results clearly demonstrate that this polarization of Moody and PKA depends on the activity of Moody/PKA signaling pathway, and we have revised Figure 5 accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As PKA signaling is also known to interact with the small GTPase Rac, and Rac is also known to modify cytoskeletal dynamics, Figure 6 would be improved by epistasis experiments with PKA and Rac mutants; if these are not readily available, the experiment could be mentioned in the Discussion as a future direction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and now performed experiments to investigate the function of Rac1 in BBB: (1) we knocked down Rac1 with RNAi (Repo&gt;Rac1-RNAi) in SPG and did not observe any noticeable effect. On the other hand, knock-down of Rho1 in SPG was lethal, and the morphology of SPG changed when Rho1 was overexpressed; (2) We checked the expression of Rac1 in SPG (Moody&gt;EGFP-Rac1) and found it to be located inside of SPG, but not in a specific pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the manuscript, the authors note that PKA has an unexpected role in dictating cell polarity, and in membrane protrusion. These features of PKA are also true for Schwann cells during development (reviewed in PMC5181106, PMC4526746). The authors should highlight these similarities, which would expand the scope and general readership for this article.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the helpful suggestion. SJs are homologous structurally and molecularly to the vertebrate paranodal junction that forms between axons and myelinating glial cells（Schwann cells）adjacent to the node of Ranvier. We have now included this point in both the introduction and discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
