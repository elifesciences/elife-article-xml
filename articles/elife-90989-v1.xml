We assessed sporogonic development using cultured gametocytes in the Netherlands and naturally circulating strains in Burkina Faso. We quantified the number of sporozoites expelled into artificial skin in relation to intact oocysts, ruptured oocysts, and residual salivary gland sporozoites. In laboratory conditions, higher total sporozoite burden was associated with shorter duration of sporogony (p&lt;0.001). Overall, 53% (116/216) of infected <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes expelled sporozoites into artificial skin with a median of 136 expelled sporozoites (interquartile range [IQR], 34–501). There was a strong positive correlation between ruptured oocyst number and salivary gland sporozoite load (ρ = 0.8; p&lt;0.0001) and a weaker positive correlation between salivary gland sporozoite load and number of sporozoites expelled (ρ = 0.35; p=0.0002). In Burkina Faso, <italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic> mosquitoes were infected by natural gametocyte carriers. Among salivary gland sporozoite positive mosquitoes, 89% (33/37) expelled sporozoites with a median of 1035 expelled sporozoites (IQR, 171–2969). Again, we observed a strong correlation between ruptured oocyst number and salivary gland sporozoite load (ρ = 0.9; p&lt;0.0001) and a positive correlation between salivary gland sporozoite load and the number of sporozoites expelled (ρ = 0.7; p&lt;0.0001). Several mosquitoes expelled multiple parasite clones during probing. Whilst sporozoite expelling was regularly observed from mosquitoes with low infection burdens, our findings indicate that mosquito infection burden is positively associated with the number of expelled sporozoites. Future work is required to determine the direct implications of these findings for transmission potential.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gametocyte</kwd><kwd>sporozoite</kwd><kwd>anopheles</kwd><kwd>sporogony</kwd><kwd>expelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019180</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-CoG 864180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andolina</surname><given-names>Chiara</given-names></name><name><surname>Graumans</surname><given-names>Wouter</given-names></name><name><surname>ramijth</surname><given-names>Jordache</given-names></name><name><surname>Bousema</surname><given-names>Teun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AMMODO Science Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bousema</surname><given-names>Teun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI132359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinnis</surname><given-names>Photini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The number of sporozoites expelled by mosquitoes that are infected with lab-cultured or naturally circulating <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> gametocytes is heterogeneous and associated with the sporozoite load in their salivary glands.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria transmission to mosquitoes depends on the presence of mature gametocytes in human peripheral blood that are ingested by a mosquito during blood feeding. Ingested parasites undergo several developmental transformations in a process called sporogony. After ingestion, gametocytes transform into male and female gametes that fuse to form a zygote. The zygote differentiates into a motile ookinete that penetrates the midgut epithelium to form an oocyst. Multiple rounds of mitotic replication result in the formation of sporozoites inside an oocyst. Upon oocyst rupture, sporozoites are released into the haemocoel and invade the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>). These sporozoites penetrate the distal portion of the two lateral and medial lobes of the glands and accumulate extracellularly inside secretory cavities before entering the salivary ducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wells and Andrew, 2019</xref>). Despite the large number of sporozoites in the cavities, only a small proportion pass through the proximal part of the lobes where the salivary ducts become narrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frischknecht et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley et al., 2018</xref>), and only tens or low hundreds of sporozoites are assumed to be inoculated per mosquito bite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graumans et al., 2020</xref>). Developmental bottlenecks during sporogony, as well as the size of the sporozoite inoculum, remain incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graumans et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The density of gametocytes in human peripheral blood is an important determinant of human to mosquito transmission. Though infections with parasite densities below the microscopic threshold for detection can infect mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schneider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bousema et al., 2006</xref>), the likelihood and infection intensity increase with the number of ingested gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley et al., 2018</xref>). Because of the abundance of low-density gametocyte carriers among infected populations, these are considered important drivers of malaria transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andolina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Slater et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ouédraogo et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, this conclusion is based on the assumption that all infected mosquitoes are equally infectious regardless of oocyst densities.</p><p>In apparent support of this assumption, single oocyst infections can result in thousands of salivary gland sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenberg and Rungsiwongse, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pringle, 1965</xref>). A positive correlation between oocyst densities and salivary gland sporozoites was previously observed in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vaughan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miura et al., 2019</xref>) as well as in <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Solarte et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that on average of 1000–2000 sporozoites reach the salivary glands per single ruptured oocyst. The few studies that quantified sporozoite inoculum by allowing mosquitoes to salivating into capillary tubes containing mineral oil, sucrose solution, or blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beier et al., 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beier et al., 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosenberg et al., 1990</xref>) estimated median inocula ranging between 8 and 39 sporozoites with a minority of mosquitoes expelling &gt;100 sporozoites (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graumans et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While these studies provide some insights into sporozoite expelling and transmission dynamics, they do not reflect natural feeding conditions. Also, microscopy techniques used to quantify sporozoites may have underestimated the number of sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Medica and Sinnis, 2005</xref>). Subsequent studies with rodent <italic>Plasmodium</italic> models allowed natural mosquito probing through skin and showed a positive association between sporozoite density in salivary glands and expelled sporozoite numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Medica and Sinnis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aleshnick et al., 2020</xref>). A recent study using a <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> malaria model demonstrated that mosquitoes with over 10,000 salivary gland sporozoites were 7.5 times more likely to initiate a malaria infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aleshnick et al., 2020</xref>). This finding has not been replicated for human malarias but is broadly consistent with post hoc analysis of infection likelihood in controlled human malaria infections (CHMI), where only mosquitoes that had &gt;1000 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> salivary gland sporozoites remaining after probing (the residual sporozoite load) were capable of establishing an infection in malaria-naïve volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Churcher et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>If low oocyst/low sporozoite densities in mosquitoes are unlikely to initiate infections in humans, this may have profound consequences for our understanding of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">WHO, 2017</xref>). If mosquitoes with low-infection burdens have limited transmission potential, then the rationale for targeting low-density infections in humans that give rise to low-infection burdens in mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley et al., 2018</xref>) may be diminished.</p><p>Here, we examined the progression of sporozoite development and the number of sporozoites expelled into artificial skin by individual <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes infected either with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocyte cultures or in experimental infections with naturally circulating parasite strains. We directly assessed the association between oocyst burden, salivary gland infection intensity, and the number of sporozoites expelled.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low number of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoites are quantifiable by qPCR</title><p>Multicopy mitochondrial COX-1 and 18S rRNA gene targets were analyzed in octuplicate on serial dilutions of sporozoites to assess qPCR performance and select the target that achieved highest sensitivity and most consistent sporozoite detection.

This approach allowed us to determine the density of intact and ruptured oocysts and associate this to sporozoite density in the same mosquito. It was noted that a minority of oocysts failed to rupture during this time span; 5% (93/1854) of all oocysts were visually intact and 88.3% (166/188) of examined mosquitoes had at least one unruptured oocyst on day 18. While we observed good concordance between oocyst densities by mercurochrome staining on day 8 and immunostaining on day 18 PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), oocysts sporadically did not take up the 3SP2-Alexa 488 anti-CSP antibody labeling.

The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) is defined as the number of infectious bites per person per time unit and is the product of human biting rate and the proportion of sporozoite-positive mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tusting et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shaukat et al., 2010</xref>). While EIR is a common measure of human malaria exposure, mosquito infection prevalence is used in this calculation and thus assumes all sporozoite-positive mosquitoes are equally infectious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, assessments of the human infectious reservoir for malaria typically take the number of oocyst-positive mosquitoes as a measure of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ouédraogo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>) and thereby not only assume that all oocysts will lead to salivary gland sporozoites but also that all oocyst-positive mosquitoes have equal transmission potential. Recent work with a rodent malaria model challenged this central assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aleshnick et al., 2020</xref>); we provide the first direct evidence for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that sporozoite burden may indeed be a relevant determinant in efficient sporozoite expelling.</p><p>In this study, we assessed sporozoite expelling by mosquitoes carrying low- and high-infection burdens.

Moreover, we observed a strong positive association between sporozoite salivary gland load and ruptured oocyst density in mosquitoes infected with both cultured and naturally circulating gametocytes, with similar median numbers of 4951 (IQR, 3016–8318) and 6350 (IQR, 4225–8475) salivary gland sporozoites per ruptured oocyst in <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and <italic>An. coluzzii,</italic> respectively. Previous studies have shown that despite the substantial release of sporozoites per oocyst, only a proportion of sporozoites successfully reach the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenberg and Rungsiwongse, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hillyer et al., 2007</xref>). In line with this, we observed considerably higher sporozoite estimates in intact oocysts (10,485–15,390 sporozoites per oocyst). Whilst these sporozoite estimates are higher than commonly reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graumans et al., 2020</xref>), an early study from the 1960s reported microscopy-detected sporozoite densities above 9000 sporozoites per oocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pringle, 1965</xref>) and a recent study using qPCR similarly observed up to 12,583 sporozoites from a single oocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

Although <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoite densities below these lower thresholds were thus uncommon, we observed that 39% of sporozoite-positive mosquitoes across a wide range of infection densities failed to expel sporozoites upon probing.

For highly infected mosquitoes, this inefficient expelling has been related to a decrease in apyrase in the mosquito saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rossignol et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thiévent et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we observed a positive association between salivary gland sporozoite density and the number of expelled sporozoites. For unknown reasons, this association was markedly stronger in experiments where <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> mosquitoes were infected using blood from gametocyte carriers who were naturally infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in Burkina Faso compared to <italic>An. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes infected with cultured gametocytes. In our experiments with natural gametocyte carriers, sporozoite density appeared associated with both the likelihood of expelling any sporozoites and the inoculum size. The most heavily infected mosquitoes expelled ~14-fold higher sporozoite numbers compared to the lowest quartile. In addition, we found evidence that the EIP – the period required for a mosquito to become salivary gland sporozoite positive – is shorter for heavily infected mosquitoes. Previous studies have not found consistent effects of parasite burden on EIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guissou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stopard et al., 2021</xref>) but, unlike our experiments, were also not specifically designed to examine this association across a broad range of infection intensities. Our associations of a shorter EIP in highly infected mosquitoes and, in separate experiments, a larger sporozoite inoculum size for highly infected mosquitoes make mosquito infection intensity a plausible factor in determining onward transmission potential to humans. Heavily infected mosquitoes may be infectious sooner and be more infectious. On the other side of the infection spectrum, it is conceivable that submicroscopic gametocyte carriers that typically result in low oocyst burdens in mosquitoes give rise to infected mosquitoes with a reduced transmission potential. This would greatly reduce their importance for sustaining malaria transmission and make it less important to identify individuals with low parasite densities for malaria elimination purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Slater et al., 2015</xref>). At the same time, we occasionally observed high sporozoite inocula from mosquitoes with low infection intensity. This argues against a clear threshold sporozoite or oocyst density below which mosquitoes are truly irrelevant for transmission. Moreover, the high number of sporozoites per oocyst makes it plausible that even the low oocyst burdens that are typically observed from asymptomatic parasite carriers (in the range of 1–5 oocysts/infected gut; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andolina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>) would be sufficient to result in salivary gland sporozoite loads that are sufficient to result in secondary infections.</p><p>Our study leaves a number of questions and has several limitations. While the use of two mosquito and gametocyte sources was a relevant strength of our study, an uncertainty relates to the choice of artificial skin that has a realistic 1.33 mm thickness but is arguably less natural than microvascularized skin with all the natural cues for mosquito probing. Whilst genuine skin might have improved natural feeding behavior, probing and blood feeding were highly efficient in our model and we see no reasons to assume bias in the comparison between high- and low-infected mosquitoes. Our assessments of EIP and sporozoite expelling did not demonstrate the viability of sporozoites. Whilst the infectivity of sporozoites at different time points PI has been examined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), these experiments have never been conducted with individual mosquitoes. In vitro experiments that aim to determine the infectivity of single mosquito bites would ideally retain the skin barrier that may be a relevant determinant for invasion capacity and use primary hepatocytes. These experiments were beyond the scope of the current work and would also not provide conclusive evidence on the likelihood of achieving secondary infections. Given striking differences in sporozoite burden between different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species – low sporozoite densities appear considerably more common in mosquitoes infected with <italic>P. yoelii</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graumans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Churcher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2021</xref>), and the inherent limitations of in vitro studies – the association between sporozoite inoculum size and the likelihood of achieving secondary infections may be best examined in controlled human infection studies. CHMI experiments can be specifically designed to estimate the likelihood that probing by (individual) high- and low-infected mosquitoes results in blood-stage infection in malaria-naïve volunteers. Whilst laborious, CHMI studies are unique in allowing definitive evidence on the possible differences in infectiousness between high- and low-infected mosquitoes.</p><p>In conclusion, we observed that the majority of oocysts rupture and contribute to salivary gland infection load. We further observe that this sporozoite load is highly variable and an important determinant of the number of sporozoites that is expelled into the skin upon probing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>P. falciparum</italic> in vitro culture and mosquito infection</title><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes, NF54 (West Africa) and NF135 (Cambodia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conway et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teirlinck et al., 2013</xref>) were cultured in an automated culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ponnudurai et al., 1982</xref>) and maintained as previously described at Radboudumc, Nijmegen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van de Vegte-Bolmer et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>An. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes, Nijmegen Sind-Kasur strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feldmann and Ponnudurai, 1989</xref>), were reared at 30°C and 70–80% humidity with a 12 hr reverse day/night cycle.

This belief has been used for goal setting (and modeling) of malaria transmission-blocking interventions. While recent studies using rodent malaria suggest that the dogma may not be true, there was no such study with human <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. In this study, the numbers of oocysts and sporozoite in the mosquitoes and the number of expelled sporozoites into artificial skin from the infected mosquito was quantified individually. There was a significant correlation between sporozoite burden in the mosquitoes and expelled sporozoites. In addition, this study showed that highly infected mosquitoes expelled sporozoites sooner.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>• The study was conducted using two different parasite-mosquito combinations; one was lab-adapted parasites with Anopheles stephensi and the other was parasites, which were circulated in infected patients, with An. coluzzii. Both combinations showed statistically significant correlations between sporozoite burden in mosquitoes and the number of expelled sporozoites.</p><p>• Usually, this type of study has been done in group bases (e.g., count oocysts and sporozoites at different time points using different mosquitoes from the same group). However, this study determined the numbers in individual bases after multiple optimization and validation of the approach. This individual approach significantly increases the power of correlation analysis.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>• In a natural setting, most mosquitoes have less than 5 oocysts. Thus, the conclusion is more convincing if the authors perform additional analysis for the key correlations (Fig 3C and 4D) excluding mosquitoes with very high total sporozoite load (e.g., more than 5-oocyst equivalent load).</p><p>• As written as the second limitation of the study, this study did not investigate whether all expelled sporozoites were equally infectious. For example, Day 9 expelled sporozoites may be less infectious than Day 11 sporozoites, or expelled sporozoites from high-burden mosquitoes may be less infectious because they experience low nutrient conditions in a mosquito. Ideally, it is nice to test the infectivity by ex vivo assays, such as hepatocyte invasion assay, and gliding assay at least for salivary sporozoites. But are there any preceding studies where the infectivity of sporozoites from different conditions was evaluated? Citing such studies would strengthen the argument.</p><p>• Since correlation analyses are the main points of this paper, it is important to show 95%CI of Spearman rank coefficient (not only p-value). By doing so, readers will understand the strengths/weaknesses of the correlations. The p-value only shows whether the observed correlation is significantly different from no correlation or not. In other words, if there are many data points, the p-value could be very small even if the correlation is weak.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90989.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The malaria parasite Plasmodium develops into oocysts and sporozoites inside Anopheles mosquitoes, in a process called sporogony. Sporozoites invade the insect salivary glands in order to be transmitted during a blood meal. An important question regarding malaria transmission is whether all mosquitoes harboring Plasmodium parasites are equally infectious. In this paper, the authors investigated the progression of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoite development in Anopheles mosquitoes, using a sensitive qPCR method to quantify sporozoites and an artificial skin system to probe for parasite expelling. They assessed the association between oocyst burden, salivary gland infection intensity, and sporozoites expelled.</p><p>The data show that higher sporozoite loads are associated with earlier colonization of salivary glands and a higher prevalence of sporozoite-positive salivary glands and that higher salivary gland sporozoite burdens are associated with higher numbers of expelled sporozoites. Intriguingly, there is no clear association between salivary gland burdens and the prevalence of expelling, suggesting that most infections reach a sufficient threshold to allow parasite expelling during a mosquito bite. This important observation suggests that low-density gametocyte carriers, although less likely to infect mosquitoes, could nevertheless contribute to malaria transmission.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper is well written and the work is well conducted. The authors used two experimental models, one using cultured <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes and An. stephensi mosquitoes, and the other one using natural gametocyte infections in a field setup with An. coluzzii mosquitoes.

to thank the editor and the reviewers for their constructive comments and the chance to revise the manuscript. The suggestions have allowed us to improve our manuscript. We have been able to fulfil all reviewer comments and added new statistical analyses to examine associations for subsets of data. Whilst suggested by a reviewer, we did not perform large-scale experiments to confirm the viability of low sporozoite densities at different time-points post salivary gland colonization. For these assays there are currently no satisfactory in vitro models for sporozoites harvested from single mosquitoes and setting up and validating such experiments could be a PhD project in itself. We do consider this suggestion very relevant but beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>Relevantly, during the time the manuscript was under review at eLife, we have been able to examine the multiplicity of infection in our field experiments. This was, as written in the original manuscript, a key reason to also perform experiments in the field where there is a greater diversity of parasite lines. We have successfully performed AMA-1 amplicon deep sequencing on infected mosquito salivary glands and infected skins. Although this does not change the key messages of the manuscript and is secondary to our main hypothesis, we do consider it a relevant addition since we were able to demonstrate that for some infected mosquitoes from the Burkina Faso study, multiple clones were expelled by mosquitoes during probing on a single piece of artificial skin. We have added a short paragraph to our revised manuscript and updated the acknowledgement section to include the supporting researcher who conducted those experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary: There is a long-believed dogma in the malaria field; a mosquito infected with a single oocyst is equally infectious to humans as another mosquito with many oocysts. This belief has been used for goal setting (and modelling) of malaria transmission-blocking interventions. While recent studies using rodent malaria suggest that the dogma may not be true, there was no such study with human <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. In this study, the numbers of oocysts and sporozoite in the mosquitoes and the number of expelled sporozoites into artificial skin from the infected mosquito was quantified individually. There was a significant correlation between sporozoite burden in the mosquitoes and expelled sporozoites. In addition, this study showed that highly infected mosquitoes expelled sporozoites sooner.</p><p>Strengths:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The study was conducted using two different parasite-mosquito combinations; one was lab-adapted parasites with Anopheles stephensi and the other was parasites, which were circulated in infected patients, with An. coluzzii. Both combinations showed statistically significant correlations between sporozoite burden in mosquitoes and the number of expelled sporozoites.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Usually, this type of study has been done in group bases (e.g., count oocysts and sporozoites at different time points using different mosquitoes from the same group). However, this study determined the numbers in individual bases after multiple optimization and validation of the approach. This individual approach significantly increases the power of correlation analysis.</p></list-item></list><p>Weaknesses:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In a natural setting, most mosquitoes have less than 5 oocysts. Thus, the conclusion is more convincing if the authors perform additional analysis for the key correlations (Fig 3C and 4D) excluding mosquitoes with very high total sporozoite load (e.g., more than 5-oocyst equivalent load).</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have also performed our analysis including only the subset of mosquitoes with low oocyst burden. In our Burkina Faso experiments, where we could not control oocyst density, 48% (15/31) of skins were from mosquitoes with &lt;5 oocyst sheets. Whilst low oocyst densities were thus not very uncommon, we acknowledge that this may have rendered some comparisons underpowered. At the same time, we observe a strong positive trend between oocyst density and sporozoite density and between salivary gland sporozoite density and mosquito inoculum. This makes it very likely that this trend is also present at lower oocyst densities, an association where sporozoite inoculation saturates at high densities is plausible and has been observed before for rodent malaria (DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008181) whilst we consider it less likely that sporozoite expelling would be more efficient at low (unmeasured) sporozoite densities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>As written as the second limitation of the study, this study did not investigate whether all expelled sporozoites were equally infectious. For example, Day 9 expelled sporozoites may be less infectious than Day 11 sporozoites, or expelled sporozoites from high-burden mosquitoes may be less infectious because they experience low nutrient conditions in a mosquito. Ideally, it is nice to test the infectivity by ex vivo assays, such as hepatocyte invasion assay, and gliding assay at least for salivary sporozoites. But are there any preceding studies where the infectivity of sporozoites from different conditions was evaluated? Citing such studies would strengthen the argument.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this thought and can see the value of these experiments. We are not aware of any studies that examined sporozoite viability in relation to the day of salivary gland colonization or sporozoite density.</p><p>One previous study assessed the NF54 sporozoite infectivity on different days post infection (days 12-13-14-15-16-18) and observed no clear differences in ‘per sporozoite hepatocyte invasion capacity’ over this period (DOI: 10.1111/cmi.12745). We nevertheless agree that it is conceivable that sporozoites require maturation in the salivary glands and might not all be equally infectious. While hepatocyte invasion experiments are conducted with bulk harvesting of all the sporozoites that are present in the salivary glands, it would even be more interesting to assess the invasion capacity of the smaller population of sporozoites that migrate to the proboscis to be expelled. This would, as the reviewer will appreciate, be a major endeavour. To do this well the expelled sporozoites would need to be harvested from the salivary glands/proboscis and used in the best and most natural environment for invasion. The suggested work would thus depend on the availability of primary hepatocytes since conventional cell-lines like HC-04 are likely to underestimate sporozoite invasion. Importantly, there are currently no opportunities to include the barrier of the skin environment in invasion assays whilst this may be highly important in determining the likelihood that sporozoites manage to achieve invasion and give rise to secondary infections. In short, we agree with the reviewer that these experiments are of interest but consider these well beyond the scope of the current work. We have added a section to the Discussion section to highlight these future avenues for research. ‘Of note, our assessments of EIP and of sporozoite expelling did not confirm the viability of sporozoites. Whilst the infectivity of sporozoites at different time-points post infection has been examine previously (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12745">https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12745</ext-link>), these experiments have never been conducted with individual mosquito salivary glands. To add to this complexity, such experiments would ideally retain the skin barrier that may be a relevant determinant for invasion capacity and primary hepatocytes.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Since correlation analyses are the main points of this paper, it is important to show 95% CI of Spearman rank coefficient (not only p-value). By doing so, readers will understand the strengths/weaknesses of the correlations. The p-value only shows whether the observed correlation is significantly different from no correlation or not. In other words, if there are many data points, the p-value could be very small even if the correlation is weak.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and agree that this is indeed insightful.

Sporozoites invade the insect salivary glands in order to be transmitted during a blood meal. An important question regarding malaria transmission is whether all mosquitoes harbouring Plasmodium parasites are equally infectious. In this paper, the authors investigated the progression of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoite development in Anopheles mosquitoes, using a sensitive qPCR method to quantify sporozoites and an artificial skin system to probe for parasite expelling. They assessed the association between oocyst burden, salivary gland infection intensity, and sporozoites expelled.</p><p>The data show that higher sporozoite loads are associated with earlier colonization of salivary glands and a higher prevalence of sporozoite-positive salivary glands and that higher salivary gland sporozoite burdens are associated with higher numbers of expelled sporozoites. Intriguingly, there is no clear association between salivary gland burdens and the prevalence of expelling, suggesting that most infections reach a sufficient threshold to allow parasite expelling during a mosquito bite. This important observation suggests that low-density gametocyte carriers, although less likely to infect mosquitoes, could nevertheless contribute to malaria transmission.</p><p>Strengths: The paper is well written and the work is well conducted. The authors used two experimental models, one using cultured <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes and An. stephensi mosquitoes, and the other one using natural gametocyte infections in a field setup with An. coluzzii mosquitoes. Both studies gave similar results, reinforcing the validity of the observations. Parasite quantification relies on a robust and sensitive qPCR method, and parasite expelling was assessed using an innovative experimental setup based on artificial skin.</p><p>Weaknesses: There is no clear association between the prevalence of sporozoite expelling and the parasite burden. However, high total sporozoite burdens are associated with earlier and more efficient colonization of the salivary glands, and higher salivary gland burdens are associated with higher numbers of expelled sporozoites. While these observations suggest that highly infected mosquitoes could transmit/expel parasites earlier, this is not directly addressed in the study. In addition, whether all expelled sporozoites are equally infectious is unknown. The central question, i.e. whether all infected mosquitoes are equally infectious, therefore remains open.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the manuscript provides important steps forward in our understanding of what makes an infectious mosquito but does not conclusively demonstrate that highly infected mosquitoes are more likely to initiate a secondary infection. We consider this to be beyond the scope of the current work although the current work lays the foundation for these important future studies. For human Plasmodium infections the most satisfactory answer on the infectiousness of low versus high infected mosquitoes comes from controlled human infection models. In response to reviewer comments, we have extended our Discussion section to highlight this importance. To accommodate the (very fair) reviewer comments, we have avoided any phrasings that suggest that our findings demonstrate differences in transmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary: This study uses a state-of-the-art artificial skin assay to determine the quantity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoites expelled during feeding using mosquito infection (by standardised membrane feeding assay SMFA) using both cultured gametocytes and natural infection.

The results obtained from these excellently designed and executed studies very well supported their conclusion - with a slight caveat regarding their application to natural transmission scenarios</p></disp-quote><p>For efficiency and financial reasons, we have worked with an approach to enhance mosquito infection rates. If we had worked with gametocytes at physiological concentrations and a small number of donors, we probably have had considerably lower mosquito infection rates. Whilst this would indeed result in lower infection burdens in the sparse infected mosquitoes, addressing the reviewer concern, it would have made the experiments highly inefficient and expensive. The skin mimic was initially provided free of charge when the matrix was close to the expiry date but for the experiments in Burkina Faso we had to purchase the product at market value. Whilst we consider the biological question sufficiently important to justify this investment – and think our findings prove us right – it remained important to avoid using skins for uninfected mosquitoes. Since oocyst prevalence and density are strongly correlated (doi: 10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.09.002; doi: 10.7554/eLife.34463), a low oocyst density in natural infections typically coincides with a high proportion of negative mosquitoes.</p><p>Of note, our approach did result in the inclusion of 15 skins from infected mosquitoes with 1-4 oocysts. This number may be modest but we did include observations from this low oocyst range which is, we agree, highly important for better understanding malaria epidemiology.</p><p>This work very convincingly highlights the potential for significant heterogeneity in the infectiousness between individual <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected mosquitoes. Such heterogeneity needs to be further investigated and if again confirmed taken into account both when modelling malaria transmission and when evaluating the importance of low-density infections in sustaining malaria transmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #4 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary: The study compares the number of sporozoites expelled by mosquitoes with different Plasmodium infection burden. To my knowledge this is the first report comparing the number of expelled <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoites and their relation to oocyst burden (intact and ruptured) and residual sporozoites in salivary glands. The study provides important evidence on malaria transmission biology although conclusions cannot be drawn on direct impact on transmission.</p><p>Strengths: Although there is some evidence from malaria challenge studies that the burden of sporozoites injected into a host is directly correlated with the likelihood of infection, this has been done using experimental infection models which administer sporozoites intravenously. It is unclear whether the same correlation occurs with natural infections and what the actual threshold for infection may be. Host immunity and other host related factors also play a critical role in transmission and need to be taken into consideration; these have not been mentioned by the authors. This is of particular importance as host immunity is decreasing with reduction in transmission intensity.</p><p>Weaknesses: The natural infections reported in the study were not natural as the authors described. Gametocyte enrichment was done to attain high oocyst infection numbers. Studying natural infections would have been better without the enrichment step. The infected mosquitoes have much larger infection burden than what occurs in the wild.</p><p>Nevertheless, the findings support the same results as in the experiments conducted in the Netherlands and therefore are of interest. I suggest the authors change the wording. Rather than calling these &quot;natural&quot; infections, they could be called, for example, &quot;experimental infections with wild parasite strains&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these concerns and, in the process, also changed our manuscript title. The following sentences have been changed:</p><p>“It is currently unknown whether all <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infected mosquitoes are equally infectious. We assessed sporogonic development using cultured gametocytes in the Netherlands and natural infections in Burkina Faso”.</p><p>Now reads:“It is currently unknown whether all <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infected mosquitoes are equally infectious. We assessed sporogonic development using cultured gametocytes in the Netherlands and experimental infections with naturally circulating parasite strains in Burkina Faso”.226-228 “Experimental infections with naturally circulating parasite strains show comparable correlation between oocyst density, salivary gland density and sporozoite inoculum”.</p><p>Has now replaced the original phrasing:“Natural infected mosquitoes by gametocyte carriers in Burkina Faso show comparable correlation between oocyst density, salivary gland density and sporozoite inoculum”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do not believe the study results generate sufficient evidence to conclude that lower infection burden in mosquitoes is likely to result in changes to transmission potential in the field. In study limitations section, the authors say &quot;In addition, our quantification of sporozoite inoculum size is informative for comparisons between groups of high and low-infected mosquitoes but does not provide conclusive evidence on the likelihood of achieving secondary infections. Given striking differences in sporozoite burden between different Plasmodium species - low sporozoite densities appear considerably more common in mosquitoes infected with P. yoelii and P. berghei the association between sporozoite inoculum and the likelihood of achieving secondary infections may be best examined in controlled human infection studies. However, in the abstract conclusion the authors state &quot;Whilst sporozoite expelling was regularly observed from mosquitoes with low infection burdens, our findings indicate that mosquito infection burden is associated with the number of expelled sporozoites and may need to be considered in estimations of transmission potential.&quot; Kindly consider ending the sentence at &quot;expelled sporozoites.&quot; Future studies on CHMI can be recommended as a conclusion if authors feel fit.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we need to be very cautious with conclusions on the impact of our findings for the infectious reservoir. We have rephrased parts of our abstract and have updated the Discussion section following the reviewer suggestions. We agree with the reviewer that CHMI studies are recommended and have expanded the Discussion section to make this clearer. The sentence in the abstract now ends as:</p><p>&quot;Whilst sporozoite expelling was regularly observed from mosquitoes with low infection burdens, our findings indicate that mosquito infection burden is associated with the number of expelled sporozoites. Future work is required to determine the direct implications of these findings for transmission potential.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>• Prevalence data shown in Fig 2A and Table S1 are different. For example, &gt;50K at Day 11, Fig 2A shows ~85% prevalence, but Table S1 says 100%. If the prevalence in Table S1 shows a proportion of observations with positive expelled sporozoites (instead of a proportion of positive mosquitoes shown in Fig 2A), then the prevalence for &lt;1K at Day 11 cannot be 6.7% (either 0 or 20% as there were a total of 5 observations). So in either case, it is not clear why the numbers shown in Fig 2A and Table S1 are different.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2A and Table S2 are estimated prevalence and odds ratios from an additive logistic regression model (i.e. excluding the interaction between day and sporozoite categories). Table S1 includes this interaction when estimating prevalence and odds ratios and as we can see some categories in the interaction were extremely small resulting in blown up confidence intervals especially in day 11. So Table S1 and Fig 2A are the results from two different models. Whilst our results are thus correct, we can understand the confusion and have added a sentence to explain the model used in the figure/table legends.</p><p>Figure. 2 Extrinsic Incubation Period in high versus low infected mosquitoes.

The fact that earlier colonization of SG and correlation between SG burden and numbers expelled suggest it could be the case, but it would be interesting to directly measure the prevalence of expelling over time to directly assess the effect of the sporozoite burden (not just at day 15 but before). This could reveal how the parasite burden in mosquitoes is a determinant of transmission.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and will consider this for future experiments. It adds another variable that is highly relevant but will also complicate comparisons where sporozoite expelling is related to both time since infectious blood meal and salivary gland sporozoite density (that is also dependent on time since infectious bloodmeal). Moreover, we then consider it important to measure this over the entire duration of sporozoite expelling, including late time-points post infectious bloodmeal. This may form part of a follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another question is whether all sporozoites (among expelled parasites) are equally infective, i.e. susceptible to induce secondary infection. If not, this could reconcile the data of this study and previous results in the rodent model where high burdens were associated with an increased probability to transmit.</p></disp-quote><p>As also indicated above, we are aware of a single study that assessed NF54 sporozoite infectivity on different days post infection (days 12-13-14-15-16-18) and observed no clear differences in ‘per sporozoite hepatocyte invasion capacity’ over this period (DOI: 10.1111/cmi.12745). We nevertheless agree that it is conceivable that sporozoites require maturation in the salivary glands and might not all be equally infectious. While hepatocyte invasion experiments are conducted with bulk harvesting of all the sporozoites that are present in the salivary glands, it would even be more interesting to assess the invasion capacity of the smaller population of sporozoites that migrate to the proboscis to be expelled. This would, as the reviewer will appreciate, be a major endeavour. To do this well the expelled sporozoites would need to be harvested from the salivary glands/proboscis and used in the best and most natural environment for invasion. The suggested work would thus depend on the availability of primary hepatocytes since conventional cell-lines like HC-04 are likely to underestimate sporozoite invasion. Importantly, there are currently no opportunities to include the barrier of the skin environment in invasion assays whilst this may be highly important in determining the likelihood that sporozoites manage to achieve invasion and give rise to secondary infections. In short, we agree with the reviewer that these experiments are of interest but consider these well beyond the scope of the current work. We have added a section to the Discussion section to highlight these future avenues for research. ‘Of note, our assessments of EIP and of sporozoite expelling did not confirm the viability of sporozoites. Whilst the infectivity of sporozoites at different time-points post infection has been examine previously (ref), these experiments have never been conducted with individual mosquito salivary glands. To add to this complexity, such experiments would ideally retain the skin barrier that may be a relevant determinant for invasion capacity and primary hepatocytes.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors evaluated oocyst rupture at day 18, i.e. 3 days after feeding experiments (performed at day 15). Did they check in control experiments that the prevalence of rupture oocysts does not vary between day 15 and day 18?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not do this and consider it very unlikely that there is a noticeable increase in the number of ruptured oocysts between days 15 and 18. We observe that salivary gland invasion plateaus around day 12 and the provision of a second bloodmeal that is known to accelerate oocyst maturation and rupture (doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009131) makes it even less likely that a relevant fraction of oocysts ruptures very late. Perhaps most compellingly, the time of oocyst rupture will depend on nutrient availability and rupture could thus occur later for oocysts from a heavily infected gut compared to oocysts from mosquitoes with a low infection burden. We observe a very strong association between salivary gland sporozoite density (day 15) and oocyst density (assessed at day 18) without any evidence for change in the number of sporozoites per oocyst for different oocyst densities. In our revised manuscript we have also assessed correlations for different ranges of oocyst intensities and see highly consistent correlation coefficients and find no evidence for a change in ‘slope’. If oocyst rupture would regularly happen between days 15 and 18 and this late rupture would be more common in heavily infected mosquitoes, we would expect this to affect the associations presented in figures 3B and 4C This is not the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors report higher sporozoite numbers per oocyst and a higher proportion of SG invasion as compared to previous studies (30-50% rather than 20%). How do they explain these differences? Is it due to the detection method and/or second blood meal? Or parasite species?</p></disp-quote><p>We were also intrigued by these findings in light of existing literature. To address potential discrepancies, it is indeed possible that the 2nd bloodmeal made a difference. In addition, NF54 is known to be a highly efficient parasite in terms of gametocyte formation and transmission. And there are marked differences in these performances between NF54 isolates and definitely between NF54 and its clone 3D7 that is regularly used. We also used a molecular assay to detect and quantify sporozoites but consider it less likely that this is a major factor in terms of explaining SG invasion since sporozoite densities were typically within the range that would be detected by microscopy. We can only hypothesize that the 2nd bloodmeal may have contributed to these findings and acknowledge this in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The median numbers of expelled sporozoites seem to be higher in the natural gametocyte infection experiments as compared to the cultures. Is it due to the mosquito species (An. coluzzii versus An. stephensi?).</p></disp-quote><p>The added value of our field experiments, a more relevant mosquito species and more relevant parasite isolates, is also a weakness in terms of understanding possible differences between in vitro experiments and field experiments with naturally circulating parasite strains. We only conclude that our in vitro experiments do not over-estimate sporozoite expelling by using a highly receptive mosquito source and artificially high gametocyte densities. We have clarified this in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>39% of sporozoite-positive mosquitoes failed to expel, irrespective of infection densities. Could the authors discuss possible explanations for this observation?</p></disp-quote><p>In paragraph 304-307 we now write that:” This finding broadly aligns with an earlier study of Medica and Sinnis that reported that 22% of P. yoelii infected mosquitoes failed to expel sporozoites. For highly infected mosquitoes, this inefficient expelling has been related to a decrease of apyrase in the mosquito saliva”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, it would be interesting to zoom in the 0-1k window, below the apparent threshold for successful expelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We have generated correlation estimates for different ranges of oocyst and sporozoite densities and added these in Supplementary Table 5.

For completeness, we include the main points here again. We enriched gametocytes for efficiency reasons, experiments on gametocytes at physiological concentrations would have resulted in a lower oocyst density and thus more ‘natural’ although a minority of individuals achieves very high oocyst densities in all studies that included a broad range of oocyst densities e.g. doi: 10.1016/j.exppara.2014.12.010; doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30044-6. Of note, we did include 15 skins from low oocyst densities (1-4 oocysts). Whilst low oocyst densities were thus not very uncommon in our sample set, we acknowledge that this may have rendered some comparisons underpowered. At the same time, we observe a strong positive trend between oocyst density and sporozoite density and between salivary gland sporozoite density and mosquito inoculum. This makes it very likely that this trend is also present at lower oocyst densities, an association where sporozoite inoculation saturates at high densities is plausible and has been observed before for rodent malaria (DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008181) whilst we consider it less likely that sporozoite expelling would be more efficient at low (unmeasured) sporozoite densities. In the revised manuscript we have also performed our analysis including only the subset of mosquitoes with low oocyst burden.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The best way to address this would be to do comparable artificial skin-feeding experiments on such wild-caught mosquitoes, but I appreciate that this is very difficult to do.</p></disp-quote><p>This would indeed by difficult to do. Mostly because infection status can only be examined post-hoc and it is likely that &gt;95% of mosquitoes are sporozoite negative at the moment experiments are conducted (in many settings this will even be &gt;99%). Importantly, also in wild-caught mosquitoes very high oocyst burdens are observed in a small but relevant subset of mosquitoes (doi: 10.1016/j.ijpara.2020.05.012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Instead, I would suggest the authors conduct addition analysis of their data using different cut-offs for maximum oocyst numbers (e.g. &lt;5, &lt;10, &lt;20) to determine if these correlations hold across the entire range of observed oocyst sheets and salivary gland sporozoite load.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided these calculations for the proposed range of oocyst numbers. In addition, we also provided them for a range of sporozoite densities. These findings are now provided in</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Entire range of observed oocyst sheets and salivary gland sporozoite load. A minor point on the regression lines in Figures 3 &amp; 4: both variables in these plots have inherent variation (measurement &amp; natural), but regression techniques such as reduced major exit regression (MAR) that allow error in both x and y variables may be preferable to a standard lines regression. Also, as it is implausible that mosquitoes with zero sporozoite in salivary glands expel several hundred sporozoites at feeding, the regression should probably also be constrained to pass through the 0,0 point.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the main priority of the analyses is the correlation, and not the fit of the regression line – which is only for indication, and also because of the availability of software, we did not change the type of regression. We have however added a disclaimer to the legend, and we have also forced the intercept to 0 – which does indeed better reflect the biological association. Additionally we added 95% confidence intervals to all Spearman’s correlation coefficients in the legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
