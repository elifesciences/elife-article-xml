to differential expression of the parental alleles of some genes. Here we investigate genomic imprinting in the cerebellum using a newly developed Bayesian statistical model that provides unprecedented transcript-level resolution. We uncover 160 imprinted transcripts, including 41 novel and independently validated imprinted genes. Strikingly, many genes exhibit parentally biased—rather than monoallelic—expression, with different magnitudes according to age, organ, and brain region. Developmental changes in parental bias and overall gene expression are strongly correlated, suggesting combined roles in regulating gene dosage. Finally, brain-specific deletion of the paternal, but not maternal, allele of the paternally-biased <italic>Bcl-x,</italic> (<italic>Bcl2l1</italic>) results in loss of specific neuron types, supporting the functional significance of parental biases. These findings reveal the remarkable complexity of genomic imprinting, with important implications for understanding the normal and diseased brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07860.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07860.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07860.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells in the human body contain two copies of each chromosome—one that was inherited from the individual's mother and one from the father—and therefore contain two copies of every gene. While both copies are usually used equally and simultaneously to produce proteins, in a minority of cases the gene from one parent is silenced in a process known as genomic imprinting. This is generally achieved via the addition of chemical marks onto the DNA, which prevent the molecular machinery that activates genes from accessing the genetic material.</p><p>Previous efforts to map imprinting in the brain throughout the mouse genome have yielded inconsistent results, due in part to the large number of factors that can affect gene expression. Perez, Rubinstein, Fernandez et al. have now addressed this issue by applying a combined approach, which includes developing a powerful statistical model that takes into account variation in age, sex, and mouse strain and extensively validating each imprinted gene candidate using an independent experimental technique.</p><p>Perez, Rubinstein, Fernandez et al. analyzed genomic imprinting initially in a part of the brain called the cerebellum in both young and adult mice. This analysis confirmed the occurrence of imprinting in 74 genes identified in previous studies, and revealed imprinting for the first time in a further 41 genes. The degree of imprinting varied between genes. In some genes only one copy was expressed and the other was completely silenced whereas others only deviated from the two copies being expressed equally. For individual genes, imprinting varied with age, tending to be more pronounced in young animals than in adults. It also varied between brain regions and typically genes were imprinted more in the brain compared to elsewhere in the body.</p><p>Mapping the activities of the imprinted genes revealed that many are involved in regulating the process of controlled cell death, or ‘apoptosis’. For one particular test gene, selectively deleting either the maternal or paternal copy had different effects on the mice, thereby confirming that imprinting can affect brain development and activity. With this in mind, the potential impact of imprinting should also be considered when evaluating the effects of inherited mutations on human health.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07860.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07860.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>genomic imprinting</kwd><kwd>molecular neuroscience</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Bcl-x</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulac</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1P50MH094271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulac</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A subset of genes in the mouse brain show dynamically regulated and unequal expression of maternally and paternally derived variants, with implications for brain development and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammalian brains, neural computations underlying signal processing and behavioral control are conducted by a large diversity of cell types, each defined by unique but flexible patterns of connectivity, electrical properties, and profiles of gene expression and chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fishell and Heintz, 2013</xref>). New experimental and conceptual frameworks have begun to address the nature of long-lasting regulatory changes at the level of the chromatin that may contribute to the establishment of neuronal identities and participate in stable encoding of cellular memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dulac, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Genomic imprinting is a unique and long lasting form of epigenetic inheritance that relies on chromatin modifications or ‘imprints’ established in the parental germ lines and maintained in cells of the developing and adult organism, resulting in the differential expression of the maternally- or the paternally-inherited allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartolomei and Ferguson-Smith, 2011</xref>). Although expression differences between parental alleles are commonly assumed to be all-to-none, a substantial number of imprinted genes have been shown to exhibit a biased expression from one of the parental alleles in at least some tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Khatib, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Menheniott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tierling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gregg, 2014</xref>). Imprinted genes have been shown to play key roles during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cleaton et al., 2014</xref>), in the placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tunster et al., 2013</xref>), and more recently, in the developing and adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wilkinson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Keverne, 2012</xref>). A systematic survey of the expression patterns of known imprinted genes in the brain indicates a preferential enrichment of imprinted gene expression in a subset of brain areas, in particular those involved in feeding, social, and motivated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the prominent role of imprinted genes in brain development and function is evidenced by a number of human disorders and mouse mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wilkinson et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, patients with Prader–Willi syndrome, caused by loss of paternal expression in the q11-13 region of human chromosome 15, display abnormal development, hyperphagia, mental retardation, and volatile behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peters, 2014</xref>). In contrast, Angelman syndrome, which is caused by loss of maternal expression in the same genomic region, results in mental retardation, impaired speech, and an abnormally joyful demeanor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peters, 2014</xref>). Similarly, Birk-Barel mental retardation syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barel et al., 2008</xref>) is caused by mutations in the human maternally expressed <italic>KCNK9</italic> gene, and phenotypes associated with loss of the imprinted genes <italic>Grb10</italic>, <italic>Mest</italic>, and <italic>Peg3</italic> in the mouse exhibit impairments in specific social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lefebvre et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isles et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garfield et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A key feature of genomic imprinting lies in the transmission of epigenetic marks that remain stable across cell divisions throughout the lifespan of the organism and in different tissues. Surprisingly, subsets of genes have been reported to exhibit tissue-specific imprinting, and the whole brain, neurons and certain brain regions emerged as hot spots for such regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrecht et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sato and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prickett and Oakey, 2012</xref>). A genome-wide identification of allelic parental bias throughout the adult and developing brain appears therefore necessary to fully assess the role of genomic imprinting in the nervous system. Such a quest has been noticeably difficult to achieve. Initial methods to uncover imprinted genes based on the differential expression between parthenogenetic (containing only maternally derived chromosomes) and androgenetic (containing only paternally derived chromosomes) embryos, and subsequent discovery of adjacent imprinted loci within the genome were mainly focused on early developmental stages, and led to the identification of approximately 100 imprinted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kaneko-Ishino et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hagiwara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ruf et al., 2006</xref>). The development of next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) allowed for genome-wide screens of parentally biased allelic expression in any tissue of interest using F1s of reciprocal crosses between distantly related mouse strains. An intriguing question was whether or not this new, and presumably more powerful, experimental strategy would uncover novel imprinted genes. The answer to this question was proven challenging and controversial. In pioneer RNA-seq analyses of mouse hybrids, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babak et al. (2008)</xref> used neonatal brains and E9.5 embryos, respectively, and determined parental biases by testing if the sum of parentally phased reads along a gene significantly deviates from biallelic expression. This approach, combined with shallow sequencing, only identified a handful of novel imprinted genes and failed to detect genes known to be imprinted in the profiled tissues. Next, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al. (2010)</xref> conducted an imprinting study at higher resolution by characterizing the preoptic area and prefrontal cortex of adult males and females, and the E15 brain, with an over 10-fold higher sequencing depth compared to the two previous studies. This experimental design, combined with testing for deviation from biallelic expression of parentally phased reads at each single SNP rather than along an entire gene, resulted with a much larger number of novel imprinted gene candidates. However, most of the novel imprinted candidates were not subject to independent experimental validation. In turn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeVeale et al. (2012)</xref> criticized the use of single SNPs to infer imprinting and the lack of systematic independent validation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al. (2010)</xref> as leading to a large and underestimated false discovery rate, and suggested that the vast majority of imprinted genes in mouse were likely already uncovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeVeale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48a">Kelsey and Bartolomei, 2012</xref>).</p><p>These early studies indicate that several critical considerations should be taken into account to allow for accurate and powerful detection of parental bias using RNA-seq. First, the use of large numbers of biological samples is essential to achieve high statistical power; second, since transcripts are purified and sequenced it is more appropriate to quantify the relative abundances of all allele-specific transcript variants of a given gene rather than rely on the less accurate assessment of allelic expression at the gene level; third, a principled and formal statistical model should be used that explicitly accounts for the biological variability among samples and all factors in the experimental design (e.g., cross, sex, and age), and finally, a systematic independent validation of all imprinted candidates is necessary.</p><p>The present study addresses these various challenges and establishes a novel and rigorous framework for detecting imprinting from RNA-seq data. We have processed the RNA-seq data in an allele-aware manner and inferred parent-of-origin biased expression with a newly developed Bayesian regression allelic imbalance model (BRAIM), which accounts for all sources of variability in the experimental design. We further build upon these methodological and experimental advances to gain insights into the spatial and developmental dynamics of parent-of-origin allelic expression. From our study, the apoptotic pathway emerges as an important target of imprinting regulation, and we provide evidence that the paternal and maternal alleles of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> (<italic>Bcl2l1</italic>) contribute unequally to brain development. These findings open exciting new avenues for investigating epigenetic mechanisms underlying the normal and pathological brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome-wide profile of parent-of-origin expression in the mouse cerebellum</title><p>We performed a genome-wide screen for imprinted genes in the cerebellum, a brain structure involved in motor control and implicated in autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaral et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>). The cerebellum is large enough to enable RNA profiling from tissue of a single animal and contains well-characterized cell types and connectivity. Moreover, unlike other brain structures, cerebellar development occurs largely postnatally, thus providing direct access to key neurodevelopmental processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hashimoto and Hibi, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The high variability of RNA expression across individuals requires the use of large numbers of biological samples to achieve statistical power and accurate detection of parental bias. Tissue was dissected from F1 mouse hybrids of Cast/EiJ and C57Bl/6J reciprocal crosses and RNA transcripts were sequenced from 48 individual cerebella representing two developmental stages and both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Half of the cerebella were collected at postnatal day 8 (P8), a period in which newly-born granule cells migrate to the inner granule layer. The remaining samples were collected from adult animals (P60). Each age group had equal numbers of males and females. Therefore, our experimental design includes six replicates for each cross, sex, and age combination, which enables inference of genomic imprinting across all individuals, while taking into account the effects of the different experimental factors.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07860.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Workflow of transcriptome-wide profiling of allele-specific expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) First, F1 hybrids were generated by crossing C57Bl/6J males with Cast/EiJ females (F1 initial) and reciprocally crossing Cast/EiJ males with females C57Bl/6J (F1 reciprocal).

In turn, quantification at the transcript level is also necessary to accurately estimate the expression of a given gene, which is merely the sum of all its isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jiang and Wong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Turro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trapnell et al., 2013</xref>). However, since a large fraction of reads do not map uniquely to a single transcript (e.g., reads originating from constitutive exons) or even to unique genomic locations, transcript- and gene-expression levels can only be estimated with some degree of certainty, that is, with estimation error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jiang and Wong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Turro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trapnell et al., 2013</xref>). The uncertainty in estimating transcript- and gene-expression levels is even more pronounced when quantifying allele-specific expression, because the high sequence similarity between the two alleles results in a high level of read-mapping ambiguity. An additional concern arises from the mapping of RNA-seq hybrid data to the mouse C57Bl/6J reference genome, as it will favor the mapping of reads originating from the C57Bl/6J allele, and may therefore lead to inaccurate estimates of allele-specific expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vijaya Satya et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, accurate inference of genomic imprinting requires a statistical model that explicitly accounts for expression-level uncertainty in each sample, together with the biological and technical variability, and the effects of all factors in the experimental design, such as sex, age, and, in the case of mouse hybrids, the cross of each sequenced subject.</p><p>To address these challenges, we applied the following steps in the analysis of the cerebellar RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’). First, we generated Cast/EiJ and C57Bl/6J diploid genomes and transcriptomes by incorporating Cast/EiJ and C57Bl/6J single nucleotide- and short insertion and deletion polymorphisms (SNPs and indels, obtained from the Mouse Genome Project: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk/REL-1303-SNPs_Indels-GRCm38">ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk/REL-1303-SNPs_Indels-GRCm38</ext-link>) into the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> GRCm38 reference genome sequence using the AlleleSeq package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rozowsky et al., 2011</xref>). We then mapped each of the Cast/EiJ×C57Bl/6J hybrid RNA-seq libraries to the splice-junction aware diploid genome using STAR RNA-seq aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). For each mapped RNA-seq library, we then estimated the expression level of each transcript with its respective error, for each allele in a Cast/EiJ×C57Bl/6J diploid transcriptome using MMSEQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Turro et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, we developed a statistical model testing for genomic imprinting at the level of each transcript, while taking into account the effects of cross, sex, and age across all samples. Specifically, we developed a BRAIM which is a Bayesian variable selection regression model extending <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chipman et al. (1997)</xref> by accounting for the measurement error in the response (‘Materials and methods’). In our settings, we define the response as the difference between the paternal and the maternal expression levels for a given transcript in each sample in the experiment, that is, the parental bias. The model therefore computes a posterior distribution of the magnitude of the parental bias, and of the effects that all factors have on the parental bias, along with their marginal posterior probabilities (PPs) of being significantly different from zero.</p><p>We fitted our model to 49,464 heterozygous autosomal and X-linked transcripts (comprised of 32,399 protein-coding and 17,065 non-coding transcripts, see ‘Materials and methods’) from 31,547 genes expressed at levels above 0.01 transcripts per million (TPM) units (solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’). A minimal threshold of 0.01 TPM was chosen because it allows for accurate and independently validated detection of parentally biased genes. We note that choosing a more stringent expression level cutoff (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and see ‘Materials and methods’) had a negligible effect on all the analyses described from here on. The distribution of the PPs of the parental effect for autosomal transcripts shows that most are not inferred to be imprinted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A–C</xref>). It also clearly identifies a group of autosomal transcripts with PP &gt; 0.95, which we set as our cutoff for calling an effect significant (‘Materials and methods’). Our analysis also identifies a clear and substantial effect of strain on expression, as evidenced by the distribution of PPs when we account for the cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A–C</xref>). This is most likely due to the divergence of the Cast/EiJ and C57Bl/6J strains, specifically in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions of the genes expressed in the cerebellum.</p><p>We did not identify autosomal imprinted transcripts with a sex effect with PP above the 0.95 cutoff, indicating that genomic imprinting is sex invariant in the mouse cerebellum. However, a group of autosomal imprinted transcripts were found to have an age effect with PPs above the 0.95 cutoff, indicating age-regulated imprinting (described in more detail below). Finally, among X-linked transcripts, above the PP cutoff, we detect two transcripts of the known imprinted <italic>Xlr3b</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2005</xref>), and a single transcript from each of two <italic>Xlr3b</italic> paralogs, <italic>Xlr3a</italic> and <italic>Xlr3c</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D–F</xref>). The high sequence similarity between these paralogs does not allow us to distinguish which of these transcripts are actually imprinted and we therefore excluded them from the remaining analyses. Using these criteria, we identified 124 genes represented by 169 transcripts as candidate imprinted genes in our data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>).</p><p>Among these candidates, 74 genes were reported and validated as imprinted in previosuly published studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref>). The remaining 50 genes have not been previously described as imprinted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To independently evaluate parental allelic expression bias in all these candidates, we used pyrosequencing, a real-time sequence-by-synthesis approach relying on light emissions after nucleotide incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang and Elbein, 2007</xref>). As positive and negative controls, we tested 11 known imprinted genes and 11 randomly selected genes with no significant parental effects according to our RNA-seq analysis, respectively. For each candidate and control gene, we tested an average of two SNPs per gene (‘Materials and methods’) in 12 individual cerebella dissected from P60 and/or 12 P8 hybrids. All samples used in the pyrosequencing validations are distinct from those used in the RNA-seq experiments. We estimated parental allelic effects in the pyrosequencing data using BRAIM. The pyrosequencing data confirmed significant parental effects for 41 of the candidate novel imprinted genes and the expected significant and non-significant parental effects for all positive and negative controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1I</xref>). Among the imprinted cerebellar genes identified, we observed a slightly greater number of genes with a paternal bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, five genes preferentially express distinct isoforms from both the maternal and paternal alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and see below).</p><p>The distribution of the parental biases in the 115 novel and known imprinted genes spans a wide range, from a weak bias (just above 50:50%) up to strong monoallelic expression (100:0%). The bias distribution follows a bimodal shape at its two extremes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), with 36 genes displaying weak biases (from slightly above 50:50–60:40%) and 55 genes showing strong biases (90:10–100:0%). The remaining 32 genes show a moderate bias, from above 60:40% to below 90:10%. Interestingly, the weak bias mode is enriched with newly identified imprinted genes (yet includes 10 detected known imprinted genes) whereas stronger biases are enriched with known imprinted genes (yet includes 18 newly detected imprinted genes). A strong correspondence (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.91, p-value &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup>) is found between the biases identified by RNA-seq and pyrosequencing, respectively, thus suggesting high accuracy in their quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows examples of various levels of allelic parental biases.

Importantly, these effects appear highly reproducible across cerebellum samples analyzed both with RNA-seq and pyrosequencing. Considering 74 known imprinted genes detected in this analysis as true positives, together with 41 newly validated imprinting genes out of 50 novel candidates (altogether represented by 160 transcripts), the precision of our approach is ∼93% and increases the number of identified mouse imprinted genes by ∼30% (from 138 to 179, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G, H</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07860.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Examples of genes imprinted in the cerebellum and of a biallelic control.</title><p><italic>Fkbp6</italic>, <italic>Ago2</italic>, and <italic>Nhlrc1</italic> show parentally-biased expression in the cerebellum as observed by RNA-seq (left) and confirmed with pyrosequencing (right). <italic>Clptm1l</italic> shows biallelic expression in the cerebellum in both RNA-seq and pyrosequencing experiments.

This observation supports the existence of additional parental biases in our data that do not meet the chosen 0.95 cutoff.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Isoform-specific imprinting</title><p>Our approach readily estimates parental bias at the transcript level, as seen in the allelic analysis of the 11 expressed isoforms of the imprinted gene <italic>Rian</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hatada et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our data suggest that most imprinted genes, including <italic>Rian</italic>, show a consistent imprinting pattern in all isoforms. However, isoform-specific imprinting is readily identified by our approach, and can be seen in two different genomic contexts. A few genes harboring a paternally expressed gene inserted within an intron (often a retrogene) have been shown to generate different isoforms from the maternal and paternal alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wood et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cowley et al., 2012</xref>). Although it is unclear exactly how such regulation arises, transcriptional interference by the intronic paternally expressed gene may play an important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McCole and Oakey, 2008</xref>). Our analysis readily identified previously reported cases of genes in which isoforms are subject to such regulation (e.g., the <italic>H13</italic>-<italic>Mcts2</italic> locus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, it detected additional imprinted transcripts in the <italic>Herc3</italic> gene- either or both of two short transcripts (indistinguishable by our sequence data) from a promoter upstream to the large 25 exons-long transcript (Gencode transcript IDs: ENSMUST00000141600.1 and ENSMUST00000122981.1), which are preferentially expressed by the maternal allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Other known cases of isoform-specific imprinting are due to differential methylation of alternative promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaud et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peters and Williamson, 2007</xref>).

This transcript is presumably a non-coding RNA since no open reading frame could be identified. In total, we detected 8 of the 10 known cases of isoform-specific imprinting (the missing two cases are the short isoform of <italic>Cdh15</italic>, which is not expressed in the cerebellum, and the long isoform of <italic>Blcap</italic>, which is not heterozygous in the Cast/EiJ×C57Bl/6J hybrids), and we uncovered additional imprinted isoforms, including a novel example of isoform-specific imprinting in the <italic>Mest</italic> locus.

Our analysis shows that the age effects on the magnitude of the parental bias and on the overall expression are positively correlated, such that both the magnitude of the parental bias and the overall expression level of imprinted genes tend to increase or decrease together with age (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.33; p-value = 4 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Since the ability to accurately detect and estimate parental biases is limited at low expression levels, we repeated this analysis with a higher expression level threshold (right to the dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) but found no significant effect on our results. The relationship between parental bias and overall expression identified in our analysis may result from the fact that the two parental alleles experience differential transcriptional regulation during development, thereby altering both the magnitude of the parental bias as well as the overall level of expression. To test this hypothesis we fitted our model to the data where we defined the response as either the paternal or the maternal expression level. This analysis reveals that age regulated expression or parental bias (age effect PP &gt; 0.95) is achieved either by a significant change in the expression level only of the most highly expressed (preferred) parental allele (PA; 19 genes, aligned along the X-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), a significant change in the expression level only of the non-preferred allele (8 genes, aligned along the Y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), or a significant change in the expression levels of both alleles (12 genes, aligned along the diagonal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Finally, some genes have a significant change in expression and/or parental bias only when both alleles are combined but not when the alleles are analyzed separately (11 genes, scattered around the origin of axes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that altering the expression level of the preferred allele is the most common mode through which imprinted genes are regulated according to age (p-value = 0.03; <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> test), and this allelic regulation changes both the parental bias as well as the overall expression level. It is also possible that the enhanced expression and parental bias observed in the P8 cerebellum originates from different cellular compositions of the developing and adult cerebellum. These scenarios are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>A number of genes for which the parental bias in the cerebellum is affected by age are associated with developmental processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. For instance, the <italic>Asb4</italic> gene, which regulates embryonic stem-cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Townley-Tilson et al., 2014</xref>), exhibits highly maternally-biased expression during cerebellar development but is biallelically expressed during adulthood, which is achieved by a significant decrease in maternal expression and a slight increase in paternal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The growth suppressor <italic>Grb10</italic> gene exhibits biallelic expression at P8 but exclusive paternal expression in the adult resulting from silencing of the maternal allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a switch in the parental bias for the transcription factor <italic>Zim1</italic>, from maternal during development to paternal in the adult cerebellum due to a reduction in maternal expression level (PP = 1.0), and no change in paternal expression (PP = 0.19) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis uncovered a novel imprinted locus at the distal end of chromosome 1, which exhibits age-dependent regulation.

The remaining 9 genes (8%) are isolated from other known or newly identified imprinted genes. Moreover, although most newly identified imprinted genes from this study are located within or around known imprinted clusters, 7 of the 41 (17%) appear isolated in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). We noticed that a substantial number of imprinted genes displaying weak to moderate parental bias localize to the vicinity of imprinted genes showing stronger parental bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For example, <italic>Ankrd34c</italic> and <italic>Ctsh</italic>, two genes that exhibit a weak paternal bias (note: the parental bias of <italic>Ankrd34c</italic> is significant according to the pyrosequencing data only), are located up- and downstream to <italic>Rasgrf1</italic>, a gene exclusively expressed from the paternal allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This observation led us to explore whether parental bias consistently decays as a function of the distance from strongly biased genes. We first defined imprinted cluster centers as genes for which the parental bias of the preferentially expressed allele reaches at least 85%, and subsequently assigned adjacent imprinted genes with an intergenic distance of up to 1 MB as members of the same cluster (‘Materials and methods’). This step partitioned the imprinted genes in our data to a total of 24 imprinted clusters. Analysis of the magnitude of the parental bias as a function of the distance to the cluster center reveals a statistically significant negative effect (p-value = 1.08 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, ‘Materials and methods’), supporting a model of decay of parental bias from imprinted cluster centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Importantly, not all of the imprinted clusters follow these patterns. For instance, the developmentally regulated imprinted cluster on chromosome 1 (described above and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) does not contain any strongly imprinted gene that could be categorized as a cluster center, nor does it exhibit a decay in the parental bias of adjacent genes.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07860.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Genomic patterns of mild to moderate parental biases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of imprinted genes according to the level of parental bias and genomic location relative to the nearest imprinted gene.

Our observations suggest that genes with weak to moderate parental biases may be indirectly affected by the silencing taking place at adjacent and strongly biased imprinting cluster center genes, perhaps through local chromatin conformation. Alternatively, more directed processes may regulate weak to moderate parental biases as these biases may be functionally important. Moreover, genes with weak biases in some tissue may display robust parental biases in specific cell types or developmental stages.</p><p>We reasoned that if the imprinting regulation of genes in which we detect weak-to-moderate parental bias at the boundaries of imprinted clusters is functionally important, natural selection may operate against disruption of the clustered organization, and thus the clustered organization, or micro-synteny, of such genes would tend to be conserved during mammalian evolution. Alternatively, if imprinting regulation of genes with weak-to-moderate parental bias is not functionally important, and simply reflects the indirect byproduct of regulation of adjacent genes, the micro-synteny of these genes is not expected to be strongly conserved across mammalian genomes. To test these hypotheses, we derived all pairs of adjacent genes in the mouse genome with orthologs in at least one of 15 other mammalian genomes (409,874 gene pairs) and estimated the tendency of their mammalian orthologs to be adjacent as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>, and ‘Materials and methods’), using a probabilistic phylogenetic model analyzing phyletic patterns of presence and absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>). This analysis reveals that the mean propensity of adjacency of mammalian orthologs of weakly imprinted gene pairs in the mouse (parental biases below 85%) is significantly higher than the mean propensity of adjacency of orthologs of all mouse adjacent gene pairs (p-value = 0.007, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These findings suggest that the micro-synteny of imprinted clusters is evolutionary conserved, thus supporting the idea that the imprinting regulation of mouse genes with weak-to-moderate parental biases is functionally important. This also suggests that the orthologs of many of these genes may be imprinted in other mammalian species.</p><p>In addition to newly identified imprinted genes associated with known imprinted clusters, several novel imprinted genes appear isolated from any other known imprinted gene (&gt;2 MB away). Previous studies have reported a differential methylation between the two parental alleles for some of these genes. For example, differential methylation was observed in a region of chromosome 13 immediately downstream of <italic>Nhlrc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xie et al., 2012</xref>), a novel paternally-biased gene in our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Differential methylation but not parentally biased expression in the brain was also reported within the Actinin alpha 1 (<italic>Actn1</italic>) gene at chromosome 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calaway and Domínguez, 2012</xref>), which codes for a protein that regulates cytoskeleton interactions with the membrane. Our results show that this gene is indeed preferentially expressed from the paternal allele in the cerebellum. We also uncovered the paternal-specific expression of the <italic>Fkbp6</italic> gene, which is isolated on distal chromosome 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, this gene displays maternal allele-specific binding of ZFP57, a DNA-binding protein that specifically binds to the majority of imprinted genes and protects them from demethylation after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Quenneville et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Spatial regulation of genomic imprinting</title><p>Tissue-dependent regulation of imprinting has been described for a subset of known imprinted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prickett and Oakey, 2012</xref>).

This pattern is also observed in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>).

To address this issue, we performed a pyrosequencing analysis of the parental biases of 13 genes inferred to be temporally and/or spatially regulated across the brain and in non-brain tissues, at postnatal days 0, 8, 15, and 64 in the cortex, hypothalamus, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1I</xref>). These three brain regions were selected for developmental analysis because they display contrasting imprinting patterns in the adult. In addition, we analyzed the parental bias of these 13 genes in the entire E15 brain. This analysis revealed substantial spatiotemporal dynamics of the parental bias of several genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). For instance, <italic>Blcap</italic> exhibits a gradual decrease in maternal bias over development consistently across the three analyzed brain regions. In contrast, the switch from maternal to paternal bias of <italic>Zim1</italic> during cerebellum development, occurs gradually along development in both the cerebellum and cortex, yet is not mirrored in the hypothalamus where maternal bias is strongly maintained into adulthood. Moreover, this analysis reveals that the sharp contrast between the parental biases of <italic>Igf2</italic> and <italic>Grb10</italic>, observed across the brain, seems to be temporally co-regulated. The switch in the expressed allele for both genes happens earlier in the cortex and hypothalamus than in the cerebellum, which roughly coincides with the completion of their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levitt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shimogori et al., 2010</xref>).

The category of programmed cell death (apoptosis) includes eight genes previously shown to exhibit parent-of-origin monoallelic expression, and five genes that we have newly identified as exhibiting parentally biased expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Our data thus uncover the programmed cell death pathway as a prominent target of imprinting. Noticeably, most of the maternally-biased genes (<italic>Cdkn1c</italic>, <italic>Kcnk9</italic>, <italic>Blcap</italic>, and <italic>Bmf</italic>) promote apoptosis, while most of the paternally-biased genes (<italic>Ndn</italic>, <italic>Peg3</italic>, <italic>Peg10</italic>, <italic>Plagl1</italic>, and <italic>Magel2</italic>) inhibit apoptosis. One gene of particular interest is the paternally-biased <italic>Bcl-x</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>), which can produce two distinct protein isoforms: the anti-apoptotic <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> and the pro-apoptotic <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, translated from two distinct mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boise et al., 1993</xref>). <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> is by far the predominant <italic>Bcl-x</italic> transcript in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Krajewska et al., 2002</xref>), where it exhibits widespread paternally-biased expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Also of interest is the gene <italic>Bag3</italic>, which was newly identified by our study as maternally-biased in the brain and biallelic in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Complete knockout of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> results in massive embryonic apoptosis and lethality, whereas loss of one allele has been reported to reduce brain size by ∼15% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kasai et al., 2003</xref>). We hypothesized that if the paternal and maternal alleles unequally contribute to the expression of <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> in the brain, and if this differential parental contribution is of functional significance, the differential loss of each parental allele should result in distinct functional outcomes. In particular, loss of the paternal (more highly expressed) allele should result in a significantly more severe phenotype than the loss of the maternal (less expressed) allele.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we generated deletions of the maternal and paternal alleles of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> specifically in the brain by transmitting a floxed <italic>Bcl-x</italic> allele from either the mother or the father to offspring along with a <italic>Nestin::Cre</italic> transgene, which is expressed specifically in the brain. The floxed <italic>Bcl-x</italic> allele enables CRE-dependent deletion of both the anti-apoptotic <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> and pro-apoptotic <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> isoforms. However, since <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> is substantially more highly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Krajewska et al., 2002</xref>), the brain-specific deletion of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> is expected to affect the <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> isoform nearly exclusively. As expected, neither the brain-specific maternal deletion nor paternal deletion of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> had a significant effect on the body weight of adult mice (week 11–12, ∼P80). However, we found that mice with a paternal <italic>Bcl-x</italic> deletion had a ∼15% reduced brain weight compared to wild type (WT) littermate controls, which carried the <italic>Nestin::Cre</italic> transgene and two WT copies of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In contrast, mice with a maternal <italic>Bcl-x</italic> deletion exhibited no significant difference in brain weight compared to WT littermates. We next asked whether the paternal <italic>Bcl-x</italic> deletion has observable effects on brain morphology by measuring the cross-sectional area of three different brain structures: cortex, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. In all three structures, significant differences in area were observed between mice with a paternal <italic>Bcl-x</italic> deletion and both mice with a maternal deletion and WT littermates, while no significant differences were found between mice with a maternal <italic>Bcl-x</italic> deletion and WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that the paternal allele of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> makes a more substantial contribution to brain development than the maternal allele.</p><p>We next assessed the cell specificity of the reduced brain weight phenotype observed upon the paternal deletion of <italic>Bcl-x</italic>. For these analyses, we used histochemical methods to quantify total cortical cells (DAPI) as well as subsets of cells that express specific cellular markers: NEUN (RBFOX3, neurons), S100ß (subset of glia), <italic>Vglut1</italic> (<italic>Slc17a7</italic>, subset of excitatory neurons), and <italic>Gad1</italic> (subset of inhibitory neurons). Our data show that DAPI+, NEUN+, and <italic>Vglut1</italic>+ cells were significantly reduced in paternal <italic>Bcl-x</italic> deletion cortices compared to their maternal deletion and WT counterparts, while S100ß+ and <italic>Gad1</italic>+ cells were not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Cell densities between the three genotypes differed only modestly for all cell types examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similar analyses of the effects of paternal and maternal <italic>Bcl-x</italic> deletion on lobule 6 of the cerebellum revealed significantly fewer cells in the molecular layer of paternal deletion compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Within the molecular and Purkinje layers, <italic>Gad1</italic>+ neurons were significantly reduced in number in mice with a paternal <italic>Bcl-x</italic> deletion compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2F,G</xref>). Together, these results reveal that deletion of the paternal allele of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> causes dramatic reductions in brain size and cell number that are not observed upon deletion of the maternal allele. Moreover, these effects differ according to cell type and brain region, with specific cell types affected in a given region. They therefore suggest a largely unexpected role of genomic imprinting in the regulation of the distribution of specific cell types in distinct areas of the mouse brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Transcriptome-wide analysis of genomic imprinting in the cerebellum</title><p>In this study we used the high resolution afforded by RNA-seq to profile genomic imprinting in the mouse cerebellum with high statistical power (48 biological samples). We analyzed expression of the parental alleles at the individual transcript level, and simultaneously estimated the effects of all factors in the experimental design (age, sex, and mouse cross) on parental allelic expression. This methodological approach allows precise quantification of the entire spectrum of parental biases observed in imprinted genes, and accurately reveals the contribution of each parental allele to the overall gene expression. In addition to 74 imprinted genes that had been previously validated in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tunster et al., 2013</xref>), our analysis detects 41 novel imprinted genes that we successfully confirmed by pyrosequencing. Taken together, our approach has a precision of ∼93% and our data increase the total number of reported imprinted genes in the mouse by approximately 30%.</p><p>Our approach demonstrates reliable inference of genomic imprinting when based on a large number of biological samples and a statistical method such as BRAIM that explicitly estimates the biological variability. Previous surveys of imprinting in the mouse either had only a single pair of F1i and F1r sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>) or had multiple such samples yet combined counts of reads across samples of the same cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeVeale et al., 2012</xref>) thereby overlooking biological variability and risking reaching erroneous conclusions (Simpson's paradox). A direct side-by-side comparison between our results and previously published data is not a fair comparison as our method naturally penalizes for the lower number of samples and possibly the weaker signal due to shallower sequencing. In addition, since none of the previously published high throughput screens for imprinting aimed to systematically validate all identified candidate imprinted genes, it is impossible to objectively estimate their associated false positive rates as achieved in this work.</p><p>Importantly, most of the newly identified imprinted genes, as well as a substantial number of those previously known, display weak-to-moderate parental biases rather than the more conventionally expected monoallelic expression. As the tissue samples analyzed by RNA-seq are comprised of a mixture of cell types it is impossible to distinguish whether the parental biases are present in all cell types of the cerebellum or whether they may result from averaging monoallelic expression of given transcripts in some cell types and biallelic representation in others. Interestingly, cell-type-specific imprinting has been reported for <italic>Gnas</italic> in the kidney within different segments of nephrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Weinstein et al., 2000</xref>), and for <italic>Ube3a</italic> and <italic>Snx14</italic> in neurons but not glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yamasaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Clarifying the origin of parental biases is clearly warranted and will require allelic resolution in defined cell types.</p><p>Is parentally-biased expression a form of genomic imprinting? Imprinted genes are often described and even defined as mononallelically expressed in a parent-of-origin specific manner. Such definition, however, is incomplete since a substantial number of known imprinted genes appear preferentially expressed from one of the parental alleles. Indeed, the concurrent detection of both mononallelically-expressed and parentally-biased imprinted genes has been highlighted in multiple genome-wide profiles of genomic imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeVeale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zou et al., 2014</xref>). Whether parentally-biased genes correspond to the same biological entity as other imprinted genes has been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Khatib, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gregg, 2014</xref>), but the regulation and functional significance of this phenomenon remains largely obscure.</p><p>Our data suggest that monoallelic and parentally biased representations share similar characteristics, and may thus represent different ranges of a common mode of differential regulation of parental allelic expression. First, the majority of imprinted genes with weak-to-moderate parental bias are located nearby or at known imprinted clusters, and we show that this localization is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting it is under purifying selection. Second, genes like <italic>Actn1</italic> and <italic>Nhlrc1</italic>, which exhibit weak parental biases and are isolated in the genome, have been reported to have differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the parental alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calaway and Domínguez, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xie et al., 2012</xref>). These DMRs may thus serve as imprinting control regions as has been shown for monoallelically expressed genes. Third, a substantial proportion of genes with weak-to-moderate biases, as well as strongly imprinted genes, show tissue and developmental-stage specificities in their parental biases. For instance, <italic>Copg2</italic> shows a weak maternal bias in the cerebellum (∼60% maternal expression to 40% paternal expression) while its maternal bias in the cortex is close to monoallelic (90% maternal expression to 10% paternal expression). It is therefore possible that many genes with weak-to-moderate parental bias in the cerebellum are actually strongly imprinted in other tissues or developmental stages. Finally, many of the genes with weak-to-moderate biases are implicated in the same biological processes as genes with strong biases, including cell survival and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dynamic temporal and spatial regulation of imprinted genes in the brain</title><p>Altogether, the parental bias and/or overall expression of more than half of the genes imprinted in the cerebellum are regulated according to age, with approximately 25% of cerebellum imprinted genes exhibiting changes in the magnitude of their parental bias between P8 and adult stages. Postnatal day 8 is an important milestone of cerebellar development that includes a peak of granule cell precursor proliferation, the active migration of granule cells to the inner granule layer, and the establishment of connectivity between mossy fibers, granule cells, and Purkinje cells. Interestingly, most of the regulated genes exhibit stronger parental biases and/or higher overall expression during this time point than in the mature cerebellum. This is the case for <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>, <italic>Plagl1</italic>, and <italic>Ago2</italic>, which are known to regulate cell survival and differentiation during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheloufi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tury et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schmidt-Edelkraut et al., 2014</xref>). A smaller subset of genes, including <italic>Stx6</italic>, <italic>Adam23</italic>, and <italic>Pcdhb12</italic>, have been shown to regulate cell motility and neuronal connectivity, suggesting that genomic imprinting is also involved in these developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Owuor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tiwari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Maniatis, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown differential regulation in the overall expression and, in some cases, the imprinting status of imprinted genes across body tissues and brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrecht et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prickett and Oakey, 2012</xref>). Our study adds substantial new insights into this phenomenon by investigating the regulation of parental bias of 28 known and novel imprinted genes, across 16 brain regions and 7 somatic non-neural tissues. Three interesting observations emerge from this analysis. First and most noticeably, many genes tested appear uniquely imprinted in the brain. Second, a subset of the genes tested show significant variability in the degree of parental bias across different brain regions. Third, genes within an imprinted cluster, as well as occasional genes located on distinct chromosomes, display interesting similarities in the patterns of paternal bias across brain regions. Additionally, for a subset of imprinted genes, we observed regulation of parental bias according to both the developmental stage and the brain region, suggesting that differences in parental bias observed throughout the adult brain may originate during the lineage specification of distinct brain regions, and may also result from different cellular compositions of the tissues analyzed.</p><p>The substantial spatial and temporal regulation of parent-of-origin allelic expression observed in our study, particularly between brain and non-brain tissues, raises the question of the specific mechanisms that may control these dynamics. For most imprinted genes, monoallelic or parentally biased expression has been shown to be primarily dependent on DNA methylation marks established in one of the parental germ lines, and maintained post-fertilization in the parental alleles of the embryo and mature organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartolomei and Ferguson-Smith, 2011</xref>). In a smaller subset of imprinted genes, the differential methylation of the parental alleles is established in somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>). Other genes such as <italic>Dlk1</italic> and <italic>Cdh15</italic> become biallelically expressed in specific cell types after gaining DNA methylation on the normally unmethylated allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferrón et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Proudhon et al., 2012</xref>). Based on these established mechanisms, it is possible that the observed spatial and temporal regulation of parental bias depends on cell-lineage-specific acquisition of DNA methylation or other epigenetic modifications in one of the parental alleles. It is also possible that changes in parental bias result from loss of methylation or perhaps hydroxymethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guo et al., 2011</xref>) of DMRs. Alternatively, spatial and temporal variations in parental biases may depend on the presence or absence of chromatin regulators directed by DNA methylation, which in turn control necessary steps to achieve preferential expression of one of the parental alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kulinski et al., 2013</xref>), or may rely on the use of brain- and brain region-specific promoter elements. If the parental bias of a certain gene changes according to cell-type, different cellular compositions may also contribute to the observed variability across tissues. This possibility is particularly intriguing in cases where parental biases change according to brain region.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relation between parental bias and gene expression</title><p>What, if any, is the functional significance of the dynamic regulation of parental biases identified in our study? We reasoned that the notion of a significant functional contribution of the observed parental bias to normal brain function and development should be supported by at least three elements: first, the parental bias of a given gene must be evolutionary conserved, second, changes in parental bias of a given gene should be consistent with changes in overall expression level, and third, uniparental deletions should lead to different phenotypes. Our data partially support these three notions. First, although we did not investigate parental biases in other species, the evolutionary conserved micro-synteny of biased genes suggests that natural selection may operate against the disruption of the biased expression. Second, an attractive hypothesis underlying parental allelic biases may lie on the requirement for different brain regions, and possibly neuronal types, to tightly regulate the expression of certain genes for proper cellular or network function. Converging evidence from mental disorders associated with slight over- or under-regulation of certain genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dölen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ramocki and Zoghbi, 2008</xref>) suggests that normal brain function may indeed require precise gene titration. Our study reveals that certain genes undergo striking variations in parental bias from one brain region to the next, or from one developmental stage to the other. For example, <italic>Ago2</italic> shows a modest 60% maternal bias in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, but a robust ∼80% maternal expression in the cortex. Similarly, <italic>Zim1</italic> shows biallelic expression in cortical regions, 85% maternal bias in the pallidum and hypothalamus, and 60% paternal expression in the cerebellum. These data, however, were collected using pyrosequencing, which does not inform on the overall gene expression level, hence such spatial changes in parental biases may, or may not, be associated with up- or down regulation of genes.</p><p>The RNA-seq data enabled us to detect a positive correlation between developmental changes in the magnitude of parental biases and overall gene expression for most imprinted genes. Moreover, we find evidence that in the majority of cases, an age-regulated increase in parental bias (age effect PP &gt; 0.95) is accompanied by a significant up-regulation in the expression level of the preferred allele and thus, an increase in parental bias correlates with an increase in overall expression level. This indicates that changes in parental bias and overall expression are coordinated according to development stage and brain region, which may effectively modulate gene dosages in individual cells. In addition, or alternatively, changes in parental biases may arise from different cellular distributions across developmental and adult brain areas. Both scenarios commonly point to a highly dynamic regulation of genomic imprinting according to neuronal types. Finally, the distinct phenotypes observed in mice bearing paternal and maternal deletions of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> argue strongly that, even for genes displaying weak-to-moderate biases, the two parental alleles may differ in their functional significance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The functional significance of <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> paternal bias</title><p>Several imprinted genes are known to play important roles in the apoptotic pathway, and we uncovered additional imprinted genes with apoptosis-related functions. Apoptosis plays an important role during brain development where it regulates cell population size and refines neuronal circuits by removing poorly connected or non-functional cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buss et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, most of the imprinted apoptosis-related genes observed in our study exhibit stronger overall expression and parental biases in the developing cerebellum than in the adult. We also observe a significant number of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes that are differentially expressed according to brain region. Considering that most neurons in the adult brain are post-mitotic, the functional significance of such spatial regulation is still unclear. Some imprinted genes, however, are known to be highly pleiotropic (e.g., <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tury et al., 2012</xref>), hence alternative functions of these imprinted apoptotic genes in the adult brain cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The <italic>Bcl-x</italic> gene, which performs a critical anti-apoptotic function in developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuan et al., 2000</xref>), exhibits a moderate bias in most adult brain regions and a slightly larger bias in the developing brain. Remarkably, the deletion of the paternal allele of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> results in a significant reduction in brain size and brain cell number compared to littermate controls, while deletion of the maternal allele has no significant effect. In addition, our histochemical analyses of brain regions from mutant mice and littermate controls reveal intriguing evidence for distinct functional consequences of the paternal <italic>Bcl-x</italic> deletion on specific cell types within a given region of the brain. In the cortex, we find that the paternal <italic>Bcl-x</italic> deletion preferentially affects neurons, but not glia, and more specifically, <italic>Vglut1</italic>-positive excitatory, but not <italic>Gad1</italic>-positive inhibitory neurons. In contrast, the <italic>Gad1</italic>-positive Purkinje cells are clearly affected by the paternal deletion in the cerebellum.</p><p>An unambiguous interpretation of these results will require future investigations to identify the origin of the paternal bias of <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>. If the observed parental bias of <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> within a given brain region is shared within all cells of the tissue, the deletion of the paternal allele should result in a larger reduction of <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> expression than deletion of the maternal allele, and the observed phenotype may reveal a high cellular sensitivity to the dosage of <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> at the cellular level. In contrast, if the observed parental bias of <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> in a given brain area originates from a mixture of cells expressing exclusively the paternal allele of <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> with cells expressing both parental alleles equally, the deletion of the paternal allele should result in the complete absence of <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> in mononallelically-expressing cells, likely resulting in cell death.

First, we downloaded the Gencode Retrotransposed (gencode.vM2.2wayconspseudos) GTF file and the ucscRetroInfo2 mm10 mouse genome assembly retrogenes annotation file from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karolchik et al., 2014</xref>). We eliminated any redundancy between the two transcript sets by selecting the longest transcript between any two transcripts represented in both files. Following that, we eliminated any redundancy between that retrogene set and gencode.vM2.annotation transcript set by selecting the longest transcript between any two transcripts represented in both sets. In order to remove any redundancy between our retrogene set and single-exon protein coding transcripts (which is a structural prominent feature of retrogenes) in gencode.vM2.annotation we kept the longest of any intersecting protein-coding single-exon transcript in gencode.vM2.annotation and retrogene in our retrogenes set. Subsequently, we added all transcripts from the UCSC knownGene mm10 mouse genome assembly annotation file, which are not indicated to be represented in the gencode.vM2.annotation set. Finally, we added all functional RNAs from the functional RNA database (fRNAdb, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mituyama et al., 2009</xref>), which did not intersect with any of the transcripts in the set we generated in the previous steps and is longer than our 59 bp read length. Altogether, this amounted in 148,120 transcripts from 92,965 genes, comprised of 60,978 protein coding transcripts, 87,142 non-coding transcripts, among which 16,404 are pseudogenes, 15,538 are retrogenes, 2518 are lincRNAs, and the remaining 52,682 are of other miscellaneous types. We then used the UCSC liftOver utility to generate a C57Bl/6J, Cast/EiJ diploid transcriptome set from our generated transcriptome set. We note that many retrogenes are highly redundant in sequence with their paralogs. In the case of short, single-end read RNA-seq data, the accuracy of their expression level estimates would therefore, by and large, be low. For this reason, retrogenes added from the ucscRetroInfo2 retrogenes annotation, which are of lower certainty than retrogenes in the Gencode annotation, are indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A–F</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA-seq sample preparation</title><p>RNA was isolated from tissues of interest using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer instructions and further purified using DNase I digestion and the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Netherlands). We required samples to have RNA integrity score of above 9, according to the Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) 2100 Bioanalyzer, to be used for RNA-seq library preparation. For each sample we used 3 μg of total RNA to prepare libraries according to the Illumina (San Diego, CA) Tru-Seq RNA Kit v2 sample preparation protocol. Sample purity and integrity was confirmed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. We selected an average fragment size of 250 bp. Each animal subject was used to prepare a single library and was sequenced on an individual lane generating 59 bp single-end reads. The average read depth across our samples was 168,991,714.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Processing of RNA-seq data</title><p>Each RNA-seq library was first subjected to quality and adapter trimming using the Trim Galore utility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore</ext-link>) with stringency level 3. We then mapped each of our C57Bl/6J×Cast/EiJ hybrid RNA-seq sequenced libraries to the C57Bl/6J, Cast/EiJ diploid genome and transcriptome splice junctions using STAR RNA-seq aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) allowing a maximum of three mismatches. Specifically, we mapped the data twice where after the first mapping step we incorporated valid splice junctions which were reported by STAR to exist in our RNA-seq data. We note that restricting the number of allowed mismatches to one had no apparent effect on the remaining downstream analyses. Subsequent to the second STAR mapping step we transformed our genomic alignments to transcriptomic alignments and thus filtered any alignments that did not map to our transcript set using custom code. We note that by doing so we allow the reads to unbiasedly align to their best locations in the splice-junction aware genome and subsequently keep our alignments of interest as opposed to aligning the read data directly to the transcriptome (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roberts and Pachter, 2013</xref>). Following that, we estimated the expression levels with their respective uncertainties of each transcript in our C57Bl/6J, Cast/EiJ diploid transcriptome using MMSEQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Turro et al., 2011</xref>). MMSEQ uses a Bayesian model for estimating expression levels and therefore computes a posterior distribution of the expression levels of each transcript in fragment per kilobase per million (FPKM) units. We first transformed these posterior FPKM samples to TPM units as TPM units were shown to be less biased and more interpretable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). We set the minimum expression TPM cutoff to 0.01. While this is a very low expression level, it still enables to detect genes with parentally biased expression, albeit with lower accuracy, in the estimated fraction of the preferentially expressed allele (see ‘Results’). In any RNA-seq sample, any transcript for which its MMSEQ posterior median TPM was lower than 0.01 was set to 0.01 (which we thus used as the minimal measureable expression level and therefore avoid taking the logarithm of 0). At a 0.01 TPM expression level cutoff we detect and validate genes with parentally biased expression, although at the very low expression levels the parental biases estimated by RNA-seq strongly deviate from those estimated by pyrosequencing and there is a higher fraction of false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This indicates that the accuracy of parental biases estimated by RNA-seq is limited at this range of low expression levels. Accordingly, the distribution of parental biases at very low expression levels does not follow the bimodal shape of parental biases of genes expressed at higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We therefore empirically defined a more stringent expression level cutoff corresponding to where the discrepancy between the parental biases estimated by RNA-seq and pyrosequencing drops dramatically (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1C</xref> and correspondingly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1B</xref>).</p><p>Using an extensive transcriptome annotation set has the advantage of estimating the expression levels (and therefore testing for parentally-biased expression) of as many known transcripts that are expressed in the tissue from which RNA was purified, as possible. However, it is very likely that highly similar transcripts (e.g., NAGNAG alternative splice forms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradley et al., 2012</xref>) will not be distinguishable by the read data. This, in turn, would increase the expression level uncertainties of such lowly identifiable transcripts and would therefore reduce power when testing whether their expression is parentally biased. Ideally, one would detect such lowly identifiable transcripts and combine their expression level estimates into that of a single merged transcript, indicating that either or all of them are expressed. Such combined transcripts would therefore have lower expression level uncertainty than their constituents, which would therefore increase power when testing whether their expression is parentally biased. To achieve this, we adopted the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Turro et al. (2014)</xref> for combining lowly identifiable transcripts based on the posterior correlation of their expression level estimates, tailored for a diploid transcriptome case. In this approach, for any given RNA-seq sample we compute the Pearson correlation coefficient of the posterior TPM samples of any pair of transcripts from the same locus and the same allele. Subsequently, if the mean Pearson correlation coefficient across all RNA-seq samples for a pair of transcripts in both alleles is lower than a defined cutoff (which we empirically set to −0.25), we combine each of these pairs into a single combined transcript. This process continues iteratively until no pair of transcripts (or pairs of already combined transcripts) can be further combined. This consistency between the alleles in the combining process ensures that the resulting combined transcripts are identical for the two alleles and can therefore be tested for parentally biased expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>BRAIM</title><p>For inferring whether a given transcript is imprinted, we define our estimand of interest as the difference in the expression level between its paternal and maternal alleles, that is, the parental bias. Intuitively, if the parental bias is approximately zero across all samples we would conclude that the transcript is not imprinted. The reality of RNA-seq data, however, is more complicated than that. First, as mentioned above, we do not obtain accurate estimates of expression levels but rather estimates with uncertainty. Next, our experimental design may include inherent factors that can affect allele-specific expression levels to various extents, such as the mouse cross, sex, and age. Whether of interest or not, the effects of these factors need to be explicitly accounted for. In addition, even though our nearly genetically identical animal subjects are treated with similar conditions, thereby minimizing effects of any additional factors to the ones specified above (such as environment), we still expect biological variability in RNA levels across our subjects (e.g., due to litter effects). Finally, we would expect technical variability across experiments to add to the biological variability, yet unless addressed explicitly (e.g., sequencing the same RNA library as technical replicates), the two are indistinguishable.</p><p>To address all of these issues we developed a statistical model for inferring genomic imprinting from our experimental design for every transcript in our annotation set. Specifically, we have chosen to extend the Bayesian variable selection regression model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chipman et al.

Since we are interested in testing whether each effect <italic>i</italic> is significant (i.e., whether <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is significantly different from zero), we model the <italic>β's</italic> as a mixture of two normals, such that the first normal is centered around zero with a small variance, representing a non-significant effect, and the second normal is centered around the estimated <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, and considers the effect as significant:<disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(5)</label><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p><italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> can be interpreted as a random variable that indicates whether factor <italic>i</italic> has an effect on the response. <italic>δ's</italic> are therefore modeled as Bernoulli i.i.d., with probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for each <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>:<disp-formula id="equ6"><label>(6)</label><mml:math id="m6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∝</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:munder><mml:mo>∏</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The <italic>τ's</italic> and <italic>c's</italic> are hyper-parameters for scaling the two normals and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the prior probability that factor <italic>i</italic> has a significant effect on the response.

The <italic>c</italic> parameter acts as a multiplying constant that determines how much higher an important effect has to be relative to a negligible effect in order to be considered significant.

We chose <italic>τ</italic> and <italic>c</italic> of all transcripts to have empirical values of 0.1 and 4.25, respectively, in order to provide a good separation between imprinted and non-imprinted transcripts at the selected PP = 0.95 cutoff. In addition, we set <italic>p</italic> of all effects to 0.1, reflecting our prior belief of the effects being significant. Although the choice of these hyper-parameter values is arbitrary to some extent, if the model is robust this choice should not affect the ranking of transcripts according to the PPs. Therefore, in order to evaluate how the inference of genomic imprinting by our model is affected by our choice of empirical hyper-parameter values we performed the following sensitivity analysis. The empirical value that we chose for each of the five hyper-parameters: <italic>τ</italic>, <italic>c</italic>, <italic>ν</italic>, <italic>λ</italic>, and <italic>p</italic>, was perturbed by selecting four other values. Specifically, we perturbed the empirical <italic>τ</italic> = 0.1 value with 0.005, 0.01, 1, and 2 thus both lowering and elevating the posterior probability of an effect being significant; we perturbed the empirical <italic>c</italic> = 4.25 value only with the higher values: 1.7, 3.4, 5.3125, and 10.625 as 4.25 was found to be approximately the minimal value for detecting significant effects; we perturbed the empirical <italic>ν</italic> = 2.5 value with 5, 12.5, 25, and 50 as <italic>ν</italic> cannot assume values lower than 2; we perturbed the empirical <italic>λ</italic> = 0.04 value with 0.002, 0.004, 0.4, and 0.8 shifting the <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup> prior distribution from informative to uninformative; and finally, we perturbed the empirical <italic>p</italic> = 0.1 value with higher prior probabilities of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. In each such perturbation we re-fitted our model to the data where all other hyper-parameter values are held fixed at their original empirical unperturbed values (thereby achieving a one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis). We assessed the perturbed results using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis in which the imprinted transcripts obtained by the unperturbed inferences were used as the ground-truth positives, and all other non-imprinted transcripts were used as ground-truth negatives. For practical computational considerations, for all perturbations we used a random sample of 10% of the 47,676 transcripts in our data set. In all perturbations the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was found to be 1, except for the <italic>τ</italic> = 1 and <italic>τ</italic> = 2 perturbations which obtained AUCs of 0.99 and 0.95, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These results therefore indicate that the ranking of transcripts according to the PP of the parental effect, obtained by our model, is robust to the choice of hyper-parameter empirical values. Therefore, the practice employed in this study of selecting empirical values, setting a parental effect PP cutoff, and experimentally confirming all transcripts with a PP of parental effect above that cutoff, is a reasonable choice for obtaining reliable inference of genomic imprinting from RNA-seq data.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07860.018</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Sensitivity analysis of BRAIM to the choice of hyper-parameter values.</title><p>Receiver operating characteristic curves describing the performance of BRAIM in detecting imprinted genes using perturbed values of <italic>τ</italic> (<bold>A</bold>), <italic>c</italic> (<bold>B</bold>), <italic>ν</italic> (<bold>C</bold>), <italic>λ</italic> (<bold>D</bold>), and the prior of <italic>δ</italic>, <italic>p</italic> (<bold>E</bold>) hyper-parameters.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07860.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07860.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07860-fig9-v2"/></fig></p><p>In order to detect all imprinted transcripts in our data we fitted our model to all 48 P8 and P60 samples, thus estimating cross, sex, and age effects on the parental bias.

In addition, a significant age effect may mean that a transcript has a strong parental bias in one age group but none in the other. In that case, the PP of the parental bias may not be significant. For these reasons we additionally fitted our model to the 24 P8 and P60 samples, independently, thus estimating only cross and sex effects on the parental bias for each of the age groups. We thus report all transcripts with a parental effect PP &gt; 0.95 in the combined P8, P60 dataset, or exclusively expressed in one of the age group datasets with a parental effect PP &gt; 0.95 as imprinted. Transcripts with an age effect PP &gt; 0.95 in the P8, P60 dataset and with a parental effect PP &gt; 0.95 in either of the individual P8 and P60 datasets were additionally reported as imprinted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Source code availability</title><p>BRAIM is implemented in R—see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Source code 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of the decay of parentally-biased expression as a function of distance from imprinted cluster centers</title><p>To quantify the effect that physical chromosomal distance of imprinted genes from their corresponding imprinted cluster center has on the magnitude of their parentally-biased expression we performed the following analysis.

In order to represent a gene by a single transcript, for each gene we chose the isoform with the most significant parental bias (i.e., the isoform with the maximal parental effect PP), derived from the model fitted to both age groups. The same criterion was also used to select between host and resident genes as the representative of their genomic location. In order to assign genes to clusters we linearly scanned each chromosome from its 5′ to 3′ end. The most upstream gene on a chromosome (where we represent the start and end sites of genes encoded on the antisense strand as their end and start sites on the sense strand, respectively), was assigned to the first imprinted cluster of that chromosome. Then, if the start site of the next downstream gene is within 1 MB of the end site of the previous upstream gene it was assigned to the same cluster, else it was assigned to a new cluster. Thus, the maximal distance between any two genes within a cluster can be 1 MB. We then defined the genes with a parental bias larger than 85:15% as candidate centers of their respective clusters. Since in some imprinted clusters more than a single gene met this condition, we grouped all physically consecutive candidate cluster center genes to a single gene which start site was defined as the start site of the most upstream candidate center gene and end site was defined as the end site of the most downstream candidate center gene. If an imprinted cluster resulted with more than one such group of candidate center genes flanked by genes with parental biases lower than 85:15% it was broken down to sub-clusters centered on each of these candidate centers. We defined the boundaries of each sub-cluster as half the distance between the end site of its center gene and the start site of the center gene of the adjacent sub-cluster (or up to 1 MB in the cases of the most up- and downstream sub-clusters) and thus flanking genes were assigned to the sub-cluster which boundary was downstream to their start site location. We finally removed any gene which start site was more than 1 MB away from its respective cluster center. We then fitted a general linear fixed effects model to non-cluster center genes, where we defined the response as the parental bias and the fixed effect as the intergenic distance from the cluster center.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of the evolutionary propensity for clustering of imprinted genes</title><p>To test whether the clustered organization of mouse imprinted genes with weak parental-expression biases (lower than 85:15%) is conserved in mammalian evolution, which therefore suggests functional importance, we carried out the following analysis of conservation of micro-synteny. We defined a pair of adjacent genes in the mouse reference genome as any two genes for which intergenic distance was below 1 MB (as 92% of the imprinted genes in our data are within 1 MB of another imprinted gene). Using this set of adjacent pairs of genes as reference we then constructed a phyletic pattern of orthologous gene pairs as follows. We downloaded the gene orthology assignment between the mouse reference genome and all mammalian reference genomes available in the Ensembl genome browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flicek et al., 2014</xref>), which are assembled at the chromosome level. This included the genomes of the following species: opossum, pig, sheep, cow, horse, cat, dog, rat, marmoset, rhesus, orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee, and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). For each comparative genome, if both orthologs of a mouse adjacent gene pair exist in that genome, we labeled this orthologous pair by ‘1’ if their intergenic distance is lower than 1 MB (i.e., they are also adjacent in the comparative genome) and ‘0’ otherwise (i.e., they are not adjacent in the comparative genome). If either or both orthologs do not exist in the comparative genome we labeled this pair as ‘?’ (i.e., unknown). Ensembl tables of orthology assignment provide two types of homology between a query and search genomes: a one-to-one and a one-to-many homology. In addition, these tables also provide a binary confidence score for the orthology assignment (0 for low and 1 for high). As a conservative approach, we filtered out all one-to-many and low confidence orthologs unless the genes orthologous to the mouse pair were found to be within 1 MB of each other. As a result we obtained a phyletic pattern, which is a type of a multiple sequence alignment, where in our case each site in the phyletic pattern is a gene pair orthologous to an adjacent gene pair in the mouse genome with the characters of ‘1’, ‘0’, and ‘?’. All phyletic pattern columns in which all sites were ‘?’, were removed thus obtaining a phyletic pattern of 409,874 sites. We then fitted to this phyletic pattern and corresponding phylogenetic species tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) a probabilistic phylogenetic model estimating the substitution rates between presence and absence (‘1’ and ‘0’, respectively) and vice-versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>). We specifically allowed the presence/absence ratio to vary across sites and the presence and absence probabilities at the root of the phylogenetic tree to be independently estimated. As a result, we obtained a posterior expectation of the absence-to-presence substitution rate (i.e., rate of gene-pair gain: ‘0’ to ‘1’) and a posterior expectation of the presence-to-absence substitution rate (i.e., rate of gene-pair loss: ‘1’ to ‘0’) for each site in the phyletic pattern. The propensity of each orthologous gene pair to be adjacent throughout the mammalian evolution represented by the species used in this analysis is therefore the posterior expectation of its rate of gene-pair gain divided by the posterior expectation of its rate of gene-pair loss. In order to test whether the propensity of adjacency of orthologs of mouse weakly parentally-biased imprinted gene pairs (with a bias lower than 85:15%), is significantly higher than what would be expected by chance, we compared the mean propensity of adjacency of these gene pairs with the mean propensity of adjacency of all gene pairs in the phyletic pattern using a one-sided <italic>z</italic>-test. We note that not applying any distance cutoff for defining a pair of adjacent genes means that genes with much longer intergenic distances will be included for which the micro-synteny is expected to be much less evolutionary conserved thus potentially biasing our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Pyrosequencing validations</title><p>Pyrosequencing validations were performed in cerebella derived from a different batch of F1 hybrids from that used in the RNA-seq experiments. The same age of animals was used for the pyrosequencing validations whenever the RNA-seq data showed an age-specific parental bias. Otherwise, either age group was used. RNA purification and quality control followed the same procedures described for the RNA-seq data. An average of three SNPs suitable for pyrosequencing analyses were identified for each candidate gene.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), Sacha Nelson (Reviewing editor and reviewer), and Sean Eddy (reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you can see both reviewers are largely favorable but together have numerous suggestions for improving the manuscript through textual changes, clarifications or in some cases additional or revised analyses. Since none of these require additional experiments they are conveyed in full rather than in synthesized form. It is possible that some of the points raised can be dealt with through clarifications to the reviewers and that additional editorial discussion may be required at that time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Reviewing editor)</italic>:</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>This is an extremely thorough analysis of imprinting in the brain which follows up on several less carefully controlled studies including one from the senior author's lab. The analysis is rigorous, the follow up validation experiments are convincing and the results with respect to control of developmentally regulated apoptosis and brain size are interesting and important.</p><p>I have only one concern which might be termed major:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> illustrates an analysis of imprinting by pyrosequencing across 16 brain regions. I find the similarity across brain regions more impressive for most genes tested than the differences. The differences between brain and peripheral tissues are, on the other hand, striking. I think the authors should tone down their discussion of this point (e.g. perhaps the variation across brain regions should be called “modest but significant” – assuming there is some test of significance, instead of “substantial”; in the subsection “Dynamic Temporal and Spatial Regulation of Imprinted Genes in the Brain”) Alternatively, and/or additionally, the authors could provide some more quantitative analysis that supports the idea that it is a “major” effect (e.g. relative to age or brain vs. periphery).</p><p>Minor comments [abridged]:</p><p>In the subsection “Developmental Regulation of Genomic Imprinting in the Cerebellum”, 42 of the 115 imprinted genes are differentially expressed between P8 and P60 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>–Table 1). This is a significantly higher proportion than the 6,531 out of 25,058 genes expressed in the cerebellum that are regulated according to developmental stage (P-value =3.8∼10-8; hypergeometric test). 25K genes seems very high for the number of genes expressed. Is this transcripts? Is it the case that essentially all genes are expressed in the cerebellum? Or is this an error?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>The authors describe an RNA-seq screen for new imprinted genes in the mouse cerebellum. The screen extends and improved upon previous work by using an experimental design with many replicants; by using a sophisticated statistical analysis that accounts for other main sources of biological variation; and by systematically following up each candidate imprinted gene from the RNA-seq analysis with a second validation assay using specific allele-specific pyroseq analysis.</p><p>The authors discover some new imprinted genes and they also make three particularly interesting observations: (1) that the degree of paternal bias for a given locus is quantitative, with some loci being only weakly or moderately biased, whereas imprinted loci are typically discussed as if they are all-or-nothing, monoallelically expressed; (2) that at least to some extent, this quantitative bias can be accounted for by a gradient away from a strong imprinting center, with loci progressively further from that point showing progressively less strong bias; and (3) that the strength and even the direction of the bias can vary in a cell type specific manner. I am not an expert in imprinted genes, but these observations seem very interesting to me, and they greatly extend my understanding of the phenomenology of parent-of-origin effects.</p><p>There is a lot of evidence of care and rigor in the manuscript and its experiments. This includes the technically sophisticated statistical model, which appears to have been carefully done and carefully tested (for example, with a parameter sensitivity analysis).</p><p>The paper describes the results of a screen, so its contribution is necessarily more descriptive – laying ground for future work – than getting at mechanisms. That said, in some places, it would strengthen the paper to have more discussion of possible mechanisms of imprinting, even if speculative, to help the reader organize the mass of descriptive observations, which can tend to become a blur.</p><p>I understand (as an outsider to the field) that there is a somewhat controversial history of previous work in this area. I think it would help, and would even strengthen the paper, to clarify that history in the Introduction. Specifically, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al. (2010)</xref> paper was particularly controversial (perhaps among others?) because it claimed to have detected over 1000 imprinted genes, when only around 100 were known. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeVeale et al. (2012)</xref> paper made a convincing case that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg et al. (2010)</xref> result was in error, a large overestimation as a result of deficiencies in statistical analysis and validation of RNA-seq information. This manuscript seems to agree with that conclusion, but the Introduction seems cagily written: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeVeale (2012)</xref> are cited simultaneously in a way that makes it seem like they both pointed to challenges in this sort of screen, rather than as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg (2010)</xref> making errors that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeVeale (2012)</xref> needed to walk back. For example, when I first read “… methodologically challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeVeale, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregg, 2010</xref>)”, I assumed that both DeVeale and Gregg were papers about the analysis difficulties. It was not clear to me, until I looked into it more, that Gregg was a high profile result that DeVeale challenged. I think it would be brave, and helpful to the field of RNA-seq statistical analysis, to be even more candid about this history.</p><p>Minor comments [abridged]:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. I'm confused by the distribution of points on this plot. Consider the orange point at roughly 0.8, 0.8. This is called a “false positive”, with a preferred allele frequency of 0.8 as measured both by RNA-seq and by pyroseq validation. Why is this a “false positive”, if pyroseq validation agrees with the allele frequency measured by RNA-seq? From your explanation I expected that the only way something can be a “false positive” is if it gets called imprinted from RNA-seq data, but fails to validate with pyroseq data. (Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> appears to show 10 false positive points, whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> says there are 9 false positives.)</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>. I am worried that an error has entered here. The Methods states that “transcripts with low expression values need to be filtered”, and “a typical distribution of TPM values is bimodal where the left mode represents transcripts with low expression”, and I agree. But the plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> is trimodal, not bimodal. The bimodality of expression levels in RNA-seq data is usually seen with modes around TPM ∼0.01-0.1 (“off” genes) and 10-1000 (“on” genes). I think these are your rightmost two modes. The third (leftmost) mode at log(TPM)∼-10 is, I'm guessing, a software artifact of MM-SEQ estimation of expression levels given little or no mapped reads. It seems unlikely that you have any data for a transcript at TPM = 10^-10. I think you should be drawing your cutoff threshold at around log(TPM)∼0, between the rightmost two modes. One place this affects you is in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>Fkbp6</italic>: I think this gene is basically off (TPM ∼ 0.1 or so), and accordingly it's showing very high variance.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Individual data points are shown with error bars.

If it's a posterior distribution, put the range in the legend (95% posterior interval?).</p><p>In the subsection “Transcriptome-Wide Profile of Parent-of-Origin Expression in the Mouse Cerebellum”, you state: “our approach has a true positive rate of 93%” – based on what? Perhaps I missed it but I don't think you ever say what you consider to be the “true” number, or how you could know it. You could mean that ∼80 genes have been previously reported as imprinted, 74 of which you detected (74/80 = 0.93), but surely more than 80 genes have previously been reported and validated as imprinted? I thought the number was &gt;100. “We also considered the possibility that true imprinted genes may not meet our parental bias PP cutoff”: The “also” is confusing because in the previous paragraph you've just said that your true positive rate (sensitivity) is 93% – which already tells you that the false negative rate – trues that you miss – should be 7%. But in this paragraph you find a false negative rate of 10/18 = 56%, so that isn't consistent with your reported true positive rate. I suppose the key is in what you mean by “subjectively selected”. You must have selected genes that you expect to be imprinted, rather than random negatives. Clarify. For example, you might lead with something like: “The fact that our true positive rate is &lt;100% means that we are sure to miss some genes that are imprinted…”</p><p>In the subsection “Developmental Regulation of Genomic Imprinting in the Cerebellum”, the sentence: “Such a pattern may artificially arise if the ability to detect the parental bias increases with its overall expression level.

I think the authors should tone down their discussion of this point (e.g. perhaps the variation across brain regions should be called “modest but significant” – assuming there is some test of significance, instead of “substantial”; in the subsection “Dynamic Temporal and Spatial Regulation of Imprinted Genes in the Brain”) Alternatively, and/or additionally, the authors could provide some more quantitative analysis that supports the idea that it is a “major” effect (e.g. relative to age or brain vs. periphery)</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point and for the helpful suggestions.

The former shows a significant difference for nearly all tested genes. The latter test also reports significant variability for a large fraction of genes (18 out of the 28 tested).

Why is this a “false positive”, if pyroseq validation agrees with the allele frequency measured by RNA-seq?

Indeed several details of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> require clarification. The orange dot with coordinates at ∼0.8,0.8 was considered a false positive because the preferred allele observed in the RNA-seq data is opposite to the one observed by pyrosequencing. This dot represents one of the transcripts of the <italic>Slc22a1</italic> gene that on the RNA-seq platform shows that approximately 80% of its expression comes from the maternal allele, which in spite of substantial variability among biological samples has a marginal posterior probability above 0.95. However, pyrosequencing analysis of this same transcript reports an average of approximately 80% of its expression from the paternal allele with high variability and this effect is not significant (PP = 0.86). A similar situation occurred for <italic>Cpa4</italic>, which is represented by the orange dot at ∼0.6,0.8. The RNA-seq data show that approximately 60% of its expression comes from the maternal allele, whereas in pyrosequencing a more substantial 80% maternal expression is observed, yet due to the high variability this effect is not significant (PP = 0.77). Since these two genes are the only examples of this situation, it is clearly an exception in our analyses.

The distribution of ln(TPM) in a single RNA-seq sample is indeed trimodal, and the left mode is indeed what MMSEQ reports, where for transcripts whose expression levels are nearly, but not absolutely, zero MMSEQ reports posterior FPKM samples as low as 10<sup>-07</sup>. If MMSEQ’s posterior FPKM variances are taken to represent the expression-level uncertainty (as we did in our model) this results with false negatives in cases where a silenced or nearly silenced allele is in the left mode but due to this artificially high uncertainty the parental bias does not come out as significant. We are aware of this limitation and all transcripts whose mean posterior FPKM (which we convert to TPM units) fell below our cutoff were set to zero. We subsequently add the cutoff value to all posterior TPM samples thereby avoid taking the log of zero. We had an error in the figure and associated text indicating the cutoff is determined as the local minimum between the left two modes for each RNA-seq sample.

We consider all genes that we detected as parentally biased (above our marginal posterior probability cutoff) that were previously reported as imprinted and independently validated (e.g., detected in an RNA-seq screen and independently validated using pyrosequencing) as true positives. This amounts to 74 genes. We additionally consider as true positives the genes that we detected as parentally biased and validated using pyrosequencing that were either not previously reported as imprinted or not independently validated. This amounts to 41 genes out of the 50 genes that we detected as parentally biased. Hence, our precision (which we confused with true positive rate) is calculated as: (74+41)/(74+50) = 92.7%.

We realize our sentence is misleading. Higher expression levels do make it is easier to detect parental biases (as are more polymorphic sites that phase the reads, as well as lower redundancy between the different isoforms). Indeed, inference of parental biases at the range of very low expression levels (left parts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplements 1A-B</xref>) is significantly affected. The location of the parental biases at that range of expression levels reflects the low identifiability – MMSEQ reports high uncertainty in the allele-specific expression levels of these transcripts and our model propagates this uncertainty. As a result, the posterior distribution of the parental bias (which prior is at 0.5) thus has higher variance (at the most extreme case the posterior distribution will cover the entire 0.5-1 range), and the mean of that posterior distribution is thus likely to be close to 0.75. This trend is also visible when we contrast the parental bias inferred by RNA-seq and pyrosequencing versus expression levels (newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>). Based on this figure we defined a more stringent expression level cutoff, where the discrepancy between the parental biases inferred by RNA-seq and pyrosequencing drops dramatically. At this expression level cutoff the dearth of imprinted genes in the left part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref> are removed, but our remaining analyses that depend on the RNA-seq data are negligibly affected.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Transcriptome-Wide Analysis of Genomic Imprinting in the Cerebellum”, the sentence: “In addition to 74 imprinted genes previously validated… our analysis detects 41 novel imprinted genes… increasing the total number of reported imprinted genes in the mouse by 26%”.
