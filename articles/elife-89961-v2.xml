national-level studies have evaluated the impact of ‘hybrid’ immunity (vaccination coupled with recovery from infection) from the Omicron variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>From May 2020 to December 2022, we conducted serial assessments (each of ~4000–9000 adults) examining SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within a mostly representative Canadian cohort drawn from a national online polling platform. Adults, most of whom were vaccinated, reported viral test-confirmed infections and mailed self-collected dried blood spots (DBSs) to a central lab. Samples underwent highly sensitive and specific antibody assays to spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens, the latter triggered only by infection. We estimated cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence prior to the Omicron period and during the BA.1/1.1 and BA.2/5 waves. We assessed changes in antibody levels and in age-specific active immunity levels.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Spike levels were higher in infected than in uninfected adults, regardless of vaccination doses. Among adults vaccinated at least thrice and infected more than 6 months earlier, spike levels fell notably and continuously for the 9-month post-vaccination. In contrast, among adults infected within 6 months, spike levels declined gradually. Declines were similar by sex, age group, and ethnicity. Recent vaccination attenuated declines in spike levels from older infections. In a convenience sample, spike antibody and cellular responses were correlated. Near the end of 2022, about 35% of adults above age 60 had their last vaccine dose more than 6 months ago, and about 25% remained uninfected. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rose from 13% (95% confidence interval 11–14%) before omicron to 78% (76–80%) by December 2022, equating to 25 million infected adults cumulatively. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) weekly death rate during the BA.2/5 waves was less than half of that during the BA.1/1.1 wave, implying a protective role for hybrid immunity.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Strategies to maintain population-level hybrid immunity require up-to-date vaccination coverage, including among those recovering from infection.

However, such studies rely on the follow-up of hospitalized patients or those with access to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing, and not randomly selected populations. Thus, the contribution of infection and vaccination to hybrid immunity and the duration of immunity from either exposure remain remarkably poorly documented at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldberg et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Development of strategies to move from pandemic to endemic management of COVID-19 will be greatly enabled by evidence of population-level immunity, which ideally should be informed by changes over time in biologic measures of immunologic protection (antibody levels, infection status, vaccination, and healthcare utilization). Humoral antibody levels, which correlate strongly with cellular immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2021</xref>), are the most practical method to monitor populations.</p><p>Canada provides an opportunity to document hybrid immunity. Although reaching high levels of vaccination reasonably quickly (by September 2021), Canada experienced a large increase in infections from Omicron from December 2021, even among vaccinated people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Public Health Agency of Canada, 2023</xref>). Vaccines used in Canada (mostly the mRNA and some adenovirus vaccines) trigger antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD), but not to the nucleocapsid protein (N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duarte et al., 2022</xref>). This enables serological distinction of infection from vaccination.</p><p>In this study, we estimate cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence among Canadian adults in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tang et al., 2022</xref>) and 2021 – prior to the Omicron period – and during two major Omicron waves (BA.1/1.1 and BA.2 and BA.5) in 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2022</xref>). We assess declines in active immunity and changes over time in age-specific active immunity levels based on prior infection and concurrent vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>From May 2020, the Action to Beat Coronavirus (Ab-C) study conducted six serial assessments of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms (via online surveys) and seropositivity (via antibody testing), with five surveys covering about 4000–9000 adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We recruited adults using the Angus Reid Forum, a nationally representative online polling platform that approximately matches Canada’s demographic profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). We obtained informed consent from each participant and excluded any unconsented panelist from the study. Details of the sampling, antibody testing strategy, and analyses have been published earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tang et al., 2021</xref>).

Dotted lines for PCR-based testing after 1 January 2022 reflect the major uncertainty in PCR-based testing.

At the end of the survey, respondents indicated their willingness to provide a blood sample by finger prick, and we sent consenters a DBS collection kit with instructions to self-collect. DBS samples were returned to Unity Health laboratories in Toronto, with mail transit times ranging 3–6 days. Sinai Health in Toronto conducted highly sensitive and specific chemiluminescence-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays targeting the spike protein, RBD, and N; validation of the assays is reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colwill et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Isho et al., 2020</xref>). Various quality control steps focussed on reducing false positives and false negatives, as well as adjusting the dilution to better detect antibody signals after vaccination became widespread (Appendix 1 provides details of the lab methods and analyses). We conducted cluster analyses of N-positivity (defined below) to assign a probability of seropositivity to each sample using control samples and those with known past viral testing results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). In a subset of 39 adults in Toronto selected conveniently, we collected venous blood samples at home, and tested these centrally for cellular immunity using the Euroimmun Interferon Gamma Release Assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernández-González et al., 2022</xref>) to detect T-cell activity against the spike protein (supplementary methods).</p><p>Our primary outcomes were the relative levels of antibodies to the spike protein (hereafter ‘spike levels’), which are increased both by vaccination and infection (defined as N-positivity or self-reported PCR/rapid test positivity), as a proxy for hybrid immunity levels. Our secondary outcome was the combination of vaccination history and infection. We applied the age-specific cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 to the Statistics Canada national population totals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Statistics Canada, 2023</xref>) to derive estimates of the number of adults infected in each major phase and compared cumulative incidence to confirmed COVID deaths by phase. Confirmed COVID deaths in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Public Health Agency of Canada, 2023</xref>) are within 10% of analyses that apply excess all-cause mortality as an upper bound for COVID-19 mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We examined three time periods: (1) March 2020 to December 2021 when Canada faced waves of ancestral, Alpha, and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2; (2) January–March 2022 during the Omicron BA.1/1.1 wave; and (3) April–December 2022 during the Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 waves. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> provides the timeline for Phases 1–6, in relation to national weekly averages of confirmed COVID-19 cases and weekly averages of vaccination from any dose.</p><p>We surveyed 10,088 adults in Phase 6 of Ab-C, of whom 4025 provided DBS from 26 September to 21 November 2022, and of whom 3378 provided both surveys and DBS. Study participants were comparable to Canadian adults in prevalence of obesity, smoking, diabetes, and vaccination, but fewer lower-education adults participated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref>). More females and vaccinated adults provided DBS in Phase 6. Lack of vaccination and lower education were correlated (Appendix 1), so we adjusted cumulative incidence for vaccination status. The characteristics of the cohort changed little between Phases 3, 4, and 6 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref>), so changes in antibody levels are unlikely to be confounded by differential recruitment in each phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Canada had four major viral waves before December 2021 and a major increase in vaccination coverage with two doses peaking in early July 2021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A large Omicron BA.1/1.1 wave of January–March 2022 coincided with a large increase in vaccination, mostly of third (booster) doses. The six Ab-C phases captured Canada’s major infection and vaccination peaks in a reasonably timely manner.</p><p>Spike levels were higher in infected than in uninfected adults, regardless of vaccination doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Spike levels were higher among those who were infected and vaccinated, and lowest among the very few who remained uninfected and unvaccinated, or had only one vaccine dose, or infection without vaccination.

This equates to about 25 million infected adults cumulatively.

Despite the rising cumulative incidence, the COVID-19 weekly death rate per million population during the Omicron BA.2/5 waves (7.7) was less than half of the weekly death rate during the Omicron BA.1/1.1 wave (16.6).

While steps to protect individuals and populations from SARS-CoV-2 infection must continue to be implemented, close to 80% of Canadian adults became infected, mostly from the Omicron variants, by December 2022. This high level of infection from the Omicron variants not only led to notable morbidity and mortality, but also contributed to population-level hybrid immunity.</p><p>Despite a marked increase in cumulative infection, COVID-19 death rates during Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 were markedly lower than during BA.1/1.1, likely reflecting a strong correlation between protection against severe disease and hybrid immunity (despite lower protection against reinfection). Canadian healthcare systems were overburdened with COVID-related hospitalizations several times during the pandemic. Since summer 2022, hospitalizations have eased significantly, most notably with fewer admissions to intensive care units following the initial Omicron BA.1/1.1 wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Public Health Agency of Canada, 2023</xref>). Continued COVID-related practices (most of which were dropped on 1 October 2022), such as travel restrictions, masking mandates, and testing requirements, also may have played a role in the lessened severity of COVID outcomes. Differences in pathogenicity of successive Omicron variants are likely too small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Strasser et al., 2022</xref>) to explain the differences in COVID-19 death rates.</p><p>We showed that absent recent infection, spike levels declined up to 9 months, but reassuringly, declines were comparable in older versus younger adults and by sex and ethnicity. Importantly, recent vaccination attenuated the declines in spike levels from older infections. Obviously, reliance on infections is unwise to boost immunity, especially for those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Collectively, our and other studies on hybrid immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bobrovitz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">COVID-19 Forecasting Team, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altarawneh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) suggest that older adults may require access to booster doses at 6- to 12-month intervals and prior to possible seasonal waves to achieve a robust level of protection against infection. Strategies to maintain population-level hybrid immunity require high vaccination coverage, including among those who have recovered from infection and the few remaining unvaccinated.</p><p>The Ab-C study is one of the few nationally representative serosurveys to measure hybrid immunity objectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldberg et al., 2022</xref>) and has the benefit of sampling the entire population. Large increases from Omicron wave are evident in other Canadian studies (mostly done prior to the BA.5 waves) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murphy et al., 2023</xref>). A national US study among blood donors reports lower levels of infection than do we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023</xref>), but has not yet reported on the BA.4/5 waves. Moreover, blood donors or hospitalized patients may have notable biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murphy et al., 2023</xref>). Since the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 appeared, self-testing using rapid antigen tests displaced PCR testing in many countries, including Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angus Reid, 2022</xref>). The use of spike levels has limitations, although we found it correlated with cellular immunity. Earlier studies demonstrate that high levels of spike or RBD antibodies are predictive of neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2021</xref>) and correlate with lower viral loads that reduce severe disease in the infected and transmission to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tan et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, our study has some limitations. First, we had a larger proportion of highly educated adults than the Canadian population. However, the selection biases did not change with subsequent waves, and we saw widespread infection and vaccination in all education groups. We deliberately focussed on distributions of antibody levels which overlap in the comparison categories, but this has the benefit of showing the full range of spike antibody response in the various strata of the infected and vaccinated. We may be underestimating spike antibody levels due to assay saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colwill et al., 2022</xref>). N-positivity may have underestimated actual infection because mild cases among vaccinated adults did not mount an antibody response or because people did not seroconvert during the sampling period. Conversely, some adults may have reverted to N-negative status. Finally, defining infection based on cumulative seropositivity and time-specific viral test positivity is crude and made more complicated by periodic viral or vaccination waves. Thus, we are limited in quantifying the hybrid immunity arising from various sequences of variant infections and vaccinations. For example, the apparent plateauing of spike level declines at 9 months in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> may reflect cohorts facing at least two distinct vaccination or viral waves. Future phases of our study may assess long-term immunity across different populations, as well as development of long COVID.</p><p>Canadian COVID-19 death rates are lower compared to the United States and other similar countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Razak et al., 2022</xref>) and we speculate this may be from the sequence of low levels of infection pre-Omicron paired with high vaccination coverage of two doses, followed by a large Omicron wave. Comparative analyses across countries using objective measures of hybrid immunity are required. In Canada and other countries, home-based self-drawn DBSs are a widely practicable and relatively inexpensive monitoring strategy for SARS-CoV-2 population immunity. Despite their limitations, serial serosurveys at the population level are reasonably efficient, low-cost ways to monitor hybrid immunity and to study newer variants of SARS-CoV-2, and possibly even other infectious agents. Future directions could include routine monitoring of various respiratory pathogens, and work to develop practicable multi-plex assays for such infections.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Has received consulting fees from Apeiron Biologics, Cellenkos, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, and GlaxoSmithKline outside the submitted work</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Has served as a consultant for BlueDot and the National Hockey League Players' Association outside the submitted work</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The Ab-C study was approved by the Unity Health Toronto Research Ethics Board (REB # 20-107 and 21-213).

In Phase 1, from May through September 2020, we invited 44,270 members (out of about 78 000 total members) of the Angus Reid Forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angus Reid Institute, 2024</xref>) an established nationwide polling panel of Canadian adults aged 18 and older, to complete an online survey about SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and testing histories. The sampled population was stratified by age groups (18–34, 35–54, 55+); sex (male, female); education (high school education or lower, some college or college or technical degree, some university, or university degree); and region, by census metropolitan area to match the national demographic profile, with oversampling of adults 60 years or older. In August 2021, we invited about 3100 additional Forum panel members from 17 regions with high burden of infection (of 93 total regions nationwide), based on a regression analysis of SARS-CoV-2 case counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). From December 2020 through January 2021, we invited all 19,994 Phase 1 participants to join Phase 2, retaining the same sampling frame. Phase 3 and 4 recruitment used similar approaches. In Phase 4, we conducted additional outreach to 2587 additional members from marginalized groups at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (2045 visible minorities and 542 Indigenous individuals). Of these, 1229 agreed to provide DBS and were included in Phase 4 mailouts (919 visible minorities and 310 Indigenous individuals). In Phase 5, a subset of 1304 participants who had recently tested negative for antibodies to nucleocapsid (N) were selected for a supplementary DBS sample; in Phase 6, 5703 DBS participants from any previous phase were enrolled.</p><p>Participants were not compensated financially by the study for participating, but earned modest redeemable points from the Angus Reid Forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Action to Beat Coronavirus Study, 2021</xref>).

Mailing time across Canada ranged from about 3–8 days. Upon arrival, samples were scanned, catalogued, and stored at 4°C in larger boxes with additional desiccant, and monitored for humidity levels (kept &lt;20%).</p><p>Antibodies were then eluted from a 4.7-mm punch in 99 µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) + 0.1% Tween (PBS-T) and 1% Triton X-100. The use of 99 µl was to ensure sufficient eluate to test three antigens (spike protein, receptor-binding domain [RBD] of the spike, and nucleocapsid protein [N]). Punches were incubated in elution buffer for a minimum of 4 hr with gentle shaking (150 RPM) at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The samples were then centrifuged at 1000 × <italic>g</italic> for 30 s.</p><p>The Network Biology Collaborative Centre at Sinai Health, Toronto, conducted a high-throughput, highly sensitive chemiluminescence-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting the spike protein, RBD, and N. Chemiluminescent ELISA assays were performed as previously described on a Thermo Fisher Scientific F7 robotic platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colwill et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Isho et al., 2020</xref>) with a few modifications. Briefly, LUMITRAC 600 high-binding white polystyrene 384-well microplates (Greiner Bio-One #781074, VWR #82051-268) were pre-coated overnight with 10 µl/well of antigen (50 ng spike (SmT1), 20 ng RBD and 7 ng nucleocapsid, all supplied by the National Research Council of Canada [NRC]). After washing (all washes were four times with 100 µl PBS-T), wells were blocked for 1 hr in 80 µl 5% Blocker BLOTTO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #37530) and then washed. 10 µl of sample (2.5 or 0.156 µl of DBS eluate diluted in 1% final Blocker BLOTTO in PBS-T) was added to each well and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. After washing, 10 µl of a human anti-IgG fused to HRP (IgG#5, supplied by NRC, final of 0.9 ng/well) diluted in 1% final Blocker BLOTTO in PBS-T was added to each well followed by a 1-hr incubation at room temperature. After four washes, 10 µl of SuperSignal ELISA pico chemiluminescent substrate (diluted 1:4 in MilliQ distilled H<sub>2</sub>0) was added to each well and incubated for 5–8 min at room temperature. Chemiluminescence was read on an EnVision (Perkin Elmer) plate reader at 100 ms/well using an ultra-sensitive detector.</p><p>Each 384-well assay plate included replicates of a standard reference curve of a human anti-spike IgG antibody (VHH72-Fc supplied by NRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colwill et al., 2022</xref>) or an anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibody (Genscript, #A02039), positive and negative master mixes of pooled serum samples, human IgG negative control (Sigma, #I4506), and blanks as controls. Negative and/or positive DBS controls (defined using plasma serology results) were included in runs in each phase.</p><p>For each antigen, raw values (counts per second) were normalized to a blank-subtracted point in the linear range of the standard reference curve to create a relative ratio (hereinafter referred to as antibody levels). The samples were processed at a 1:4 dilution of the DBS eluate (2.5 μl/well of sample) and 1:64 dilution. We used the former to derive positivity threshold and the latter to display antibody level distributions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3"><title>Determining positivity</title><p>There is uncertainty in the measured values of the antibodies to N. We sought to reflect this uncertainty in the confidence intervals for prevalence estimates. We used control samples and known positives to estimate the probability of seropositivity for each sample, and we used multiple imputation to account for the unknown true seropositivity status. We estimated log relative rates in a model adjusting for age, sex, region, and vaccination status.

We estimated a mixing proportion for each phase (by maximum likelihood), the densities for each component are shown in blue and red for the seronegative and seropositive components, respectively.</p><p>For each sample, we calculated a probability of seropositivity using Bayes rule. This probability depends on the mixing proportion as well as the red and blue densities, as when prevalence is high the threshold should be lowered to reduce false negatives. These probabilities are used for multiple imputation, generating 100 datasets where each sample is designated as seropositive or seronegative. For grouping subjects as infected and uninfected in the ‘immunity wall’ figures, cutoffs for each phase (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>) are set so that the expected number of false positives and false negatives is identical.</p><p>Prevalence estimates and their confidence intervals use post-stratification, adjusting the study sample to reflect the Canadian distribution of population by age, sex, region and vaccination status. For each phase, we fit a logistic regression model which included vaccination status (no doses v. one or more) and region (British Columbia and Yukon; Prairie provinces, NWT, Nunavut; Ontario; Quebec; Atlantic provinces), each of which are interacted with age and sex (and the age–sex interaction). We did not interact vaccination status with region, as the number of unvaccinated individuals in the sample was small in some regions. We obtained estimates of log relative rates and the accompanying variance matrix for each of the 100 imputed datasets and combined them according to Rubin’s rule.</p><p>The population by age, sex, province, and vaccination status at each phase are obtained from the Public Health Agency of Canada’s <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19">Infobase</ext-link>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Public Health Agency of Canada, 2023</xref>).

After obtaining consent for re-contact, participants attended either a Unity Health Toronto hospital visit or agreed to a home visit. A phlebotomist collected one tube of venous blood from each participant using 7 ml lithium-heparin blood collection tubes. Blood collection tubes were mixed by inversion, stored at room temperature, and delivered to the St. Joseph’s Health Centre laboratory within 16 hr of collection to be refrigerated at 2–8°C.</p><p>Prior to stimulation, samples were removed from refrigeration for 30 min. For each whole-blood sample, one stimulation tube set from the Quan-T-Cell SARS-CoV-2 kit (EUROIMMUN, ET 2606-3003) was warmed to room temperature. Each set consisted of three stimulation tubes: (1) CoV-2 interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) BLANK: no T-cell stimulation, for determination of the individual IFN-γ background; (2) CoV-2 IGRA TUBE: specific T-cell stimulation using antigens based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; (3) CoV-2 IGRA STIM: unspecific T-cell stimulation by means of a mitogen, for control of the stimulation ability. The blood collection tube was mixed by gentle inversion, then sampled using 1 ml pipets to draw and transfer 500 μl of whole blood to each of the three tubes. The filled stimulation tubes were sealed and mixed by rapid inversion, then shaken by hand and incubated at 37°C for 20–24 hr. At the end of the incubation period, the tubes were removed from the incubator and centrifuged for 10 min between 6000 and 12,000 × <italic>g</italic>.</p><p>Following centrifugation, the plasma obtained from the stimulated whole-blood samples was diluted and used on the anti-IFN-γ-coated ELISA plate. EUROIMMUN Mississauga conducted interferon-gamma release assays using the Quan-T-Cell ELISA (EQ 6841-9601). 100 μl of the calibrators, controls, and diluted plasma samples (1:5 in sample buffer) were transferred into the individual microplate wells and incubated for 120 min at room temperature. The wells were washed (five times, each using 300 µl of wash buffer). 100 µl of biotin was pipetted into each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The wells were washed, and 100 µl of enzyme conjugate was pipetted into each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The wells were washed, and 100 µl of chromogen/substrate solution was pipetted into each well and incubated for 20 min at room temperature, protected from direct sunlight. 100 µl of stop solution was pipetted into each well. Photometric measurements of the colour intensity were made at a wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength between 620 and 650 nm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-5"><title>Epidemiological analyses</title><p>This analysis focussed on Phases 3–6 of the Ab-C study, which correspond to the pre-omicron (15 August to 15 October 2021) and omicron (BA.1/1.1, BA.2, and BA.5) periods (24 January to 30 March; 27 May to 1 July; and 26 September to 21 November 2022), respectively. To confirm the Ab-C data are representative of the Canadian population, we calculated the proportion of participants who filled out the survey and provided DBS by demographic characteristics (province, household size, age, sex, education, ethnicity, weight, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension) and vaccination status, and compared these to the Canadian national data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref>).</p><p>As already reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tang et al., 2022</xref>), the demographic and health characteristics of those who completed surveys and provided DBS were generally comparable to the Canadian census population, except for fewer adults with an educational level of some college or less in the Ab-C study compared with the census population. In Phase 6, the proportion of adults unvaccinated was similar in the Ab-C surveyed population (8%) as in Canada overall (10%). However, the unvaccinated rates were lower in those who submitted DBS samples (3%). We have previously found greater unvaccinated rates among the lower levels of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). Education level (some college or less, college graduate, university graduate) was inversely correlated with vaccination status: chi-squared statistic 17.156 (df = 2; p-value of 0.0001882). Hence, we adjusted for vaccination status when calculating estimates of cumulative incidence. Moreover, the Ab-C study has had fewer racial or ethnic minority adults (which is defined by Statistics Canada, the national lead statistical agency, as ‘Visible Minorities’) but more Indigenous adults than the census population. Compared with the census population or nationally representative surveys, study participants had a similar prevalence of obesity, current or former smoking, diabetes and hypertension.</p><p>The Phase 3–6 population distributions, which are most directly relevant to estimating cumulative and period-specific Omicron incidence, are broadly similar among those who completed surveys and those who provided a DBS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, a comparison of those invited who participated and did not in Phase 1 of the study showed a bias towards greater female participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). However, differences by sex were not important predictors of cumulative incidence (data not shown), so this bias does not materially affect the overall estimates of cumulative infection.</p><p>The age-specific ‘immunity wall’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> defines infection as either having tested positive on polymerase chain reaction or antigen rapid test or with antibodies to the N antigen (which is appropriate among the largely vaccinated cohort). N-positivity reflects infection and would not arise from Canadian-approved vaccines that only contain the spike protein. We defined infection as any positive COVID-19 test more than 7 days prior to the DBS being received and any N-positivity.</p><p>We obtained the overall cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections based on N-positivity and derived the 95% confidence intervals using the delta method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldberg et al., 2022</xref>). In order to examine the level of antibody response from infection and vaccination (by vaccine doses), we display the distributions of antibodies to spike antigens (at the 1:64 dilution) using box plots with jitter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Results for antibodies to RBD are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig4">Appendix 2—figure 4</xref>).

resulting from both COVID-19 vaccination and natural infection in a representative sample of the Canadian population. The work provides solid evidence that Individuals who received a booster vaccination and had a prior infection had the highest antibody levels, particularly when either the vaccination or natural infection had occurred within the past six months. These findings are of fundamental importance in supporting the value of booster vaccination in populations vulnerable to severe COVID-19.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89961.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Eduardo L</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01pxwe438</institution-id><institution>McGill University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Shitindo</surname><given-names>Mercury</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Africa Bioethics Network</institution><country>Kenya</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.12.27.23300588">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.27.23300588v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

This study holds significant importance as it assessed antibody levels arising from both COVID-19 vaccination and natural infection in a representative population-based sample. The analysis was conducted with thoughtfulness and rigor. The sampling methodology ensured the representation of the broader Canadian population, including minorities and indigenous communities. Findings suggest, that despite a substantial number of individuals having been previously infected, especially following the first omicron wave, repeat booster vaccination is essential to ensure that individuals develop an optimal antibody response against new exposures to infection, given the waning of antibodies over time. The study findings carry global significance as it informs decisions about the relevance of booster vaccination for reducing infection incidence amid the ongoing challenge of vaccine hesitancy and the continual emergence of new variants. I have included below a few suggestions that, in my opinion, could enhance the study's contribution to the literature:</p><p>1) In reference to the statement &quot;hybrid immunity played a role in reducing severe disease and deaths&quot;, I recommend that authors use a more nuanced statement. This is because previous studies have demonstrated that the effectiveness of even only primary-series vaccination against COVID-19 severe disease was high, with slow waning over time. Similar protection was found among unvaccinated individuals who were previously infected with COVID-19. These studies include reference 3 by the authors; Chemaitelly H, Nagelkerke N, Ayoub HH, et al.

However, as we merged data from Phase 2 to Phase 6 (the data used for this study), we found inconsistencies in the self-reported name of COVID vaccines. Some participants reported different vaccine names for the vaccines they had reported on previously. Because we had no way of confirming which iteration of the information was correct, we could not distinguish recall bias from genuinely correcting previously erroneous responses.

We oversampled the elderly and the indigenous groups to counter under-responsiveness from those groups.
