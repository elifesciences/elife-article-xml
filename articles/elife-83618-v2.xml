slow twitch muscles with each type expressing common as well as specific sets of proteins. Congenital myopathies are a group of muscle diseases leading to a weak muscle phenotype caused by mutations in a number of genes including <italic>RYR1</italic>. Patients carrying recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations usually present from birth and are generally more severely affected, showing preferential involvement of fast twitch muscles as well as extraocular and facial muscles. In order to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of recessive <italic>RYR1</italic>-congential myopathies, we performed relative and absolute quantitative proteomic analysis of skeletal muscles from wild-type and transgenic mice carrying p.Q1970fsX16 and p.A4329D RyR1 mutations which were identified in a child with a severe congenital myopathy. Our in-depth proteomic analysis shows that recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations not only decrease the content of RyR1 protein in muscle, but change the expression of 1130, 753, and 967 proteins EDL, soleus and extraocular muscles, respectively. Specifically, recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations affect the expression level of proteins involved in calcium signaling, extracellular matrix, metabolism and ER protein quality control. This study also reveals the stoichiometry of major proteins involved in excitation contraction coupling and identifies novel potential pharmacological targets to treat RyR1-related congenital myopathies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>RYR1</kwd><kwd>mutations</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>congenital myopathy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Ryanodine receptor mutations</kwd><kwd>Excitation contraction coupling</kwd><kwd>Proteomic profiling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A-184765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treves</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NeRab</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treves</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010474</institution-id><institution>RYR-1 Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zorzato</surname><given-names>Francesco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010767</institution-id><institution>Swiss Foundation for Research on Muscle Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treves</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name><name><surname>Zorzato</surname><given-names>Francesco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030-212192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treves</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative proteomic analysis shows that recessive <italic>Ryr1</italic> mutations not only decrease the content of RyR1 protein in muscle, but also affect the content of many other proteins involved in a variety of biological processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscles constitute the largest organ, accounting for approximately 60% of the total body mass; they are responsible for movement and posture and additionally, play a fundamental role in regulating metabolism. Furthermore, skeletal muscles are plastic and can respond to physiological stimuli such as increased workload and exercise by undergoing hypertrophy. Broadly speaking muscles can be subdivided into different types depending on their speed of contraction, namely slow twitch muscles are characterized by level of oxidative activity, while fast twitch muscles show high content of enzymes involved in glycolytic activity. Fast- and slow-twitch muscle can be also identified based on the expression of specific myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lieber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>). Fast twitch muscles, also known as type II fibers, are specialized for rapid movements, are mainly glycolytic contain large glycogen stores and few mitochondria, fatigue rapidly and characteristically express the MyHC isoforms 2 X, 2B, and 2 A. They are also the first muscles to appear during development and are more severely impacted in patients with congenital myopathies; they also undergo more prominent age-related atrophy or sarcopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lieber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckingham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jungbluth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lawal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nilwik et al., 2013</xref>). Slow twitch muscles (type 1 fibers) are mainly oxidative, contain many mitochondria and are fatigue resistant. Slow twitch muscle, such as soleus, contain muscle fibers expressing the MyHC 1 isoform in addition of muscle fibers expressing MyHC 2 A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>). Type 1 fibers are generally less severely affected in patients with neuromuscular disorders such congenital myopathies.</p><p>Although such a general classification based on MyHC isoform expression was used for many years by biochemists and physiologists, it has been recently improved thanks to the implementation of ‘omic’ approaches which have helped refine the phenotypic signature at the single fiber level. A great deal of data has shown that type 2 A fast fibers display a protein profile similar to type I fibers, namely a remarkable level of enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism. Interestingly, type 2 X fibers apparently encode proteins annotated to both oxidative and glycolytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eggers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murgia et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>There are also a number of functionally specialized muscles including extraocular muscles (EOM), jaw muscles and inner ear muscles that have a different embryonic origin and are made up of atypical fiber types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>). For example, EOMs are the fastest contracting muscles yet they are fatigue resistant, contain many mitochondria and express most MyHC isoforms including type 1, embryonic and neonatal MyHC as well as EO-MyHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Porter et al., 1995</xref>). EOMs are also specifically spared in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy yet they are affected in patients with some congenital myopathies, including patients with recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> myopathies carrying a hypomorphic or null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Porter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Porter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amburgey et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Congenital Myopathies (CM) are a genetically heterogeneous group of early onset, non-dystrophic diseases preferentially affecting proximal and axial muscles. More than 20 genes have been implicated in CM, the most commonly affected being those encoding proteins involved in calcium homeostasis and excitation contraction coupling (ECC) and thin-thick filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jungbluth et al., 2018</xref>). Mutations in <italic>RYR1,</italic> the gene encoding the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) calcium channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, are found in approximately 30% of all CM patients, making it the most commonly mutated gene in human CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amburgey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jungbluth et al., 2018</xref>). Within the group of patients carrying <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations, those with the recessive form of the disease are more severely affected, present from birth, have axial and proximal muscle weakness as well as involvement of facial and EOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lawal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amburgey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jungbluth et al., 2018</xref>). A common finding is also the reduced content of RyR1 protein in muscle biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monnier et al., 2008</xref>) which could be one of the causes leading to the weak muscle phenotype. To date, the pathomechanism of disease of recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations is not completely understood and for this reason we created a mouse model knocked in for compound heterozygous mutations identified in a severely affected child with <italic>RYR1</italic>-related congenital myopathy. The double knock in mouse, henceforth referred to as double heterozygous or dHT mouse, carries the RyR1 p.Q1970fsX16 mutation in one allele leading to the absence of a transcript due to nonsense-mediated decay of the allele carrying the frameshift mutation, and the mis-sense RyR1 p.A4329D mutation in the other allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elbaz et al., 2019</xref>). The muscle phenotype of the dHT mouse model closely resembles that of human patients carrying a hypomorphic allele plus a mis-sense <italic>RYR1</italic> mutation, including reduced RyR1 protein content in skeletal muscles, the presence of cores and myofibrillar dis-array, mis-alignment of RyR1 and the dihydropyridine receptor and impaired EOM function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elbaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eckhardt et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, beside a reduction in RyR1, the latter muscles also exhibited a significant decrease in mitochondrial number as well as changes in the expression and content of other proteins, including the almost complete absence of the EOM-specific MyHC isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eckhardt et al., 2020</xref>). Such results imply that broad changes in protein expression caused by the mutation and/or reduced content of RyR1 channels, impact other signaling pathways, leading to altered muscle function. A corollary to this is that since not all muscles are equally affected (for example fast twitch muscles and EOMs are more affected than slow twitch muscles) there may be differences in how the <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations affect the different muscle types.</p><p>In order to establish how and if <italic>Ryr1</italic> mutations differentially impinge on the expression and function of proteins specific for different muscle types, we performed qualitative and quantitative proteomic analysis of EDL, soleus and EOMs from wild-type and dHT mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows a diagram of our experimental workflow: three muscle types were isolated from 12 weeks old wild-type (WT)(n=5) and dHT (n=5) mice, samples were processed for Mass Spectrometry and the results obtained were analyzed against a protein database containing sequences of the predicted SwissProt entries of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/</ext-link>, release date 2019/03/27), <italic>Myh2</italic> and <italic>Myh13</italic> from Trembl, the six calibration mix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrné et al., 2016</xref>) and commonly observed contaminants (in total 17,414 sequences) using the SpectroMine software.

The volcano plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows the log<sub>2</sub> fold change of proteins in EOM (condition 2) versus fast EDL (condition 1) muscles. Interestingly, Reactome pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) revealed that EDL muscles contain a larger number of proteins annotated to adaptive immunity and MHC class I antigen presentation compared to EOMs, while the classes of proteins annotated to the citric acid cycle, electron transport chain and fatty acid ß-oxidation are significantly lower in EDL compared to EOMs. This result is in line with the fact that like soleus muscles, or cardiac muscles, EOMs are enriched in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Porter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>) to support continuous movements of the eyes.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> shows that the content of more than 2000 proteins are differentially expressed (q&lt;0.05) in EOM compared to soleus from WT mice, of these 521 are present in lower amounts and 1663 are present in higher amounts in EOM compared to soleus muscles. The volcano plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> shows the log<sub>2</sub> fold change of proteins in EOM (condition 2) versus slow soleus (condition 1) muscles. Reactome pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) revealed that the most affected category is that containing genes annotated to muscle contraction (that were both up- and downregulated) followed by genes involved in MHC class I antigen presentation, translation and ubiquitin/proteasome degradation that are upregulated in soleus muscles compared to EOM muscles. Reactome pathway analysis as well as Genome Ontology pathway analysis are not sufficiently informative and probably miss important groups of proteins specific to skeletal muscle function; this observation prompted us to select specific proteins whose expression level is known to be different between fast, slow and EOM muscles. Focusing on the relative change in protein content between EDL and soleus muscles of contractile and sarcomeric proteins, our results confirm that the slow muscle Troponin I and C1 isoforms as well as the slow-MyHC 1 (encoded by <italic>Myh7</italic>) are enriched between 32 and 197-fold in soleus muscles, whereas α-actinin 3 and 4 and myomesin 1 are more abundant in EDL muscles and desmin is enriched in soleus muscles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Analysis of sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins involved in ECC show that the content of calsequestrin 2 and SERCA2 is 11- and 22-fold higher in soleus muscles, whereas the relative content of proteins of the junctional face membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum involved in ECC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Treves et al., 2009</xref>) including RyR1, the dihydropyridine (DHPR) complex (including the α1, β1, and α2δ subunits), Stac3, junctophilin-1 and triadin is more than 50% higher in EDL muscles compared to soleus, as is FKBP12 which binds to and stabilizes the RyR1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brillantes et al., 1994</xref>). Fast twitch muscles are also enriched in SERCA1, calsequestrin 1 and junctophilin 2. The abundance of protein annotated to calcium signaling and sarcoplasmic reticulum in EDL is consistent with the larger membrane volume of sarcotubular membrane in fast-twitch muscles compared to slow twitch muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luff and Atwood, 1971</xref>).</p><p>A similar approach was used to compare the relative content of specific proteins changing between EDL and EOMs and soleus and EOMs. Importantly, the results of the mass spectroscopy approach reported here validate a great deal of experimental observations including the fact that EOMs express high levels of <italic>Myhc13</italic>, a specific extra-ocular muscle MyHC isoform (MyHC-EO), as well as more cardiac muscle specific protein isoforms. For example, within the contractile and sarcomeric protein category, compared to EDL muscles, EOMs are particularly enriched in MyHC-slow (24-fold), MyHC-EO (29-fold) and Troponin C1 (slow and cardiac muscle isoform, 31-fold), whereas they contain very low amounts of α-actinin 3 (0.02-fold), MyHC 2b (0.07-fold) and MyHC 2 X (0.61-fold). Within the ECC coupling category, EOMs are enriched in calsequestrin 2 (21-fold), SERCA2 (3.6-fold) and junctin/junctate/aspartyl-ß-hydroxylase (3.5-fold) whereas their content of RyR1, the α-1 subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPRα1s), calsequestrin 1, Stac3, junctophilin-1 and triadin is significantly reduced by more than 50% compared to EDL muscles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Similarly, soleus muscles and EOMs vary in their content of a large number of proteins. Within the contractile and sarcomeric protein category, EOMs are enriched in embryonic MyHC (<italic>Myhc3</italic>, 49-fold), MyHC-EO (20-fold) and cardiac troponin T (3.10-fold), whereas compared to soleus muscles they contain very low amounts of slow- MyHC (0.0096-fold), myosin light chain 2 (0.01-fold), myozenin-2 (0.017-fold) and α-actinin 2 (0.017-fold). In the ECC category, EOMs are enriched in a number of proteins including SERCA1 (eightfold) and SERCA3 (sevenfold), Stim1 (fourfold), Junctin/junctate/Aspartyl-ß-hydroxylase (threefold), DHPRα1s (1.4-fold) and junctophilin-1 (1.4-fold), whereas they contain very low amounts of SERCA2 and &gt;50% lower amounts of Mitsugumin 53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). Interestingly compared to EDL and soleus muscles, EOMs are enriched more than twofold in Stim1, junctin/junctate/aspartylß-hydroxlase. Furthermore, compared to soleus muscles and EOMs, EDLs are enriched in parvalbumin and in proteins annotated to calcium-dependent signaling’ via the calcium /calmodulin dependent protein kinase IIα and IIγ, whereas soleus and EOM muscles are enriched in S100A1.</p><p>Altogether, the results of the mass spectrometry analysis not only confirm known differences between muscle types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Porter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celio and Heizmann, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luff and Atwood, 1971</xref>) but also reveal new molecular signatures of EDL, soleus and EOMs. In this context, it is worth mentioning that more than 10 heat shock proteins are more abundant in soleus muscles and EOMs compared to EDL muscles, including <italic>Hspb6</italic> (16-fold higher in soleus compared to EDL) and <italic>Hspa12a</italic> (7-fold higher in EOM vs soleus). <italic>Hspb6</italic> has been implicated in protection against atrophy, ischemia, hypertensive stress, and metabolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dreiza et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, a great deal of data has shown that muscles from patients with several neuromuscular disorders including those caused by <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations show fiber type 1 predominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jungbluth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lawal et al., 2018</xref>) and heat shock proteins have been suggested to have a protective effect against muscle damage caused by calcium dysregulation and uncoupling of mitochondrial respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maglara et al., 2003</xref>) as well as protective effects against ischemic injury in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, the content of Mitsugumin 53 (encoded by <italic>Trim72</italic>), a protein involved in muscle membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2009</xref>) is 2.8-fold higher in slow twitch muscles compared to fast twitch muscles. Thus, on the basis these observations we cannot exclude the possibility that increased expression of Mitsugumin 53, along with a set of heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dreiza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maglara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larkins et al., 2012</xref>), might be relevant in preventing muscle fiber type 1 damage associated with the presence of recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations or with other type of stressing events. To directly verify this hypothesis, we examined the proteome of fast and slow twitch muscles in a mouse model (RyR1 dHT) of congenital muscle disorders carrying the p.Q1970fsX16 mutation in one allele and the mis-sense p.A4329D mutation in the other allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elbaz et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Comparison of muscles isolated from WT and RyR1 dHT mice</title><p>In the next experiments, the proteome of three different muscles from dHT mice vs those of WT mice were compared. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> shows that in EDL muscles a total of 848 proteins are significantly (q&lt;0.05) mis-regulated in dHT mice; in particular, 529 and 319 proteins are up- or downregulated only in the EDLs of dHT mice compared to WT mice, respectively.

In the ECC protein category, RyR1, DHPRα1s, and Junctophillin 1 are significantly decreased, as is triadin, whereas junctin/junctate/ß-hydroxylase and SERCA2 are increased in muscles from dHT mice. In the contractile protein group, significant changes are only observed for Troponin 3 whose content decreases by about 30%. Similar to what was observed in EDL muscles, we found that the content of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases IIδ and γ is increased. In addition, S100A1, a calcium binding protein which binds to and regulates RyR1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Treves et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prosser et al., 2011</xref>), is significantly increased in soleus muscles from dHT mice.

fast twitch muscles such as EOMs and EDLs compared to the slow twitch soleus muscle and the proteomic approach revealed that the content of many proteins differs between dHT and WT EDL, soleus and EOM muscles. We next refined our analysis and searched for protein whose content variation is most strongly associated with the dHT genotype. In particular, we searched for proteins which show significant changes in content in all three muscle types, namely EDL, Sol, and EOM. The Venn diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) shows that the three muscle types from the dHT mice share a number of proteins whose content increases or decreases. The downregulation of RyR1 appears to be a unique a signature of the dHT phenotype, since its decrease is the only change shared between all muscle types investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Biological process GO analysis revealed that the content of genes annotated to intracellular organelles, cytoplasm and ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> left panel, downregulated) and cellular process, metabolic process and organic substance metabolic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> left panel, upregulated) amongst others is changed in both EDL and soleus muscles from dHT mice. On the other hand, the content of genes annotated to supramolecular fiber, extrinsic component of membrane and myofibril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> middle panel, downregulated), biological regulation, regulation of cellular process and organic substance metabolic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> middle panel, upregulated) amongst others is changed in both EDL and EOMs from dHT mice. While the content of genes annotated to cytoplasm, organelle membrane and mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> right panel, downregulated) and cellular process, metabolic process and organonitrogen compound metabolic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> right panel, upregulated) amongst others is changed in both soleus and EOMs from dHT mice. Two heat shock proteins Hsp70 (BiP) and Hsp family B small member 6 (<italic>Hspb6</italic>) are increased only in EDL and EOMs. Interestingly, the content of 39 proteins including Kelch-like protein 41, two annotated to calcium signaling such as calmodulin kinase 2δ and aspartyl-ß -hydroxylase are increased in all three muscle types from dHT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and D</xref>), as are several proteins associated with the 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits. GO analysis of biological process revealed that the content of genes annotated to cellular process, cellular component organization or biogenesis and cellular component organization amongst others are upregulated in the three muscle types in dHT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Quantification and stoichiometry of ECC proteins in WT and dHT muscles</title><p>Skeletal muscle ECC relies on the highly ordered architecture of two intracellular membrane compartments, namely the transverse tubules which are invaginations of the plasma membrane containing the DHPR macromolecular complex and the sarcoplasmic reticulum containing the RyR1 macromolecular complex, as well as other proteins involved in calcium homeostasis and accessory structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Treves et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franzini-Armstrong and Jorgensen, 1994</xref>). The relative content of many of these proteins has been determined, nevertheless few studies have established their stoichiometry in relation to particular muscle types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franzini-Armstrong and Jorgensen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leberer and Pette, 1986</xref>). Within a total muscle homogenate, sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins are of low abundance, thus, to quantify these proteins we performed high-resolution TMT mass spectrometry by using spiked-in labeled peptides from major protein involved in key steps of ECC calcium signaling to build a standard calibration curve. In particular, we used peptides from RyR1 and DHPRα1s, and Stim1 and Orai1, proteins which are involved in calcium release from the SR and in calcium entry across sarcolemma, respectively. The obtained protein concentrations showed a high correlation (R2=0.96; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) with the MS abundance estimates determined from the global proteomics analysis. Therefore, we used this curve to extrapolate the absolute amounts and stoichiometry of proteins whose values fall within the linear domain of the curve, namely, JP-45, triadin, junctophilin 1, Stac3 in addition to RyR1, DHPRα1s, Stim1 and Orai1. The content of the RyR1 protomer in WT fast twitch EDL muscles is 1.29±0.07 μmol/kg wet weight, whereby the calculated RyR1 tetrameric complex is 0.32 μmol/kg wet weight (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>) a value which is threefold lower compared to that determined in total muscle homogenates by[<sup>3</sup>H]-ryanodine equilibrium binding by Bers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bers and Stiffel, 1993</xref>). On the other hand, our RyR1 quantification results in mouse total muscle homogenates obtained by TMT mass spectrometry using labeled peptides is approximately fivefold higher compared to those obtained in rabbit and frog whole skeletal muscle homogenate preparations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 1994</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Margreth et al., 1993</xref>. Our results also show that the RyR1 concentration (in μmol/Kg) in soleus and EOM muscles from WT mice is approximately 38% and 46% of that found in EDL muscles of WT mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). We found that the content of DHPRα1s in EDL muscles is 0.56±0.03 mol/kg wet weight, a value approx. 2.5-fold higher compared to that of soleus muscles (0.18±0.01 μmol/kg wet weight) and of EOMs (0.21±0.01 mol/kg wet weight). Thus, the calculated RyR1 tetramer to DHPRα1s ratio in EDL muscles from WT and dHT mice is 0.571 and 0.429, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Such a value appears to be slightly higher both in soleus and EOM muscles (0.667 and 0.625 in WT and dHT soleus muscles and 0.714 and 0.474 in WT and dHT EOMs, respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). The Stac3 content correlates with that of DHPRα1s, namely EDL is the muscle which is most enriched in Stac3 (0.62±0.07 μmol/kg wet weight); soleus and EOMs contain approximately one-third of the Stac 3 present in the EDL, namely 0.22±0.02 mol/kg wet weight and 0.17±0.01 mol/kg wet weight in soleus and EOMs, respectively. Stac3 content in muscles from dHT is similar to that of WT littermates. Interestingly, the content of Stim1 depends on the muscles type. Mass spectrometry quantification revealed that EOMs contain the highest amounts of Stim1 (1.35±0.03 μmol/kg wet weight) compared to soleus (0.55±0.03 μmol/kg wet weight) and EDL (0.46±0.02 μmol/kg wet weight). Western blot analysis of total muscle homogenates from WT mice confirmed that EOMs contain four times more Stim1 than EDL muscles <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> and that equal proportions of Stim1 and Stim1L are present in the three muscle groups, with no preferential expression of the long isoform in any of the muscles investigated. As to WT EDL and soleus, we found no major differences in Stim1 expression, confirming previous data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cully et al., 2016</xref>. The expression of Stim1 is accompanied by the expression of Orai1 in EDL and EOMs but not in soleus muscles. Indeed, mouse EOMs contain the highest amount of Orai1 monomer (0.16±0.03 μmol/kg wet weight) and EDLs contained approximately 68% of that (0.11±0.01 μmol/kg wet weight). To our surprise in soleus muscles, the content of Orai1 is below the detection level of mass spectrometry measurement, indicating that slow twitch (soleus) muscles express very little, if any, Orai1 compared to fast twitch EDL and EOMs.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Correlation of the actual cellular abundances of four selected proteins (in µmol/kg wet weight) determined by PRM/SID (n=2) and the iBAQ values (n=5) determined by label-free/TMT quantification (both in logarithmic scale, base 2) from the global proteomics discovery dataset for EDL samples.</title><p>Error bars are indicated for the y-axis, but for the x-axis, due to their low scale (range from 0.058 to 0.086), they are not shown by the software PRISM, GraphPad Software, (v9).

The results of the proteomic analysis reveal that, asides the drastic reduction in RyR1 content, profound changes occur in the content of many proteins particularly in fast-, slow-twitch and EOM muscles. Namely, we found that recessive <italic>Ryr1</italic> mutations lead to an increase content aspartyl-ß-hydroxylase (Asph), some ribosomal proteins and calmodulin kinase 2 delta. EDL and EOMs that are more severely affected, also share changes in the content of other proteins, including collagens, heat shock proteins, and CamK2b as well as additional ribosomal proteins. We believe that the reduced RyR1 calcium channel content has a domino effect leading to changes in content of many proteins, particularly in EDL and EOMs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Stoichiometry of ECC molecular complex in health and diseased muscles</title><p>In this study we used spiked-in labelled peptides for isobaric TMT mass spectrometry measurements to quantify the major protein components of the ECC molecular complex in EDL, soleus and EOM from WT and dHT mice and established the absolute content of low abundant ECC-molecular complex proteins, including RyR1, DHPRα1s, Stim1, Orai1. The calculated values for RyR1 and DHPRα1s that we obtained are of the same order of magnitude as those previously determined by equilibrium ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Margreth et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cully et al., 2016</xref>), confirming the reliability of this approach. In addition, we also provide for the first time the absolute quantification of Stim1 and Ora1, two crucial proteins involved in Store Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE). Our results are interesting because of the widespread attention gained by SOCE in skeletal muscle, not only because mutations in <italic>STIM1</italic> and <italic>ORAI1</italic> are the underlying feature of several genetic diseases associated with muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Böhm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lacruz and Feske, 2015</xref>), but also because experimental evidence has shown that Stim1 and Orai1 play an important role in refilling intracellular calcium stores in fast and slow twitch muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cully et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wei-Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrell et al., 2016</xref>). Quantitative isobaric TMT mass spectrometry revealed important differences in the content of Stim1, Stim2 and Orai1 among different muscle types. We are confident of our results because the data relative to Stim1 content were validated by staining western blots of total muscle homogenates with Stim1-specific antibodies. Our data show that EOMs contain the highest levels of Stim1, and, in agreement with previous data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cully et al., 2016</xref>, we found no major differences in Stim1 content between fast and slow twitch muscles. The Stim1 to Orai1 ratio in EOMs is 45, a value approximately 1.9-fold higher compared to that of EDLs. This higher content of Stim1 and Orai1 supports the idea that SOCE is a robust component of calcium signaling in EOMs mediating the constant calcium entry necessary to replenish sarcoplasmic reticulum stores needed to support the continuous fast muscle contraction unique to EOMs, compared to other striated muscles. A mind-boggling result emerging from the quantitative analysis of Stim1 and Orai1 is that slow twitch muscles such a soleus contain very low levels of Orai1 protein which could not be quantified by LC-MS. This raises the important question as to the nature of the molecular component(s) interacting with Stim1 in order to operate SOCE in slow twitch muscles. At this point in time, we cannot exclude the possibility that in slow twitch muscles, Stim1 interacts with a molecular partner different from Orai1, or that SOCE might be operated by an Orai1 variant having a much higher divalent cation conductance compared to the ‘classical’ Orai1 isoform expressed in EDL and EOM. Nevertheless, such a question is beyond the scope of the present investigation and cannot be answered by the data presented here.</p><p><italic>STAC3</italic> mutations have been linked to Native American Myopathy (NAM), a severe congenital myopathy resulting in muscle weakness and skeleton alteration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horstick et al., 2013</xref>). Such mutations cause a decrease of the interaction between Stac3 with DHPRα1s resulting in a functional deficit of EC coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong King Yuen et al., 2017</xref>). On the basis the quantitative data we obtained using the LC-MS standard curve generated by spiked-in peptides, the Stac3 to Cacna1s stoichiometry ratio is 1.11, 1.22, and 1.67 in EDL, soleus and EOM respectively, and no differences were observed between WT and dHT mice. Stac3 interacts via its SH3 domain with a Kd ranging between 2 and 10 µM, with a binding site within the cytosolic II-III loop of the DHPRα1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rufenach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Polster et al., 2018</xref>). Here we show that the molar content of Stac3 in EDL, soleus and EOMs is between 2.5- and 10- fold lower than its Kd for the DHPRα1s II-III loop binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong King Yuen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rufenach et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the fractional occupancy of the DHPRα1s binding site by Stac3 is lower than 50%, a value which is still sufficient to support normal EC coupling. Nevertheless, the extent of the fractional occupancy depends on the fiber type. In particular, if the Kd of the DHPRα1s binding site for Stac3 is identical in EDL, soleus and EOM, then the fractional occupancy of the DHPRα1s binding site for Stac3 in soleus and EOMs is lower than of EDL muscles, because the molar content of Stac3 in soleus and EOMs is three-fold lower compared to that of EDL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). <italic>STAC3</italic> mutations linked to NAM decrease the Kd of the SH3 domain of Stac3 for the cytosolic II-III loop of DHPRα1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rufenach et al., 2020</xref>) further lowering the fractional occupancy of Stac3 binding site of DHPRα1s to a low level close to zero, a condition that would disrupt EC coupling in NAM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horstick et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Recessive <italic>Ryr1</italic> mutations affect the expression of extracellular matrix</title><p>‘Reactome’ interaction pathway analysis revealed that the major pathways affected by the presence of compound heterozygous <italic>Ryr1</italic> mutations in EDL muscles includes proteins involved in organization and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and indeed the content of collagen I, II, IV, V, and XI was significantly reduced. The ECM plays an important role in muscle force transmission, maintenance and repair and collagen fibers account for 1–10% muscle dry weight, forming a highly ordered network surrounding individual muscle fibers and muscle bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trotter and Purslow, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gillies and Lieber, 2011</xref>). Exactly how defects in the collagen network impact muscle function is not clear, nevertheless patients bearing mutations in Collagen VI (<italic>COL6A1</italic>, <italic>COL6A2</italic> and <italic>COL6A3</italic>) suffer from Ulrich and Bethlem myopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bethlem and Wijngaarden, 1976</xref>) and exhibit muscle contractures involving elbows and ankles, a clinical sign that has been also described in patients suffering of congenital myopathies linked to recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monnier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, a frequent common feature of patients with congenital myopathies carrying recessive <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations is the appearance of a number of skeletal abnormalities at birth, including scoliosis and congenital dislocation of the hip, kyphosis, clubfoot, flattening of the arch of the foot (or an abnormally high arch of the foot). Patients also exhibit joint laxity that may lead to dislocation of the patella, or, more rarely abnormal tightening of certain joints, resulting in contractures especially of the Achilles tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jungbluth, 2007</xref>) and such features may also be related to the changes in collagen composition of the muscle fibers, as observed in dHT mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Recessive <italic>Ryr1</italic> mutations affect the expression of proteins involved in ER protein quality control and protein synthesis</title><p>Muscles from the dHT did not show upregulation of proteins related to ER stress such as PERK, IRE1a, ATF6, although the content of BiP as well as that of several heat shock proteins was significantly increased in EDL and EOM muscles. Heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones that participate in the safeguard of cell integrity, playing numerous functions including protection from heat insults, prevention of aggregation and facilitation of protein folding. There are different categories of heat shock proteins, including small HSPs (HSPB1-10) that are involved in protein folding, prevention of aggregation. In skeletal muscle, these small proteins have been shown to be involved in the maintenance of the cytoskeletal network and contractile elements and play a role in myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dreiza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maglara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 1997</xref>). Large HSP are present in many subcellular locations including mitochondria, nucleus, sarcoplasmic reticulum and myoplasm where they facilitate protein folding and re-folding, facilitate protein transport into the SR and mitochondria and prevent aggregate formation. Interestingly, intensive resistance training increases heat shock protein levels in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murlasits et al., 2006</xref>) whereas aging is associated with a decrease in HSP70 response in muscles following muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vasilaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murgia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brinkmeier and Ohlendieck, 2014</xref>). Proteomic profiling has shown that muscle diseases including dysferlinopathies, myofibrillar myopathies, spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and others are associated with upregulation of distinct HSP (for review see 51). These results together with our findings suggest that altered muscle function caused by genetic mutations are accompanied by adaptive cellular responses aimed at counterbalancing muscle damage and/or restoring proper function. Of note, in soleus muscles from the dHT mice, HSP are not up-regulated; this may be due to the fact that soleus muscles are less damaged/stressed or because the content of HSPs in soleus muscles is constitutively higher than in EDL muscles. In particular, the expression of HSP70 is fivefold higher in WT soleus compared to WT EDL muscles. The high expression of HSP70 might thus protect slow twitch muscles from extensive damage linked to the expression of mutant RyR1s, an event which may ultimately account for the fiber type I predominance observed in patients with congenital myopathies linked to <italic>RYR1</italic> mutations.</p><p>An interesting observation of the present study is that the content of ribosomal proteins constituting the 40 S and 60 S subunits is significantly increased in the three muscle types from the dHT compared to WT. In skeletal muscle, up-regulation of ribosomal proteins accompanies hypertrophy and training, whereas ribosomal proteins decrease with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ubadia-Mohien et al., 2019</xref>).

In particular, absolute quantification can be achieved by measuring the content of a protein relative to a spiked-in peptide with known absolute concentration. A limitation of the multiplexed isobaric mass tag-based protein quantification is the reliable detection of very low abundant proteins, such as transcriptional factors and other molecules involved in cellular signaling. Because of this intrinsic hurdle of multiplex isobaric mass tag spectrometry, in this study we missed nuclear proteins in addition to protein components of signaling pathways. An additional drawback of this study is that it gives a static image of muscle protein content in young adult mice without conveying information about the dynamics of protein changes or changes in post-translational modifications occurring during muscle disease.</p><p>In summary, our quantitative proteomic study, shows that recessive <italic>Ryr1</italic> mutations not only decrease the content of RyR1 protein in muscle, but also affect the content of many other proteins involved in a variety of biological processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><p>All experiments involving animals were carried out on 12 weeks old male WT and dHT mice littermates.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Reviewers (1) and (2) were enthusiastic about the work; reviewer (3) had reservations. Nevertheless we would like to offer you the opportunity to submit a revised version addressing the comments particularly of reviewers (2) and (3). I have worked through all the comments and hope the notes to follow may be useful in connection with this.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer (2) makes the following broad comments that may merit addressing:</p><p>a) The main limitation of this study is that the results are primarily descriptive in nature, and thus, do not provide mechanistic insight into how Ryr1 disease mutations lead to the muscle-specific changes observed in the EDL, soleus and EOM proteomes.</p><p>b) Results comparing fast twitch (EDL) and slow twitch (soleus) muscles from WT mice confirmed several known differences between the two muscle types.

Although the definition of mechanistic insights related to changes of dozens of proteins is very interesting, it is a difficult task to accomplish and goes beyond the goal of the high-throughput proteomic analysis presented here. Nevertheless, the analysis of DEPs may indeed provide arguments to speculate on the pathogenesis of the phenotype linked to recessive RyR1 mutations. In the unrevised manuscript, we pointed out that the fiber type I predominance observed in congenital myopathies linked to recessive <italic>Ryr1</italic> mutation are consistent with the high expression level of heat shock proteins in slow twitch muscles. However, as suggested by Reviewer 3, we have removed &quot;vague statements&quot; from the text of the revised manuscript, concerning major insights into pathophysiological mechanisms, since we are aware that the mechanistic information, if any, that we can extract from the data set, cannot go over the intrinsic limitation of the high-throughput proteomic technology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Results comparing fast twitch (EDL) and slow twitch (soleus) muscles from WT mice confirmed several known differences between the two muscle types.

We agree that the data showing changes in protein content between the 3 muscle groups of the WT mice are important also because they validate the results of the proteomic approach. Indeed, the present results confirm that many proteins including MyHCIIb, calsequestrin 1, SERCA1, parvalbumin etc are more abundantly expressed in fast twitch EDL muscles compared to soleus. Similarly, our results confirm that EOMs are enriched in MyHC-EO as well as cardiac isoforms of ECC proteins. This point has been clarified in the revised version of the manuscript (page 8, lines 196-213; page 9 lines 214-228).

The expression of transcripts encoding <italic>Cacna1s</italic> and <italic>Stac3</italic> is approximately 9-fold higher in EDL compared to Soleus.

Indeed, we found that the content of the Stac3 protein in EDL is 3-fold higher compared to that in soleus. Although there is no apparent linear correlation between mRNA and protein levels, we believe that a few plausible conclusions can be drawn, namely: (i) the expression level of both transcripts and proteins is higher EDL compared to EOM and soleus muscles, respectively, (ii) the expression level of transcripts encoding <italic>Stac3</italic> correlate with those encoding <italic>Cacan1s</italic> and confirm proteomic data.

We think that such a filter will miss relevant proteins. One example for all: if we set the filter for fold change of protein expression level to 0.5 we will filter out the RyR1 in the comparison between Soleus WT and Soleus from dHT mice. This result would be inconsistent with a set of data obtained by different experimental approaches including western blot analysis and qPCR (Elbaz et al. 2019) showing that the muscle phenotype of the soleus from dHT mice is in agreement with a decrease of the RyR1 protein and transcript expression level, even though it does not reach the threshold of 0.5.

In these publications, we showed that the decrease of the RyR1protein content is consistent with the decrease of force developed both in vivo and in vitro and with the smaller electrically evoked calcium transients. EDL from dHT showed a 10% decrease of wet weight, suggesting a small degree of muscle atrophy, which does not correlate with the much larger decrease of RyR1 content in the skeletal muscle homogenate. The muscle weakness is mostly explained mostly by reduction of RyR1 expression and in part by the small degree of muscle atrophy. In Elbaz et al., 2019 and Eckhardt et al., 2020 papers, mice having an age range between 8-12 weeks were characterized and in the present paper, muscles were harvested from 12 weeks old mice (page 22, line 558).

Hum Mol Gen 2019; Eckhardt et al. Hum Mol Gen 2020) concerning the skeletal muscle phenotype of the dHT mice. Elbaz et al. (2019) showed that in EDL and Soleus muscle from dHT mice there are ultrastructural changes referable to core-like structures, but no major signatures of atrophy and or necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). We would like to point out that Reactome pathway analysis and GO analysis did not identify terms annotated to either autophagy, apoptosis or necrosis.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Histological staining of EDL and soleus muscles from EDL and soleus.</title><p>Cross sectional area of HandE stained muscle sections from WT and dHT mice.

The GO pathway analysis seems to not be very informative here and the changes are subtle considering that the filter threshold was set at 0.25.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggests to use the GSEA tool to explore enrichment pathway since GO pathway was not informative. We believe that the use of the GSEA tool and other tools will face the same problem, i.e. the enrichment terms are not informative for EC coupling and other muscle physiology terms because most of the annotated terms in these tools are related to cancer or immunological pathways regardless of the filter threshold relative to fold changes. We did use GSEA tool and we did not pick up significant terms relating to EC coupling and neuromuscular disorders linked to RyR1 mutations</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) The discussion should be more organized and should address the pathological mechanism of the mutation and how the current study improves our understanding of the disease. For example, the section about the implication of the mutation in bone formation and remodeling is irrelevant to the current study and is an over-interpretation of the results found in skeletal muscle.</p></disp-quote><p>The discussion of the revised manuscript has been reorganized with new paragraphs. In addition, in the revised manuscript we removed the sentence referring to the effects of RyR1 mutations on bone formation and remodeling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
