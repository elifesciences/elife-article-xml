mammalian brain, and are thought to subserve important, if not fully understood roles in normal and abnormal brain function. Oscillations at different frequency bands are hallmarks of specific brain and behavioral states. At the higher end of the spectrum, 150-200 Hz ripples occur in the hippocampus during slow-wave sleep, and ultrafast (400-600 Hz) oscillations arise in the somatosensory cortices of humans and several other mammalian species in response to peripheral nerve stimulation or punctate sensory stimuli. Here we report that brief optogenetic activation of thalamocortical axons, in brain slices from mouse somatosensory (barrel) cortex, elicited in the thalamorecipient layer local field potential (LFP) oscillations which we dubbed “ripplets”. Ripplets originated in the postsynaptic cortical network and consisted of a precisely repeating sequence of 2‑5 negative transients, closely resembling hippocampal ripples but, at ~400 Hz, over twice as fast. Fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons fired highly synchronous 400 Hz spike bursts entrained to the LFP oscillation, while regular-spiking (RS), excitatory neurons typically fired only 1-2 spikes per ripplet, in antiphase to FS spikes, and received synchronous sequences of alternating excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We suggest that ripplets are an intrinsically generated cortical response to a strong, synchronous thalamocortical volley, and could provide increased bandwidth for encoding and transmitting sensory information. Importantly, optogenetically induced ripplets are a uniquely accessible model system for studying synaptic mechanisms of fast and ultrafast cortical and hippocampal oscillations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oscillations</kwd><kwd>barrel cortex</kwd><kwd>thalamocortical</kwd><kwd>somatosensory cortex</kwd><kwd>ripples</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS116604</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agmon</surname><given-names>Ariel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Training Grants GM081741 and GM132494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hostetler</surname><given-names>Rachel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Brief optogenetic stimulation of thalamocortical axons evoked a 400 Hz wavelet, 'ripplet,' in the extracellular field potential in cortical layer 4, together with phase-locked spike bursts in fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons and alternating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in excitatory cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A ubiquitous feature of neuronal networks, in the brains of multiple mammalian species throughout the evolutionary tree, is their propensity to engage in large-scale, synchronous and rhythmic patterns of electrical activity, reflected as oscillations in the local field potential (LFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Buzsáki et al., 2013</xref>). LFP oscillations occur at frequencies spanning four or more orders of magnitude, with oscillations at different frequency bands often nested together and co-modulating each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Steriade, 2006</xref>). Different oscillatory patterns are hallmarks of specific brain and behavioral states; for example, theta rhythms (4–9 Hz) are typical of exploratory behavior, sleep spindles (~10 Hz) occur during certain sleep stages, and gamma oscillations (30–90 Hz) are the hallmark of cognitive activity and sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Lopes da Silva, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Singer, 2018</xref>). Even faster, transient 150–200 Hz ‘ripples’ in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus occur during quiet immobility and slow-wave sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bragin et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bragin et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Csicsvari et al., 1999a</xref>), and are thought to be critical for memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Girardeau and Lopes-Dos-Santos, 2021</xref>). Extracellular voltage signals, including oscillations, are driven by currents entering (sinks) or leaving (sources) the intracellular brain compartment, and reflect both synaptic activity and action potential firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Mitzdorf, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Liebe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Schomburg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Reimann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Pesaran et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus fire at precise phases of theta, gamma, and ripple oscillations in a subtype-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cardin, 2018</xref>), and synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory cells are implicated in the generation of oscillations across the spectrum, although the details may vary between frequency bands, between different brain areas, and even between cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Kopell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Whittington et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>At the high end of the frequency range, ultrafast, 250–600 Hz oscillations have been observed in both hippocampus and neocortex. In the hippocampus, such oscillations (often called ‘fast ripples’) are almost exclusively paroxysmal (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Gulyás and Freund, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Lévesque and Avoli, 2019</xref>), although their underlying cellular and network mechanisms remain under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dzhala and Staley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Foffani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Engel et al., 2009</xref>). In the neocortex, however, non-paroxysmal 600 Hz wavelets have been repeatedly observed in scalp recordings from human subjects in response to peripheral nerve stimulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Curio, 2000</xref>). Similar 600 Hz LFP oscillations in response to peripheral nerve stimulation were also observed in monkeys and piglets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ikeda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Baker et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, LFP oscillations in the 300–500 Hz range were also consistently observed in rats in response to whisker deflections or to auditory clicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Jones and Barth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Jones et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Jones and Barth, 2002</xref>); however, their underlying mechanisms and functional significance remain largely unexplored.</p><p>We recorded ex vivo extracellular and intracellular activity evoked by optogenetic activation of channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-expressing thalamocortical axons in thalamorecipient layers of mouse somatosensory (barrel) cortex. We report here that brief light pulses (as short as 1 ms) elicited a transient (&lt;25 ms), highly reproducible LFP oscillation or ‘ripplet,’ which closely resembled hippocampal ripples but, at ~400 Hz, was more than twice as fast. Paired whole-cell recordings from fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons and regular-spiking (RS) excitatory cells revealed precise phase relationships between FS spikes, RS spikes and ripplets, and between FS spikes and sequences of alternating EPSCs and IPSCs in RS cells, suggesting that phasic RS→RS and RS→FS excitation underlies ripplet generation. Ripplets may be a stereotypical cortical response to strong, punctate stimuli that activate thalamocortical afferents with a high degree of synchrony and could be used by the cortex to encode specific features of a sensory event. Importantly, optogenetically evoked ex vivo ripplets are a uniquely accessible model for studying the synaptic basis of fast and ultrafast network oscillations, including hippocampal ripples.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded extracellular and intracellular responses in layer 4 (L4) of barrel cortex brain slices, evoked by widefield optogenetic activation of thalamocortical synapses. Slices were prepared from brains of 3–7-postnatal-week-old mice of both sexes expressing ChR2 in the somatosensory thalamus (see ‘Materials and methods’). We applied brief light pulses through the epi-illumination path of the microscope, likely activating most of the thalamocortical axons and terminals within the surrounding L4 barrel. To verify that ChR2 in L4 was expressed by thalamocortical and not intracortical axons, we imaged and quantified the extent of tdTomato reporter expression in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Within the barrel cortex, there was a sparse population of reporter-expressing cell bodies in L2/3 and L5, but virtually none within L4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Since the thalamus and L4 itself are the two main sources of excitatory input to L4 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Feldmeyer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Petersen and Sakmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>), we conclude that the network activity we observed was predominantly evoked by thalamocortical activation, although we cannot rule out that a small number of corticothalamic neurons in L6, which send axonal collaterals to L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">White and Keller, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Kumar and Ohana, 2008</xref>), also expressed ChR2 and provided a minor excitatory contribution.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic activation of thalamocortical axons evoked ripple-like extracellular wavelets</title><p>A brief light pulse (1–10 ms, typically 2–5 ms) evoked a stereotypical field potential wavelet in L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this and all other electrophysiological traces, the light-evoked response is represented by a 25-ms-long record beginning 1 ms before light onset, and the timing of the light pulse is indicated by a cyan bar above or below the trace. At all stimulus durations, the LFP waveform consisted of an initial low-amplitude negative component (solid arrowhead), followed by 2–5 (typically 3–4) larger negative transients (hollow arrowheads) riding on a slow, positive-going envelope. In the example slice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the fourth transient was barely discernible in response to a 1 ms light pulse (left), but became noticeably larger with a 5 ms pulse (right). A low-amplitude negative shoulder or ‘hump’ (arrow) was often observed on the rising phase of the first large transient. These optogenetically evoked waveforms were reminiscent of hippocampus ripples, LFP wavelets recorded from the cell body layer of areas CA1 or CA3; we therefore named them RIPPle-Like Extracellular Transients or ‘ripplets’.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Local field potential oscillations (ripplets) induced by optogenetic thalamocortical activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Averaged ripplets evoked in an example slice; light pulses (1 and 5 ms duration for left and right traces, respectively) represented by cyan bars above traces, and apply to (<bold>A–C</bold>).

To reveal any presynaptic thalamocortical components in the ripplets, we blocked fast ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) pharmacologically with CNQX + APV. This eliminated the large negative transients but left unchanged the early negative component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel, solid arrowhead), which therefore reflected the initial thalamocortical volley. Interestingly, the presynaptic response to 5 ms or longer light pulses revealed one or two additional presynaptic transients of decreasing amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel, solid arrowheads), suggesting that thalamocortical axons fired additional volleys of decreasing magnitude and coherence. Subtracting the waveforms in CNQX + APV from those in control ACSF isolated the postsynaptic component of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Superposition of the isolated presynaptic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left) and postsynaptic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right) contributions at 1, 5, and 10 ms stimulus durations demonstrated that prolonging the light pulse added late components to the response waveform but did not affect the timing of the earlier peaks. To confirm that the iGluR-independent signals reflected action potentials, we added TTX to the bath, which blocked all remaining responses except for a small square waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The latter was coincident with the light pulse and was most likely an electrical or optoelectrical artifact, and is subtracted from all traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Ripplet waveforms, as well as their isolated presynaptic components, were remarkably consistent between animals in their temporal structure, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> by the superposition of responses in slices from four different animals, drawn at different vertical scales to facilitate time course comparison. To quantify the variability in the temporal structure of ripplets between animals, we measured the peak times (relative to light onset) of the isolated presynaptic volleys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, left; eight slices from eight animals tested in CNQX + APV) and of the postsynaptic transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, right; 11 slices from 11 animals with ripplet amplitudes ≥0.5 mV). Standard deviations (SDs) of the presynaptic volleys ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 ms, and SDs of ripplet peaks ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 ms. Calculated over the three volleys, the presynaptic axons appeared to fire at an average frequency ( = 1/average ISI) of 239 ± 6 Hz. This is consistent with the observed burst frequency in thalamocortical neurons of the same mouse genotype when activated optogenetically ex vivo, which rarely exceeds 300 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Hu and Agmon, 2016</xref>, their Figure 4E). Calculated over the four ripplet peaks, ripplet frequency averaged 408 ± 15 Hz, that is, nearly twice as fast as the apparent presynaptic volleys.

In the remainder of this study, we focus on L4.</p><p>To examine if burst patterns were dependent on stimulus parameters (light duration and intensity), we first compared bursts elicited by 2 and 5 ms light pulses. In the example cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, a 2 ms stimulus elicited a precisely reproducible four-spike burst (10 superimposed red traces); increasing stimulus duration to 5 ms left the timing and jitter on these four spikes nearly unchanged but occasionally elicited a fifth, long-latency spike (arrowhead) with considerably higher jitter compared to the first four spikes (blue traces; note increased jitter in the raster plot in the lower panel). We refer to such spikes, with higher jitter and occasional failures, as ‘low-reliability spikes.’ All seven FS cells tested at both stimulus durations fired more spikes in response to a 5 ms compared with 2 ms stimulus, with a median increase of one spike/stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) but with no appreciable change in timing and precision of the earlier spikes, as seen by the identical median values of the second spike jitter and the first ISI at the two stimulus durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>We then compared the number and precision of spikes in response to different light intensities. Bursts elicited by 20 and 90% intensity, in the same example cell from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. At the lower intensity, there was again one less spike, but in addition the jitter of all spikes except the first was &gt;3× higher. In a subsample of 14 cells tested with 5 ms light pulses at five different intensities (10, 20, 40, 60, and 90% of maximal intensity), the average number of spikes/trial increased from 2.9 at 10% to 4.8 at 90% intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As seen by comparing the second spike jitter and first ISI between at 20 and 90% light pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), overall spike timing did not differ between the two intensities (p=0.38) but at lower intensities spikes were much less precise (second spike jitter: 106 ± 13 vs. 43 ± 6 μs, p&lt;0.0001). That ISIs were largely independent of stimulation intensity suggested that the burst pattern was not intrinsically generated in the FS cell but was imposed on it by extrinsic inputs. Consistent with this conclusion, reducing the light level resulted in some cells in spikes dropping out sporadically, revealing apparent subthreshold EPSPs that remained aligned with the temporal structure of the burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, guidelines). That EPSPs elicit FS spikes with such high precision is consistent with the properties of excitatory synaptic inputs onto FS interneurons in neocortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Geiger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Galarreta and Hestrin, 2001</xref>).</p><p>What were the temporal relationships between FS spike bursts, thalamocortical volleys, and ripplets? We plotted all FS spike times in our dataset as a histogram and then modeled each spike order as a Gaussian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Overlaying Gaussians representing FS spikes with those representing thalamocortical volleys from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>) revealed a close temporal relationship between the first FS spike and the initial thalamocortical volley, with the postsynaptic spike following the presynaptic volley at a latency of 0.8 ms, consistent with a monosynaptic response. Later FS spikes, however, actually preceded the closest presynaptic volley, consistent with the conclusion above that the additional thalamocortical volleys did not drive the postsynaptic bursts in a 1:1 manner. In contrast, overlaying the distributions of FS spikes and LFP transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) revealed a 1:1 relationship between these events, however, with the two oscillations almost exactly out of phase: each ripplet transient lagged behind the corresponding FS spike peak by 0.44–0.54 of a cycle, translating to 1.0–1.3 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FS cells synchronized their firing with near-zero lag and submillisecond precision</title><p>Given the precise temporal relationship between FS spikes and the population activity reflected as ripplets, one would expect different FS cells in the same barrel to fire in tight synchrony with each other. We therefore examined intra-barrel FS-FS temporal relationships by simultaneous paired recordings. Indeed, when stimulated by a light pulse, simultaneously recorded FS-FS pairs exhibited highly precise spike synchrony. In the two example pairs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, the peaks of the first three spikes in each burst aligned to within 0.1–0.3 ms between the two cells. To quantify the magnitude and precision of pairwise synchrony, we used the Jitter-Based Synchrony Index (JBSI), which is a normalized measure of spike-spike synchrony in excess of that expected by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Agmon, 2012</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). Synchrony is defined as the fraction of spikes co-occurring within a predetermined ‘synchrony window’ (SW), and chance synchrony is the average synchrony remaining after shifting each spike in one train by a random jitter ≤J, J = 2·SW. When calculated for decreasing SW values, the JBSI typically increases to a maximum and then precipitously drops off to zero, as J falls below the intrinsic precision of the system and the applied jitter no longer disrupts the pairwise synchrony. We defined ‘pairwise precision’ as the smallest SW value with JBSI &gt; 0.5. Since neurons can maintain a precise temporal relationship even when they fire at non-zero time lags relative to each other, one can extend this analysis by calculating the JBSI for a range of virtual lags (shifts) of one spike train relative to the other, analogous to a classical cross-correlation histogram; we defined ‘pairwise lag’ as the virtual lag for which the JBSI was maximized. The full analysis can be represented as a two-dimensional matrix in which the JBSI is plotted as a function of the two parameters, SW and virtual lag, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> for the FS pair shown in panel A.

We recorded from RS cells in whole-cell, current-clamp, and voltage-clamp modes to reveal the timing of spikes and synaptic events, respectively, in relation to ripplets and FS bursts. In current-clamp mode, RS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, blue traces) responded to brief light pulses with a large depolarization (up to 15–20 mV above resting potential), crested by a series of 3–5 apparent EPSPs (slanted arrowheads) and typically giving rise to 1–2 spikes. Of 55 RS cells recorded in current-clamp mode and stimulated at a near-maximal light level, 73% fired at least one, but never more than two spikes/stimulus; the rest either remained subthreshold (11%) or occasionally fired three or more spikes (16%). Spikes evoked by near-maximal stimulus levels were mostly highly precise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left), but spikes arising from late EPSPs were often of lower reliability and occasionally failed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right, vertical arrowhead). Spikes evoked by low light levels would often switch sporadically between EPSPs, a pattern we refer to as ‘EPSP hopping’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left, inset). To examine phase relationships between RS spikes and ripplets, we recorded in current-clamp mode from 10 RS cells (from 10 animals) simultaneously with the LFP. As indicated by the vertical guidelines in the two example records in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, peaks of spikes and of apparent EPSPs in RS cells occurred close to and usually slightly before the LFP negative peaks, that is, in-phase with ripplets.

We then assigned a phase angle to each of the 28 FS spikes and 13 RS spikes observed in these experiments by interpolating its time of peak between the nearest ripplet trough and peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The phase angles of the two cell types were nonoverlapping, with FS spikes occurring at a median phase angle of 26<sup>o</sup> (i.e. slightly past the trough; 10–90th percentile range: (–14)–82<sup>o</sup>, translating to a range of 0.65 ms), and RS spikes occurring at a median phase angle of 161<sup>o</sup> (i.e. slightly before the peak; 10–90th percentile range: 145–187<sup>o</sup>, translating to a range of ~0.3 ms). Thus, on average, FS spikes preceded RS spikes by ~135<sup>o</sup> or ~0.9 ms. While this appears inconsistent with the order of firing during hippocampal ripples, in which FS cells lag behind pyramidal cells by about 100<sup>o</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hájos et al., 2013</xref>), 100<sup>o</sup> of a 180 Hz ripple oscillation amounts to 1.5 ms. Given the 2.4 ms ripplet period, the 0.9 ms delay between L4 FS and RS spikes means that FS spikes (other than the first) occurred 1.5 ms after RS spikes, exactly as in the hippocampus. Notably, a 1.5 ms lag is precisely the time it takes for RS cells to generate monosynaptic EPSPs in FS cells, and for postsynaptic FS cells to reach threshold and fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Galarreta and Hestrin, 2001</xref>). Thus, this analysis is consistent with a model by which FS spikes (other than the first, which was clearly driven by thalamocortical excitation) were directly driven by excitation from neighboring RS cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>FS spikes and ripplet troughs were phase-locked to EPSC-IPSC alternations in RS cells</title><p>To examine the temporal relationships between FS and RS cell responses directly, we performed simultaneous recordings from six FS-RS pairs (from four animals), switching the RS recording mode between current and voltage clamp to reveal both spikes and postsynaptic currents, respectively. When in voltage clamp, we held the RS cells between –50 and –55 mV to distinguish between EPSCs (negative deflections) and IPSCs (positive deflections). We also tested recorded pairs for direct synaptic connections between them. Two example pairs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, with 10 superimposed traces of FS spike bursts (red) and simultaneously recorded RS postsynaptic currents (blue), and with sequentially recorded RS spikes in the upper trace. Note that the pair in panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> is illustrated at two different stimulus intensities. The voltage-clamped RS responses revealed a sequence of regularly alternating EPSCs and IPSCs (E’s and I’s, onsets marked by filled and hollow arrowheads, respectively). These E-I sequences were tightly synchronized between neighboring RS cells in a given barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The dashed vertical guidelines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref> are aligned with FS spikes peaks and demonstrate that each FS spike occurred immediately following the onset of an EPSC and before the onset of an IPSC in the RS cell.

Comparing the total charge transfer (the area under the curve) between the voltage-clamp records of RS cells A and B reveals a net inhibitory response in A (positive total charge) and a net excitatory response in B (negative total charge); this large variability in excitatory-to-inhibitory ratio between RS cells was representative of our sample (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and is also observed in hippocampal pyramidal neurons during ex vivo ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ellender et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hájos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Phase-locking of E-I alternations in regular-spiking (RS) cells to fast-spiking (FS) spikes and ripplets.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Superimposed FS spike bursts (red), simultaneously recorded voltage-clamped excitatory postsynaptic currents–inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSC-IPSC) alternations (middle traces, blue) and sequentially recorded current-clamp responses from paired RS cells (upper traces, blue), evoked by 2 ms light pulses (cyan bars under red traces) in two example FS-RS pairs.

The median FS spike phase angle was 59<sup>o</sup> (10–90th percentile range: 5–106<sup>o</sup>). Therefore, given the 2.4 ms oscillation period, each FS spike occurred about 0.4 ms after the onset of an EPSC in the RS cell and 0.8 ms before the onset of an IPSC in the same RS cell. The most parsimonious interpretation for these temporal relationships is that RS and FS cells received a barrage of shared EPSPs at the ripplet frequency; these EPSPs elicited short-latency (0.4 ms) spikes in the FS cells, and FS spike volleys, in turn, elicited IPSPs in RS cells after a 0.8 ms monosynaptic delay. As described above, RS spikes occurred, on average, 0.9 ms after the previous FS spike volley, implying that RS cells reached firing threshold nearly simultaneously with the arrival of a wavefront of inhibition, leaving a very narrow ‘window of opportunity’ for RS cells to fire. The earliest cohort of RS cells to reach spike threshold fired while ‘laggards,’ cells slightly slower to reach threshold, were preempted from firing by the incoming IPSP volley. This explains why only a fraction of RS cells fired on any given cycle and also explains how synchronous RS firing was maintained from one cycle to the next.</p><p>To further test the role of inhibition in ripplet oscillations we blocked fast inhibition locally, with the GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist gabazine applied from an extracellular patch pipette placed in the same barrel.

An example recording is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, with the averaged voltage-clamped traces from the RS neuron (blue) below the averaged LFP (magenta). The vertical guidelines demonstrate that the troughs of the ripplet waveform were aligned with the onset of EPSCs in the RS cell. Plotting ripplet troughs against EPSC onsets in eight RS cells recorded simultaneously with the LFP (in eight slices from four animals) demonstrated the close temporal correspondence between the extracellular troughs and the onsets of intracellular EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that population EPSCs in RS cells were a major contributor to the current sinks underlying the LFP transients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We describe here transient (&lt;25 ms), ultrafast (~400 Hz) network oscillations, which we refer to as ‘ripplets,’ elicited in thalamorecipient cortical layers by brief (as short as 1 ms) optogenetic stimulation of thalamocortical axons and terminals. The oscillation was reflected in the extracellular voltage (the LFP) as 2–5 negative waves that immediately followed the initial current sink generated by the thalamocortical volley but were dependent on postsynaptic activity within L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In whole-cell intracellular recordings, inhibitory FS cells fired a highly reproducible burst of 3–6 spikes at the ripplet frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), with spike peaks aligned with LFP troughs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). As revealed by pairwise recordings, FS cells fired in exquisitely precise, sub-millisecond synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Excitatory RS cells mostly fired 1–2 spikes per ripplet, which, as a population, were temporally offset from FS spikes, preceding each FS spike (except the first) by ~1.5 ms and aligned with ripplet peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Voltage-clamp recordings at an intermediate holding potential revealed a precise, alternating sequence of EPSCs and IPSCs in RS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), phase-locked to ripplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and synchronized between neighboring RS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). On average, each FS spike followed an RS EPSC at short (0.4 ms) latency and preceded an RS IPSC by 0.8 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that FS spikes were elicited by EPSPs shared with the excitatory cells, and in turn evoked monosynaptic IPSPs in excitatory cells.</p><p>Taken together, these observations suggest the following synaptic mechanisms for ripplet generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The highly synchronous, optogenetically evoked thalamocortical volley set in motion a cascade of ‘spike packets’ in subsets of L4 excitatory cells, each packet triggering the next one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), similar to feedforward ‘synfire chains’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeles, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Diesmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Mehring et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barral et al., 2019</xref>) except that a given excitatory cell could fire in more than one packet. Although only a subset of all RS cells fired on any given cycle, the strength, reliability, and high prevalence of excitatory RS-RS synapses within L4 barrels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Feldmeyer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Petersen and Sakmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Schubert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Kameda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Koelbl et al., 2015</xref>) ensured that this subset was sufficient to extend the oscillation by one more cycle. The 2.4 ms period of the oscillation was determined by the interval between packets, which was the sum of the synaptic delay (from RS spike to EPSP onset in a postsynaptic RS cell) and the rise time (from EPSP onset to spike in the postsynaptic RS cell). The initial thalamocortical volley, as well as each subsequent RS spike packet, elicited highly synchronous FS spike volleys, supported by the strong TC→FS and RS→FS connectivity in L4 of barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Simons and Carvell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agmon and Connors, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Swadlow et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Galarreta and Hestrin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Porter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Bruno and Simons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Beierlein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Bruno and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Inoue and Imoto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Sun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Kameda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Hu and Agmon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). The delay from an RS spike volley to the evoked FS spike was ~1.5 ms, significantly shorter than the oscillation period, because synaptic latencies, EPSC rise times, and spike rise times are all faster in FS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). This left a gap of 0.9 ms between the FS spike volley and the next RS volley, just enough time for FS cells to elicit a wavefront of feedforward IPSPs in RS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This inhibitory wavefront coincided with the rising phase of the RS spikes, too late to block the earliest spikes but just in time to preempt any laggard RS cells from firing. In this manner, FS cells enforced RS firing synchrony and thereby also FS spike synchrony in the next cycle. Only a fraction of all excitatory cells escaped this feedforward inhibitory control and fired on any given cycle, enough to elicit the next cycle but not enough for the excitatory feedforward cascade to turn into a paroxysmal chain reaction. The number of excitatory cells firing likely declined with each cycle, possibly because high-frequency activity suppresses excitatory synapses more than inhibitory ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1998</xref>), until the oscillation died out.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of ripplet generation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the layer 4 circuit, illustrating one representative fast-spiking (FS) interneuron and three regular spiking (RS) cells at four successive time points, from left to right, representing the four cycles of the oscillation.

For clarity, only connections from one RS cell are depicted. A synchronous thalamocortical (TC) volley excites FS and RS cells in parallel; FS cells fire ~0.9 ms earlier because of the faster kinetics of their excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spikes. RS cells generate an excitatory feedforward cascade of successive spike volleys that elicit additional FS spike volleys.

While FS cells are a critical component of the circuit, they do not act as independent pacemakers, and direct FS-FS interactions, chemical or electrical, may not be a necessary feature (see below). Several aspects of this model are at odds with currently proposed models of hippocampal ripples (see below), and this could reflect real differences between the two types of oscillations. Nevertheless, the strong phenomenological similarities between neocortical ripplets and hippocampal ripples (see below) suggest that optogenetically evoked ripplets may be a uniquely accessible model system for deciphering the cellular, synaptic, and network mechanisms underlying other fast and ultrafast neocortical and hippocampal oscillations, mechanisms that to date remain elusive.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Previous observations of ripplet-like oscillations in the neocortex</title><p>Although not nearly as widely reported or intensively studied as hippocampal ripples, neocortical ripplet-like oscillations have been observed previously in both humans and animals, either in response to electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, or in response to strong, punctate sensory stimuli that are likely to activate afferents in a highly synchronous manner. In humans, noninvasive EEG and MEG scalp recordings revealed fast, transient oscillations (~600 Hz, 10–15 ms duration) in response to electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, riding over the N20 peak, which reflects the monosynaptic cortical response (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Curio, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hashimoto, 2000</xref>). Multi-electrode MEG studies localized the source of these fast oscillations to the primary somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hashimoto et al., 1996</xref>). In a combined EEG and single-unit recording study in awake monkeys, 600 Hz LFP oscillations were found to occur in phase with bursts or single spikes in putative pyramidal cells, in response to electrical stimulation of the median nerve; spike bursts were also observed in response to tactile stimulation (tap) of the finger or hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Baker et al., 2003</xref>). Similar MEG oscillations were observed in piglets, in response to electrical stimulation of the snout, and were shown to follow at short latency thalamocortical volleys recorded in cortical layer 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ikeda et al., 2002</xref>). Electrical stimulation of the thalamus elicited 400–600 Hz LFP oscillations in cortical layers 4–6 in the rat, in phase with extracellular RS and FS spikes and bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Kandel and Buzsáki, 1997</xref>). Probably most reminiscent of the current study, Barth and coworkers observed brief (~13 ms) periods of 350–400 Hz EEG oscillations in barrel cortex of both awake and ketamine-anesthetized rats, in response to short, rapid-onset displacements of single or multiple whiskers; similar oscillations were also observed in auditory cortex in response to sound clicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Jones and Barth, 1999</xref>). In a follow-up intracellular study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Jones et al., 2000</xref>), the same authors report ~500 Hz FS spike bursts in response to whisker deflections, with individual spikes aligned to the troughs in the extracellular field potential. RS cells typically fired 1–2 spikes interspersed with subthreshold events, which occurred at the frequency of the field potential oscillations, precisely as we observed here.</p><p>That ripplet-like oscillations have been observed in vivo in response to both sensory and peripheral nerve stimulation, in two primary cortical areas (somatosensory and auditory) and in four different species (humans, monkey, pig, rat), supports the conclusion that the ripplets we observed in yet another species, the mouse, were not an artifact of our ex vivo preparation or optogenetic stimulation, but a manifestation of a ubiquitous intrinsic property of sensory cortices – their propensity for generating ultrafast oscillations in response to strong, synchronous activation of their afferents. In our experiments, the light pulse likely activated with a high degree of synchrony most, if not all thalamocortical terminals impinging on the recorded neurons. Strong synchrony is a well-documented feature of the sensory responses of thalamocortical neurons in vivo, and the degree of thalamic synchrony may be the most important determinant of the strength of the downstream cortical response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Alonso et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Pinto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Roy and Alloway, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Temereanca and Simons, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Bruno and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Whitmire et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Wright et al., 2021</xref>). Precisely what degree of thalamocortical synchrony is required for ripplet generation, and what type and intensity of sensory stimuli elicit such synchrony in vivo, is yet to be determined.</p><p>If ripplets are an intrinsic feature of sensory neocortex, why have they not been more widely reported in vivo? A technical reason could be the sensitivity of these oscillations to inhalation anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Jones and Barth, 1999</xref>), but it could also reflect the fact that most in vivo studies do not record or report LFPs. Without LFP recordings at a high cut-off frequency, ripplets may only be evident in extracellular recordings as bursts in putative FS units, and only if such units are identified and separated from the majority RS units. Such FS bursts have indeed been observed in unanesthetized animals. In awake rabbits, putative FS cells fire ultrafast (&gt;600 Hz) bursts of 3–7 spikes in response to electrical stimulation of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Swadlow, 1995</xref>), reminiscent of the FS bursts we describe here. FS cells in sedated rats fire, on average, four spikes/stimulus in response to high-velocity whisker deflections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Lee and Simons, 2004</xref>). In awake, head-fixed mice engaged in an object localization task, FS cells often fire short-latency, high-frequency bursts following active whisker touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Yu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Yu et al., 2019</xref>).

Similar to CA1 pyramidal cells during ripples, individual excitatory cells did not fire on every ripplet cycle, although in our slices the majority of L4 RS cells fired at least one spike per ripplet event, whereas only about 10% of CA1 pyramidal cells fire during a given ripple event in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Buzsáki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Ylinen et al., 1995</xref>), and even a smaller percentage fire ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ellender et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hájos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Hofer et al., 2015</xref>).

There is also similarity in the triggering mechanism, which in the hippocampus is a volley or burst of volleys in the main excitatory input to CA1, the Schafer collaterals, whereas ripplets were elicited by a spike volley in the main input to the neocortex, thalamocortical axons. Moreover, in the hippocampus the triggering input does not impose its own burst frequency on the target and only acts as a source of strong excitation, and the oscillation is generated de novo in the target structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>), just as we observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Several competing models are proposed in the literature, assigning different weights to pyramidal–pyramidal (PYR-PYR), pyramidal–interneuron (PYR-INT), and interneuron–interneuron (INT-INT) connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Traub and Bibbig, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Taxidis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Traub et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Malerba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Donoso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Braun and Memmesheimer, 2022</xref>). Recent experimental and computational studies lean in favor of a ‘hybrid’ PYR-INT-INT model, suggesting that FS interneurons act as the central pacemakers of the ripple oscillation, and that tonic excitation from pyramidal neurons is needed only to keep interneurons sufficiently depolarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Schlingloff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Stark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Ramirez-Villegas et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, we propose that neocortical ripplet oscillations were based on what may be considered a PYR-PYR-INT mechanism, in that phasic excitatory inputs originating from local RS cells were driving the oscillation on a cycle-by-cycle basis, and that FS interneurons were followers, rather than leaders, in these oscillations. This conclusion is based on our voltage-clamp data that revealed regularly alternating, ripplet-entrained postsynaptic E-I sequences in RS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B and D</xref>). Our data also showed that EPSCs in RS cells immediately preceded spikes in simultaneously recorded FS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), implying that FS firing was driven by rhythmic excitatory inputs shared with the RS cells and not by tonic depolarization. In turn, FS spike volleys generated antiphasic IPSCs in RS cells, and this precisely timed inhibition was likely critical for maintaining synchronous RS (and thereby also FS) firing from cycle to cycle. Notably, similar sequences of antiphasic, ripple-locked EPSCs and IPSCs were also observed in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Maier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hájos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Schlingloff et al., 2014</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gan et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, it is difficult to see how such precisely timed, phasic excitation would <italic>not</italic> be a driving factor in the entrainment of FS spikes to the ripplet (or ripple) oscillation, even if additional, interneuron-autonomous mechanisms (see next section) contributed to FS-FS synchrony.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The role of electrical and chemical FS-FS connections</title><p>FS cells in the rodent neocortex and hippocampus are known to be coupled by electrical synapses. These are prominent in juvenile rats, with coupling coefficients of 5–10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Gibson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Otsuka and Kawaguchi, 2013</xref>). In the mouse, however, electrical coupling is much weaker, with reported coupling coefficients of ~1.5% in juvenile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Hu and Agmon, 2015</xref>) and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Galarreta and Hestrin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Meyer et al., 2002</xref>) mice, although one study in juvenile mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Deans et al., 2001</xref> found stronger coupling. In our current dataset of subadult and adult animals, the coupling coefficient between paired L4 FS cells, when detectable, was &lt;1%. Interestingly, a recent ultrastructural study of gap junctions in barrel cortex has identified a subset of PV interneurons (‘Type 1’), with somata located more centrally in the barrel and dendritic arbors fully contained within the barrel, which do not make gap junctions with each other but do make them with PV cells closer to the barrel periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Shigematsu et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that our paired recordings, which were biased towards neighboring FS cells, preferentially sampled unconnected type 1 pairs. Even so, the pairs we recorded were exquisitely synchronized. Our data therefore suggest that electrical coupling did not play a major role in the submillisecond FS-FS synchrony we observed and by extension in the generation of ripplets. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies in connexin 36 (Cx36) knockout mice, in which FS-FS electrical coupling is abolished but hippocampal ripples are mostly unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Hormuzdi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Maier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Buhl et al., 2003</xref>).

In our current dataset, only 1/3 of the recorded FS-FS pairs were connected chemically, whereas all pairs exhibited sub-millisecond firing synchrony during ripplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This argues against a major role for inhibitory-to-inhibitory synapses in this synchrony, although we cannot rule out the possibility that such synchrony is transitive; that is, if A and B are synchronized by mutual inhibition, and so are B and C, then A and C will be synchronized even if they are not directly connected. Nevertheless, the most likely generator of submillisecond FS-FS synchrony during ripplets remain shared excitatory inputs. Similar conclusions were reached about sharp synchrony between FS interneurons in the awake rabbit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Swadlow et al., 1998</xref>) and during cortical UP states in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Neske and Connors, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Ideas and speculations: The functional significance of ripplets</title><p>What function do ripplets serve in cortical sensory processing, if any? One possibility is that ripplets signal in a binary mode, ‘Yes’ or ‘No,’ that a highly salient sensory event has occurred. In addition, the spike sequences of excitatory cells during ripplets could provide increased bandwidth for transmission and storage of specific information about this event. Similar to the encoding scheme proposed for gamma/theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Lisman and Buzsáki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref>) or for odor coding in the insect olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Laurent and Davidowitz, 1994</xref>), ripplets could provide a temporal framework for clustering spikes into discrete time bins, each ripplet cycle representing a time bin of ~2.5 ms. While FS spikes occur in every bin, excitatory neurons fire more sparsely, thus generating a binary sequence of 1’s (spike) and 0’s (no spike), with different neurons generating different sequences. Moreover, these binary sequences may vary in tune with the temporal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arabzadeh et al., 2005</xref>) or spatial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Andermann et al., 2004</xref>) variations in the activity pattern of primary sensory, brainstem, and thalamocortical neurons along the chain of activity from periphery to cortex, thus encoding specific information about the sensory event. The assignment of a precise spike sequence to a neuron, rather than merely a total spike count, more than doubles the amount of information that can be conveyed by the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Arabzadeh et al., 2006</xref>). The amount of information depends on the temporal resolution of the spike code, and it is therefore quite striking that three different studies of temporal coding in rat somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ghazanfar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Panzeri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Foffani et al., 2004</xref>) found that maximal information content is achieved when spikes are aggregated in time bins of 2–3 ms, which is exactly a ripplet cycle.</p><p>How will the information encoded in these putative binary patterns be read-out by downstream cortical targets? L4 excitatory cells make synapses on basal dendrites of L2/3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Feldmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Lübke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>), and at least some L2/3 pyramidal neurons are tuned to precise spatiotemporal sequences of synapse activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Branco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Branco and Häusser, 2011</xref>). One can therefore envision that a given spike pattern in L4 cells will specifically activate those L2/3 pyramidal cells that are tuned to this exact spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic inputs. In this manner, ripplets can transform a temporal code representing a sensory feature, for example, texture, into a spatial code, with different ensembles of L2/3 pyramidal cells encoding different textures. Such ensembles can stabilize by Hebbian or spike time-dependent plasticity mechanisms and form ‘engrams,’ long-term assemblies that can later be activated to recall the same sensory events that initially shaped them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2019</xref>). That ripplets participate in the encoding of sensory information into transient or stable ensembles is a testable hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Summary and future directions</title><p>Our experiments revealed the synaptic interactions underlying ripplets – transient, ultrafast network oscillations evoked in the somatosensory cortex by a brief, synchronous thalamocortical volley. Previously observed in human EEG/MEG recordings and in a small number of in vivo animal studies, ripplet-like oscillations in sensory cortices may be much more common and widespread than currently recognized. The robustness and precise reproducibility of optogenetically evoked ripplets, and the accessibility of our ex vivo experimental model to recording and imaging and to pharmacological, chemogenetic, and optogenetic manipulations, will allow future studies to examine the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of ripplets in exquisite detail, shedding light not only on this particular phenomenon but also on the synaptic circuitry of the thalamorecipient cortical layers in general. This will accelerate development of detailed, biologically grounded computational models of the neocortical network; indeed, the ability to generate ripplet oscillations in response to a synchronous thalamocortical volley can now be used as a stringent ‘reality check’ for existing models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Banitt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Markram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Hass et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Gouwens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Borges et al., 2022</xref>). Studies of neocortical ripplets are also likely to shed new light on the synaptic mechanisms underlying similar oscillations in other brain areas, such as hippocampal ripples. Beyond mechanisms, the role of ripplets in encoding and transmitting sensory information is a highly intriguing topic awaiting future investigations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, both sexes)</td><td align="left" valign="top">KN282</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC)</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="top">036680-UCD</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gensat.org/cre.jsp">http://www.gensat.org/cre.jsp</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse, <italic>M. musculus</italic>, both sexes)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Ai32</td><td align="left" valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="top">RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX">:IMSR_JAX</ext-link>: 024109</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/024109">https://www.jax.org/strain/024109</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse, <italic>M. musculus</italic>, both sexes)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Ai9</td><td align="left" valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="top">RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX">:IMSR_JAX</ext-link>: 007909</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/007909">https://www.jax.org/strain/007909</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">CNQX</td><td align="left" valign="top">Tocris</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat. no. 1045/1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">20 μM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">D-AP5 (APV)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Tocris</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat. no. 0106/1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">30 μM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Gabazine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.tocris.com/products/sr-95531-hydrobromide_1262">SR 95531 hydrobromide</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Tocris</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat. no. 1262/10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">20 μM</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animals used in this study were housed at the AAALAC-accredited WVU Lab Animal Research Facility according to institutional, federal, and AAALAC guidelines.

Upon break-in, cells were routinely tested by a standardized family of incrementing 600-ms-long intracellular current steps in both negative and positive directions. Upon strong depolarization, FS cells invariably reached steady-state firing rates of 150–300 Hz and their spike trains showed no or little frequency adaptation, while RS cells typically fired an initial fast doublet, followed by a slower, steady-state firing at &lt;50 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In dual-recording experiments, synaptic connectivity was routinely tested in both directions by stimulating one cell with a 10–20 Hz train of brief suprathreshold current steps and recording the response in the paired cell (at resting potential if the putative synapse was excitatory, or at –50 mV if inhibitory).

The JBSI is the difference between the observed and chance synchrony, that is, the magnitude of synchrony destroyed by the jitter, multiplied by a normalization factor β which limits the JBSI to values between 1 (highest possible synchrony) to -1 (lowest possible synchrony), with 0 indicating purely chance synchrony.

the cortex evoked by optogenetic stimulation of thalamocortical afferents in ex vivo brain slices. The authors proposed that these oscillations correlate with sensory stimulation and may be relevant for the perception of relevant sensory inputs and they combined ex-vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, local field potential (LFP) recordings, and optogenetic activation of thalamic afferents to generate ripple-like extracellular waveforms in the cortex, referred to as &quot;ripplets.&quot; The authors described the sequences of RS and FS neuron discharge and how they phase-locked to the ripplet, providing a model for the cellular mechanism generating the ripplet. The authors also cited the literature about ultrafast oscillations and carefully compared the novel ripplets to the well-known hippocampal ripples.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82412.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Cheong</surname><given-names>Eunji</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01wjejq96</institution-id><institution>Yonsei University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Huguenard</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Acsady</surname><given-names>Laszlo</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01jsgmp44</institution-id><institution>Institute of Experimental Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>Hungary</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.02.506344">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.02.506344v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John R Huguenard (Reviewer #2); Laszlo Acsady (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Based on the attached reviewers' comments, all the reviewers agree that this manuscript is of potential interest to the audience studying the mechanisms of high-frequency cortical oscillations and their role in sensory information transfer. All three reviewers also agree that the proposed method provides a successful ex vivo model to study the ultrafast oscillation-mediated circuitry and cellular mechanisms and that the data reasonably support most of the claims by the authors in this manuscript.</p><p>However, all three reviewers also raised concerns in common about what extent the data could be interpreted based on the present data.</p><p>Firstly, they raised the concern that the experiments claiming the spread of phasic activity from Layer 4 RS to Layer 5 FS cells can not be accepted as entirely conclusive as it is at the current state. In more detail, the horizontal cut severed the L4 RS to L5 FS connections and many TC inputs to the L5 FS apical dendrites and the axons of L4 FS cells to L5 FS cells which can be pivotal in the translaminar spread. The observation that L5 FS spike bursts decrease after cutting the L4/L5 boundary could be interpreted in other ways. The current interpretation of data seems overly extended because it does not necessarily represent cellular and synaptic activities that are phase-locked with the ripplets observed in L4. As it is outside the main scope of the paper, it could be toned down or dropped. Alternatively, this part should be redone with appropriate control experiments with the angled slice-cutting methods and the experiments suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>The second common concern is the interpretation of nearby FS synchrony induced by TC activation. The authors described the phase-locked responses of FS and RS cells with local ripple oscillations to optogenetic activation and highly synchronized FS-FS firing by eliminating electrical gap-junction and inhibitory synaptic connections to this synchrony. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that common excitatory inputs to FS and RS cells in L4 would be essential to generate these local ripplets. However, it interferes with the ability to follow the logical flow for biding other findings of phase-locking responses of FS and RS cells in ripplet oscillations in L4. This issue may be addressed by rephrasing and stating that Opto activation of TC creates highly synchronized inputs to the L4, which might further help the ultrafast synchrony.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, the authors understated the GABAergic mechanism by FS cells, whereas the highly (and artificial) synchronous stimulation of many TC axons and terminals would activate FS cells which are GABAergic neurons.</p><p>Thirdly, as the authors proposed a circuit model, it would be ideal that the authors try to perform in silico analysis using the suggested model to explore the function of thalamocortical axons on the fast-spiking and regular spiking neurons to support their circuit model. However, if it takes too much effort to test an in silico model, it can be considered as an option for the authors.</p><p>There are more major concerns raised by the reviewers below, which should be addressed appropriately before we can consider publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Should further data analysis, figures revision, and text rationale allow you to address these criticisms, we would be happy to review a revised manuscript.</p><p>In the meantime, we hope you will find our referees' comments helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact us if there is anything you would like to discuss.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors should consider the logical flow when presenting the synchrony of the FS-FS spike burst. It would strongly support the main idea of the manuscript if the authors rephrase or/and rearrange the corresponding text and data.</p><p>2) Please provide detailed information on the viral vector of JAWS used for the experiment of suppressing L4 RS cell firing in the methods section, and also present expression image and spike data in figures to support the idea for the subsequent experiment performed in L5.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) While the authors are generally cautious in their interpretation of the optogenetic approach and how realistic it might be, we think that this issue deserves more direct discussion. In some ways, the high degree of nearby FS synchrony induced by TC optical activation is not at all surprising given what is already known about the potency of TC inputs onto FS cells (the senior author's own work and that of many other labs), and the highly (and artificial) synchronous stimulation of many TC axons and terminals onto FS cells. The rare literature examples of high-frequency sensory evoked responses that the authors cite are arguably not simple sensory activity at all (electrical stimulation in the periphery or thalamus, both of which might lead to abnormal sensory recruitment.</p><p>2) The results regarding the propagation of high-frequency events to layer 5 are arguably outside the main scope of the paper, and could potentially be dropped. As is, many controls that have not been provided would need to be added. For example, demonstrating a complete lack of optogenetic effects in layer 4 with Jaws to rule out that there might actually be low levels of expression that could contribute to the results. In addition, ruling out the interaction between the blue and red light stimuli in the two pathways is required, as the spectral overlap for excitation spectrum is not as clean as one would need to unambiguously interpret these results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In order to prove the critical role of FS-FS interactions in timing the oscillation the authors may consider GABA-A receptor blockers and/or optogenetic inhibition of PV cells.</p><p>2) To gain further insights into the excitatory background of the oscillation I would propose performing RS-RS pair recordings. In this configuration, the kinetics and strength of their interactions could be measured to establish whether this is fast and strong enough to provide a drive for the oscillation. RS data similar to FS cells shown in Figure 2 (variable stimulation intensity vs jitter) could also help to elucidate the mechanisms. Using voltage-clamp experiments in RS cells could help to resolve the origin of the excitatory drive of the oscillation (TC or RS-RS interactions). Optimally experimental work would be coupled with in silico simulations to test which network activity may underly the oscillation.</p><p>3) In order to make predictions for future research concerning the role of this ultrafast oscillation it would be advisable to test its postsynaptic effects on targets that do not receive direct thalamic inputs (i.e. upper layer 2/3 cells). This would not only allow more insights into the generation of the oscillation but could test whether the oscillation is indeed able to select a subset of L2/3 cells as suggested. For a translaminar spread to layer 3 measuring the strength and variability of the oscillation in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, which are not directly contacted by thalamic inputs, would greatly enhance the predictive power of the paper for future research.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised manuscript titled &quot;Ultrafast (400 Hz) network oscillations induced in middle cortical layers by optogenetic activation of thalamocortical axons.&quot; We appreciate the effort you have made to improve your manuscript, and we have carefully reviewed it.</p><p>We are pleased to see that the authors have addressed most of the comments made by the reviewers. The manuscript has been improved, and the unnecessary distracting parts have been removed, resulting in a smoother flow of data. However, we would like to draw your attention to a few critical comments that still need to be addressed.</p><p>Firstly, the authors should include a discussion on how the strong optogenetic approaches used in this paper might or might not be relevant to the actual sensory processing in the brain circuit, given that the current data is obtained from brain slices and artificially synchronous wide-field optogenetic activation. We believe that this is an essential point to address, and we encourage you to include an appropriate discussion in the manuscript.</p><p>Secondly, the authors should discuss in more detail the potential functional consequences and function of ultrafast brain oscillation in vivo, given that this manuscript focuses on the cellular nature of high-frequency oscillation in vitro. This is an excellent suggestion, and we believe that including a discussion on this topic will enhance the impact of your manuscript.</p><p>We appreciate the valuable contribution that your manuscript has made, and we believe that addressing these comments on functional significance will further improve the quality and impact of your work. We have appended the full comments from the reviewers below for your reference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>We agree that this is a carefully controlled study that examines the mechanisms through which very high-frequency LFP activity can be evoked in sensory cortical slices. The recordings are elegant, with combined extracellular and multi-intracellular data, and high quality and the results clearly lead to the conclusion that this in vitro activity is driven by RS cell firing.</p><p>However, regarding original major point #1, we do not share the opinion of the authors that these are well linked to naturalistic sensory stimuli. In all the papers cited to support this, the main means of activating cortical response is electrical shocks either delivered directly to peripheral sensory nerves (non-human primates, humans), or to the snout (piglets). Baker found LFP wavelets with electrical shocks to peripheral nerves but was not surprised by this (their last paragraph), as it presumably results from a particular form of artificial activation. They did find multiple spikes (perhaps consistent with LFP wavelets) with tactile sensory responses, but notably did not observe LFP correlates to these more naturalistic stimuli. Jones found wavelets, particularly with simultaneous stimulation of multiple vibrissae, but also looked at more controlled stimuli of multiple whiskers. This last paper is the only one that comes close to reporting cortical high-frequency wavelets with what might be considered natural sensory.</p><p>What the authors might consider &quot;exceptionally salient stimuli&quot; (line 72) is a bit unclear, but if by this they mean response to an electrical shock, we would argue this does indeed result from abnormal sensory recruitment, and presumably would not be part of sensory processing in 99.9% of contexts. The issue is that optogenetic stimulation artificially increases synchrony perhaps even more than electrical peripheral stimulation, as all the infected TC axons are presumably rapidly and synchronously activated by the light stimulus. Thus the abstract, and related text in the introduction and discussion needs to be modified to reflect the proper context. The following abstract statement &quot;At the higher end of the scale, ultrafast (400-600 Hz) oscillations in the somatosensory cortex, in response to peripheral stimulation, were previously observed in human and a handful of animal studies;&quot; should be revised to indicate that most of the literature on this point were obtained in fact with responses to electrical shocks, which are not a proxy for generic (naturalistic?) peripheral sensory stimulation, but rather an artificial means of activating sensory pathways.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors adequately answered my queries concerning the mechanism of generating ultrafast network oscillation via the interacting elements of layer 4 neurons following the activation of their thalamic inputs. Now the comparison with earlier hippocampal data is fair, detailed, and concise. I have no more comments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82412.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Based on the attached reviewers' comments, all the reviewers agree that this manuscript is of potential interest to the audience studying the mechanisms of high-frequency cortical oscillations and their role in sensory information transfer.

We especially took notice of the comment by Reviewer #3 that the L4/L5 cut necessarily truncated the apical dendrites of L5 pyramidal cells, which could have removed some of their thalamocortical inputs and which could have also rendered these cells less responsive to local excitation. We note that this interpretation is still fully consistent with our model, which posits that firing of local excitatory neurons is necessary for pacing FS interneurons at ripplet frequency. Nevertheless, we felt that more work is required to arrive at an unequivocal interpretation of these experiments, and removed the slice cutting experiment from the current manuscript. We still report the observation that L5 FS interneurons fire light-induced bursts at 400 Hz, and provide examples in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second common concern is the interpretation of nearby FS synchrony induced by TC activation.

By either model, blocking GABAergic inhibition would disrupt the oscillation, and therefore blocking GABA receptors would not help distinguish between these two competing models.

The most substantial revisions are in response to Reviewer #2’s concern that we were confounding our optogenetic stimulation with naturalistic, physiological sensory stimuli. To alleviate this concern, we now specify, in the section of the Discussion titled “Previous observations of ripplet-like oscillations in the neocortex”, exactly what type of stimuli were used by these previous studies, making a clear distinction between peripheral nerve stimulation (used in most human and in some animal studies) and punctate tactile and auditory stimuli (used in the Barth studies, whose observations most closely resemble our own). We make a similar distinction in the relevant places in the Abstract and the Introduction.</p><p>As we state throughout the manuscript, ripplets are generated by strong synchronous activation of thalamocortical afferents. How and under what conditions is such synchrony achieved? Clearly, our optogenetic stimulation elicited the required synchrony. The reviewer seems to suggest that such synchrony will rarely, if ever, be achieved in-vivo by naturalistic stimuli, even though ripplets were elicited in the Barth studies by whisker deflections and by auditory clicks, physiological sensory stimuli which, we submit, are regularly encountered in the daily lives of rodents. We therefore take a more prudent stance and suggest in the revised document (line 430) that “Precisely what degree of thalamocortical synchrony is required for ripplet generation, and what type and intensity of sensory stimuli elicit such synchrony in vivo, is yet to be determined.”</p><p>I believe that these revisions adequately address the first point made in the editorial decision letter. The editors then add a second point, suggesting that we “discuss in more detail the potential functional consequences and function of ultrafast brain oscillation in vivo”. The potential function of ripplets was already discussed in detail in the previous submission, in the last section of the Discussion, under “Ideas and speculations: the functional significance of ripplets”. We now made additional textual revisions to this section, which I believe better clarify these ideas and suggest how spike sequences during ripplets can encode information about the sensory event that triggered them. I hope this adequately addresses this request.</p></body></sub-article></article>
