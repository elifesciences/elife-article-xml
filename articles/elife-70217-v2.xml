The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993). The clinical features of HD include motor deficit, psychiatric disturbance, cognitive impairment, and peripheral signs such as weight loss and sleep disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosh and Tabrizi, 2015</xref>). Disease onset, which is dependent on the CAG repeat length, is usually defined by the onset of motor symptoms, although non-motor symptoms are often present many years in advance. The striking neuropathological characteristic of HD, induced by the mutant Htt protein (mHtt), is the progressive brain atrophy mainly in the striatum and cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walker, 2007</xref>). Despite ubiquitously expressed mHtt protein in HD brain, the primary vulnerable neuronal types are medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum and pyramidal neurons in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998</xref>). Widespread mHtt protein aggregation in HD brain tissue is another hallmark of HD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies and Scherzinger, 1997</xref>). While the causative gene for HD was identified 28 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Macdonald, 1993</xref>), there are still no effective disease-modifying therapies available to prevent or delay the progression of this disorder.</p><p>Since the identification of causative gene for HD, a large number of animal models have been generated in a variety of animal species including <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> zebrafish, mouse, rat, sheep, pig, and non-human primates to better elucidate the complex pathogenic mechanisms in HD, and to develop potential therapeutic strategies for HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farshim and Bates, 2018</xref>). Although large animal models, such as pig and non-human primates, are very useful to study HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Niu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sasaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), mouse models still dominate the research field and provide us with valuable tools to investigate the pathogenesis of HD and therapeutic targets.</p><p>To date, there are more than 20 different HD mouse models available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks and Dunnett, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crook and Housman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farshim and Bates, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pouladi et al., 2013</xref>). In general, those genetic mouse models can be classified into three groups based on distinct strategies: the transgenic models carrying human HTT N-terminal fragments with CAG expansions such as R6/1, R6/2, and N171-82Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mangiarini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schilling et al., 1999</xref>), the transgenic full-length mutant HTT models such as YAC128, BACHD, BAC-225Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Slow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wegrzynowicz et al., 2015</xref>), humanized HD mice (Hu97/18 and Hu128/21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Southwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Southwell et al., 2013</xref>), and knock-in models with expanded CAG repeats inserted into a mouse Htt exon 1 such as HdhQ72 and HdhQ150 or into a humanized exon 1 sequence such as HdhQ111, HdhQ140, N160Q, zQ175, and Q175FDN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hickey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levine et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Menalled et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Menalled et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shelbourne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Southwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wheeler et al., 1999</xref>). The existing mouse models mimic some aspects of HD including behavioral disturbances and neuropathological changes of the disease. However, none of them can fully recapitulate human disease, and many of them have spurious phenotypes that are irrelevant or opposite to human conditions. The N-terminal fragment transgenic mice such as R6/2 show a robust phenotype and severely reduced life span, but they demonstrated severe developmental deficits and nonspecific neurodegeneration throughout the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crook and Housman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mangiarini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Southwell et al., 2016</xref>) as well as diabetes, which are not correlated with HD patients. In comparison, full-length transgenic HD mice and Hdh knock-in mice replicate relatively better the neuropathology of HD; however, they display much milder phenotypes and slower progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farshim and Bates, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pouladi et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, YAC128, BACHD, and humanized HD strains (Hu97/18 and Hu128/21) exhibit significant weight gain, opposite to what is seen in HD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Slow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Southwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Southwell et al., 2013</xref>). Another commonly used mouse model zQ175 KI has robust phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2001</xref>); however, it has mouse HTT gene and therefore not suitable for testing the approach of genetically deleting human mutant HTT gene via methods such as CRISPR-Cas9.</p><p>Therefore, despite all the achievements, we are still in search for a new full-length model that not only accurately recapitulates all HD phenotypes, but also without spurious characteristics.</p><p>In light of the clear relationship between PolyQ repeat length and disease onset and severity in both humans and mice, in this study, we engineered a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse model of HD-BAC226Q which expresses full-length human HTT with 226Q encoded by a mixture of CAG-CAA repeat. This 226Q repeat length is smaller than the maximum 250 polyQ in HD patient cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nance et al., 1999</xref>). The CAG-CAA mix will stabilize the polyQ length. Our novel BAC226Q mouse recapitulates a full spectrum of cardinal HD symptoms and pathologies: reduced life span, weight loss, motor and non-motor neurologic phenotypes, selective brain atrophy, striatal neuronal death, mHtt aggregation, and gliosis. It is also important to note that there are no spurious abnormalities identified to date. Therefore, the new HD mouse model will be valuable for studying pathogenic mechanisms and developing therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of BAC226Q transgenic mice</title><p>Transgenic BAC226Q mice were generated and contain the full-length human HTT with 226 CAG-CAA repeats under the control of the endogenous human HTT promoter and regulatory elements. Similar to the BACHD mouse, a mixed CAG-CAA repeat is used to create a stable length of polyglutamine (PolyQ) that is not susceptible to expansion or retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2008</xref>).

Age-matched 11-month BACHD and wild-type mice were used for comparison. As expected, the band for 226Q mutant huntingtin in BAC226Q mouse is at a higher molecular weight than that for 97Q huntingtin in the BACHD mouse.

Both male and female transgenic mice were born in the expected Mendelian ratios with no obvious abnormalities. Both males and females were fertile, but males were preferred for breeding because female animals had a short window of time during which they were able to adequately care for pups. Transgenic BAC226Q mice had significantly reduced lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In both sexes, only 50% of transgenic animals survive past 1 year. The longest surviving transgenic mice were 15 months old when they had to be euthanized due to the end-point condition according to animal welfare requirements. In comparison, non-transgenic littermate controls appeared healthy at 15 months of age. Animal weights were recorded weekly and the results show that HD mice were born normal and gained weight at the same rate as their non-transgenic littermates in the developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In both male and female WT littermates, body weight continuously increased until the 11 months of age; however, BAC226Q exhibited slower weight gain followed by progressive and significant weight loss which resulted in about 40% loss at 11 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Weight loss is a common and serious complication in HD patients, who fail to maintain weight even when caloric intake is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aziz et al., 2008</xref>).

First, overall activity was measured in the open field task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Open field activity is divided into horizontal and vertical components. Horizontal activity is measured by lateral movement around the open field, and vertical activity is measured by rearing movements. At 2 months, HD mice are indistinguishable from non-transgenic littermate controls in both horizontal and vertical activity measures. Horizontal activity is dramatically increased at 4 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but returns to wild-type levels at 10 and 15 months. In contrast, vertical activity of 4-month HD mice has declined to about 20% of the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggests that in addition to their hyperkinesia, the mice cannot rear normally, indicating a loss of motor control. While reduced vertical activity at 4 months may be caused by the increase in horizontal movement, at 10 and 15 months, horizontal activity is reduced to wild-type levels but vertical activity does not recover and becomes even more impaired. These results parallel the biphasic motor symptom progression in HD patients in which early stage involuntary movements become more dystonic in late stages of disease.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Robust, early onset, and progressive motor deficits in BAC226Q mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Horizontal and vertical activities are measured by total beam breaks in 1 hr in the open field.

In lesion models, stereotyped turning occurs in a single direction determined by which hemisphere is lesioned. While BAC226Q mice spent time turning in both directions, and the frequency of turning was significantly increased over controls.

To characterize the non-motor phenotypes in the BAC226Q mice, we subjected 2-month-old BAC226Q mice to several tasks. Testing was performed at 2 months for two reasons: first, these tests depend to some degree on the ability of the animal to move around, thus we need to test at 2 months when there is no measurable motor impairment. Second, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms frequently occur years before the onset of motor symptoms in HD patients. The tests were performed in an ascending order of stress level, from object-in-place memory test, sucrose preference to the most stressful forced swim task. Because there is an evidence of impaired hippocampal function in pre-symptomatic HD patients, we chose a challenging cognitive task with a hippocampus-dependent spatial component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Phillips et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ransome et al., 2012</xref>).

BAC226Q mice, on the other hand, showed no discrimination of the moved objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) despite spent an equal total amount of time exploring the objects in both training and testing sessions.

While non-transgenic littermates preferred the sucrose solution, BAC226Q mice showed significantly reduced preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating an anhedonia-like phenotype typical of depression.

HD patients develop hyperkinetic chorea first and as the disease progresses, hypokinesia and dystonia subsequently. Parallel to the patient’s motor symptom progression, BAC226Q mice have severe hyperkinesia including involuntary choreiform movement by 12–16 weeks and show reduced mobility after 10 months.</p><p>An important but less well-studied aspect of HD is psychiatric and cognitive impairments, which often occur decades before the onset of motor symptoms in HD mutation carriers. In addition to motor dysfunctions, BAC226Q mice show non-motor phenotypes at 2 months, before the onset of motor deficit and neuropathology, which is the same temporal sequence as in patients. Thus BAC226Q is an appropriate and powerful tool to study the mechanisms underlying psychiatric and cognitive deficits.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A model well suited for preclinical investigations</title><p>Several features make BAC226Q well suited for preclinical studies. First, BAC226Q accurately recapitulates HD phenotypes. Therefore, candidate drugs or approaches for disease modification can be tested for their abilities to rescue these highly relevant phenotypes at multiple levels. Second, BAC226Q has normal development and very early onset of phenotypes that are progressive and robust. This provides a long window of observation for testing the efficacy of therapeutic candidates. Third, the remarkable region-specific brain atrophy revealed by high-resolution structural MRI can be used as a biomarker and readout in preclinical studies longitudinally without sacrificing the animals. Fourth, the CAG-CAA mix makes the polyQ length stable between generations and among individuals, which is a critical advantage of consistency for research and especially for drug development, although this model is limited for research in somatic instability and RAN translation, two of the actively studied mechanisms that are suggested to be important for HD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bañez-Coronel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kacher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Swami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabrizi et al., 2020</xref>). Last but not least, BAC226Q has human genomic DNA as the transgene, which is very appropriate for testing gene-editing such as CRISPR/Cas9 strategy in preclinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Insights of mHtt toxicity in BAC226Q</title><p>Although we only conducted an initial analysis of BAC226Q mice, we have already generated data that can be used to clarify some of the questions in the field.</p><p>Huntingtin aggregates were first identified in R6 mice expressing exon 1 of mutant huntingtin and subsequently identified in human tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mangiarini et al., 1996</xref>). Since N-terminal huntingtin is much more susceptible to aggregation compared to the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ratovitski et al., 2009</xref>), and causes a more severe disease phenotype in mice, there has been a hypothesis that full-length mHtt need to be cleaved into fragments to exert toxicity. Although further investigation is needed to detect various fragments, our repeated Western blots of full-size gels for different ages of BAC226Q, exemplified by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, have not shown appreciable 226 PolyQ-containing N-terminal fragments nor their accumulation as a function of time and disease stages in BAC226Q mice. It will be interesting to explore in the future whether the low abundance N-terminal fragments below detection on Western blots are the main cause of toxicity, or the full-length mHtt with 226Q played the main role in pathogenesis in this mouse model.</p><p>Another important question is whether mHtt has a dominant gain-of-toxic function, or a combination of loss-of-function of the wild-type allele. In human patients, rare cases of disrupting one Htt allele did not develop abnormality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambrose et al., 1994</xref>), patients with homozygous mutant Htt alleles develop HD similar to heterozygous carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dürr et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kremer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Squitieri et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wexler et al., 1987</xref>). In BAC226Q, mHTT was not overexpressed, and the two alleles of the wild-type HTT exist. The fact that BAC226Q mice developed such robust HD-like phenotype and that wild-type Htt knockout in adult mice did not induce HD-like phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leavitt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), seem to give more support to the ‘gain-of-function’ hypothesis. An interesting future experiment will be to put BAC226Q in Htt<sup>+/−</sup> and Htt<sup>−/−</sup> background, and examine whether the current HD-like phenotypes in BAC226Q are enhanced. The implication of the above discussion is whether deleting mutant HTT allele will be sufficient to benefit patients in gene-targeting as a therapeutic method.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we report the generation and analyses of a novel BAC226Q mouse, which accurately recapitulates the cardinal HD phenotypes including body weight loss, HD-like characteristic motor behavioral impairment, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms, and classic HD neuropathology changes such as significant neuronal death in striatum and cortex, widespread mHtt aggregation pathology, and reactive gliosis. Therefore, this model will be valuable for mechanistic studies and therapeutic development of HD, especially for the preclinical genetic therapies targeting human mHTT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>BAC engineering and generation of transgenic mice</title><p>A BAC containing the full-length wild-type human HTT gene was modified to express a full-length HTT with a stable, expanded polyglutamine tract. A plasmid containing exon 1 of HTT with 226 mixed CAG-CAA repeats was a gift from Dr. Alex Kazantsev (MIT). The sequence corresponding to 226Q was inserted into the HTT gene by homologous recombination using our standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gong et al., 2002</xref>). Fingerprinting analysis by genomic Southern blots detected no unwanted rearrangements or deletions in the modified Htt-226Q BAC. The modified BAC was sequenced to confirm that there were no unwanted mutations other than the intended 226Q insertion. Finally, the full-length human Htt-226Q BAC copy number and the insertion site in mouse genome were determined by whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, performed by Novogene Corporation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Mice were housed in a temperature and humidity controlled specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility under a 12-hr light/dark cycle schedule with food and water available ad libitum. Transgenic mice were bred with wild-type FVB/N mice (Taconic). It is important to note that BAC226Q in the Taconic FVB/N mouse background exhibited the most robust and consistent phenotypes. Genotyping was determined by PCR of genomic DNA isolated from tail snips. Genotyping primers are located in intron 2 and are specific to human huntingtin (forward primer: 5′-GTA TAT GCT GCT GCC TGC AA-3′; reverse primer: 5′-AGG GGA CAG TGT TGG TCA AG-3′), producing a 403-bp PCR fragment. Non-transgenic littermates were used as controls. All experimental protocols were approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine and Peking University animal care and use committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Motor behavioral study</title><p>All motor behavioral tests were performed during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle for male and female mice. Data were counted by investigators who were blind to the genotypes of mice.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Open field test</title><p>Mice were monitored individually with the VersaMax Animal Activity Monitoring System (Accuscan Instruments). The activity monitor consists of a 16× 16 grid of infra-red beams at floor level to track horizontal position with 16 additional beams at a height of 3 in. to detect vertical activity. Male and female animals were used in test at the ages of 2, 4, 10, and 15 months. Horizontal and vertical activities were measured by beam breaks recorded over a period of 1 hr by the VersaMax software in the dark cycle. The open field chambers were thoroughly cleaned between animals to ensure removal of odors from previous animals. Data were recorded and analyzed by the VersaMax software (Accuscan Instruments). There was no significant influence of sex, thus male and female data were pooled for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Cylinder test</title><p>Male and female animals were used in test at the ages of 2 and 4 months. Each animal was placed in a clear acrylic cylinder and recorded on video for 5 min. A mirror was placed below the cylinder to provide a view of the animal from below. For rearing frequency, rearing duration, and circling behavior, video recordings were analyzed using ImageJ. Digital videos of the mice were converted to gray-scale and cropped to a view of the animal’s silhouette. With VirtualDub software, a Gaussian blur filter was applied and followed by thresholding to obtain a clear outline of the animal’s body. The videos were subsequently analyzed with the ‘Analyze Particles’ tool in ImageJ to obtain pixel area and orientation angle for each frame (5 min at 30 frames per second). Animal rotation was determined by measuring changes in orientations, that is, the angle of the major axis of the best-fit ellipse between frames in either clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The degree of continuous rotations above 180<sup>o</sup> in either direction were summed and divided by 360<sup>o</sup> to obtain the number of circling. All three sets of data were calculated for each individual animal by ImageJ, and confirmed by manual counts. There was no significant influence of sex, thus male and female data were pooled for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Rotarod</title><p>Mice were trained to run on the rotarod apparatus (IITC Life Science) at 8 weeks of age in three daily trials at a fixed speed (10 rpm) for 60 s.

In subsequent experiments, mice were tested once a week in a session of three consecutive trials on an accelerating rotarod (4–45 rpm over 5 min). The interval between trials is 15 min.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Harry T Orr as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Amber L Southwell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Given the potential importance of somatic instability in the HD pathogenesis as well as ongoing therapeutic strategies it is critical that authors discuss the absence of somatic instability in this model as a weakness.</p><p>2. If the authors are going to conclude that HTT fragments are not generated and thus do not contribute to pathogenesis in this model, it is critical that whether fragments are in fact generated be determined a method designed specifically to detect small proteins/peptides.</p><p>3. Statistical analysis is insufficient and not detailed. The statistical analysis section says that analyses were performed using the students t test or one way ANOVA, though which test was used for each piece of data is not detailed anywhere, and what tests were used for post hoc correction of multiple comparisons is not mentioned at all. In either the Results section or the figure legends, please indicate what test is used for each piece of data and give the exact p values for comparisons that are significant and those that are close to allow the reader to make their own assessments. Perhaps a statistical table could be included with the test, the n and the p for ANOVA as well as each pairwise comparison.</p><p>Additionally, in many cases, one way ANOVA is not appropriate. In cases where mice are assessed at multiple ages, 2WAY ANOVA for age and genotype must be employed. In cases where the same mice are used at multiple time points, this must be repeated measures ANOVA. Also, assessments at multiple ages performed using the same mice should be presented as line graphs, such as panel 2B, while those with different mice should be presented as bar graphs, such as 2C. If the bodyweight data in 2C was actually performed using the same mice at each age, it should not be presented as a bar graph.</p><p>Additional Points:</p><p>1. The assessment of HTT level and species should include WT Htt. Even though this is the mouse Htt protein, if it is not included, then an assessment of transgene expression level in comparison to endogenous expression cannot be made. From the Westerns that compare mHTt to BACHD mice, it appears that expression is lower. This is great since the BACHD is an overexpression model and a model with expression closer to endogenous levels would be a good thing. However, without the wtHtt, this assessment can't be made. Re-probing with MAB2166 would show both proteins, and considering the large size of the tg mHTT, separation of the proteins should not be a problem. It also looks from the S830 blot that there is a portion of the tg mHTT that remained insoluble. The authors may want to consider a more robust detergent in lysis in order to more accurately quantify tg mHTT.</p><p>2. Methods are insufficiently detailed. Were the same mice used for every study? If so, they would have been moved to single housing early on for the sucrose preference test. Since single housing affects other behavioral outcomes, and could do so in a disease-dependent manner, it would be important to understand this. An overview paragraph or diagram describing the cohorts is needed, and the potential effects of single housing on subsequent assessments should be addressed.</p><p>– Sex of the mice is only mentioned for body weight and for MRI. Were equal numbers of male and female mice used for other assessments? Was data analyzed separately for males and females and only combined if they were not different? Why were only female mice used for MRI?</p><p>– The authors observed and quantified circling. They correctly make the important distinction that the circling phenotype of mice with unilateral motor damage is unidirectional and state that the circling in these mice is bidirectional. However, in the videos, the mice seems to only circle in one direction. To make the statement that these mice circle bidirectionally, this analysis would need to be done separately for each direction.</p><p>– Neuropathology was assessed at 2 and 11 months of age, but data is only shown for the stereology at 2 months of age. The authors state in results that forebrain weight was similar at 2 months of age, but the data is not shown. In fact, the figure only shows whole brain weight at 11 months, not forebrain weight. Please describe how the forebrain was divided and add the data. Was the DARPP-32 assessment performed at 2 months? If not, why? If so, where is the data?</p><p>– The methods state that behavioral videos were analyzed with ImageJ, but no other information is given. Most labs use expensive animal tracking software to analyze behavior videos. This statement requires either a full description or a citation of another paper with a full description of exactly house mouse behavior was analyzed by ImageJ.</p><p>– Most of the behavior data has insufficient detail. How many training trials were done over how many days for rotarod? The performance of the WT mice seems awfully poor, but the accelerating program described is pretty standard except for a shorter than usual inter trial interval. My WT mice can stay on this program for basically the full 300s, yet the mean reported here is ~30s for young WT mice. Were they only trained 1 day? Considering that all of the FL tg HD mice have reported motor learning deficits in rotarod as early as 2months of age where it takes 3 days for them to catch up to WT mouse performance, but they can then perform just as well as the WT mice, this is really insufficient. Obviously it can't be repeated, but it needs to be clarified. The difference in performance between what is reported here and what is typically reported for FVB mice needs to be addressed. This 10 fold difference in performance is huge.</p><p>– Dilutions of antibodies should be given, and secondary antibodies should be named.</p><p>– Amount of protein separated on APGE should be given (only says 'an equal amount of protein').</p><p>3. Other conclusions are not supported by the data. The authors describe S830 as aggregate-specific in 1 sentence and say that it is picking up only soluble mHTT in the next paragraph. These are contradictory statements. S830 does, in fact, detect soluble mHTT, so should not be used as a basis for making statements about the role of aggregates in HD pathogenesis. The authors state that it is widely postulated that Htt aggregates are the source of HD toxicity. However, it has been well described that neurons with aggregates live longer than neurons without aggregates, suggesting a protective role of aggregation. Additionally, multiple mouse models with robust brain aggregation, shuch as the YAC128 C6R and short stop models, have transgene alterations that make them non-pathogenic i.e. no neurodegeneration, not HD-like behavior phenotype, but still result in robust brain HTT aggregates. So, it's been well established in the field for a long time that aggregation is not the driver of disease in HD.</p><p>– The authors state that because they observe robust disease in their model and the full complement of mouse Htt is still present, this demonstrates that HD is a GOF disease, not LOF. First, this is not a novel finding. Like several of the things in the Discussion section, it is common to other FL mouse models of HD, thus, not novel. This includes things like onset of cognitive and psychiatric behavioral abnormalities prior to motor abnormalities (Seen in YAC128, BACHD, Humanized mice, Q175), or robust disease without overt dependence on cleavage (hard to tell without fragment analysis, but presumably not different from BACHD). Furthermore, mHTT is known to sequester wtHTT or do its job poorly and potentially competitively, so just because the wtHTT is still there, doesn't' meant that the mHTT can't have some dominant negative effect and result in LOF toxicities. Thus, this study clarifies GOF vs LOF.</p><p>4. Often the figure call outs are out of order in the text. For instance, in figure 2, survival data is presented first followed by body weight data, whereas in the text, body weight data is presented prior to survival data. Please re-order either the text or the figure. This also occurs with panel 5A coming after 5B, and 6E coming after 6G in the text.</p><p>5. The introduction states that the causative gene for HD was identified 2 decades ago. This was actually 28 years; closer to 3 decades.</p><p>6. In the description of existing mouse model of HD, no distinction is made between KI models where only additional CAG is knocked in to the mouse Htt gene and models where the entirety of human HTT exon 1 is knocked in to the mouse gene. This is an important distinction for assessment of therapies that target exon 1 outside of the CAG tract.</p><p>7. Please include N in figure legends 3 and 4 as are done in 2 and 5.</p><p>8. One ref in the introduction is denoted as 4 author last names et al., while all others are only 1 name et al., or 2 names with and please change for consistency.</p><p>9. Weight loss Results section says that the tg mice gained weight the same as their littermates for the first 8 weeks, but the graph in 2B shows total overlap for 13 weeks (90 days).</p><p>10. DARPP-32 staining is not a way to quantify MSNs. Please rephrase this in results. It is a marker of healthy MSNs. Expressions can be reduced and lost prior to death of cells. Even if this wasn't the case, using IOD of staining throughout the striatum doesn't quantify cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70217.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

If the authors are going to conclude that HTT fragments are not generated and thus do not contribute to pathogenesis in this model, it is critical that whether fragments are in fact generated be determined a method designed specifically to detect small proteins/peptides.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We are fully aware of the body of publications on various mouse models, pro-and-con on this issue, including the significant ones of which the reviewer was a co-author. For example, some of the publications proposing the “fragment pathology” are (Graham et al., 2006; Slow et al., 2005). And the publications inconsistent with the above are (Gafni et al., 2012). In our case, we have done a large number of Western blots for brain samples at different ages in BAC226Q, and obtained consistent results that BAC226Q mice didn’t show detectable mHtt fragmentation. Being aware that more detailed investigation will be needed, we have softened our language in this revised version, making it a “tentative discussion” rather than a “conclusion”.</p><p>Our previous manuscript reads:</p><p>“Our data do not support this hypothesis, because in the life span of BAC226Q mice, fragmented mHtt is hardly detectable. It seems that in BAC226Q, full length mHtt is toxic and sufficient to drive pathogenesis.”</p><p>Now we change the paragraph to:</p><p>“Although further investigation is needed to detect various fragments, our repeated Western blots of full-size gels for different ages of BAC226Q, exemplified by Figure 1B, have not shown appreciable 226 PolyQ-containing N-terminal fragments nor their accumulation as a function of time and disease stages in BAC226Q mice. It will be interesting to explore in the future whether the low abundance N-terminal fragments below detection on Western blots are the main cause of toxicity, or the full length mHtt with 226Q played the main role in pathogenesis in this mouse model.”</p><p>1.

In either the Results section or the figure legends, please indicate what test is used for each piece of data and give the exact p values for comparisons that are significant and those that are close to allow the reader to make their own assessments.

We first invited Prof. Jerry Cheng, a professional Bio-statistician to join our team as a co-author. Prof. Cheng worked with us in actually re-analyzing all data sets. As a result, we revised many places in <italic>Figures</italic> (substantial revision in Figure 2 and Figure 5), <italic>Figure legends</italic> (substantial revision in Figure 2 and Figure 5) and <italic>Methods</italic>. We have given more detailed explanations of exact P values, numbers of animals in each experiment, and the types of statistical analyses. It is worth noting that regarding some of the repeated measurements, e.g., Figure 2C, we made serious efforts to use exactly the same cohort of mice in longitudinal studies. However, a complication is that as the mice aged, many of them, especially BAC226Q mice, died in the process. Therefore, we were forced to add additional mice from the same breeding batch but not in the original experimental cohort to reach sufficient numbers of animals. Thus, these experiments were not strict repeated measures. We explained each individual case in the revised Figure Legends and Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional Points:</p><p>1. The assessment of HTT level and species should include WT Htt. Even though this is the mouse Htt protein, if it is not included, then an assessment of transgene expression level in comparison to endogenous expression cannot be made. From the Westerns that compare mHTt to BACHD mice, it appears that expression is lower. This is great since the BACHD is an overexpression model and a model with expression closer to endogenous levels would be a good thing. However, without the wtHtt, this assessment can't be made. Re-probing with MAB2166 would show both proteins, and considering the large size of the tg mHTT, separation of the proteins should not be a problem. It also looks from the S830 blot that there is a portion of the tg mHTT that remained insoluble. The authors may want to consider a more robust detergent in lysis in order to more accurately quantify tg mHTT.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In fact, in the past 5 months, this is the experiment in which we spent most of our effort and struggled with severe obstacles including obtaining antibodies from international shipping to China. We tried multiple antibodies, many conditions of lysis buffers, and different types of gels. The 1C2 antibody doesn’t recognize the wild type Htt. We tried MAB2166 in 10 gels and Western blots, just to confirm a problem well known in the field that MAB2166 has much reduced affinity to mHtt in the reverse relationship to the length of expanded PolyQ. BACHD97 was poorly recognized by MAB2166, and BAC-225Q was almost not recognized (Wegrzynowicz et al., 2015). BAC226Q is similar to BAC-225Q. Therefore, our tentative estimate of BAC226Q expression level comes from the 1C2 and S830 detection of relative abundance of mHtt226Q and mHtt97Q which is known to be 2-3 folds of the wild type Htt.</p><p>We will pursue another approach that can potentially address this question with Evotec SE Company by the MSD method (Reindl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019), and will eventually give a more definitive answer.

Most labs use expensive animal tracking software to analyze behavior videos. This statement requires either a full description or a citation of another paper with a full description of exactly house mouse behavior was analyzed by ImageJ.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following details in the <italic>Method</italic> section:</p><p>In the Open field Test, mice were monitored individually for 10 minutes in the VersaMax Animal Activity Monitoring System and video recordings were analyzed by the VersaMax software (Accuscan Instruments). Horizontal movements and vertical rearing were counted by investigators who were blind to the genotypes of the mice.</p><p>The cylinder test was performed during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. Each animal was placed in a clear acrylic cylinder and recorded on video for 5 minutes. A mirror was placed below the cylinder to provide a view of the animal from below. Rearing frequency and time were counted from the video recording by investigators who were blind to the genotypes of the mice. For circling behavior, video recordings were analyzed using ImageJ. Digital videos of the mice in cylinder task were converted to gray-scale and cropped to a view of the animal’s silhouette. With VirtualDub software, a Gaussian blur filter was applied and followed by thresholding to obtain a clear outline of the animal’s body. The videos were subsequently analyzed with the “Analyze Particles” tool in ImageJ to obtain pixel area and orientation angle for each frame (5 minutes at 30 frames per second). Frequency and duration of rearing were calculated for each individual animal, and confirmed by manual counts by investigators who were blind to the genotypes of the mice. Animal rotation was determined by measuring changes in orientations, i.e., the angle of the major axis of the best-fit ellipse between frames in either clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. The degree of continuous rotations above 180 <sup>o</sup> in either direction were summed and divided by 360 to obtain the number of circling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Most of the behavior data has insufficient detail. How many training trials were done over how many days for rotarod? The performance of the WT mice seems awfully poor, but the accelerating program described is pretty standard except for a shorter than usual inter trial interval. My WT mice can stay on this program for basically the full 300s, yet the mean reported here is ~30s for young WT mice. Were they only trained 1 day? Considering that all of the FL tg HD mice have reported motor learning deficits in rotarod as early as 2months of age where it takes 3 days for them to catch up to WT mouse performance, but they can then perform just as well as the WT mice, this is really insufficient. Obviously it can't be repeated, but it needs to be clarified. The difference in performance between what is reported here and what is typically reported for FVB mice needs to be addressed. This 10 fold difference in performance is huge.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Method for rotarod test as follows:</p><p>“Mice were trained to run on the rotarod apparatus (IITC Life Science) at 8 weeks of age in three daily trials at a fixed speed (10 rpm) for 60 seconds. The training lasted for three days. Only during this training period, mice that fell were placed back on the rod until the end of the 60 seconds. In subsequent experiments, mice were tested once a week in a session of three consecutive trials on an accelerating rotarod (4-45 rpm over 5 minutes). The interval between trials is 15 minutes. Latency to fall was recorded for each animal and averaged over the three trials. The same cohort of wild type and BAC226Q mice were used for this experiment.”</p><p>With regard to the reviewer’s question about the shorter than usual latency before falling for young wild type and BAC226Q mice, we think that the main factor is the difference in the equipment <italic>per se</italic>. When we performed the task of Figure 3F in New York, we used <italic>IITC Life Science</italic> rotarod, which perhaps was much more slippery than usual, and caused all animals to stay much shorter time on the rotating rod.

Other conclusions are not supported by the data. The authors describe S830 as aggregate-specific in 1 sentence and say that it is picking up only soluble mHTT in the next paragraph. These are contradictory statements. S830 does, in fact, detect soluble mHTT, so should not be used as a basis for making statements about the role of aggregates in HD pathogenesis. The authors state that it is widely postulated that Htt aggregates are the source of HD toxicity. However, it has been well described that neurons with aggregates live longer than neurons without aggregates, suggesting a protective role of aggregation. Additionally, multiple mouse models with robust brain aggregation, shuch as the YAC128 C6R and short stop models, have transgene alterations that make them non-pathogenic i.e. no neurodegeneration, not HD-like behavior phenotype, but still result in robust brain HTT aggregates. So, it's been well established in the field for a long time that aggregation is not the driver of disease in HD.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight. We now revise to</p><p>“S830 …which specifically detects soluble and aggregated mutant Htt”.</p><p>This is consistent with our experiments that S830 detects soluble mHtt at 2 months, and aggregated mHtt starting at 4 months.</p><p>With regard to the mHtt aggregation being pathogenic, innocuous or beneficial, our manuscript does not have experiments for investigating this question. The only relevant sentence in this manuscript “…It is widely postulated that mHtt aggregates are the source of HD toxicity…” is now eliminated. We claim no further than the fact that BAC226Q mice exhibit age-dependent and progressive development of cytosolic and neuritic mHtt aggregations as well as nuclear inclusions, which are hallmarks of human HD patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors state that because they observe robust disease in their model and the full complement of mouse Htt is still present, this demonstrates that HD is a GOF disease, not LOF. First, this is not a novel finding. Like several of the things in the Discussion section, it is common to other FL mouse models of HD, thus, not novel. This includes things like onset of cognitive and psychiatric behavioral abnormalities prior to motor abnormalities (Seen in YAC128, BACHD, Humanized mice, Q175), or robust disease without overt dependence on cleavage (hard to tell without fragment analysis, but presumably not different from BACHD). Furthermore, mHTT is known to sequester wtHTT or do its job poorly and potentially competitively, so just because the wtHTT is still there, doesn't' meant that the mHTT can't have some dominant negative effect and result in LOF toxicities. Thus, this study clarifies GOF vs LOF.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the question of gain-of-function vs. loss-of-function, dominant negative effect of mHtt is not new and has been explored by colleagues in the field. However, it is still important and especially relevant to gene editing as a therapeutic method. This is the reason we discuss it here. After considering several lines of evidence, we therefore revise the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“Another important question is whether mHtt has a dominant gain-of-toxic function, or a combination of loss of function of the wild type allele. In human patients, rare cases of disrupting one Htt allele didn’t develop abnormality (Ambrose et al., 1994), patients with homozygous mutant Htt alleles develop HD similar to heterozygous carriers (Dürr et al., 1999; Kremer et al., 1994; Squitieri et al., 2003; Wexler et al., 1987). In BAC226Q, mHTT was not overexpressed, and the two alleles of the wild type HTT exist. The fact that BAC226Q mice developed such robust HD-like phenotype, and that wild type Htt knockout in adult mice didn’t induce HD-like phenotypes (Leavitt et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016), seem to give more support to the “gain-of-function” hypothesis. An interesting future experiment will be to put BAC226Q in Htt<sup>+/-</sup> and Htt<sup>-/-</sup> background, and examine whether the current HD-like phenotypes in BAC226Q are enhanced. The implication of the above discussion is whether deleting mutant HTT allele will be sufficient to benefit patients in gene-targeting as a therapeutic method.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
