and oscillation-based computations. Using modeling, we show that both superficial and deep layers of the primary mouse visual cortex implement two ultrasensitive and bistable switches built on mutual inhibitory connectivity motives between somatostatin, parvalbumin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide cells. The switches toggle pyramidal neurons between high and low firing rate states that are synchronized across layers through translaminar connectivity. Moreover, inhibited and disinhibited states are characterized by low- and high-frequency oscillations, respectively, with layer-specific differences in frequency and power which show asymmetric changes during state transitions. These findings are consistent with a number of experimental observations and embed firing rate together with oscillatory changes within a switch interpretation of the microcircuit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microcircuit</kwd><kwd>modeling</kwd><kwd>oscillations</kwd><kwd>switching dynamics</kwd><kwd>cortical layers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 2041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>Gerald</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Helmut</given-names></name><name><surname>Knösche</surname><given-names>Thomas R</given-names></name><name><surname>Deco</surname><given-names>Gustavo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Research Project COBRAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PSI2016-75688-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deco</surname><given-names>Gustavo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Catalan AGAUR program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017 SGR 1545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deco</surname><given-names>Gustavo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 -

The majority of interneurons can be assigned to biochemically defined classes, such as parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). These neurons are distributed across layers and connected according to an intricate circuit diagram with intra- and interlaminar connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kätzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cardin, 2018</xref>). The discovery of regularities within the connectivity pattern of excitatory and inhibitory neurons prompted researchers to propose the existence of canonical microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Douglas and Martin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beul and Hilgetag, 2014</xref>), which implement elementary computations that are repeated across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miller, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To identify such computations, research has focused on a better description of the functional role of individual neuron types by selective optogenetic activation and silencing of specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fishell and Kepecs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maffei, 2017</xref>). These studies have not only highlighted an essential role of inhibitory neurons to balance excitation, but also recognized disinhibitory subcircuits, which release pyramidal neurons from strong inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fishell and Kepecs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Letzkus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, neuronal oscillations in different frequency bands have been attributed to the activity of different interneuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen, 2017</xref>). While the computational properties of simplified circuits with multiple interneuron types have been investigated theoretically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hertäg and Sprekeler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Garcia Del Molino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lee, 2018</xref>), in the context of vision, locomotion, prediction errors, and whole-brain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lee and Mihalas, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dipoppa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hertäg and Sprekeler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensaid et al., 2019</xref>), the dynamics of more complex networks comprising multiple layers with translaminar connectivity remain unexplored. Moreover, even though models have examined the emergence of oscillations in local (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lee, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Domhof and Tiesinga, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Veit et al., 2017</xref>) and whole-brain neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensaid et al., 2019</xref>) composed of canonical microcircuits, it is unclear how firing rate descriptions of microcircuit function relate to oscillatory behavior of cortical networks, which can differ across cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adesnik, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Kerkoerle et al., 2014</xref>). This is crucial to interpret meso- and macroscopic signals from local field potential (LFP), electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetencephalography (MEG) recordings with respect to circuit function, where access to firing rate information is not possible.</p><p>To address these questions, we take a computational approach and isolate the role of different neurons in rate- and oscillation-based functioning of the layered microcircuit of the primary mouse visual cortex, for which the most comprehensive connectivity diagram to date is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Modeling permitted to go beyond of what is possible with available experimental tools and we not only characterized the effect of selective activation/suppression of different neuron types, but also perturbed specific connections and test their impact on microcircuit dynamics and response properties.</p><p>We found that the superficial and deep layers in the visual microcircuit can operate in two different states, triggered by the external activation of specific interneuron types and each with different excitation–inhibition balance: An inhibition dominated state controlled by SST neurons (SST state) and a disinhibited state that is attained by activation of PV and/or VIP neurons (PV/VIP states). By perturbing connections of different types of interneurons, we confirmed that disparities in recurrent connections within these inhibitory cell classes play a crucial role for the different EI balance in the two states. Two mutual inhibitory motifs that include SST, PV, and VIP cells serve as ultrasensitive or bistable switches with different sensitivity, which can toggle the microcircuit between the two states. Such a state change in one layer can propagate through translaminar connections to the other layer. Notably, we also found that in the inhibited regime slow beta-band oscillations were more prevalent especially in the deep layer, whereas in the disinhibited state fast gamma oscillations emerged predominately in the superficial layer, similar to experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Kerkoerle et al., 2014</xref>). We also provide a mechanistic explanation to other empirical findings such as asymmetric changes in oscillation power and frequency during state transitions as seen during the presentation of visual stimuli with increasing size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Veit et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, our results provide a comprehensive description of state-dependent effects of different inhibitory interneuron types with testable predictions and link rate- and oscillation-based accounts of microcircuit functioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we investigate the computational properties of a detailed microcircuit of the mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This network consists of two different layers (superficial and deep), representing L2/3 and L5 of the primary visual cortex and each containing four different cell types that are connected within and between layers: excitatory pyramidal cells (PYR), and three different classes of inhibitory cells (PV, SST, and VIP). The connectivity was corrected for the different prevalence of each cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>) and scaled with a global parameter (<italic>G</italic>) to approximate effective coupling changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jobst et al., 2017</xref>). This scaling was necessary, because the connectivity weights were empirically determined for individual cell pairs, whereas the effective interactions are mediated through entire cell populations for which the absolute cell count is not known. The variable <italic>G</italic> controls for the effective connectivity between cell types, such that a larger value of <italic>G</italic> implies a larger number of cells in the network. Thus, the connectivity strength between the modeled cell classes in our model also approximates the population size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The population dynamics of each neuron type was given by a firing rate model (see Methods). The different excitatory–inhibitory feedback loops endowed the model with resonance properties, which was accompanied by oscillations in the presence of externally applied noise. This allowed us to study both firing rate and oscillatory behavior as measured by variations in power and frequency of the LFP, approximated by the rate of the pyramidal cell populations. We first examined spontaneous interactions across all neurons and then drove specific neuron classes, simulating input from remote cortical and subcortical sources.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Network anatomy and spontaneous activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Layout of the local network with a superficial layer that includes four different cell types in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex and three cell types in a deep layer representing L5.

A sharp increase in pyramidal, PV and VIP cell activity with <italic>G</italic> was followed by a rapid decrease of mean rates in both layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). SST neurons also behaved similar to PV and VIP cells, but both rise and decay in their activity were much slower. The average firing rates of pyramidal and SST neurons were higher in the deeper layer, in accordance with experimental results in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sakata and Harris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Senzai et al., 2019</xref>). Power spectral analysis of the LFP showed a clear peak, whose frequency and power varied with the coupling parameter in a layer-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Generally, frequencies first increased within the high gamma range from ~60 Hz (for small <italic>G</italic>) to ~110 Hz (for <italic>G</italic> = 100) across both layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). For <italic>G</italic> &gt; 100, the dominant LFP frequency steadily decreased to a low gamma (~40 Hz, superficial layer) or low beta range (~15 Hz, deep layer) for <italic>G</italic> = 500. Interestingly, the frequency consistently remained higher in deep layers, consistent with recent experimental findings in mouse V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adesnik, 2018</xref>). Moreover, high gamma frequencies (<italic>G</italic> &lt; 250) were stronger in superficial layers, whereas the power of slower oscillations (<italic>G</italic> &gt; 250) was higher in deep layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), in congruence with empirical mouse V1 findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Senzai et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Origin of different firing rates and oscillations in deep and superficial layers</title><p>Next, we investigated the anatomical origin of firing rate and oscillation differences across layers by modifying specific connections. We targeted three connections, which show pronounced asymmetry across layers: PYR<sup>sup</sup> → PYR<sup>deep</sup> connection, translaminar projections of SST cells, and recurrent inhibition among PV neurons (PV–PV connections) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). The removal of the PYR<sup>sup</sup> → PYR<sup>deep</sup> connection strongly reduced the firing rate differences across the layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Removal of the translaminar SST connection, which only projects from deep to superficial layer had a smaller impact on the firing rate difference. Moreover, the disinhibitory PV–PV connections are considerably stronger in deep layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). When we changed the PV–PV connections such that their strength was the same in the deep and superficial layers, the firing rate difference between the two layers was also reduced. Modifying all three connections simultaneously almost completely abolished the rate inequality between layers. Likewise, differences in oscillation power in different frequency bands across layers were suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Thus, our model suggests that stronger excitation and disinhibition in the deep layer together with more inhibition in the superficial layer underlie the experimentally observed firing rate and oscillation power differences between deep and superficial layers.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of connectivity lesions on rate and spectral properties across layers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic two-layer network.

To this end, we silenced individual inhibitory cell types in both layers by removing all their connections and examined the effect on oscillation frequency and power of the LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Knocking out PV cells was accompanied by a slow oscillation (~30 Hz) in both layers with a frequency that remained approximately stable with <italic>G</italic>. By contrast, when SST cells were removed the network oscillated at high frequency (~110 Hz) across all tested values of <italic>G</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, top, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, left). Note that this increase in the oscillation frequency was not due to disinhibition from SST silencing, because PYR firing rate decreased in both knockout cases with <italic>G</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), while the frequency remained high. In accordance with this hypothesis, for small values of <italic>G</italic>, when PV rate was high, the oscillation frequency in the intact network approached the frequency seen in the SST knockout case. As <italic>G</italic> was increased and SST activity surpassed PV firing rates, the oscillation frequency decreased and converged to values seen in the PV knockout scenario. Importantly, oscillatory power was overall higher in the PV knockout case with a low frequency and lower in the SST silenced network with faster oscillations across all tested values of <italic>G</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, right). In contrast to PV and SST cells, VIP cell silencing only slightly increased the oscillation frequency, but did not influence the relative decrease in frequency as a function of <italic>G</italic>. However, when we manipulated frequency and power in the knockout networks, we found that they changed symmetrically. In both PV and SST silenced circuits, driving PYR cells or the remaining inhibitory cells jointly increased or decreased power and frequency in superficial and deep layer, except for the deep layer after SST silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Thus, the relative dominance of PV and SST cell activity is an important factor that determines the oscillation frequency and power, which are inversely related in the full model (see below), but positively correlated in the partly silenced network.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Two different states and state switching dynamics of the microcircuit</title><p>Thus far, we changed the relative prevalence of given interneuron types by scaling the connectivity matrix or silencing individual cell types or connections. Visual inspection of the microcircuit revealed two prominent mutual inhibition motifs.

We hypothesized that driving one inhibitory cell type will functionally silence competing cells and toggle the circuit between different inhibitory states, which may differ in terms of PYR firing rate and their oscillation profile.

First, VIP connections to SST cells suppressed SST rates, whereas PYR and PV cells initially increased their firing across both layers for sufficiently high <italic>G</italic> values (<italic>G</italic> &gt; 150), because they were released from SST inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <italic>G</italic> &lt; 25). However, as VIP input increased, PYR and PV cells were gradually suppressed again in the superficial layer, while their firing rate was only slightly affected in the deep layer. This was caused by the inhibitory connection from VIP to PYR cells in the superficial layer and indeed its removal resulted in a response similar to the deep layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The presence and strength of disinhibition in the superficial layer depended on the baseline activity of SST cells, with higher SST rates, either due to high <italic>G</italic> values or caused by external drive, enhancing the PYR cell disinhibitory peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). By contrast, when SST rates were too low, VIP input failed to further suppress SST activity and thus no disinhibition of PYR cells was seen.</p><p>Second, as <italic>G</italic> increased, the responses of SST cells became more switch like with sigmoidal curves in both layers, a hallmark of an ultrasensitive switch in many biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrell and Ha, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A similar sigmoidal decrease in SST firing rates with initial PYR disinhibition followed by inhibition was observed in both layers when only PV cells were driven (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, when PV cells were stimulated, switch like ultrasensitive responses occurred at larger <italic>G</italic> values as compared to VIP input, especially in the deep layer. By contrast, VIP cell-induced inhibition on PYR cells was weaker than PYR suppression mediated by PV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>In some biological systems ultrasensitivity with sigmoidal response curves is accompanied by bistable behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferrell, 2002</xref>), characterized by state transitions that are not reversed when the input is withdrawn. A telltale sign of bistability is the presence of hysteresis, that is the response curves change as a function of the direction in which the state change was triggered. To test for bistability in the microcircuit, we first applied an increasing current to VIP or PV cells in both layers simultaneously, followed by current in the decreasing direction for different values of the coupling parameter. We found that hysteresis appeared at sufficiently high <italic>G</italic> values, as visible by the appearance of noncongruent response curves for the up and down direction in all cell types of both layers for VIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and PV input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Hysteresis in the deep layer for PV input required very strong input, even though a small hysteresis effect was observed for smaller <italic>G</italic> that was transmitted from superficial layers via translaminar connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition-based ultrasensitivity and hysteresis commonly require strong inhibitory interactions between the components of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferrell, 2002</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the enhanced mutual inhibitory connections between SST &lt;&gt; VIP and SST &lt;&gt; PV cells due to the scaling by <italic>G</italic> underlie the sigmoidal and hysteretic response curves. Indeed, selectively increasing these weights was sufficient for ultrasensitivity and hysteresis to appear in the microcircuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Next, to quantify the switching behavior of the microcircuit we fitted a Hill function to the SST firing rate response curve (see Methods) and estimated the Hill coefficient (<italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), a measure for ultrasensitivity. We also estimated the area between the up and down branches of the response curves (<italic>h</italic>) to quantify hysteresis. We found that both <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> and <italic>h</italic> increased monotonically with <italic>G</italic> when either VIP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) or PV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) were stimulated. Within a limited range of <italic>G</italic>, the Hill coefficient (<italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub>) increased monotonically for the transition from SST to VIP or SST to PV states in both layers, while hysteresis was absent (<italic>h</italic> = 0). Hysteresis occurred at different values of <italic>G</italic> depending on the type of switch and layer, and caused an abrupt increase in <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub>, which stabilized with large values of <italic>G</italic> and gave rise to a virtually binary state transition. A closer study of the bifurcation diagrams showed marked differences across switches and layers. As we increased <italic>G</italic>, the sensitivity increased rapidly for the VIP to SST switch in both layers.

Likewise, hysteresis onset increased from the VIP switch to the PV switch in the superficial and deep layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

In contrast, the frequency within the high activity state, dominated by PV cells, remained unchanged.

In addition, we removed translaminar connections to test their role in the state propagation (only connections with an impact are shown). When the circuit displayed high SST activity, input to VIP cells in the superficial layer showed a disinhibitory PYR rate increase in the deep layer, which was mainly due to a translaminar reduction of SST activity rather than a direct drive from superficial to deep PYR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We obtained a similar result in the superficial layer after driving the deep layer VIP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

However, for a deeper understanding of this switch one important question remains: Why are PYR cells more inhibited in the SST dominated regime as compared to the PV governed regime? To this end, we examined the mouse V1 connectivity matrix and found that there is a strong asymmetry between recurrent connections among PV and SST cells. While connections between PV cells in each layer are the strongest within the entire matrix, recurrent connections among SST cells are entirely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the strong self-inhibition of PV cells effectively reduces their inhibitory effect on PYR cells, while SST cells can elicit comparatively stronger inhibition on PYR cells due to the absence of self-inhibition. If this was true, exchanging the recurrent connections, that is removing PV self-connections and add them to SST cells may invert their role in microcircuit state switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). In simulations with the inverted connectivity scheme we found that input to SST cells indeed created a disinhibition peak in the PYR cell response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, left), similar to VIP input in the original connectivity scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), while PV and VIP cells showed a monotonic suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">2A</xref>).

The underlying switching mechanics are realized by the interactions among the three interneuron types (PV, SST, and VIP), which compete for inhibitory influence on pyramidal cells.

Similar to previous simulations of anatomically simplified neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hertäg and Sprekeler, 2019</xref>), we found that a key to this inhibitory asymmetry lies in the degree to which PV and SST cells are connected among themselves. While SST cells lack mutual connectivity, PV cells have strong mutual connectivity (that may also be reinforced by gap junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>). In our rate model, self-inhibition of PV cells reduced their impact on PYR cells and enhanced PYR rates. We note that a similar effect was found in spiking network models, where PV interactions enhanced PYR rates and synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hahn et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, we found that exchanging self-connections of PV and SST neurons inverted their role in mediating the inhibited or disinhibited state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Origin of switching dynamics</title><p>The switching mechanism emerges as a consequence of two mutual inhibitory connection motifs that is from SST to PV and VIP, and PV/VIP to SST neurons, in both layers. Thus, driving SST cells switches the microcircuit state to the ‘inhibited state’ by suppressing PV and VIP neurons as well as PYR neurons. Conversely, input to VIP or PV cells disinhibits the circuit by decreasing SST cells activity. The nature of this switch depended on the mutual inhibitory connectivity strength, rendering the state transition purely ultrasensitive with sigmoidal input–output curves for weaker weights or bistable with hysteresis and memory for stronger weights, consistent with recent observations made in simplified inhibitory neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hertäg and Sprekeler, 2019</xref>).

Notably, the two ways to control the switch differ in their sensitivity, with VIP cells requiring considerably less input to control SST activity and flip the circuit to the disinhibited state in both layers than PV cells. Thus, PV cells seem to be more specialized in keeping the excitation–inhibition balance at sufficiently high levels, whereas VIP cells play more a switching role, even though both cell types can assume both functions.</p><p>The switching circuitry of the microcircuit can not only be activated by simultaneous input to superficial and deep layers, but each layer can transmit its state change to the other through translaminar connectivity, and effectively synchronize inhibited or disinhibited states across the whole microcircuit.

Consistent with experiments and models, PV cells drive high frequencies (‘gamma range’), whereas SST cells prefer lower frequencies (‘beta range’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lee, 2018</xref>). Accordingly, during the inhibited switch state the dominating SST cells impose a slower frequency on PYR cells as compared to the PV dominated disinhibition state with high frequencies. VIP cells had little influence on oscillation frequency. An interesting finding of our study is that this switch in frequency is already shaped by the connectivity pattern of the circuit and is only partly modified by intrinsic neuronal properties such as differing time constants. Note also that in the absence of noise and oscillations, the ability of the network to change its frequency is not dependent on the exact time constant of neuron populations suggesting that the switch is already engrained in the connectivity. Neuron population time constants, however, do determine the amount of change in the oscillation frequency as the network goes from SST to PV mode. This result thus provides a potential explanation for a longstanding question of what determines the oscillation frequency in neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunel and Wang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jia et al., 2013</xref>). This finding is in contrast to previous modeling efforts which introduced slow and high frequencies by endowing interneurons with different time constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hyafil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mejias et al., 2016</xref>). Animal experiments have revealed that the power of high-frequency oscillations was stronger in the superficial layer, while slower oscillation had more power in the deep layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Kerkoerle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haegens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buffalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonaiuto et al., 2018</xref>). Based on our results we argue that the emergence of such differences in oscillations in deep and superficial layers crucially depends on specific anatomical connections (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, our results also replicate experimental findings which have shown that visual stimulation mediated by feedforward connections and visual attention mediated by feedback connections suppress slow oscillations (alpha band) and enhance fast oscillations in the gamma band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Kerkoerle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Klimesch, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Thus, our results also suggest an alternative, anatomically based taxonomy for oscillations, dividing them into competing SST- (low frequency) and PV-driven rhythms (high frequency). Notably, during the transition between (PV or SST dominated) switch states the oscillation frequency and power behave asymmetrically, that is an increase in frequency is accompanied by a decrease in power. However, when PV or SST cells are strongly suppressed or silenced, frequency and power change symmetrically. A decrease in frequency and increase in power is also found in recent experiments in monkeys and mice, in which small stimuli trigger a high-frequency oscillation (~60 Hz) that is replaced by a lower frequency (~30 Hz) in the presence of larger stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Veit et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gieselmann and Thiele, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Anatomical studies show that this surround suppression effect is presumably mediated by lateral excitatory input from the surround to SST neurons in the center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>). Our model suggests that the surround switches the microcircuit from a PV/VIP dominated state with a high frequency, putatively mediated by stimulus triggered feedforward and feedback drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gonchar and Burkhalter, 2003</xref>), to a more inhibited state caused by enhanced lateral drive to SST cells. We note that experiments have also reported the inverse case with an increase in oscillation frequency and decrease in power after enhancing visual stimulus contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ray and Maunsell, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The switching properties in the model depend on the coupling parameter <italic>G</italic>, which scales the overall connectivity between neurons of the circuit. This parameter has been previously used to study whole-brain models of cortical dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deco et al., 2013</xref>) and can be related to the overall cell count in the studied circuits. The experimentally given connectivity matrix used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>) only describes the connection strength between pairs of neurons and therefore it becomes necessary to scale the weights while investigating the dynamics of the firing rate-based model. As the coupling parameter critically determines the presence of ultrasensitivity, bistability, and oscillation properties, it is crucial for further studies to determine its value, which may differ between different circuits across the brain. We found that feedforward and feedback input lead to suppression of SST and PYR activity for sufficiently high <italic>G</italic> values. This is inconsistent with recent experimental results in mouse V1, where the rate of all cell types increased after visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dipoppa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirchberger et al., 2021</xref>).

There exist a number of studies which have charted the different morphological and biochemical cell types in these two layers, which can also be divided into PV, SST, and VIP classes similar to layers 2/3 and 5 in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Scala et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frandolig et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yavorska and Wehr, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2021</xref>). However, there is limited anatomical knowledge about the cell-specific connectivity within each layer and their connections to other layers in the microcircuit. We therefore excluded these layers from our study and restricted our model to the more comprehensively mapped connectivity of layers 2/3 and 5. It is possible that cell type-specific connectivity within the layers 4 and 6 and feedback from layer 6 to the thalamus can change the network dynamics, but that requires more detailed investigation.</p><p>The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref> also included layer 1, which contained only two inhibitory cell classes.

Our results provide evidence that the microcircuit contains supplementary homeostatic mechanisms that keep disinhibition within healthy boundaries. When the circuit is disinhibited and SST activity suppressed, strong drive to pyramidal cell can cause a sudden reversal of SST neurons to a high firing rate state and thereby restore a more inhibited state in the microcircuit. This phenomenon was reported experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>) and in a recent theoretical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Garcia Del Molino et al., 2017</xref>) showing elevated visually evoked SST rates, after prior suppression through VIP cells during darkness.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Related experimental data from nonhuman primates</title><p>While our results were obtained using anatomical data from mouse V1, the model also replicates some of the experimental findings obtained from monkey V1 recordings.

Moreover, our model predicts that driving PYR cells is followed by linear or nonlinear responses in inhibitory cells depending on the dominance of SST or PV/VIP cells, respectively. Finally, experiments could test whether inhibition or disinhibition mediated by driving specific inhibitory cells in one layer propagate to the other layer, as our simulations showed.</p><p>In conclusion, the microcircuit function that emerges from our computational study is a homeostatic switch that toggles pyramidal cells, the principal output neurons of the circuit, between an inhibited and disinhibited state. The switching dynamics is orchestrated by an array of inhibitory neurons, each performing a specific task in the switch mechanics. Feedforward, feedback, and lateral input may change the position of the switch and regulate the flow of excitation to downstream microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cardin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fishell and Kepecs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hahn et al., 2021</xref>). Our results also map different types of oscillations onto different interneuron types and link them with distinct switch states, which in the future may help to bring together rate- and oscillation-based experimental paradigms. They also provide mechanistic insight into the long held notion that slow oscillations assume an inhibitory function, while fast oscillations serve information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Singer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fries, 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microcircuit architecture</title><p>In this study, we developed a firing rate model of the visual cortical microcircuit. This model is based on pairwise connectivity between major neuron types in superficial and deep layers of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Using octuple whole-cell recordings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref> exhaustively mapped out the connectivity (excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) strength and connection probability) between a large number of morphologically defined neurons (interneurons and pyramidal cells) within and between layers 1, 2/3 (superficial), and 5 (deep) of the primary visual cortex of the mouse, while layers 4 and 6 were not included. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref> also quantified the relative prevalence of each cell type and reported synaptic plasticity properties of specific connections. Finally, based on their genetic makeup, different interneurons were labeled as PV cells (layer 2/3: basket cells and chandelier cells; layer 5: shrub cells and horizontally elongated cells), SST cells (layers 2/3 and 5: Martinotti cells), and VIP cells (only layer 2/3: bitufted cells and bipolar cells).</p><p>To convert the original connectivity data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref> for the connection probability matrix and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> for the weight [EPSP/IPSP] matrix) into a format suited for a computational model, we performed several manipulations. First, restricting our analysis to pyramidal cells and three major interneurons types (PV, SST, and VIP), we created a single connectivity matrix (<italic>C</italic>) by element-wise multiplication of EPSP/IPSP strength (i.e., mean amplitude) and connection probability matrices. To generate a single class of PV cells in each layer, we added the weights of basket cells and chandelier cells in the superficial layer and the weights of basket cells, shrub cells, and horizontally elongated cells in the deep layer. After inspection of the connectivity matrix, we noticed that out of the two existing VIP cell types, one VIP cell type preferentially targeted other neurons in L2/3 (bitufted cells), whereas the other only innervated L5 (bipolar cells). Based on this observation, we divided VIP neurons into VIP<sub>sup</sub> and VIP<sub>deep</sub> cell types, even though both types were anatomically located in the superficial layer.</p><p>Thus, we had four neuron types in both deep and superficial layers. Instead of modeling populations of neurons with <italic>N</italic> cells for each class, we modeled each cell population using a single firing rate-based neuron. However, we adapted the connectivity weights according to their relative prevalence, which is computationally less expensive. To this end, we first followed the general rule that there are roughly five times more pyramidal neurons in a microcircuit than interneurons. Therefore, all inhibitory weights in the matrix were scaled down by a factor of 0.2. Next, we multiplied the weights of each interneuron type with its relative prevalence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>).

Here, we used the Hill equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrell and Ha, 2014</xref>) to estimate the sensitivity of the output (<italic>y</italic>) to the input (<italic>x</italic>):<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the intercept, <italic>d</italic> is the maximum, <italic>k</italic> is the half-maximum of the output <italic>y</italic> and <italic>n</italic> is the Hill exponent (also denoted as <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> in the results section), which we used to quantify the response curves of SST cells to VIP and PV input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). If <italic>n</italic> = 1, the Hill curve is hyperbolic, whereas <italic>n</italic> &gt; 1 indicates a sigmoidal shape with growing slope (i.e., sensitivity) as <italic>n</italic> increases.</p><p>Hysteresis in general describes the dependence of a system’s behavior on the past and implicates the presence of memory. As a consequence, system responses observed when input is steadily increased differ from responses to decreasing input. To test for hysteresis, we computed response curves of all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) for ascending and descending VIP and PV input separately. For each input value (<italic>i</italic>), the rate response of all cells of the previous input value (<italic>i</italic> − 1) was used to initialize the cell rates for the new input value. In the presence of hysteresis, the response curves for increasing and decreasing input do not collapse. Hysteresis (<italic>h</italic>) was then quantified as the summed difference of the ascending and descending rate curves of the SST cells in superficial and deep layers.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Anatomical connectivity parameters.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Connection probabilities for different morphologically defined cell types, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review. Please note the reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. ]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Computational Properties of the Visual Microcircuit&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thilo Womelsdorf (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Although the reviewers expressed interest in the study, with some mixed enthusiasm, major issues were identified. Reviewers agreed that these preclude publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at present and would require a substantial amount of additional work to improve the manuscript. The main issues identified were the lack of input layers in the model, the dynamics of different neuron types and their impact on the system, and the idealization of the circuit as a single column. If you are able to address these points and the other points raised by the reviewers, <italic>eLife</italic> would welcome re-submission of this paper: This would be treated as a new submission, but would likely go to the same reviewers if it were to be sent out for review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors build a microcircuit of mouse primary visual cortex using connectivity data between four cell types (PV, SSt, Pyr, VIP) in two laminar compartments (superficial and deep). The authors then examine the influence of (1) Global increase in coupling (G), and (2) Specific drive to particular neurons. This basic microcircuit appears to capture some basic features of physiology, namely: (1) Increased high-frequency power in superficial layers and increased low-frequency power in deep layers (Figure 1), (2) Enhanced firing rates in deep layers. The main finding of the authors is that when they enhance drive to the VIP cells, there is a steep transition in the firing of SST cells, which they characterize as a bi-stable system. Overall, this study has merit in providing a quite extensive characterization of a canonical microcircuit, and the authors do a great job in linking their manipulations to experimental findings.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1) The authors describe the effect of driving VIP interneurons as disinhibitory. I'm confused. Figure 3 shows that the effect of driving VIP interneurons in pyramidal firing rates in superficial layers is largely suppressive, which seems to go against their main conclusion and experimental findings.</p><p>2) Noisy oscillations should be better defined. Are these noisy limit cycles or quasi oscillations?</p><p>3) The model provided by the authors has a stochastic drive and therefore exhibits noisy oscillations. It should be discussed whether similar results would have been obtained when using stochastic Wilson-Cowan models where each population consists of multiple neurons and the neurons have spiking output.</p><p>4) A limitation of the study is that Layer 4 is not modelled, and that the application of external drive appears somewhat arbitrary. In reality the external drive on PV and Pyramidal cells will likely be matched/balanced to some extent. However, Figure 5 applies a constant input to either PV or VIP cells which does not seem a realistic assumption. It would be hard to make reasonable assumptions on how the input drive to VIP cells looks like.</p><p>5) Related to this, the authors identify that the bi-stable switch appears to emerge in a particular regime of G. However, do we have any idea what the value of &quot;G&quot; in an actual circuit would be? Furthermore, should one not examine how the strength of external drive modulates the ability of the circuit to switch?</p><p>6) A very relevant study, Di Poppa et al. by Ken Harris lab, is only marginally discussed in this paper. However, that paper also provided a model of interactions between these cell classes and reports many findings on disinhibition and covariation between the cell types.</p><p>7) The authors should stress that this is a model of the MOUSE primary visual cortex. We know that the monkey visual cortex has quite different properties in terms of cell types, connectivity, lamination etc. It's unclear whether the mouse work bears any relevance for the monkey. The authors mix references to mice and monkey studies, but this should be made clear at all point. For instance, γ oscillations in monkeys have quite different signatures from the mouse in terms of frequencies. We can't really compare those in a straightforward way.</p><p>8) The study relies on the octo-patch data. However, that dataset was criticized quite severely in a commentary. Can references be made to other studies e.g. from Scanziani confirming some of these connectivity patterns?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an excellent, innovative, well written and comprehensive modeling study. The paper is made possible with detailed anatomical data that is only available recently about connectivity matrices and cell type distributions across layers. The study systematically shows how drive to VIP (feedback type) and PV (feedforward type) cell modulate a SST cell dependent inhibited and a PV dependent disinhibited state. The study mechanistically tracks down the source for the two separable states asymmetric self-inhibition and show how state transitions can be induced ('toggled'). The paper provides strong quantifiable predictions which is attractive for empirical people.</p><p>A weakness is that many assumptions are implicit and key findings are difficult to find in the large amount of data.</p><p>1. It is difficult to get a good understanding which G values are realistic for invite states and what they mean. There is a rate and power change for G of &lt; 100 (Figure 1), but then various interesting effects are occurring at G &gt;200 (effects of cell silencing).</p><p>What are the underling characteristics / mechanisms that determine g changes, i.e. changes in effective coupling strength? describing this more explicitly early in the results would enhance comprehensibility</p><p>2. The presentation of the key contributions of SOM and PV is ideally improved. Going through Figure 2 is highly interesting but time consuming because the many panels make this a dense figure. Can the two key results of the effects of PV silencing and SOM silencing be shown as a power vs frequency plot – identical to Figure 2C and D. So far, we only see the peak frequencies across G but this does not easily allow to appreciate the power spectral shape at a low (e.g. 50) or high (e.g. 450) G. In its current form it is not possible to confirm how wide the power spectral density peaks are.</p><p>3. The results are describing average effects and are surprisingly non-quantitative. There is not a single statistic used and error bars are lacking. While this seems justified in many cases it leaves the impression that there is no noise in the results and that they would be perfectly reproducible and robust across may conditions. How realistic is this and what would change if realistic noise is introduced?</p><p>When the authors address this question, it would be important to see an explicit definition of what a 'state' refers to. The paper describes many simulations where inputs are switched on constantly and with no apparent fluctuations. Is that realistically happening in real feedforward /feedbacK signal dynamics?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Using a Wilson-Cowen model, the authors look at the coupling between 8 neuronal populations (excitatory + 3 inhibitory) based on experimental connectivity of the L2/3 and L5 populations. They do a very thorough analysis of the oscillatory properties of this system under a set of assumptions. Even though they do not address computations directly, the results are interesting, and link to several hypotheses in the field on the generation of oscillatory behavior. However, I am not convinced that following the choices of parameters and approximations the model is a useful approximation of the biological circuit. I believe the authors need to do considerably more work to justify the choices of parameters and the implicit approximations used (or that they are irrelevant for the behaviours described).</p><p>Simplified models which abstract away a lot of the details are needed for theoretical understanding in neuroscience. However, arguments need to be made that the simplified model still maintains relevance for the system studied.</p><p>1. While the experimental results for connectivity included in the model are very detailed, they are not a complete description of the microcircuit. Most importantly, they lack a L4, which is the primary target of thalamic inputs, which is important if one studies studying evoked responses. They also lack a L6.</p><p>2. It is unclear how much of a cortical tissue would the model represent. If it is a small column, the authors need to justify the validity of studying it in isolation (rather than as a set of coupled microcircuits). If it corresponds to a significant fraction of an area, the authors need to justify the relevance of homogeneity assumption (that all neurons behave like the mean), or switch to methods representing heterogeneous populations.</p><p>3. While care was taken on the connectivity between individual populations, the input/output transformation is assumed identical. One would imagine that the effects studied of the circuit depend significantly on the intrinsic properties of the different cell types.</p><p>4. An unexpected choice for parameters for intrinsic time scales for the neurons involved which was only in the supplemental material on page 54: while the time scale for SST neurons is 30ms, for PV 7ms the time scale for the excitatory neurons is 3ms. I did try to follow the papers cited for this, but most are modeling papers, and in the experimental paper I did not find this justification. Much better referencing to the exact source of such data is needed. These choices are very different from the intrinsic membrane time constant for these cells.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Rate and Oscillatory Switching Dynamics of a Multilayer Visual Microcircuit Model&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Floris de Lange (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues identified by the first reviewer that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors addressed reasonably 4 out of the 5 original points.</p><p>Points 1 (lack of layers 4/6) and 2 (homogeneity of inputs/connections) are addressed, and they point to limitations of the model. Layer 4 is discussed but only as an input (while biologically it is strongly recurrently connected) and Layer 6 seems not to be discussed. Given the experimental data available I believe nothing needs to be studied in the results, but a small Discussion section with limitations could help put the work in context.</p><p>However, the point about time scales remains incredibly confusing to me.</p><p>A critical point is the reply from the authors:</p><p>&quot;To test the impact of such time constant differences, we systematically varied the synaptic time constants across different neuron types and examined the network oscillation frequency after VIP input (see the newly added Figures 5e-h, lines 355-375). The notable result was that the transition between a slow and high frequency oscillation remained clearly visible even when all neuron types had the same time constant. This supports the conclusion that the frequency switch is already engrained in the connectivity of the network and is only modified by differences in time constants.&quot;</p><p>Yet looking at figure 5h, for the same time constants (orange line) the transition is not clearly visible to me.</p><p>Another point which is somewhat confusing: looking at equation 1, $\tau$ seems to be better mapped to the membrane time constant and looking at equation 2 the synapses are instantaneous. Yet the authors point to choices of $\tau$ to synaptic not membrane time constants.</p><p>If I am interpreting correctly figure 5h, it seems that an important effect described disappears when the time constant for pyramidal neurons reaches 10ms, which is on the low end for the membrane time constant for excitatory neurons. A clear explanation why $\tau$ in equation 1 is mapped by the authors to synaptic rather than membrane time constant, and why the membrane time constant can be ignored when it is longer than the synaptic time constant is needed to understand the applicability of the model for biological circuits.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77594.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Indeed, VIP neurons are inhibitory, but the net effect of activating these neurons is contingent on the activity of SST neurons. The reason a disinhibitory peak cannot be found with lower G-values is that the SST rates are low and VIP/PV cells are more active, such that further drive to these cells only leads to a small further suppression of SST cells. As a consequence, there is no release from SST inhibition and VIP (or PV) cells start to inhibit PYR cells immediately. By contrast, when SST neuron rates are sufficiently high, the initial suppression of SST cells releases PYR neurons from inhibition and leads to a disinhibitory peak before the VIP/PV inhibition starts to inhibit PYR neurons again. Spontaneous SST rates are enhanced by larger G-values and thus the disinhibition in Figure 3a and b are solely seen for high G-values. We also provided external SST drive and now show that with more input the disinhibition also increases (Supplementary Figure 3b, lines 249-253).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerns:</p><p>1) The authors describe the effect of driving VIP interneurons as disinhibitory.

In reality the external drive on PV and Pyramidal cells will likely be matched/balanced to some extent. However, Figure 5 applies a constant input to either PV or VIP cells which does not seem a realistic assumption. It would be hard to make reasonable assumptions on how the input drive to VIP cells looks like.</p></disp-quote><p>To study the microcircuit, we applied drive to single cell types analogous to optogenetic stimulation to compare with the experimental literature and make predictions. As pointed out correctly this is not what may be happening under in vivo conditions in the neocortex, where all cell types get simultaneous input from other circuits or within the circuit such as the superficial layer from layer 4 in V1. However, this simultaneous input is not uniform to all cell types and is scaled as a function of input type. In mouse V1, it was found that layer 4 pyramidal cells preferably drive PV and other PYR cells in the superficial layer, skipping VIP cells but have little influence on SST cells (Adesnik et al., 2012, Nature). In contrast, feedback drive form higher order areas to the V1 superficial layer of mice targets mainly VIP cells and to a much lesser extent all the other cell types (Zhang et al., 2014, Science).</p><p>However, the reviewer’s concern is valid and therefore we have now added a new figure where we show the effect of stimulating all cell types in the superficial layer together, scaling the input to the different cell types to mimic drive from L4 or feedback input from the anterior cingulate cortex (Figure 9 and lines 469-489). We found that as G increased the activity of SST cell decreased compared to the other cell types and subsequently the network switched from an inhibited, slow oscillation dominated state, to a disinhibited state with high frequency oscillations. This is consistent with reports that visual stimulation of V1 replace slow oscillations by γ oscillations (Chen et al., 2017, Veit et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Related to this, the authors identify that the bi-stable switch appears to emerge in a particular regime of G. However, do we have any idea what the value of &quot;G&quot; in an actual circuit would be? Furthermore, should one not examine how the strength of external drive modulates the ability of the circuit to switch?</p></disp-quote><p>The second reviewer also raised a question about the meaning of ‘G’. Therefore, we elaborate on the meaning of the G-value in more detail in the results (see lines 113-120) and Discussion sections (lines 635-647). Also, based on the experimental literature we speculate in the discussion what values the G parameter may assume in the mouse V1 (lines 639-643).</p><p>To address the second concern, we applied a constant drive to all populations in the circuit and systematically varied its strength (see newly added Supplementary Figure 7). We found that stronger baseline activity enhanced the disinhibition effect and shifted SST response curves to higher values, while the slope of the sigmoidal curves remained unchanged. Thus, external drive does not introduce qualitative changes in network behavior and features such as a transition from ultrasensitivity to bistability are observed for a large range of input values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A very relevant study, Di Poppa et al. by Ken Harris lab, is only marginally discussed in this paper. However, that paper also provided a model of interactions between these cell classes and reports many findings on disinhibition and covariation between the cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>The paper of Di Poppa et al. is relevant to our study and we mention its experimental findings in relation to our results on lateral inhibition in the context of surround suppression ('Lateral inhibition switches circuit to the SST state' in the Results section). We now also cite it to discuss the potential G-values in mouse V1 in the new paragraph of the Discussion section (lines 639-643). However, it is important to note that in terms of modeling Di Poppa et al. fitted the connections to estimate effective interactions between cell populations under different experimental situations related to locomotion. By contrast, our study is based solely on anatomical connections and their weights as provided by the experimental literature (Jiang et al., 2015) and no fitting or adjustment of connections was performed, except for testing the causal role of specific links for microcircuit properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should stress that this is a model of the MOUSE primary visual cortex.

However, that dataset was criticized quite severely in a commentary. Can references be made to other studies e.g. from Scanziani confirming some of these connectivity patterns?</p></disp-quote><p>Anatomically, one of the main concerns of the Jiang et al. 2015 study pointed out by other experimentalists in a commentary was that recurrent connections between pyramidal cells were very weak or absent, which was related to the age of the animals. To test how recurrent excitation influences our results we parametrically changed the connection strength of the PYR cell self-connection. We curiously found that the switching dynamics of the circuit is fully preserved even in the absence of recurrent excitation (see lines 418-427). Moreover, more recurrent excitation only had a slight impact on the slope of sigmoidal response curves and reduced the frequency of the high-frequency oscillation during the disinhibited state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an excellent, innovative, well written and comprehensive modeling study.

The reason why we introduced the scaling factor G is that the empirical connectivity data provided by Jiang et al. (2015) only describe PSP strength and connection probability between pairs of single cells. However, in our simulations we modeled the activity of the entire population of each neuron class (interneuron types and pyramidal cells) using a single differential equation which mimics the mean firing rate of the entire population of a single neuron types. These differential equations were then coupled according to the connectivity matrix derived from single cell connections. However, a population of neurons has a much stronger impact on another population within the microcircuit than the impact of a single PSP on a single neuron. As we don't know the absolute size of each population in the circuit, we introduced the parameter G that scales the connections between the neurons. As this parameter increases, the interaction strength between the neuronal populations increases, which is analogous to increasing the absolute size of the cell class populations, or the number of cells per class. In the discussion we also speculate based on empirical results where the G-value of the V1 mouse cortex may lie.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The presentation of the key contributions of SOM and PV is ideally improved. Going through Figure 2 is highly interesting but time consuming because the many panels make this a dense figure. Can the two key results of the effects of PV silencing and SOM silencing be shown as a power vs frequency plot – identical to Figure 2C and D. So far, we only see the peak frequencies across G but this does not easily allow to appreciate the power spectral shape at a low (e.g. 50) or high (e.g. 450) G. In its current form it is not possible to confirm how wide the power spectral density peaks are.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. However, replacing the summary figures of Figure 2, where the peak frequency is shown as a function of G-values, would increase the number of figures considerably. As there are already a number of additional main figures added after the revision, we prefer to keep the current layout of Figure 2, and hope for the reviewer’s understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. the results are describing average effects and are surprisingly non-quantitative.

The paper describes many simulations where inputs are switched on constantly and with no apparent fluctuations. Is that realistically happening in real feedforward /feedbacK signal dynamics?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. In order to address this concern, we have added Supplementary Figure 8a-c. First, we added Gaussian white noise to all the cells in the model and measured the response of SST neurons after VIP input, as the switching properties can be seen most clearly here. It can be observed that the mean of 50 noise trial does not differ from a single noise free simulation (see Supplementary Figure 8a, lines 317-320).</p><p>Next, we added a different type of noise to the model by jittering the connectivity weights, as the empirical data in Jiang et al. (2015) are presented as mean and standard deviation. Jittering caused changes in the slope of sigmoidal response curves, but this type of jitter did not change the ultrasensitivity properties of the circuit per se (see Supplementary Figure 8b,c, lines 321-327).</p><p>Showing all the results in the presence of noise will make the figures rather unwieldy. Therefore, we think that it is sufficient to show that the key results do not change in the presence of noise, while leaving the rest of the figures unchanged.</p><p>In our manuscript, a state refers to a different excitation-inhibition balance, which is characterized by the prevalent activity of a specific interneuron type (lines 85-89). Here, we externally drove either SST or PV cells, analogous to optogenetic drive from outside, and found that when PV or VIP cells are strongly driven there was more excitation in the network as compared to SST cell drive, which overall inhibits the circuit much more strongly. If the network is in a relatively more excited state, passing activity from this network to further downstream circuits is easier than in more inhibited states.</p><p>These simulations were adapted to show what happens in case of optogenetic activation. However, in a more realistic scenario, bottom-up and top-down drive will activate all cell types simultaneously as shown experimentally, albeit with different weights (see e.g. Adesnik et al., 2012 for layer 4 drive to the superficial layer in mouse V1, or see Zhang et al., 2014 for top-down drive from the anterior cingulate to V1 in the mouse). Thus, we modeled such scenarios by driving all cell types simultaneously in the superficial layers weighted by empirical data (Adesnik et al., 2012 for bottom-up drive and Zhang et al., 2014 for top down drive). We found that both types of drive tend to suppress SST activity as G-values increase and lead to a transition from slow oscillator activity to a high frequency oscillation (Figure 9, lines 469-489), in accordance with experimental findings that both bottom up ('visual stimulation') and top-down activation ('attention) suppress slow oscillations in favor of a high frequency γ rhythm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Using a Wilson-Cowen model, the authors look at the coupling between 8 neuronal populations (excitatory + 3 inhibitory) based on experimental connectivity of the L2/3 and L5 populations. They do a very thorough analysis of the oscillatory properties of this system under a set of assumptions. Even though they do not address computations directly, the results are interesting, and link to several hypotheses in the field on the generation of oscillatory behavior. However, I am not convinced that following the choices of parameters and approximations the model is a useful approximation of the biological circuit. I believe the authors need to do considerably more work to justify the choices of parameters and the implicit approximations used (or that they are irrelevant for the behaviours described).</p><p>Simplified models which abstract away a lot of the details are needed for theoretical understanding in neuroscience. However, arguments need to be made that the simplified model still maintains relevance for the system studied.</p><p>1. While the experimental results for connectivity included in the model are very detailed, they are not a complete description of the microcircuit. Most importantly, they lack a L4, which is the primary target of thalamic inputs, which is important if one studies studying evoked responses. They also lack a L6.</p></disp-quote><p>The original connectivity matrix as reported by Jiang et al. (2015) indeed did not include layers 4 and 6. Even though the cell composition of layer 4 in mouse V1 has been studied in detail (Scala et al., 2019, Nat Comm), its connectivity with the other layers and their cell types is not known. To circumvent the problem and study the impact of layer 4 activation on the circuit, we modeled layer 4 input to the superficial layer based on a physiological study (Adesnik et al., 2012, Nature), which charted the EPSP strength in different cell types of the superficial layer after stimulation of L4. In our model, we thus applied excitatory input to all superficial neuron types that was scaled by weights provided by the empirical EPSP strength. We used a similar approach to model feedback input to the superficial layer of mouse V1 on the basis of similar experimental results obtained by Zhang et al. 2014 (Science), which reported EPSP strength of different cell types in V1 after stimulation of the anterior cingulate of the mouse. The results are shown in newly added Figure 9 (see also lines 469-489) showing that both bottom-up drive (visual stimulation) or top-down stimulation (e.g. attention) can switch the network from a low to a high frequency oscillation state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is unclear how much of a cortical tissue would the model represent. If it is a small column, the authors need to justify the validity of studying it in isolation (rather than as a set of coupled microcircuits). If it corresponds to a significant fraction of an area, the authors need to justify the relevance of homogeneity assumption (that all neurons behave like the mean), or switch to methods representing heterogeneous populations.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original paper by Jiang et al. (2015), the connectivity matrix was constructed for interneurons that were &lt;250 micrometers apart within a layer, as connectivity quickly dropped beyond this distance. Thus, our microcircuit model also covers a similar spatial extent in the horizontal plane. Note that the influence of neighbouring circuit was studied in our manuscript by driving SST cells externally, mimicking lateral inhibition mediated by horizontal connections in mouse V1 (see lines 384-396).</p><p>The connectivity matrix in Jiang et al. (2015) contained both mean values for the connectivity strength (PSP strength and connection probability) as well as their standard deviation. We used the mean connectivity throughout the paper, but now we have also added a figure (Supplementary Figures 8 b-c, lines 321-327) in which the weights were jittered. The results show that the ultrasensitivity is preserved, while the slope of the sigmoidal response curve in SST cells varies with the jitter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While care was taken on the connectivity between individual populations, the input/output transformation is assumed identical. One would imagine that the effects studied of the circuit depend significantly on the intrinsic properties of the different cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we added two parameters to the transfer function and varied their values systematically. The results are shown in Supplementary Figures 8d-e and demonstrate that one parameter does not qualitatively change the results, only shifting sigmoidal curves to the right, while the other parameter has an influence on whether the network shows an ultrasensitive response or bistability. This is discussed in the revised manuscript (see lines 328-335)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. An unexpected choice for parameters for intrinsic time scales for the neurons involved which was only in the supplemental material on page 54: while the time scale for SST neurons is 30ms, for PV 7ms the time scale for the excitatory neurons is 3ms. I did try to follow the papers cited for this, but most are modeling papers, and in the experimental paper I did not find this justification. Much better referencing to the exact source of such data is needed. These choices are very different from the intrinsic membrane time constant for these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very helpful comment. We are happy report that further analysis of this issue yielded surprising results. Indeed, in the modeling literature the existence of slow and fast oscillations is often assumed and mechanistically implemented as a difference of synaptic time constants of different inhibitory populations (see e.g. Hyafil et al., 2015, Mejias et al., 2016). To test the impact of such time constant differences, we systematically varied the synaptic time constants across different neuron types and examined the network oscillation frequency after VIP input (see the newly added Figures 5e-h, lines 355-375). The notable result was that the transition between a slow and high frequency oscillation remained clearly visible even when all neuron types had the same time constant. This supports the conclusion that the frequency switch is already engrained in the connectivity of the network, and is only modified by differences in time constants.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues identified by the first reviewer that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors addressed reasonably 4 out of the 5 original points.</p><p>Points 1 (lack of layers 4/6) and 2 (homogeneity of inputs/connections) are addressed, and they point to limitations of the model.

Given the experimental data available I believe nothing needs to be studied in the results, but a small Discussion section with limitations could help put the work in context.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this additional comment. We now added a section about anatomical limitations of our study to the discussion, mentioning that there is a lack of detailed information about the connectivity within layers 4/6.

A clear explanation why $\tau$ in equation 1 is mapped by the authors to synaptic rather than membrane time constant, and why the membrane time constant can be ignored when it is longer than the synaptic time constant is needed to understand the applicability of the model for biological circuits.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have recalculated Figure 5h to better depict the frequency changes with increase in VIP input. The figure shows now more clearly that while the disinhibition peak with enhanced frequency decreases with higher PYR time constants, it remains at approximately double the size of the SST dominated baseline activity before the disinhibition starts (see Results section, oscillations and switching dynamics section). The slower time constants of PYR cells also slows down all inhibitory cell types which have a joint effect on decreasing the peak (especially SST and PV cell time constants influence the peak, see Figure 5e-f).</p><p>We also followed the reviewer's advice and explained the meaning of time constants in the Wilson Cowan model in more detail in the methods section (population activity model section). In the Wilson-Cowan model, the time constant refers to the population of neurons and it is not possible to associate it to either synaptic or membrane time constants. Therefore, we have deleted all the references to 'synaptic' time constants in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
