senescence, leading to imbalanced tissue maintenance, cell death and compromised organ function. This is first observed in the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ that generates and selects T cells. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning these ageing processes remain unclear. Here, we show that mouse ageing leads to less efficient T cell selection, decreased self-antigen representation and increased T cell receptor repertoire diversity. Using a combination of single-cell RNA-seq and lineage-tracing, we find that progenitor cells are the principal targets of ageing, whereas the function of individual mature thymic epithelial cells is compromised only modestly. Specifically, an early-life precursor cell population, retained in the mouse cortex postnatally, is virtually extinguished at puberty. Concomitantly, a medullary precursor cell quiesces, thereby impairing maintenance of the medullary epithelium. Thus, ageing disrupts thymic progenitor differentiation and impairs the core immunological functions of the thymus.</p></abstract><kwd-group

alterations of cell type composition and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). The ageing process is characterised by an upregulation of immune-system-associated pathways, referred to as inflamm-ageing, which is a conserved feature across tissues and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benayoun et al., 2019</xref>). Ageing of the immune system first manifests as a dramatic involution of the thymus. This is the primary lymphoid organ that generates and selects a stock of immunocompetent T cells displaying an antigen receptor repertoire purged of pathogenic ‘Self’ specificities, a process known as negative selection, yet still able to react to injurious ‘Non-Self’ antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palmer, 2013</xref>). The thymus is composed of two morphological compartments that convey different functions: development of thymocytes and negative selection against self-reactive antigens are both initiated in the cortex before being completed in the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson and Anderson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klein et al., 2014</xref>). Both compartments are composed of a specialised stromal microenvironment dominated by thymic epithelial cells (TECs). Negative selection is facilitated by promiscuous gene expression (PGE) in TEC, especially so in medullary TEC (mTEC) that express the autoimmune regulator, AIRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sansom et al., 2014</xref>). This selection ultimately leads to a diverse but self-tolerant T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire.</p><p>Thymic size is already compromised in humans by the second year of life, decreases further during puberty, and continuously declines thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linton and Dorshkind, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palmer, 2013</xref>). With this reduced tissue mass, cell numbers for both lymphoid and epithelial cell compartments decline. This is paralleled by an altered cellular organisation of the parenchyma, and the accumulation of fibrotic and fatty changes, culminating in the organ’s transformation into adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shanley et al., 2009</xref>). Over ageing, the output of naive T cells is reduced and the peripheral lymphocyte pool displays a progressively altered TCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Egorov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thome et al., 2016</xref>). What remains unknown, however, is whether stromal cell states and subpopulations change during ageing and, if so, how these changes impact on thymic TCR selection.</p><p>To resolve the progression of thymic structural and functional decline, we studied TEC using single-cell transcriptomics across the first year of mouse life. We investigated how known and previously unrecognized TEC subpopulations contribute to senescence of the stromal scaffold and correspond to alterations of thymocyte selection and maturation. Our results reveal how the altered transcriptomes of mature TEC subtypes reflect the functional changes they are undergoing with advancing age. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the quiescence of TEC progenitors is a major factor underlying thymus involution. These findings have consequences for targeted thymic regeneration and the preservation of central immune tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Thymus function is progressively compromised by age</title><p>Thymus morphological changes were evident by 4 weeks of age in female C57BL/6 mice, including cortical thinning and the coalescence of medullary islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Using flow cytometry, we profiled developing thymocytes undergoing negative selection (Helios+: Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>), a process that can be partitioned into four key stages: (1) double positive thymocytes (Wave 1a: Helios+PD-1+), (2) immature CD4+/CD8+ single positive (SP) thymocytes (Wave 1b: Helios+PD-1+), (3) semi-mature CD4+/CD8+ SP thymocytes (Wave 2a: Helios+) and, (4) mature CD4+/CD8+ SP thymocytes (Wave 2b: Helios+; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, left panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daley et al., 2013</xref>). Across these stages, the frequency of negatively selected thymocytes varied with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, right panel). Specifically, negative selection of MHC class I restricted (i.e. CD8+ SP) thymocytes increased after the first week of life (Wave 1b) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b,c</xref>).

Using TCR-targeted bulk sequencing of the most mature CD4+ SP thymocytes (denoted ‘M2’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">James et al., 2018</xref>), we observed that 1-week-old mice exhibited shorter CDR3 lengths and a lower proportion of non-productive TCR α and β chain sequences than older mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e,f</xref>). V(D)J segment usage was altered by age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref>), which has the potential to reshape the antigen specificity repertoire of newly generated T cells. Approximately one-third of β chain V or J segments showed an age-dependent use (38% and 29%, respectively), illustrating the robustness of TCR V(D)J usage to thymic involution and the decline in thymocyte negative selection. Diversity of the TCR repertoire amongst the most mature thymocytes, however, increased significantly over age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), although not monotonically, along with the incorporation of more non-templated nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). The latter is inversely correlated with the post-puberty decline in the expression of thymocyte terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cherrier et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting an ageing-altered mechanism that is not intrinsic to the developing T cells.

The individual subtypes, which are also identifiable from two independent data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2020</xref>), were distinguished by the expression of marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 2). Among these were markers well established for different TEC populations (post-AIRE mTEC: <italic>Krt80, Spink5</italic>; Mature cTEC: <italic>Prss16, Cxcl12</italic>; mature mTEC: <italic>Aire</italic>, <italic>Cd52</italic>) and others that have been described more recently (Tuft-like mTEC: <italic>Avil, Trpm5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, each TEC subtype, as defined by its single-cell transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), did not segregate exclusively with a single cytometrically defined TEC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 3). For example, a subtype that we termed Intertypical TEC (<italic>Ccl21a, Krt5</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 3), and which was evident at all postnatal time-points, was composed of cells from each of the four cytometrically defined TEC subpopulations. Hereafter, for clarity, we refer to transcriptomically defined TEC clusters as subtypes and cytometrically specified TEC as subpopulations.</p><p>Four novel TEC subtypes were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 4): perinatal cTEC (marked by the expression of <italic>Syngr1</italic>, <italic>Gper1</italic>), Intertypical TEC (<italic>Ccl21a, Krt5</italic>) and two rare subtypes, termed neural TEC (nTEC: <italic>Sod3</italic>, <italic>Dpt</italic>) and structural TEC (sTEC, <italic>Cd177, Car8</italic>) based on their enrichment of neurotransmitter and extracellular matrix expression signatures (e.g. <italic>Col1a1, Dcn, Fbn1</italic>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>). Specifically, nTEC both lacked expression of <italic>Rest</italic> (RE1 silencing transcription factor), a transcriptional repressor that is typically expressed in all non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nechiporuk et al., 2016</xref>), and expressed genes silenced by REST (<italic>Snap25, Chga, Syp</italic>), markers shared in common with enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borges et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engelstoft et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, sTEC were marked by expression of numerous collagens and proteoglycans indicating a possible role in extracellular matrix maintenance within the thymus. Perinatal cTEC were derived almost exclusively from the cytometric cTEC population and expressed β−5t (encoded by <italic>Psmb11</italic>), which is both a component of the cortical thymoproteosome and a marker expressed by TEC progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ohigashi et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to sharing many of the classical cTEC markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <italic>Prss16, Cxcl12</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), perinatal cTEC were characterised by a highly proliferative transcriptional signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). In contrast, Intertypical TEC were present in both cortical and medullary subpopulations, and expressed gene markers associated with a progenitor-like TEC<sup>lo</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 4). Importantly, Intertypical TEC (including those derived from cortical subpopulations) displayed a restricted expression of β−5t yet had transcripts for other canonical cTEC markers (e.g. <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, <italic>Ctsl</italic>). This illustrates that the use of conventional cTEC FAC-sorting strategies, (e.g. selection on Ly51 expression) captures a highly heterogeneous mixture of cells. Moreover, we found that Intertypical TEC expressed markers concordant with previously described TEC populations that localise to the corticomedullary junction (CMJ), and have been ascribed with progenitor-like functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayer et al., 2016</xref>). These populations have variously been labelled as (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 4): junctional TEC (jTEC; Pdpn, Ccl21a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Onder et al., 2015</xref>), TPAlo (Ccl21a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michel et al., 2017</xref>) and Sca1+ (Ly6a, Plet1, Itga6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ulyanchenko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lepletier et al., 2019</xref>).

In contrast, Intertypical TEC displayed an opposite pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, left panel, dark green bars): their ageing-related decrease in cytokine signalling pathways contrasted with the stronger inflammatory signature characteristic of senescent tissues, a.k.a. inflamm-ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franceschi et al., 2006</xref>). In summary, mouse thymus involution is mirrored by alterations in both TEC subtype composition and transcriptional states.

PGE is facilitated in part by the protein AIRE, which leads to the expression or enhanced expression of tissue restricted antigen-genes (TRAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sansom et al., 2014</xref>).

We evaluated the dynamics of TEC differentiation by pulse-chase lineage tracing using 1, 4 and 16 week old 3xtg<sup>β5t</sup> mice for the analysis of mTEC and cTEC compartments that had been treated with doxycycline either 2 or 28 days earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The majority of cTEC in 1 week old mice were labelled after 2 days, yet this fraction declined considerably in treated 4-week-old mice, concordant with the loss of perinatal cTEC and an emergence of mature cTEC over this time interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>); a dynamic that tracked with the differential cellularity of cTEC over age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We noted an accumulation of mTEC 28 days after labelling 1-week-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), which declined for mice labelled at 4 weeks old, at the peak of mTEC cellularity, reflecting a high turnover of mTEC over this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dumont-Lagacé et al., 2014</xref>). These dynamics remained largely unchanged in 16–20 week old mice, concordant with observations of a longer half-life of mTEC across this age range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dumont-Lagacé et al., 2014</xref>). The accumulation of ZsG+ cells 2 days after doxycycline treatment in 16-week-old mice was not maintained 4 weeks later in either cTEC or mTEC, evident by an approximately twofold reduction in labelled TEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

Thymi were labelled at weeks 1, 4 and 16 and harvested 4 weeks later in triplicate, sorting ZsG+ and ZsG- cTEC and mTEC in equal numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). Droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing and graph-based clustering of single-cells revealed considerable heterogeneity across TEC. We annotated individual clusters into TEC sub-clusters that reflected our TEC subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> - labels); this captured the majority of our previously observed TEC phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">5</xref>). Amongst these sub-clusters we observed, and subsequently discarded, a group of cells whose shared expression of marker genes for both TEC and thymocytes was suggestive of physically interacting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). We discovered that most sorted ZsG+ cells were concordant with an Intertypical TEC phenotype across all ages and that their proportion increased with age in line with their relative accumulation in the ageing thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). We then evaluated the frequency of ZsG+ cells within each TEC subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Concordant with our lineage-tracing results, fewer ZsG+ mature cTEC (~30%) were captured from mice labelled at 1 week compared to older animals (≥80%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), in parallel with the shift from perinatal to mature cTEC in adult mice. The relative proportion of ZsG+ cells increased modestly in mature mTEC populations reflecting their longer half-life with advancing mouse age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dumont-Lagacé et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, the exception to this pattern was a decline in ZsG+ proliferating TEC, concordant with the quiescence of this dividing mTEC state and the accumulation of Intertypical TEC.</p><p>To examine how TEC differentiation is altered with age, we used diffusion pseudotime analysis to connect single-cell transcriptomes across cortical and medullary lineages, starting from the Intertypical TEC compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). We observed and removed from this analysis Intertypical TEC sub-clusters that showed a differential bias for either cortical (Intertypical TEC 3) or medullary (Intertypical TEC 1 and 2) lineages based on marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). We identified a single cortical trajectory and a bifurcating medulla lineage originating from the Intertypical TEC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). It has been established that cells can accumulate in meta-stable states along a differentiation trajectory and that the density of these cells is inversely related to the rate of their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haghverdi et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, we next followed the β−5t+ and β−5t- TEC states across age and examined how the density of cells changed in these meta-stable states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b,c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). While the cortical lineage demonstrated only a modest increase of ZsG+ cells at the most immature state by 16 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), for the medulla lineage we observed a considerable increase in ZsG+ cells over age in the earliest progenitor state (State 1 Poisson GLM p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>), and a concordant decline in mature mTEC (State 3 Poisson GLM p=7.25×10<sup>−60</sup>), consistent with a partial block during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). These earliest regions of density in both lineages corresponded to the Intertypical TEC four sub-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>).

We find that as ageing progresses, fewer CD4+ and CD8+ SP thymocytes are negatively selected. The combination of overall reduction in mTEC cellularity and the decline in PGE of TRAs likely reduces the efficiency of antigen presentation thus impacting negative selection which, in turn, results in an increase in TCR repertoire diversity with age. With single-cell transcriptomics we identified nine TEC subtypes, four of which were previously undescribed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 4). These subtypes are largely concordant with TEC subpopulations identified recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2020</xref>), but our investigation of mice at different ages has resolved the identity of some subpopulations that were amalgamated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, our data from 1-week-old mice provides a clear distinction between perinatal and mature cTEC. Similarly, our data from older mice demonstrates that Intertypical TEC (referred to as mTEC I in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2020</xref>) are composed of both cytometrically sorted cTEC and mTEC<sup>lo</sup> populations. This study’s refined categorisation of TEC subtypes highlights the insufficiency of previously established FACS-based and ontological TEC classifications, and should facilitate detailed investigations of their function using more specific markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 2). By tracking TEC types and states across the murine life course, we have found that mature TEC subtypes exhibit age-altered gene expression profiles similar to those observed across many other tissues and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benayoun et al., 2019</xref>), as well as replicating previous observations of reduced cell proliferation and changes in global architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ki et al., 2014</xref>). However, Intertypical TEC, a TEC subtype newly defined in this study, showed an opposing age-related pattern, with decreased expression in cytokine signalling pathways.</p><p>TEC progenitors have been described with distinctive molecular identities (e.g. β−5t expression) in the postnatal thymus where they dynamically expand and contribute to the mTEC scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleul et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ucar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ulyanchenko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). During mouse development these TEC progenitors arise from the endoderm of the third pharyngeal pouch (mid-gestation) and subsequently develop into lineage-restricted cTEC and mTEC progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamazaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ohigashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ripen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodewald et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shakib et al., 2009</xref>). The ability of β−5t+ TEC progenitors to expand and maintain the mTEC scaffold is progressively reduced in adolescent mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayer et al., 2016</xref>). Using lineage tracing, we revealed how adult medulla-biased Intertypical TEC arise from a β−5t+ TEC progenitor population and likely represent a precursor to mature mTEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). The sporadic expression of <italic>Psmb11</italic> amongst mTEC-biased Intertypical TEC could also explain the ZsGreen+ signal in these experiments. However, across multiple experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) we find that <italic>Psmb11</italic> is not universally expressed in Intertypical TEC, despite the fact that 75% of sorted ZsGreen+ cells from 8-20 week old mice are Intertypical TEC. Therefore, we conclude that the ZsGreen+ labelling of mTEC-biased Intertypical TEC most likely arises from a shared β−5t+ TEC progenitor state and that Intertypical TEC represent a previously missing precursor between β−5t+ progenitors and mature mTEC. Following this reasoning, we explored whether the potential restriction of mTEC differentiation was a consequence of the quiescence of these precursors. Using a combination of lineage-tracing, single-cell RNA-sequencing and pseudotime analysis we found that mTEC precursors in our data differentially accumulated in the ZsG+ fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b–d</xref>). Moreover, we observed that an mTEC-biased subset of Intertypical TEC accumulated in the ZsG- fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1e</xref>). In this experiment ZsG- Intertypical cells were either older than 4 weeks and thus had not been labelled, but had already begun to quiesce, or were derived from a separate β−5t- progenitor. The latter inference is compatible with the conclusion that mTEC differentiation from an Intertypical TEC precursor is restricted with age, but this model is unparsimonious as it requires that mTEC arise from two distinct progenitors, one that expresses <italic>Psmb11</italic> and another that does not, which converge on similar transcriptional programs. However, two lines of evidence suggest that this might indeed be the case: (1) ZsG cells are preferentially enriched in the medulla-biased Intertypical TEC two sub-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), which lacks <italic>Psmb11</italic> expression, unlike the other Intertypical TEC groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>), (2) we observed two differentiation trajectories amongst the mTEC arising from the Intertypical TEC compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>); the latter lineage is preferentially enriched for ZsG- mature mTEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). In sum, these observations indicate that the age-related expansion of Intertypical TEC is a direct consequence of their constrained differentiation into mature mTEC. Finally, our results beg the question of what molecular mechanism leads to Intertypical TEC quiescence and restricted mTEC differentiation? A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lepletier et al., 2019</xref>) suggests that TEC progenitors are re-programmed by interactions between BMP, Activin A and follistatin. In our data, <italic>Fst</italic> (encoding follistatin), <italic>Bmp4</italic> and <italic>Inhba</italic> (encoding Activin A) are specifically expressed in the Intertypical TEC 4sub-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). If the model proposed by Lepletier et al. is correct, then TEC progenitors may be the architects of their own malfunction.</p><p>The re-modelling of TEC maturation and the progression of inflam-ageing both alter thymus function and result in increased TCR diversity with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Concomitantly, two processes - diminution of mature TEC cellularity and blockage of TEC maturation - contribute to reduced presentation of self-antigens to developing thymocytes and thus to a less efficient negative selection. This impairment is in keeping with features of age-related thymic involution: its overall reduction in naive T-cell output and an increased release of self-reactive T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goronzy and Weyand, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palmer, 2013</xref>). To compound these effects, the involuting thymus is also rapidly purged of its distinctive perinatal cTEC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The consequences of this are likely to be a further loss of antigen presenting cTEC and reduced support of thymocyte maturation. Taken together, we expect that these TEC changes impair the maintenance of central tolerance and could explain, at least in part, the increased incidence of autoimmunity with advancing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Candore et al., 1997</xref>), in which the cumulative dysfunction of thymic central tolerance induction over time generates a slow drip feed of self-reactive T cells into the periphery. Moreover, CD4+ thymocytes have been shown to contribute to the maintenance of mature Aire+ mTEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irla et al., 2008</xref>), thus the overall decrease in CD4+ thymocyte cellularity with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) may also play a role in the loss of mature mTEC.</p><p>In summary, our results reveal how the altered transcriptomes of mature TEC subtypes reflect the functional changes they are undergoing with advancing age. An enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms that prevent progenitors from fully progressing towards mature mTEC should facilitate studies exploring therapeutic interventions that reverse thymic decline.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Female C57BL/6 mice aged 1 week, 4 weeks, 16 weeks, 32 weeks, or 52 weeks were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, and rested for at least 1 week prior to analysis. 3xtg<sup>β5t</sup> mice ﻿[β−5t-rtTA::LC1-Cre::CAG-loxP-STOP-loxP-ZsGreen] mice were used for lineage-tracing experiments as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayer et al., 2016</xref>).

Sequential steps of α- and β-chain rearrangement were simulated to model β-selection and double negative thymocyte maturation prior to negative selection. We uniformly sampled V(D)J segments from the C57BL/6 TCR locus. For the TCR β-chain, variable (V) and diversity (D) segments were randomly selected from available sequences. For joining (J) segments, the TRBJ1 locus was selected on the first attempt, and TRBJ2 if a second attempt to rearrange was made. Consequently, the matching TRBC segment was selected based on the J segment that was chosen (either TRBC1 or TRBC2). For the concatenation of each segment pair, that is V-J, V-D, VD-J, randomly selected nucleotides were inserted between the adjoining segments, based on sampling from a Poisson distribution with λ = 4. The productivity of the rearranged β-chain was determined by the presence of a complete open reading frame (ORF) beginning with a canonical start codon (‘ATG’) in the selected V segment that spanned the full V(D)J and constant segments. In the event of a failed rearrangement, a second attempt was made using the TRBJ2 and TRBC2 segments. If either of these attempts produced a valid TCR β-chain, then under the principle of allelic exclusion the simulation proceeded to the α-chain rearrangement. However, if the second rearrangement failed to produce a valid TCR β-chain, the process was repeated for the second allele.</p><p>For the TCR α-chain, variable (V) and joining (J) regions were randomly selected from the available TCRA sequences. Following the same principle as above, if the simulated rearrangement failed to generate a valid TCR with a complete ORF spanning the V segment to the constant region then the simulation switched to the second allele. A successful TCR germline was recorded only in the event of both valid α- and β-chains. The complete simulation resulted in a valid α-chain in 40.2% of simulations, and a valid β-chain in 63.1% of simulations.</p><p>To calculate sample sizes for our TCR-sequencing experiments we simulated 1 million ‘thymocytes’, and sub-sampled 10, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 and 100,000 cells, defined by a productive pair of TCR chains. To simulate replicates we ran these simulations with 10 different random initiations. To establish the required sample sizes, we calculated the proportions of V(D)J segment frequencies for α- and β-chains. Additionally, we calculated the TCR diversity at each sample size using the Shannon entropy across α- and β-chain CDR3 clonotypes, defined by the unique amino acid sequence.

To enhance the differences in the expression profile of individual TEC libraries, we first applied a text frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manning et al., 2008</xref>) to the gene-by-cell expression matrix. This transform enhances the signal from rarely expressed genes (of particular importance would be those that are promiscuously expressed in TEC), while also lessening the contribution from widely expressed genes. The transformed matrix represents the product of the gene-frequency and the inverse-cell-frequency. To compute this transformed matrix, we first assigned the gene-frequency matrix as the log2 of normalised gene-by-cell expression matrix (G<sub>f</sub> = log<sub>2</sub> (C); C is the normalised count matrix). Next, we computed the inverse-cell-frequency as the inverse frequency of detection of each gene (ICF<sub>x</sub> = log10 (N / (1+E<sub>x</sub>)); N is the number of cells, E<sub>x</sub> is the number of cells expressing gene <italic>X</italic>). Finally, the product of the gene-frequency matrix and inverse-cell-frequency was computed (GF_ICF = G<sub>f</sub> * ICF).

To assess the robustness of the clusters, we also clustered cells without the TF-IDF transform and using a series of alternate parameters. We computed a consensus matrix to determine how often the identified TEC subtypes co-clustered. We found that the identified TEC sub-types were robustly co-clustered regardless of the parameters of the clustering that was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Magali Irla (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use single cell analyzes of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) of mice at different ages to explore the mechanisms of thymic involution and its impact on T cell development. Thymic involution and change in the immune response with aging have been well documented, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, due in part to a lack of information about TEC heterogeneity and dynamics at different ages of thymus development and involution. The authors therefore address an important question. Although it was known that ageing alters TEC composition and transcriptional profile (Gray et al., 2006; Ki et al., 2014), the originality of this study relies on using scRNA-seq during ageing, providing a substantial amount of novel data on TEC biology. The current study identifies potentially interesting new subsets, including one termed &quot;intertypical TECs&quot; that expresses features of both cTEC and mTECs. However, the reviewers had a number of significant concerns about the presentation and interpretation of the data as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the study features some novel TEC populations (e.g. structural TECs, or n-TECs), the authors provide just two markers per cluster, without showing how homogeneously these markers are expressed within the specific cluster. Moreover, the study lacks validation of markers defining particular cell population by independent approaches. Similar lack of validation also applies for the main conclusions regarding changes in composition of TECs.</p><p>2) How do the authors reconcile the observation that they found 9 TEC subsets while Bornstein et al., 2018 only identified 5 TEC subsets (4 mTEC subsets and 1 cTEC subset) by scRNA-seq? Figure S3 compares Bornstein scRNA-seq data to the TEC subsets identified in the present study in different conditions (embryonic stages, Aireko, Pou2f2ko mice). The important data should be more clearly presented and discussed in the Results section. The legend for this Figure is confusing.</p><p>3) More characterization is needed for the novel &quot;intertypical TEC&quot; population described here. For example, do single TEC really do co-express <italic>Psmb11</italic> and <italic>Ccl21a</italic>, or is this TEC population merely a heterogenous cluster of cTEC and mTEC1? How do the intertypical TECs differ from previously described Ccl21+ cells or mTEC1 cells or jTECs, and what is their relationship with proliferating mTECs and mature mTECs? Figure 1 and their names suggest that intertypical TECs might give rise to proliferating mTECs and that they give rise to mature mTECs, however lineage tracing experiment shows intertypical and mature population to be highly ZsGreen positive, while proliferating mTECs are almost completely negative. How is the progenitor subset defined?</p><p>4) Potentially key data in the present study are from the lineage-tracing experiments in Figure 3 and 4, but the results here are difficult to interpret. Figure 3 isolates cells labeled in Psmb11-constrained Cre mice (termed 3xtg) after 48h, subjects them to scRNA-seq, and concludes that many labeled cells are what the authors call intertypical cells, including some cTEC and also cells termed by others as mTEC I that express <italic>Ccl21a</italic>. Figure 4 studies thymic epithelial cell populations 4 weeks after labeling, at different ages. However, labeling of populations at different ages is not assessed at early times, but only after 4 weeks. The authors do show expression of <italic>Psmb11</italic> in the scRNA-seq, but this does not establish that similar populations were labeled and at equivalent efficiency. This is the biggest omission in this work, that if rectified would greatly improve the work.</p><p>5) Additionally, the results are sometimes presented in a cryptic fashion, making it difficult to evaluate key aspects of the study. Several supplementary figures are of poor resolution (S1A, S1C, S5, S8B, S8C, S8D, S12C-F). They contain important data that cannot be properly evaluated. Moreover, there is an enormous amount of information – some of it important – in the supplemental information, that would benefit from being included in the main paper. This includes details of TRAs whose expression changes with age, and some important information for the lineage tracing experiments.</p><p>6) In its current form, the manuscript does not provide strong evidence that any of these described populations are progenitors, and the conclusion that differentiation is compromised with age, is therefore weak. The authors should be encouraged to discuss alternative interpretations of their data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56221.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the study features some novel TEC populations (e.g. structural TECs, or n-TECs), the authors provide just two markers per cluster, without showing how homogeneously these markers are expressed within the specific cluster.

Similar lack of validation also applies for the main conclusions regarding changes in composition of TECs.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript places greater emphasis on Supplementary file 1-table 2 (from the original manuscript) containing the full list of marker genes for each cluster, including <italic>p</italic>-values. The main text of the original submission necessarily can discuss only a subset of these. We have now amended this table to demonstrate the homogeneity of marker gene expression. It now includes statistics related to marker gene expression both within and outside of the cluster (specifically, mean expression and percentage non-zero expression within/outside of the cluster).</p><p>With regard to independent validation of markers, we now present 3 lines of evidence that fully support (a) our identification of 9 TEC populations, and (b) genes whose expression is enriched within these populations:</p><p>1) In two revised Figures (Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 2) we now provide independent replication of our TEC types in two separate mouse data sets, namely those of Bornstein et al. (Bornstein et al., 2018) and Park et al. (Park et al., 2020) (also relevant to (2) below). These studies were performed independently in different institutes, involving mice of different ages and genders, and were analysed using different computational workflows. Both studies also used single-cell mRNA sequencing to study TEC heterogeneity owing to this technique’s unrivalled high throughput and predictive power.</p><p>2) Single antibody experiments were unable to discriminate the 9 TEC populations for 3 reasons: (i) These cells’ marker proteins are commonly extracellular or intracellular, rather than being cell-surface. For example, the Intertypical TEC subtype marker <italic>CCL21a</italic> is secreted resulting in a diffuse staining pattern by IHC. (ii) Marker protein levels are not always expressed in an age-independent manner. For example expression of Ly51, the well-established canonical marker of cTEC, varies considerably across the life-course, yielding sorted populations that contain both mature cTEC and Intertypical TEC, increasingly so in older mice. (iii) The unavailability of high-quality and/or informative reagents. We tested 18 protein-assay combinations (14 antibodies targeting 13 proteins by either histology and/or flow cytometry), of which 10 were technically successful (i.e. provided a signal above background noise levels). These proteins were: for histology, CD177 (2 different clones), Lifr, Cytokeratin5, Cytokeratin8 and <italic>CCL21a</italic>, and for flow cytometry, CD177, L1cam, <italic>Mmp2</italic> and CD142. We further tested antibodies against CD52, Tagln, Dcamkl1, Itgb4 and CD271, which did not yield signals above background staining. To assist the TEC research community we provide full details of these antibodies and assays in Supplementary file 1-table 3.</p><p>3) The compositional changes we observe are concordant with a previous report (Rode, et al. J Immunol 2015). In pre-pubescent mice, cTEC are initially the most abundant epithelial cell subpopulation. At approximately 4 weeks of age the cellularity of mTEC is the largest and thereafter their number (and consequently the size of the medulla) declines, whereas the cTEC scaffold expands in parallel. In this manuscript, we considerably extend this knowledge by demonstrating that cTEC in 1-week old mice are transcriptomically distinct from cTEC in older mice. Moreover, we show that the cytometrically isolated cTEC includes perinatal cTEC, mature cTEC and Intertypical TEC, a composition that changes with age. The division of Intertypical TEC across commonly used flow cytometric gates further illustrates the challenges in validating TEC subpopulation shifts using flow cytometry and a limited set of informative cell surface markers.</p><p>For these 3 reasons, we believe that high-dimensional single-cell methods are the only currently-available approach able to definitively resolve TEC heterogeneity.</p><p>The revised manuscript now directly addresses these points:</p><p>– Additional information concerning marker gene heterogeneity is present in Supplementary file 1-table 2 (as described above).</p><p>– New Supplementary file 1-table 3 details our FACS/Histology assays that sought to validate markers.</p><p>– The main text and Figure 2 have been modified to further clarify these issues:</p><p>“Our analysis revealed 9 TEC subtypes (Figure 2b,c), thus providing a greater richness of epithelial states than previously appreciated (Bornstein et al., 2018, Park et al., 2020) (Figure 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 2) and a greater diversity than the 4 phenotypes cytometrically defined and selected in this study (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-B).

The important data should be more clearly presented and discussed in the Results section. The legend for this Figure is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for highlighting this important distinction between the two studies. We performed an independent clustering on data using, for consistency, the identical approach that we had taken with our own data. (Note that we could not take advantage of the identity of TEC subsets in the Bornstein et al. dataset as this information is not publicly available.) This independent clustering, which was described in our original submission, revealed using the Bornstein et al. dataset the presence of 9 TEC clusters that were highly concordant with the findings from our own clustering of TEC across the mouse life course (data from this study).</p><p>Our most recent (i.e. new) analysis demonstrates the consistent and independent replication of these 9 TEC subtypes now across 3 mouse data sets: wild-type epithelial cells from Bornstein et al., epithelial cells from Park et al., and our TEC data from this mouse ageing study. More specifically, we trained a k-nearest neighbour classifier using either the mouse TEC from Park et al. or the mouse TEC in our ageing study, and used these to classify the single TEC from Bornstein et al. The results of this cross-classification analysis are presented in two new figures (Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 2), and data complements our previous Table 1 (now Supplementary file 1-table 4). This latest analysis demonstrates an independent replication of the TEC subtypes across 3 data sets, and further provides a mapping between the different naming schema (new Figure 2 —figure supplement 2).</p><p>Furthermore, we note that the higher temporal resolution of our ageing time course has empowered the identification of the Perinatal cTEC subtype. We classified a small number of these cells within both the Bornstein et al. data from 6 day old mice (n=5), and the young TEC from Park et al. (n=4), both sets of which are disproportionately derived from 6 day old mice, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> (Left-Bornstein et al., Right-Park et al.):</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56221-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, we identified 2 rare populations of mouse TEC: sTEC and nTEC. nTEC have also been described recently by Park et al., 2020.These new analyses are now presented in the revised manuscript:</p><p>– Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 include river plots that reconcile the mapping between TEC identities described by independent single cell TEC studies.</p><p>– Text as quoted under essential revision point 1) above.</p><p>– New text:</p><p>“With single-cell transcriptomics we identified 9 TEC subtypes, 4 of which were previously undescribed (Supplementary file 1-table 4).

For example, do single TEC really do co-express Psmb11 and Ccl21a, or is this TEC population merely a heterogenous cluster of cTEC and mTEC1? How do the intertypical TECs differ from previously described Ccl21+ cells or mTEC1 cells or jTECs, and what is their relationship with proliferating mTECs and mature mTECs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated the description of Intertypical TEC to clarify their gene markers and their relationship with previously published subpopulations including mTEC I and jTEC (Supplementary file 1-table 4: previously Table 1). Accordingly, Intertypical TEC can be described as <italic>Ccl21a+Ly6a+Pdpn+Plet1+</italic> as listed in Supplementary file 1-table 4 (previously Table 1). We show the correspondence between Intertypical TEC and mTEC I in River Plots (new Figure 2D and new Figure 2—figure supplement 3). From these it should be evident that this TEC population is not a heterogeneous mixture of cTEC and mTEC I.</p><p>Regarding the co-expression of <italic>Psmb11</italic> and <italic>Ccl21a</italic>, these genes are co-expressed in a subset of Intertypical TEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). It is important to note that β-5t-marked cells do not concurrently express <italic>Psmb11</italic>. This arises from differing dynamics between the cortical and medullary lineages, whereby cTEC-committed cells consistently up-regulate <italic>Psmb11</italic>, which is sustained in their mature state (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). In contrast, cells committed to the medullary lineage pass through a transient state, that includes the expression of <italic>Psmb11</italic>, which is then down-regulated (Figure 7E). Thus, we do not expect a strong constitutive co-expression of both <italic>Psmb11</italic> and <italic>Ccl21a</italic> as a marker of a distinct TEC population.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Co-expression of <italic>Psmb11</italic> and <italic>Ccl21a</italic> in single TEC.</title><p>Expression in single TEC of (a) <italic>Psmb11</italic> , (b) <italic>Ccl21a</italic> , (c) both (<italic>Psmb11</italic>+/<italic>Ccl21a</italic>+; blue), and (d) expression levels of <italic>Psmb11</italic> vs. <italic>Ccl21a</italic>, with TEC subtype indicated by colour.

How is the progenitor subset defined?</p></disp-quote><p>Our lineage tracing experiments indicate that the progression of mTEC differentiation proceeds from medulla-biased Intertypical TEC through a proliferative state to mature mTEC (Figure 5E, Figure 6C, Figure 7, Figure 7—figure supplement 1). We apologise that our original submission unintentionally misled the reviewers: proliferating mTECs are not “almost completely [ZsGreen] negative”. We now further clarify these issues in the revised manuscript, specifically by improving Figures 6 and 7 and associated supplemental Figures. These show results from the larger lineage tracing with single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis and demonstrate that whilst the labelling of Proliferating TEC declines modestly with age, approximately 60% of cells in this group remained labelled 4 weeks after doxycycline treatment (Figure 6E).</p><p>This new lineage tracing experiment demonstrated that Intertypical TEC derive from both β5t-positive and -negative precursors, and that Intertypical TEC represent a heterogeneous population expressing varying levels of <italic>Pdpn</italic>, <italic>Ccl21a</italic> and <italic>Psmb11</italic> (Figure 7E, Figure 6—figure supplement 5, Figure 7—figure supplement 3). We expect that these cells represent common states in TEC differentiation, rather than discrete cell types in the conventional sense, namely separate thymic epithelial subtypes that represent terminally differentiated TEC. Moreover, it is evident that Intertypical TEC sub-clusters represent lineage-biased states: for example, Intertypical TEC-3 express more cTEC-like markers and Intertypical TEC-1 and -2 express more mTEC-like markers (Figure 6—figure supplement 5). For the subsequent differentiation trajectory analysis we inferred that the Intertypical TEC-4 population as being the progenitor group based on: i) enrichment of <italic>Pdpn</italic>+ and <italic>Ly6a+</italic> (Figure 7E and Figure 6—figure supplement 5 and Figure 7—figure supplement 3), after which there is transient expression of <italic>Psmb11</italic>+ (Figure 7E) – these genes have previously been described as markers of TEC progenitors, and, ii) their position at the apex of the bifurcation between cTEC and mTEC lineages (Figure 7—figure supplements 1 and 2).</p><p>Our revised manuscript now contains far greater detail in contrast to our initial description of the Intertypical TEC population:</p><p>“In contrast, Intertypical TEC were present in both cortical and medullary subpopulations, and expressed gene markers associated with a progenitor-like TEC<sup>lo</sup> phenotype (Supplementary file 1-table 4). […] Together, these results suggest: (i) that previous classifications annotated a heterogeneous population containing Intertypical TEC, and (ii) that Intertypical TEC might provide the progenitors of mature mTEC found at high density at the CMJ (Onder et al., 2015, Michel et al., 2017, Ulyanchenko et al., 2016, Lepletier et al., 2019, Mayer et al., 2016; Supplementary file 1-table 4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Potentially key data in the present study are from the lineage-tracing experiments in Figure 3 and 4, but the results here are difficult to interpret.

In the revised submission, we strengthen the case that the change in TEC differentiation dynamics is a consequence of ageing by providing additional information on: 1) the differences in labelled cells across all EpCAM+ cTEC and mTEC following either a 2 or 28 day chase period after doxycycline treatment, and 2) the dynamics of labelling as a function of age (Figure 6A and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). The majority of (ZsG+) labelled TEC after 48hours at all ages are cTEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>), in line with the constitutive expression of <italic>Psmb11</italic> in this TEC compartment. Notably ~60% of all cTEC are labelled after 2 days post dox-treatment in 1 week old mice (top), whilst the equivalent mTEC is close to 0%. The percentage of cells labelled in the cTEC then drops quickly to ~25% in 4 week old mice (middle), and to 25-40% in 16 week old mice (bottom), in accordance with the observed fluctuations in cTEC numbers in the thymus and the switch from perinatal to mature cTEC (Figure 3B). Concerning the mTEC of mice treated at 1 week, after 28 days ~25% of mTEC are labelled, which is equivalent to the number of labelled cTEC, and suggests a progressive accumulation of label in the mTEC compartment that is specific to the first 28 days of mouse life. From 4 weeks onwards, the percentage of labelled mTEC remains consistently low, in line with our current and previous [Mayer et al.] conclusions that the efficiency or extent of contribution to mTEC differentiation from β5t-positive precursors that are physically present at the CMJ is reduced with age.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56221-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It is important to emphasise that these results are consistent across replicates (<italic>n</italic>=5 per experiment) and that they illustrate the highly dynamic nature of TEC differentiation. This latter point is now highlighted in Figure 6A, which shows the dynamics of ZsGreen labelling over age for the different chase periods. The initial high labelling of cTEC in 1 week old mice after 2 days, gives way to a more consistent labelling across older mice and the period of time used for the chase, findings that are again concordant with a constitutive expression of <italic>Psmb11</italic>.Furthermore, in Figure 6A we observe that the percentage of labelled mTEC 2 days post dox treatment increases monotonically (i.e. progressively in the same direction) from 1 to 4 to 16 weeks, consistent either with a subset of mTEC being derived continuously from a β5t-positive progenitor, and/or there being an increase in promiscuous expression of <italic>Psmb11</italic> amongst mature mTEC, and/or there being an accumulation of ZsGreen labelling with age.</p><p>Consequently, our revised manuscript now contains further details on lineage tracing (including Figure 6A and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and the section entitled Ageing compromises the differentiation of Intertypical TEC into mature mTEC has been revised extensively:</p><p>“Our current and previous observations indicate that TEC differentiation is highly dynamic across the mouse life course (Figure 3B,C (Mayer et al., 2016)). […] The accumulation of ZsG+ cells 2 days after doxycycline treatment in 16 week old mice was not maintained 4 weeks later in either cTEC or mTEC, evident by an approximately 2-fold reduction in labelled TEC (Figure 6A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Additionally, the results are sometimes presented in a cryptic fashion, making it difficult to evaluate key aspects of the study. Several supplementary figures are of poor resolution (S1A, S1C, S5, S8B, S8C, S8D, S12C-F). They contain important data that cannot be properly evaluated. Moreover, there is an enormous amount of information – some of it important – in the supplemental information, that would benefit from being included in the main paper. This includes details of TRAs whose expression changes with age, and some important information for the lineage tracing experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise.

In addition, and to highlight the decline in mTEC function, we have presented the results on age-dependent changes in mTEC TRA promiscuous gene expression in a new Figure 4 (previously supplementary figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In its current form, the manuscript does not provide strong evidence that any of these described populations are progenitors, and the conclusion that differentiation is compromised with age, is therefore weak. The authors should be encouraged to discuss alternative interpretations of their data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. Accordingly, we have now revised our manuscript extensively to include lineage tracing information and new analyses whose results support our previous conclusions. Specifically: (1) We show that perinatal cTEC express <italic>Psmb11</italic>, a marker expressed in thymic progenitors (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). (2) Moreover, we demonstrate that mTEC arise from a medulla-biased Intertypical TEC pool, and both are derived from a β5t+ precursor TEC state (Figure 5d-e, 6c, 7a-d). (3) We have revised our previous Figure 4 (now new Figures 6 and 7) which now also contain associated lineage tracing data and a new pseudotime analysis. These figures show that mTEC are most likely derived from one or more Intertypical TEC states and these share a β5t+ common progenitor. Our available data suggests that this common progenitor may be enriched within the Intertypical TEC-4 population. Experimental confirmation of this hypothesis would require further lineage tracing from an entirely new transgenic model and thus is out of scope for this submission. Intriguingly, we also observed an accumulation of ZsG negative cells in a specific Intertypical TEC state (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) that likewise represents an mTEC precursor based on our pseudotime analysis. We believe that this could represent a second differentiation trajectory within the mTEC lineage or a population of very long-lived quiescent Intertypical TEC.</p><p>In response, to reflect additional complexities that our experiments suggest we now discuss alternative possible explanations:</p><p>“TEC progenitors have been described with distinctive molecular identities (e.g. β-5t expression) from the postnatal thymus where they dynamically expand and contribute to the mTEC scaffold (Bleul et al., 2006; Ucar et al., 2014; Ulyanchenko et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2014). […] If the model proposed by Lepletier et al. is correct, then TEC progenitors may be the architects of their own malfunction.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
