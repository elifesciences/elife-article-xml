There is increasing evidence that signaling during development between these distinct cell types plays an important role in ensuring the appropriate identity and number of cells in the fully formed adult organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ribatti and Santoiemma, 2014</xref>). A particularly well-studied example of such heterotypic interactions occurs during the development of the vertebrate limb, where signals are exchanged between the apical ectodermal ridge and the underlying mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delgado and Torres, 2017</xref>).</p><p>While vertebrate limbs are relatively complex structures, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing-imaginal disc, the larval primordium of the adult wing and thorax, is ideally suited to the study of cell–cell interactions in the context of organ development because of its relative simplicity and amenability to genetic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waddington, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neto-Silva et al., 2009</xref>). The wing-imaginal disc is composed of epithelial cells that form a sac-like structure (comprising the columnar cells of the disc proper and the squamous cells of the peripodial epithelium [PE]) and a population of adult muscle precursors (AMPs) that resides between the epithelial cells of the disc proper and the underlying basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The epithelial portion of the disc derives from a primordium of approximately 30 cells from the embryonic ectoderm that are specified during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mandaravally Madhavan and Schneiderman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Worley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Requena et al., 2017</xref>). The AMPs, originally referred to as adepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poodry and Schneiderman, 1970</xref>), represent a subset of cells from the embryonic mesoderm that generate the adult flight muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bate et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandes et al., 1991</xref>). The AMPs underlie the dorsal portion of the wing disc epithelium, the notum, which is the primordium of the dorsal thorax. During metamorphosis, these AMPs generate multiple muscle fibers that comprise the direct and indirect flight muscles (DFMs and IFMs, respectively) (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bothe and Baylies, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunage et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laurichesse and Soler, 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Temporal cell atlas of the developing wing-imaginal disc.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development: embryo (E), larval phases (L1–L3), pupa, and adult.

The AMPs are generated by an asymmetric division of a muscle founder cell during embryogenesis; one daughter cell becomes an AMP while the other generates precursors of larval muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bate et al., 1991</xref>). In the second thoracic segment, dorsal clusters of AMPs, which express a segment-specific combination of Hox genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roy and VijayRaghavan, 1997</xref>), become associated with the wing disc, remain in the notum region, and proliferate via symmetric cell divisions. At the onset of the third larval instar (L3), the AMP cells switch to a pattern of asymmetric cell division as a result of Wingless (Wg; Wnt ligand) and Notch signaling interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>). The precursors of the indirect and direct flight muscles can be distinguished by higher levels of expression of the transcriptional regulators Vestigial (Vg) or Cut (Ct), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>). The elevated Vg expression in the IFM precursors is maintained by expression of Wg ligand from the notum epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sudarsan et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Two large questions central to the mechanisms that regulate proliferation and cell fate specification in the AMPs, however, remain largely unanswered. First, what regulates the location and number of AMPs? It has been suggested that the notum acts as a ‘dynamic niche’ that both regulates the survival of AMPs and guides their specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunage et al., 2017</xref>). However, the signals emanating from the epithelial cells to either regulate AMP numbers or maintain them in the notum region of the wing disc have not been identified. Second, it is known that the AMPs contribute to the formation of several complex muscle types: How are different AMP types specified? It has been proposed that extrinsic signals from the disc epithelium function during the larval stage to direct subsets of the AMPs to become precursors of specific types of muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunage et al., 2017</xref>). However, with the exception of Wg, such signals remain unidentified.</p><p>Single-cell transcriptomics provides a powerful strategy for mapping the cellular composition of developing organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schier, 2020</xref>), including vertebrate appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fabre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feregrino et al., 2019</xref>), and has been successfully utilized for characterizing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc at single snapshots during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bageritz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zappia et al., 2020</xref>).

Since spatial information is lost in most prevalent scRNAseq protocols, computational methods are used to infer it, usually based on the expression of landmark genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Satija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karaiskos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bageritz et al., 2019</xref>). Complementary to spatial localization are approaches that have examined the expression of receptors, ligands, and downstream molecules to predict which cell subsets interact and by what mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vento-Tormo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browaeys et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The combination of these approaches, namely estimating the physical context of each cell and investigating the expression of extracellular cues such as receptor–ligand pairs, provides an unparalleled advantage for studying organ development. Here, we couple these two approaches to identify heterotypic interactions that are crucial for disc development, focusing on signaling between the disc epithelium and the AMPs. To this end, we collected single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) data from two developmental time points, derived a comprehensive view of cell subsets and their spatial organization, and examined the expression of receptors and ligands. We show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands emanating from the disc epithelium create an AMP niche that regulates AMP numbers and restricts them to the region of the notum. Furthermore, we find that Hedgehog ligand from the disc epithelium specifies a unique subpopulation of AMPs and identified novel Hh-target genes, <italic>Neurotactin (Nrt)</italic> and <italic>midline</italic> (<italic>mid)</italic>, which are induced during the last phase of larval development. Beyond these examples, our annotated dataset provides a resource for spatiotemporal cellular composition in the developing wing disc and points to additional potential heterotypic interactions between epithelial cells and AMPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a temporal cell atlas of the developing wing-imaginal disc</title><p>The wing disc is composed of multiple cell types, including the columnar cells of the disc proper, the squamous cells of the PE, and the mesoderm-derived AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, the wing disc is in intimate contact with branches of the tracheal system and circulating blood cells called hemocytes. With the goal of generating a spatiotemporal atlas of the developing wing disc, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to collect transcriptional profiles of cells at mid and late third instar, which correspond to 96 and 120 hr after egg lay (AEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Two biological replicates were obtained at each time point that, after filtering for low-quality cells, generated data from 6922 and 7091 cells in the 96 hr samples and 7453 and 5550 cells in the 120 hr samples.

We observed expression of a similar set of marker genes in each of these cell types to those described by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bageritz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zappia et al., 2020</xref>). Altogether, we recovered profiles for 19,885 AMPs, 7104 wing disc epithelial cells, 15 tracheal cells, and 12 hemocytes. Notably, our dataset shows an overrepresentation of AMPs, probably the result of our collagenase-based dissociation protocol (see Materials and methods) that dissociated AMPs far more effectively than epithelial cells. This enrichment of AMPs has enabled an especially detailed analysis of this cell type, which has previously received less attention. Unlike bulk RNA-sequencing approaches that would average changes in gene expression across multiple cell types, we were able to observe expression changes between 96 and 120 hr that occurred in both the epithelium and the AMPs together, as well as those changes that were confined to either the epithelial cells or the AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Major transcriptional differences between epithelial cells reflect their proximodistal position</title><p>To search for the signals that might be exchanged between the epithelium and the AMPs, we first characterized the cell types within each of these populations separately. The wing disc epithelium is often divided into four broad domains – the notum, hinge, pouch, and PE – based both on morphology and gene expression patterns. The genes encoding the transcription factors <italic>nubbin</italic> (<italic>nub</italic>) and <italic>Zn finger homeodomain 2</italic> (<italic>zfh2</italic>) were used to define the pouch and hinge, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zirin and Mann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Terriente et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayala-Camargo et al., 2013</xref>). Expression of these proteins is shown for wing discs at 96 and 120 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>). To characterize the epithelial compartment, we clustered the cells and then classified these clusters as originating from the larger domains of notum, hinge, pouch, and PE based on the expression patterns of marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Many of these genes were already expressed in a domain-specific manner by 96 hr, suggesting that cells in the epithelium had already been partitioned into these domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>The proximodistal axis was a primary feature in stratifying cells within our analysis, while the anteroposterior axis separated the data to a lesser degree.

Notably, in <italic>htl</italic> mutants and in <italic>ths</italic> and <italic>pyr</italic> double mutants, mesoderm cells are still present within the embryo, but they accumulate in multilayered arrangements instead of a monolayer along the ectoderm (as observed in wild-type embryos) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beiman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stathopoulos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kadam et al., 2009</xref>). These observations suggest that FGF signaling might be primarily needed for proper mesoderm spreading rather than for cell proliferation and survival. By analogy, Ths and Pyr may regulate the localization of AMPs relative to the epithelium.</p><p>To examine the consequences of interfering with FGF signaling within the larval wing disc, we perturbed the expression of Pyr and Htl. To disrupt Pyr expression within the epithelial tissue, we utilized an <italic>apterous</italic> (<italic>ap</italic>) Gal4 driver (<italic>ap-Gal4</italic>) that expresses in the entire dorsal compartment of the disc proper, including all of the epithelial cells that overlie the AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>). Expressing an RNAi that targets <italic>pyr</italic> with this <italic>ap-Gal4</italic> driver resulted in a reduction in AMPs and an obvious increase in apoptosis (visualized using anti-Dcp1), primarily observed in the more ventral- and posterior-localized AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). A likely explanation for this result is that <italic>pyr</italic> knockdown within the wing disc restricts AMP survival to the Ths-expressing region of the dorsal notum as Pyr and Ths have been noted to have partially redundant functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stathopoulos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kadam et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, this result suggests that sufficient Ths cannot reach this region of the notum to compensate for the knockdown of Pyr at physiological levels of Ths expression. We next tested if the Ths and Pyr receptor Htl is required within the AMPs. Using the AMP-specific driver <italic>15B03-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), we expressed an RNAi for <italic>htl</italic> and observed an obvious decrease in the number of AMPs following knockdown of FGF signal transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Altogether, we conclude that FGF signaling between AMPs and the disc epithelium is necessary for proper AMP survival.</p><p>To determine if the location and level of FGF signaling controls the position and number of the AMPs, we assessed the effects of increasing the levels of FGF ligands and also expressing them ectopically. First, we used a <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> driver that is expressed in a stripe of cells just anterior to the anterior-posterior compartment boundary of the epithelium, including in the notum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Expression of either <italic>pyr</italic> or <italic>ths</italic> in this domain caused a massive increase in the number of AMPs, not only beneath the notum epithelium where AMPs are normally present, but throughout the entire <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> expression domain, including underneath the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). AMPs were observed along the entire stripe of ectopic FGF expression, all the way to the ventral hinge and even extending on the ventral side to the peripodial epithelium. From this, we conclude that FGF signaling does not just increase AMP number, but can also induce AMP spreading beyond the epithelial notum.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) from disc epithelium controls adult muscle precursor (AMP) localization.</title><p>(<bold>A-B'</bold>) Wing discs with <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> driving the expression of <italic>&gt;GFP</italic> alone (<bold>A, A'</bold>) or <italic>&gt;GFP</italic> together with <italic>&gt;pyr</italic> (<bold>B, B'</bold>), stained with anti-Twi (cyan) to visualize the AMPs. (<bold>A’</bold>) and (<bold>B’</bold>) correspond to white dashed boxes in (<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>), respectively.

AMPs throughout the A-P axis of the disc were found to be in both S- and M-phase of the cell cycle, as indicated by the incorporation of the thymidine analog EdU and staining for phospho-histone-H3 (PHH3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). This shows that when an FGF source is provided in the epithelium AMPs are capable of cell cycle entry and progression even in portions of the disc that are distant from the notum, consistent with the large increase in the number of AMPs. Thus, expression of Pyr and Ths in epithelial cells appears sufficient to both attract AMPs to that location and sustain their local proliferation.</p><p>To determine whether AMPs can be induced to migrate at different stages of larval development, we restricted the ectopic expression of FGF ligands to the later stages of larval development. The expression of <italic>dpp&gt;pyr</italic> or <italic>dpp&gt;ths</italic> was controlled by a temperature-sensitive Gal80, and when expression was initiated in mid-L3 (48 hr prior to dissection), AMPs were observed throughout the dorsal portion of the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, when expression was initiated later in L3 (24 hr prior to dissection) AMPs were observed in the dorsal hinge but not the pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together, these experiments indicate that the myoblasts found to be associated with other regions of the disc are derived from those underlying the notum. Additionally, these experiments show that AMPs can be induced to emigrate from the notum region even in the later stages of L3, suggesting that the localized expression of the FGF ligands in the notum both localizes AMPs to that region of the disc and also sustains their survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

Consistent with our scRNAseq data, Ptc was observed mostly in a group of direct AMPs, but also in two additional smaller groups of cells that are located more dorsally among indirect AMPs. The proximity of these Ptc-expressing AMPs to Hh-secreting epithelial cells suggests that they are responding to the Hh secreted by these cells rather than a circulating pool of Hh that should be available to all AMPs. Indeed, a recent study suggests that Hh ligand from the epithelium is transported via cytonemes to nearby AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatori and Kornberg, 2020</xref>).</p><p>To determine if Ptc expression in the AMPs closest to the Hh-producing epithelial cells is a result of Hh pathway activation, we reduced <italic>smo</italic> expression in all AMPs and observed that Ptc expression in AMPs was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This indicated that, as in the disc epithelium, Hh signal transduction within the AMPs is required to establish high Ptc expression in the posterior-localized AMPs. To address whether all AMPs are capable of this response, we expressed an activated form of the transcription factor Ci (Ci<sup>3m</sup>), which is resistant to proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Price and Kalderon, 1999</xref>), in all AMPs and observed that this leads to an uniformly high level of Ptc protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Thus, all AMPs appear capable of responding to Hh, but during normal development, only AMPs with close proximity to the posterior compartment of the disc epithelium receive the signal.

During the pupal phase, the AMPs give rise to three distinct muscle fiber types within the adult thorax: dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLM), dorsoventral muscles (DVM), and DFMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). While DLMs and DVMs are IFMs that generate the mechanical movement required for flight by compressing the thorax, the DFMs are responsible for flight steering by fine-tuning the position of the wing blades (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bate, 1993</xref>). Both DLMs and DVMs are formed from indirect AMPs, whereas the direct AMPs develop into the DFMs. Control adults displayed wild-type posture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), while after Hh signaling was downregulated in AMPs with <italic>smo<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, we found that a majority of adults displayed an ‘outstretched’ wing posture phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J, L</xref>).

These wing posture phenotypes were reproducible with multiple <italic>smo<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> and in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Adults with either the outstretched or downtilted phenotypes were incapable of flight.

When we reduced <italic>smo</italic> expression in the AMPs, we observed a misalignment of the DFM fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5U</xref>).

In contrast, the DLM and DVM muscle fibers appeared relatively normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5S, T</xref>).

Importantly, muscle 51, which is derived from a separate group of AMPs not associated with the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawrence, 1982</xref>), is unaffected by these manipulations. The DLMs had no noticeable defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5V</xref>), likely because the DLMs do not arise in de novo, unlike the other adult flight muscles, but rather by the fusion of AMPs with histolyzing larval muscles that act as templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandes et al., 1991</xref>). Overall, our data suggest that Hh signaling is important for proper specification of a subset of the direct AMPs and that excessive Ci activity causes inappropriate patterning that perturbs the development of the IFMs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Neurotactin and midline are AMP-specific downstream targets of Hh signaling</title><p>What are the downstream targets that are activated by Hh signaling in the AMPs?

Surprisingly, while Nrt and Mid expression patterns included all posterior-localized direct AMPs, the expression of both genes extended into anterior-localized direct AMPs, which do not express Ptc. Due to their high expression levels in the posterior-localized AMPs, we hypothesized that expression of Nrt and Mid, at least in the posterior AMPs, was influenced by Hh signaling.</p><p>To determine if <italic>Nrt</italic> and <italic>mid</italic> are downstream Hh-signaling targets, we examined if perturbing the Hh pathway within the AMPs would alter their expression. The knockdown of <italic>smo</italic> and consequent reduction in Hh signaling resulted in a dramatic decrease in both Nrt and Mid expression in the direct AMPs at 120 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J, K, N</xref>). Remarkably, this was observed in both the posterior- and anterior-localized AMPs alike. We tested if increased Hh signaling would be sufficient to induce expression of Nrt and Mid by driving <italic>ci<sup>3m</sup></italic> in the AMPs. This resulted in the ectopic expression of both Nrt and Mid in all of the AMPs, although expression was higher within direct AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L–N</xref>). Thus, all AMPs are capable of inducing Nrt and Mid expression in response to Hh signaling, but only the AMPs closest to Hh-secreting epithelial cells do so under physiological conditions. This relationship between <italic>ptc</italic>, <italic>mid</italic>, and <italic>Nrt</italic> is specific to the AMPs as we did not observe correlation between <italic>ptc</italic> and either <italic>Nrt</italic> or <italic>mid</italic> within the epithelium. These experiments indicate that Hh signaling is important for proper patterning of the AMPs. However, Hh signaling is not required to regulate all aspects of the direct AMP cell fate as high Ct expression was unaffected following the manipulation of Hh signaling by <italic>smo</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). This suggests that Hh signaling is acting independent from <italic>ct</italic> to specify the fate of a subpopulation of the AMPs.</p><p>To evaluate the functional consequences of reducing <italic>Nrt</italic> and <italic>mid</italic> expression, we used RNAi to reduce their expression. The RNAi line directed against <italic>mid</italic>, however, failed to significantly reduce Mid protein levels. In contrast, <italic>Nrt</italic> knockdown reduced Nrt levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>) and resulted in adults with defects in the posterior DFMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P</xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5R</xref>), albeit not as severely as knockdown of <italic>smo</italic>. This result shows that the Hh-signaling downstream target <italic>Nrt</italic> is critical for proper DFM development.</p><p>The AMPs with high Ptc expression are in the vicinity of Hh-expressing epithelial cells, which is consistent with the notion that Hh is a short-range morphogen capable of acting on cells within 40 µm from the source. However, we observed expression of the two target genes, Nrt and Mid, in anterior-localized AMPs far beyond 40 µm from the Hh source. Knockdown of Hh signaling via <italic>smo<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> expression abolished the expression of both genes in anterior- and posterior-localized AMPs alike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J, K</xref>), ruling out the possibility of their activation in a Hh-independent manner. This raised the possibility that these cells were initially closer to the Hh source earlier in development and had subsequently moved anteriorly either as a result of passive displacement or active migration. In this scenario, the expression of Nrt and Mid would be expected to perdure for longer than the expression of Ptc. To test whether anterior-localized AMPs had past activation of the Hh-signaling pathway, we used a lineage-tracing method to identify cells that had previously expressed <italic>ptc</italic> (<italic>ptc<sup>ts</sup>&gt;FLP, GFP<sup>FLP-Out</sup></italic>; see Materials and methods). We labeled all cells that displayed activity of <italic>ptc-Gal4</italic> during late second and early third instar, and observed lineage labeling (indicated by GFP expression) of all direct AMPs underlying the posterior compartment of the epithelium as well as a trail of anterior AMPs that recapitulate the domain of anti-Nrt staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref>). These results indicate that these anterior GFP-positive AMPs likely descended from cells that previously expressed high levels of <italic>ptc</italic>, and that past activation of the Hh pathway is likely to be responsible for the expression of both anterior- and posterior-localized Nrt and Mid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6R</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Heterogeneity and diversification of cell types</title><p>Data obtained from scRNAseq experiments can provide both spatial and temporal information that give us a better understanding of how cells diversify and then stabilize their transcriptomes during development, and point to ways in which they interact with each other. Moreover, we have been able to visualize the expression of genes from our dataset in a three-layered virtual wing disc – a format that will be useful for developmental biologists.</p><p>One interesting observation from our data is that spatial positioning within the wing disc is highly informative of the transcriptional state of cells. In particular, the proximodistal axis of the disc epithelium is one of the primary stratifying features within our single-cell data. Epithelial cell clusters were easily mapped back to sub-regions within the notum, hinge, pouch, and PE. In contrast, although the cells of the anterior and posterior compartments have been separated by lineage since early in embryogenesis, we observe less differential expression between the two compartments. Thus, position along the proximodistal axis has a far greater influence on the transcriptome of a cell than its ancestry.</p><p>In the epithelium, we observe that most of the major cell types observed at late L3 (120 hr AEL) are already present at mid L3 (96 hr AEL). However, the transcriptomes of the two major populations of AMPs, those that give rise to the DFMs and IFMs, diverge significantly during this time interval. At 96 hr, AMPs appear to be in a relatively naive state; canonical markers for the direct and indirect flight precursors, <italic>ct</italic> and <italic>vg</italic>, both show relatively uniform expression at the mid L3 stage. At the late L3 stage, we observe more distinguishable differences between the transcriptomes of direct and indirect cell types. Both <italic>ct</italic> and <italic>vg</italic> have greater differential expression in the AMPs at this time point. The earlier stabilization of epithelial cell fates then provides a stable platform for the generation of spatially localized signals that regulate myoblast numbers and provide instructive signals for fate specification.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>FGF signaling regulates the number and location of AMPs</title><p>Ths and Pyr have previously shown to regulate the spreading of mesodermal cells during embryogenesis, but a role for these ligands in regulating myoblast numbers was not previously appreciated. We show these ligands are necessary for AMP survival and that increased levels of these ligands can promote AMP proliferation even at sites distant from the notum. Indeed, increased expression can induce a dramatic overproliferation of the AMPs, even as late as third instar. Ectopic FGF signaling is sufficient to support AMP viability and cell proliferation at other locations in the wing disc, including underneath the pouch. Thus, the localized expression and level of Ths and Pyr secreted by epithelial cells in the notum could provide sufficient trophic support to generate the appropriate number of AMPs during normal development. While this work was in preparation, another group independently showed that the <italic>ths-Gal4</italic> line is expressed in the notum epithelium and that reducing <italic>ths</italic> function reduces AMP numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vishal et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We have also demonstrated that ectopic and elevated levels of expression of Ths or Pyr can draw AMPs out of the notum region, all the way to the ventral hinge and around the ventral edge of the disc proper onto the peripodial epithelium. With constitutive FGF ligand expression driven by <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic>, we did not observe AMP migration to the lateral regions of the disc, which are far from the ectopic FGF source. However, when FGF expression is initiated in L3 by controlled Gal80<sup>ts</sup> repression, we observed a large number of laterally located AMPs. We attribute the difference in these two scenarios to ectopic AMPs along the <italic>dpp</italic> stripe possibly serving as an FGF sink. When FGF is turned on later in development, there are no ectopic AMPs. In their absence, FGF could reach more lateral portions of the disc, thus allowing AMP emigration to those regions. Furthermore, the expression of Pyr in the wing pouch, which is separated from the notum by the dorsal hinge, was sufficient to promote colonization of the pouch region by AMPs. The AMPs can be induced to colonize new domains late into larval development by the expression of either FGF ligand. These results suggest that under physiological conditions AMPs remain beneath the notum epithelium because there is insufficient FGF outside of this region. Altogether, our work illustrates that a source of epithelial FGF is critical for forming the AMP niche and that levels of FGF regulate both the location and number of the AMP cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Instructive Hh signaling from the epithelium to the myoblasts</title><p>We have shown that the anteroposterior identities of the disc epithelium are important for proper specification of gene expression within the underlying AMPs. One powerful advantage of scRNAseq as opposed to its bulk sample predecessor is the ability to measure gene co-expression within subpopulations of a tissue. We leveraged this advantage to identify two novel Hh-signaling targets, <italic>Nrt</italic> and <italic>mid</italic>, within AMPs. While we currently do not know whether <italic>Nrt</italic> and <italic>mid</italic> are direct targets of Ci, both genes do have consensus Ci-binding sites within potential regulatory regions. Nrt is a single-pass transmembrane protein. Its extracellular ligand, Amalgam, has more widespread expression in the direct myoblasts and is expressed at comparable levels at both 96 and 120 hr AEL. Two molecules of Amalgam can form homodimers, and each is capable of binding to Nrt on different cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frémion et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zeev-Ben-Mordehai et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, an effect of Hh-induced expression of Nrt in a subset of the direct adult flight muscles might be to promote aggregation of Nrt-expressing cells at a later stage of development.</p><p>An unexpected observation was that AMPs beneath the anterior compartment, distant from the epithelial source of Hh, express both identified Hh targets Nrt and Mid. However, this expression is dependent upon Hh signaling since knockdown of <italic>smo</italic> blocks gene expression. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that a second signal from posterior AMPs activates <italic>Nrt</italic> and <italic>mid</italic> expression in these cells, our lineage-tracing experiments favor a model where a subset of the direct AMPs are generated posteriorly and move anteriorly during the course of development. Such movement could be due to a process of active migration in response to hitherto unknown external cues or to displacement as a result of oriented cell division. Understanding the mechanistic basis of AMP migration would represent an exciting avenue of future research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Our work has provided a base for the study of heterotypic interactions in the developing wing disc during conditions of normal growth and demonstrate that such interactions can have a major effect on cell number, cell migration, and cell fate in the wing disc.

The scVI VAE model consisted of 2 layers (n_layers = 2) and 20 latent dimensions (n_latent = 20), with a negative-binomial reconstruction loss (reconstruction_loss=‘nb’). The model was trained on variable genes selected by Seurat’s variance-stabilizing transformation method; 1000 (for epithelial subsets) or 2000 (for AMP subsets) variable genes were calculated for each inputted batch, and then the union of these genes was supplied to scVI.

In these cases, differential expression statistics (i.e., FDR and fold-change) are obtained by combining the cells (across batches) in each group and conducting a single comparison. When evaluating differential expression between time points (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>) (which would be inherently confounded with batch effects since time points were collected across separate sequencing experiments), we took a conservative approach and only considered genes that were consistently significant (by the criteria defined above) in each temporal pairwise comparison (i.e., DE analysis was conducted between all temporal pairs: 96h1 vs. 120h1, 96h2 vs. 120h1, 96h2 vs.120h1, 96h2 vs.120h2). We report the natural-log of the average value for these pairwise comparisons, and the maximum FDR calculated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Generating a virtual model of the wing disc</title><p>We assembled reference gene expression patterns from a number of sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Held, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler et al., 2003</xref>) and based our starting geometry on the disc proper from images in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bageritz et al., 2019</xref>.

The geometry of the three-layered model is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4,</xref> and the binarized reference gene expression patterns are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. We used DistMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karaiskos et al., 2017</xref>) to statistically map single cells back to the reference. With this virtual wing disc model, we used DistMap to calculate a ‘virtual in situ’ or a prediction of gene expression patterns. This is based on the detected gene expression with the single-cell data and the mapping location to calculate relative expression values for our model. We mapped the AMP and epithelial cells separately as this improved how well the model predicted genes with known expression patterns. In addition, we used the scVI imputed gene expression values when mapping the cells to the reference.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Examination of receptor–ligand expression</title><p>From FlyBase, we assembled a list of genes encoding receptors and ligands from the following 19 pathways of interest: Wnt/Wingless, FGF, Hedgehog, PDGF/VEGF, JAK-STAT, activin, BMP, Fat-Ds, Slit-Robo, ephrin, toll/toll-like, semaphorin, Notch, insulin-like, fog, torso, miple, EGFR, and TNF. For our analysis, we only examined pathways in which at least one receptor or ligand was either (1) differentially expressed within one of the major domains of the epithelium (notum, hinge, pouch, or PE) when compared to all other epithelial cells, (2) differentially expressed within one of the major domains of the AMPs (direct or indirect cells) when compared to each other, or (3) differentially expressed between all epithelial cells vs. all AMP cells.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Rajesh D Gunage (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript relates the production of a &quot;cell atlas&quot; of the wing disc and the associated adult muscle precursors using single cell transcriptomics in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. While the results of this study are valuable to the community, this is not a novel approach, since two previous studies describe single cell transcriptome analysis for the wing disc and one for the AMPs (Bageritz et al., 2019, Deng et al., 2019, Zappia et al., 2020).</p><p>Exploring the expression level of ligand/receptor couples, the authors propose possible cross-talk taking place between the wing epithelium and the AMPs. They identify three ligands that potentially play a role in such crosstalk, FGF, Hh, and TNFα. The most relevant results concern the FGF ligands Thisbe and Pyramus, which seem produced by the disc epithelium to regulate the number and the localisation of the associated AMPs. The proposed role of Hh and Hh signalling is less convincing. No demonstration is made that Hh produced by the disc is indeed signalling to the AMPs. In addition, the phenotype is not sufficiently characterised in the larva. TNF/TNF receptor signalling is not studied.</p><p>Overall, the paper presents interesting but spread-out data, due to an substantial focus on the technical aspect of the single cell approach and a general presentation of the data obtained. This approach does not contribute to enhancing interest in the paper and seems dispensable in its details as many parts are essentially similar to previously published approaches. More focus should be put on the real novelty of the study, i.e. FGF/FGFR signalling in the epithelial/muscle crosstalk. As it stands this aspect is somewhat limited.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The manuscript is 97 pages. This is definitely too long ( the journal does not have a page-limit, but it is prudent to keep a succinct thread going and place details accessible elsewhere). Importantly, the description of the single cell approach and the general exploitation of the data should be moved to supplementary information, given that three previous studies have been published on similar/identical aspects (Figure 1 of this paper is very similar to Figure 1 of Bageritz et al., 2019).</p><p>2. The description of FGF signal crosstalk between the disc and the AMPs is potentially interesting, but preliminary. A description of how FGF ligands spread is missing. This is key since over-expression of the ligands seem to trigger localised recruitment of the AMPs. As it stands, the paper does not fully demonstrate that FGF produced by the disc acts on FGF receptor on AMPs. Finally, the distinction between recruitment and proliferation effects is poorly characterised. The notion that FGF signalling allows adapting the number of AMPs to the size of the disc is very interesting. Testing this would be a significant advance, no matter what the result.</p><p>3. The same remarks apply to the analysis of the Hh/<italic>ptc</italic>crosstalk. Here a clear characterisation of the larval phenotype is missing. The source of the ligand is also puzzling. Given that Hh is known to accumulate at high level in the hemolymph (Rodenfels et al., 2014) other sources of Hh may also need to be considered. In any case. It may be best, for purposes of this manuscript, that the authors focus on better understanding the FGF pathways here and leave the elaboration of Hh signaling for later.</p><p>4.

Our work differs from those studies in two important ways. (1) By obtaining data from two different time points during L3, we show that cell fates in the epithelium are established by mid-L3 while AMP fates are consolidated much later. This is key in understanding how signaling from the epithelium impacts the AMPs (2) By performing additional computational analysis of the AMPs (detailed below), we were able to uncover a role for Hedgehog signaling in a subset of the AMPs in specifying fates via AMP-specific target genes that had not been previously described.</p><p>We wish we had done a better job of explaining the additional computational analysis that we did that enabled us to find differences between subsets of AMPs that had previously escaped detection. Our analysis showed that Hedgehog signaling is active in a subset of the AMPs – this was not apparent from the data presented in the Zappia et al. paper. This may in part be due to our use of the 10x Genomics barcoding rather than DropSeq technology (which was used extensively by both Bageritz et al. and Zappia et al.) and deep sequencing, which lead to an increased number of genes per cell (an average of ~3,000 genes per cell in our dataset vs. an average of 500 genes per cell in the Zappia et al. dataset). Additionally, as described below, we uniquely addressed confounding biological factors that obscured characterization of the active Hedgehog signaling population within our AMP data.</p><p>When the AMPs are analyzed using default parameters, the major stratifying factor that separates the AMPs into four main groups based on both cell sex and cell-cycle status (Please see Figure 1—figure supplements 4 and 5). We found a way of computationally removing stratification from both cell sex and the cell-cycle state in order to focus on cell fates. Stratification based on the cell sex was eliminated by treating male and female cells as distinct batches, which worked well because the relative binary ON/OFF expression of <italic>lncRNA:roX1</italic> and <italic>lncRNA:roX2.</italic> Cell-cycle status is not a binary state. To remove this stratifying effect, we determined which dimension of the latent space effectively captures cell-cycle variation. Briefly, our process of cell cycle correction is a two-step process. In the first step, we use dimensionality reduction to translate the transcriptome of each cell to a 20-dimensional latent space. This step is common among many single-cell RNA analyses, using tools such as PCA or scVI, and is necessary to reduce the noise and complexity of single-cell data for downstream analyses (e.g., clustering for cell-type identification). However, in the second step, we examined each of the 20 latent dimensions for correlation with annotated cell cycle genes. We found that cell-cycle variation was mostly observed in one of these 20 dimensions, and that when we removed this dimension from our analysis (effectively removing cell-cycle effects), we were then able to observe other differences that had been obscured. These two computational corrections allowed us to discover that Hedgehog signaling was active in a particular cluster of AMPs. Importantly, we believe that many of the published datasets from scRNA-seq studies would benefit from such computational corrections.</p><p>Once we observed that <italic>patched</italic> was upregulated in a subset of AMPs, we noticed that the canonical target of Hedgehog signaling in the disc epithelium, <italic>decapentaplegic</italic>, was not expressed in these cells. Using computational tools, we looked for genes that were expressed in those cells that upregulated <italic>patched</italic>, and identified <italic>midline</italic> and <italic>Neurotactin</italic> as targets of Hedgehog signaling in AMPs. The discovery of these targets was only possible because of the single-cell approach since we looked for genes that were expressed in the same subset of cells as those that upregulated <italic>patched</italic>.</p><p>Thus, while we agree that others have published single-cell studies of the same tissue, the analytical tools and computational corrections that we used enabled us to characterize differences in AMPs with greater resolution than reported in those previous studies, and resulted in the identification and characterization of AMP-specific Hedgehog targets. In addition, by generating an integrated cell atlas from two developmental time points, we were able to investigate the temporal dynamics of gene expression within cell types. This promoted the discovery that the AMPs are still being actively patterned by the epithelium, as observed by the induction of <italic>midline</italic> and <italic>Neurotactin</italic> between mid (96h) and late (120h) phase of wing disc development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Exploring the expression level of ligand/receptor couples, the authors propose possible cross-talk taking place between the wing epithelium and the AMPs.

In our revised manuscript, we have presented these more clearly and also included additional experiments that flesh out aspects of FGF and Hedgehog signaling that the reviewer refers to. These findings are detailed below in the section on “Essential revisions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The manuscript is 97 pages.

Importantly, the description of the single cell approach and the general exploitation of the data should be moved to supplementary information, given that three previous studies have been published on similar/identical aspects (Figure 1 of this paper is very similar to Figure 1 of Bageritz et al., 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have reduced the word count of the main section of the manuscript by approximately 30% and have reduced the first three figures of the previous version into a single figure. In the text, we emphasize the computational tools that we have used during the course of this work that should be useful to others. As discussed previously, we found that removal of the dominating effects of cell sex and cell cycle on the transcriptome revealed heterogeneity among the AMPs that was not otherwise apparent. We notice that many published studies of multiple cell types in <italic>Drosophila</italic> do not do this and that those data may benefit from this kind of analysis. We have also retained a main figure which describes how we can display our data on a three-layered wing disc (peripodial epithelium, disc proper, and AMPs). This method will enable others to easily visualize the expression of any gene of interest in all three layers of the wing disc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The description of FGF signal crosstalk between the disc and the AMPs is potentially interesting, but preliminary. A description of how FGF ligands spread is missing. This is key since over-expression of the ligands seem to trigger localised recruitment of the AMPs. As it stands, the paper does not fully demonstrate that FGF produced by the disc acts on FGF receptor on AMPs. Finally, the distinction between recruitment and proliferation effects is poorly characterised. The notion that FGF signalling allows adapting the number of AMPs to the size of the disc is very interesting. Testing this would be a significant advance, no matter what the result.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included additional data to characterize the role of the FGF ligands in sustaining the viability of the AMPs, in regulating their proliferation, and in recruiting them to alternative locations.</p><p>First, we show that the FGF secretion by the epithelial cells is necessary for the survival of the AMPs in the notum (Figure 3H). We examined cell death using an antibody that recognizes activated caspase (anti-Dcp1). Following knockdown of <italic>pyramus</italic>, we observe elevated levels of caspase activity in the same parts of notum where myoblast numbers are decreased, especially in the ventral part of the notum. This is the region where <italic>pyramus</italic> and <italic>thisbe</italic> are not co-expressed, as evidenced by spatial mapping of our single-cell data, and therefore unlikely to function redundantly. This also suggests that at physiological levels of expression, these FGFs are acting as short-range signals, since there is insufficient Thisbe in this region to compensate for reduced Pyramus levels.</p><p>Second, we show (in multiple ways) that the FGF ligands can promote the proliferation of AMPs. We had previously shown that while antagonizing FGF signaling reduced AMP numbers (which could simply be a pro-survival effect), increasing FGF levels using <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> caused a spectacular increase in the number of AMPs. Our previous experiments could not distinguish if these cells were proliferating only in their normal niche (in the notum) and then emigrating or whether they were proliferating in these ectopic locations. We have added data that show that AMPs that are far from the notum continue to proliferate (Figure 4E, F; Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E). We detect ectopic AMPs undergoing both S-phase and mitosis by staining for EdU incorporation and anti-phosphohistone H3, respectively. Thus, we now show that AMPs can proliferate at many locations in the wing disc as long as sufficient levels of FGF ligands are provided. Taken together, these experiments show that the FGF ligands are necessary for the survival of AMPs and that altering their levels can regulate AMP numbers.</p><p>Third, we have examined the time course of AMP migration out of the notum when ectopic FGF is provided. Our previous experiments did not address the issue of when AMPs were able to be drawn out of the notum. Using <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> together with a temperature-sensitive <italic>Gal80</italic>, we initiate expression of <italic>&gt;pyr</italic> and <italic>&gt;ths</italic> at different stages of larval development (Figure 4G, H; Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C). We show that even when expression is initiated at mid L3, we can still induce migration of AMPs from below the notum epithelium to new locations beneath the ventral hinge and pouch. This shows that the FGFs do not function simply in the initial localization of the AMPs to the notum region of the disc and argues that the AMPs remain in this region because it is the only portion of the epithelium that continues to expresses the FGF ligands <italic>ths</italic> and <italic>pyr</italic>.</p><p>Fourth, our experiments have also addressed the issue of how far FGF ligands can spread. Under conditions of overexpression, we show that sufficient FGF can diffuse many cell diameters from the source to enable AMPs to emigrate to and survive at those locations. However, at physiological levels of expression, we do not observe AMPs far from the epithelial cells that make them, indicating that insufficient FGF reaches regions of the epithelium outside of the notum to draw AMPs to those locations.</p><p>In summary, the data we have added make a strong argument that localized expression of the FGF ligands is necessary for the survival of the AMPs, for regulating the extent of their proliferation, and for restricting them to the region of the notum.</p><p>We also attempted to visualize the FGF ligands in the AMPs. We have spent the last two months trying to visualize the spread of tagged versions of the FGF ligands. These stainings have been occasionally successful and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we observe endogenous Thisbe-FLAG (visualized with anti-FLAG) in the epithelial cells of the notum and in puncta in the underlying AMPs. We have tried a variety of fixation conditions and detergents but found the staining to be inconsistent and with varying amounts of background. For this reason, we are reluctant to include these images in the main manuscript. Importantly, in the images shown, the puncta we observe remain confined in myoblasts under the Ths-expressing part of the notum and they do not extend more ventrally even to the region that are predicted from our single-cell data to express <italic>pyramus</italic>. While these images are not pretty, the result is consistent with our other experiments that show that at physiological levels of expression the FGF ligands act at short distances from their source.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>FLAG-tagged Ths ligand is observed in both the epithelium notum and underlying AMPs.</title><p>(A-C) Max projections over all images slices (epithelium + AMPs) from wing discs with FLAG tag inserted at the N-terminus of Ths (Bl. 77476).

The same remarks apply to the analysis of the Hh/ptc crosstalk. Here a clear characterisation of the larval phenotype is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Our Hedgehog work was presented at the end of a long manuscript and the reviewer may have overlooked our data on the characterization of the larval phenotype. We had devoted an entire figure (and many experiments) to characterizing the larval phenotype (now Figure 6). Indeed, we feel that discovering AMP-specific targets of Hedgehog signaling in the larval wing disc best illustrates the power of single-cell transcriptomics.</p><p>We found that <italic>dpp</italic> was not expressed by the <italic>ptc</italic>-expressing AMPs. We leveraged our single cell data to show that the transcription factor Midline and the cell-surface protein <italic>Neurotactin</italic> are expressed in cells that upregulate <italic>patched</italic> (Looking for co-expression in subsets of cells is one of the most powerful uses of single-cell transcriptomics). We showed that the expression of both Midline and <italic>Neurotactin</italic> is dependent on Hedgehog signaling. Thus, we have identified AMP-specific targets of Hh in the larval disc.</p><p>Our work also suggests that AMPs are displaced anteriorly during larval development since we detect perdurance of Midline and <italic>Neurotactin</italic> in more anteriorly located AMPs and present lineage-tracing data to show that these cells were once located more posteriorly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The source of the ligand is also puzzling.

However, we have now added a series of images (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) that show that the only AMPs that upregulate <italic>patched</italic> are those that are within approximately 40 μm of the cells in the Hedgehog-secreting cells in the posterior compartment of the disc epithelium.
