It forms at the cell surface and contains MyD88 and IRAK proteins which ultimately coordinate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signals via the Myddosome when triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregates but the magnitude and time duration of the response are very different for reasons that are unclear. Here, we followed the formation of Myddosomes in live macrophages using local delivery of TLR4 agonist to the cell surface and visualisation with 3D rapid light sheet imaging. This was complemented by super-resolution imaging of Myddosomes in fixed macrophages to determine the size of the signalling complex at different times after triggering. Myddosomes formed more rapidly after LPS than in response to sonicated Aβ 1–42 fibrils (80 vs 372 s). The mean lifetimes of the Myddosomes were also shorter when triggered by LPS compared to sonicated Aβ fibrils (170 and 220 s), respectively. In both cases, a range of Myddosome of different sizes (50–500 nm) were formed. In particular, small round Myddosomes around 100 nm in size formed at early time points, then reduced in proportion over time. Collectively, our data suggest that compared to LPS the multivalency of Aβ fibrils leads to the formation of larger Myddosomes which form more slowly and, due to their size, take longer to disassemble. This explains why sonicated Aβ fibrils results in less efficient triggering of TLR4 signalling and may be a general property of protein aggregates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TLR4</kwd><kwd>amyloid beta</kwd><kwd>Myddosome</kwd><kwd>fluorescence imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EPSRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/W015005/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bing</given-names></name><name><surname>Klenerman</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BBSRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/V000276/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bryant</surname><given-names>Clare E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Amyloid-beta aggregates and lipopolysaccharide differ in their kinetics of Myddosome formation and size of Myddosome formed, providing an explanation for the less efficient triggering of TLR4 observed with aggregates.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signalling through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) potently drives the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and the type I interferon (IFN) IFNβ, during Gram-negative bacterial infection. It is now clear that TLR4 activation is important in many diseases with, for example, its triggering by small aggregates of proteins, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ), thought to be important in the initiation and development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Okamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Reed-Geaghan et al., 2009</xref>). Two rare genetic variants in the APOE or TREM2 genes are associated with AD and these proteins both can modulate TLR4 signalling. Importantly, TLR4 priming is required for full activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome which is also thought to play an important role in the aetiology of many of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Juliana et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Signalling through TLR4 utilises four adaptor proteins: Myelin and lymphocyte protein (Mal)/(TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein (Tirap), Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), Translocating chain-associated membrane protein (Tram), and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon beta (Trif) which form two macromolecular signalling complexes: the Myddosome and the Triffosome, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gay et al., 2014</xref>). The Myddosome consists of MyD88 and IRAK-2 and -4 kinases. In a crystal structure of the Myddosome there are six MyD88 molecules, four IRAK4, and four IRAK2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Our biophysical analysis within cells, also identifies complexes with six MyD88, but other stoichiometries are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Latty et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Moncrieffe et al., 2020</xref>). Our previous work shows that low doses of small Aβ-42 oligomers (at concentrations of these proteins found in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients) primes TLR4 signalling to induce sustained cytokine production, through Myddosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>), which is a pattern of signalling that is very different to that seen when TLR4 is triggered by LPS. It is unclear how such different patterns of TLR4 signalling are induced by protein aggregates in comparison to LPS. The Aβ aggregates are much larger than LPS and potentially multivalent so it is possible they could bind multiple TLR4 simultaneously potentially sterically hindering the successful formation of Myddosomes and hence altering the signalling efficiency.</p><p>Studying live Myddosome formation in cells is technically challenging for many reasons including labelling the key proteins, the resolution of imaging required to identify individual proteins and the fact that TLR4 traffics rapidly away from the cell surface. Our previous work used fluorescently tagged MyD88 in total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to follow Myddosomes formation in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Latty et al., 2018</xref>). We found that Myddosomes assemble within minutes of TLR4 stimulation and that they contained six MyD88 molecules although larger Myddosomes could form. Lipid partial agonists at TLR4 stimulate slower formation of a smaller number of Myddosomes. Only a small number of Myddosomes need to be formed on the cell surface for full cellular signalling to occur, and we proposed that the difference between full and partial agonism is determined by Myddosome number, size, and the speed of their formation. Elegant work using TIRF microscopy supported our hypothesis when studying Myddosome formation in response to triggering of the interleukin 1 receptor in mouse lymphoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deliz-Aguirre et al., 2021</xref>). Here, small reversible Myddosomes formed but signalling required the formation of stable larger Myddosomes with four or more MyD88. Both these previous imaging studies on Myddosomes used TIRF microscopy. This technique limits the volume that can be visualised to 200 nm above the coverslip such that only Myddosomes formed on the bottom cell membrane can be seen so any Myddosomes formed away from this field of view will be lost. It is also hard to calculate the lifetime of assembled Myddosomes with TIRF because the loss of the Myddosome fluorescence signal could be attributed to either disassembly or trafficking of the complex away from the bottom cell membrane. Confocal microscopy images cells in 3D, but its low imaging speed and out of plane photobleaching means this technique is not capable of repetitive live cell imaging of low-level fluorescence signals. Signalling through TLR4 is fast so to visualise early events, such as Myddosome formation, ideally signalling should be initiated at a defined time, such as by controllably delivering agonists to the surface of a single cell and then immediately imaging the cellular response.</p><p>Here, we combined light sheet microscopy with local agonist delivery, via a nanopipette, to determine why Aβ aggregates trigger such a distinctive pattern of TLR4 signalling compared to LPS. Light sheet 3D scanning, by scanning the objective or sample stage, can scan the whole-cell sample with relative high speed (single cell scanning only takes 2 s). The use of a nanopipette, will accurately deliver individual molecules to a defined position on the cell surface. We called this method local-delivery selective-plane illumination microscopy (ldSPIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2021</xref>). ldSPIM uses a nanopipette to control the position from which the molecules are delivered and the lightsheet microscopy to follow Myddosome formation in live macrophages following TLR4 triggering by LPS or sonicated Aβ fibrils.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IdSPIM captures the precise formation kinetics of all Myddosomes within a cell</title><p>We used IdSPIM to follow TLR4 activation and quantitatively characterise the formation of the Myddosome as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. A pipette with a diameter of 200 nm for LPS or 800 nm for sonicated Aβ1–42 fibrils was positioned 3 µm above the cell surface, and a pressure pulse for 5 s was used for delivery of the TLR4 agonist onto the surface of MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> immortalised bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs) transduced with MyD88-YFP. The assembly of MyD88 oligomers after TLR4 activation was then visualised in live cells using 3D light sheet scanning.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of local-delivery selective plane illuminatiion microscopy.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Schematic of nanopipette delivered triggering of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and Myddosome formation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregates.

We firstly characterised the Aβ fibrils using electron microscopy, showing that the majority was less than 100 nm in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test the macromolecule delivery ability of the nanopipette, the sonicated Aβ fibrils (4 μM total monomer concentration) were first tagged with a 1:1000 dilution of Amytracker 680, a small molecule dye which specifically binds to aggregates; this was then delivered to the macrophage surface. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a, b</xref> shows the deposition of Amytracker tagged aggregates at the cell membrane demonstrating reliable delivery of sonicated fibrils to the cell membrane.</p><p>Macrophages were activated by both LPS and sonicated Aβ fibrils to form Myddosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A typical result showed that 450 s after triggering with sonicated Aβ fibrils, the first Myddosome was formed, with continuous assembly of new complexes for the next 1000s. The fibrils are detected on the cell surface immediately after dosing, so time taken to visualise a Myddosome accurately records the kinetics of Myddosome formation. In the reconstructed 3D scan image of the whole cell, any Myddosomes formed in the total cell volume can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The spatial distribution and movement of each individual Myddosome were tracked and shown in 3D volume rendered images, which was projected using the brightest point method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Compared with TIRF, 3D light sheet imaging is able to follow all Myddosomes formed, allowing for the calculation of the lifetime of each individual Myddosome, and the total number of Myddosomes assembled within a certain time period post triggering precisely. Our previous studies have demonstrated that when TLR4 is triggered by various agonists, the response speed and magnitude of response vary; therefore, we measured the structure and dynamics of Myddosome assembly following triggering by LPS and sonicated Aβ fibrils, and analysed the data to determine the following parameters: (1) the first time point when Myddosomes formed, (2) the Myddosome lifetime, (3) the total number of oligomers formed within 30 min of triggering, (4) the size and shape distribution of assembled Myddosomes and (5) the variation of MyD88 oligomer size with stimulation time.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Montage showing the time series of Myddosome assembly (small bright puncta) for different stimulations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) control: no Myddosomes formed when PBS buffer is delivered.

The sonicated Aβ fibrils delivered from the nanopipette-triggered Myddosome formation, demonstrating that sonicated Aβ fibrils could induce an inflammatory response. Previous work has shown that this occurs through TLR4 activation and that the kinetics of this response to Aβ is much slower than in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>). The similarities and differences in Myddosome signalling kinetics between sonicated Aβ fibrils and LPS stimulation were, therefore, then characterised. We measured the first time point when a Myddosome formed, the Myddsome lifetime, the Myddosome size, and the change in the Myddosome size with stimulation time. We observed that LPS-triggered Myddosomes formed faster and are shorter lived than Myddosomes formed by sonicated Aβ fibrils. In both cases, most Myddosomes formed are removed by disassembly at the cell surface. These differences potentially support our hypothesis that the sonicated Ab fibril is multivalent binding multiple TLR4s and hence forms larger Myddosomes and these Myddosome would then take longer to form and remove.</p><p>Super-resolution microscopy of the Myddosome formed when stimulated with LPS in comparison to Aβ sonicated fibrils demonstrated a range in Myddosome size and shape. One limitation of our model is that viral transduction of MyD88 into cells may result in overexpression of the protein which could lead to structural variation that may be seen under physiological conditions. The heterogeneity in Myddosome structure and function, however, may also be functionally important. In particular, small round Myddosomes, less than 100 nm in diameter, were formed in high proportion at early times and then decreased in proportion with time. Despite the wide range of Myddosome sizes we observed, those formed by LPS triggering were on average smaller than those formed by sonicated Aβ. We also observed evidence that Myddosomes have different structures, especially at early times. We do not know, however, which of all these Myddosomes are signalling competent. LPS-triggered Myddosome signalling has a negative feedback control system whereby a short MyD88 isoform MyD88s is upregulated. Myd88s lacks the intermediate domain (ID) for IRAK recruitment and thus is signalling incompetent so this may result in the formation of Myddosomes with different structures at later times. In our previous experiments measuring Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) translocation to nucleus in response to LPS we showed that translocation occurred in the first 30 min after triggering by LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Latty et al., 2018</xref>), when we observed a high proportion of small Myddosomes. It therefore seems plausible that the small round Myddosomes, formed in higher proportion at early times, are signalling competent. The larger Myddosomes formed in response to sonicated Aβ fibrils also seem to be signalling competent, since we previously observed prolonged TNFα production over 24 hr, following addition of Aβ aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>), during which time we observed mainly larger Myddosomes. Determining the signalling competency of different sized Myddosomes complexes is an important goal for future studies, but the structural diversity we have observed does provide a potential explanation for how diverse signalling outcomes are possible when TLR4 is activated by different agonists.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. First, we could not distinguish between signalling competent and signalling competent Myddosomes. In future work, we could use IRAK4 or two antibodies to identify functional Myddosomes on fixed cells, as well as working with cells where the Myddosome expression levels are at physiological levels which may reduce the formation of larger Myddosomes. Second, we have only measured the delay time for Myddosome formation when triggered by LPS or Aβ aggregates. This delay times involves dimerisation of TLR4, binding of LPS or Aβ aggregates to the TLR4 dimer followed by Myddosome formation. These other processes might contribute to the difference in delay time that we observed between LPS or Aβ aggregates. It is worth noting that in our experiments we deliver the LPS or Aβ aggregates directly onto the surface for 5 s and that we previously showed the presence of the preformed TLR4 dimers on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Latty et al., 2018</xref>). The affinity of Aβ aggregates for TLR4 is not known but LPS has a high affinity for TLR4, estimated to ∼3 nM for lipid A–TLR4-MD-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akashi et al., 2003</xref>). However, even with this high affinity which implies fast binding, direct delivery directly onto the surface and the presence of preformed TLR4 dimers on the cell surface we observed that it took 80 s to observe Myddosome formation. This indicates that Myddosome formation is the slow step for LPS triggering. This is likely to be the case Aβ aggregates, since pM concentrations of aggregates can trigger TLR4 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>) indicating high affinity. However, it is not possible to rule out a contribution of a difference in affinity to observed difference in delay time without measuring the affinity directly.</p><p>Overall, we have found that there are clear differences between the Myddosomes formed by LPS and Aβ aggregates in their kinetics, size, and shape. Furthermore, the Myddosomes formed over time also change in size and shape with continual exposure to agonist. The lifetime and structure of the Myddosome formed at the cell surface appear to play an important role in the strength of downstream signalling, and the fact that the Myddosomes vary in structure and kinetics may, we speculate, play an important role in explaining how the same cellular components can give rise to multiple different cellular responses. Our experiments provide new insights into Myddosome formation triggered by LPS compared to Aβ aggregates. The combination of smaller more efficient signalling hubs, which form faster and last for a shorter time may provide a simple explanation for the larger signalling response observed with LPS than with Aβ aggregates. If this is correct, then smaller Aβ aggregates may be expected to be more potent agonists than larger aggregates. Furthermore, it suggests the reduced rate of Myddosome formation, longer lifetime and altered Myddosome structure may contribute to the weaker response from sonicated Aβ fibrils. Given the common aggregation pathway and similar aggregate structure of other aggregation prone proteins, such as tau and a-synuclein, larger multivalent protein aggregates in general may trigger TLR4 signalling less effectively than LPS giving rise to the low levels of chronic inflammation observed in neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Lentiviral transfection and transduction for MyD88-YFP macrophage production</title><p>HEK293T cells and immortalised mouse macrophages MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> (NR-15633) were a gift from Doug Golenbock and Kate Fitzgerald now banked with BEI Resources, USA were grown in complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM <sc>L</sc>-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin).

The raw images were assembled into xyzt hyperstacks, followed by background subtraction using a rolling-ball algorithm (rolling ball radius = 80 pixels) and 3D Gaussian blurring (<italic>xyz</italic> radius = 1 pixel). The hyperstacks were then 3D projected into the <italic>xy</italic> plane.</p><p>Puncta in the 3D projections were identified using ImageJ’s Find Maxima plugin (prominence over background intensity = 20 counts) and isolated into a new stack for tracking. Particle trajectories were then extracted from the identified localisations, with the following parameters used to minimise the false detection of noise and minimise the number of lost tracks: (1) maximum search range (distance a localisation in a trajectory can move between subsequent frames) = 8 px (0.85 μm); (2) memory (the maximum number of frames where a spot can vanish, reappear and be considered in the same track) = 6 frames (60 s); (3) minimum track length = 2 frames (20 s). From the calculated trajectories, the lifetime of each track was extracted. Trajectories that formed in the first frame were treated as pre-formed MyD88 puncta; these were excluded from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Myddosome spatial localisation</title><p>Analysis was carried out using custom scripts written in python (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/p-sur/Myddosome-localisation">https://github.com/p-sur/Myddosome-localisation</ext-link>; copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Suresh, 2024</xref>). Cell boundaries and centroid coordinates were extracted from the acquired xyzt hyperstacks. Puncta were localised and tracked using a Python implementation based on the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Crocker and Grier, 1996</xref>. The cell centroid coordinates at each time point were used to correct for any cell movement during the duration of image acquisition. Following trajectory assembly, the nearest distance of each localisation at each time point to the cell boundary was calculated, and used to segment the puncta as membrane- or cytoplasm-formed; a threshold of 1.4 μm was used to separate these populations. Cytoplasm formed trajectories were excluded from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>dSTORM imaging of Myddosome</title><p>Macrophages were plated in complete media and allowed to sit down on a glass-bottom confocal dish (VWR International) overnight. The media was replaced with fresh media supplemented with either LPS (1 μg/ml) or sonicated Aβ fibrils (monomer concentration 100 nM) and stimulated for five different time periods: 30 min, 3 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, and 24 hr. Following triggering, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then fixed (0.8% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS) for 15 min at 4°C. Following washing, the cells were stained with 6.7 μg/ml of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 4°C. The cells were then washed a further three times with PBS prior to imaging. dSTORM imaging was carried out with 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 0.5 mM glucose, 1.3 μM glucose oxidase, 2.2 µM catalase, and 50 mM mercaptoethylamine. The dSTORM images were acquired by a typical TIRF microscope, with the beam angle set for HILO illumination. Image stacks (2000 frames) were acquired after illumination with a 190-mW 638 laser (Cobolt 06-MLD-638, HÜBNER GmbH &amp; Co KG) and 10 ms camera exposure for each field of view. Image reconstruction was performed using ThunderSTORM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of super-resolved MyD88 puncta</title><p>Following dSTORM reconstruction, true MyD88 puncta were identified by looking for co-localisation between the 488 nm (YFP) and 635 nm (antibody) channels. Following identification, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the puncta was measured by fitting a 1D Gaussian to the pixel intensities of the super-resolved puncta and recording the standard deviation of the Gaussian profile. The diameter of the super-resolved puncta was calculated using the relationship below:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.355</mml:mn><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The intensity of MyD88-YFP images was thresholded to generate a binary mask of Myddosomes. Region of interests were drawn around all filtered Myddosomes. The multiple ROIs generated were saved to a region file. These ROIs were then reloaded to the thresholded dSTORM Myddosomes images. This step ensured that analysis was performed only on the regions where MyD88-YFP was detected. An Integrated Morphometry Analysis (IMA) was then performed through IMA plugin running inside MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kedia et al., 2021</xref>). Parameters like the shape factor were computed for both the LPS and sonicated amyloid-β aggregates triggered Myddosomes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-92350-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All source data is included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The electron microscopy work was performed using the facilities at CAIC (Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre).

However, TLR4 has recently been found to respond to other endogenously derived ligands. This has implicated TLR4 signaling in the development of disease pathology, for example, Alzheimer's disease, through the recognition of amyloid-beta. Intriguingly, the signaling response to these non-bacterial-derived ligands differs from that of bacterial-derived LPS, suggesting mechanistic differences between endogenous and bacterial-derived agonists. In this work, the authors set out to characterize these mechanistic differences. TLR4 signals through two large macromolecular complexes that assemble at activated receptors: the Myddosome and Triffosome. One hypothesis the authors aimed to test was that different ligands alter these signaling complexes' kinetics and nano-scale features. The authors focused on testing this hypothesis by examining the formation of the Myddosome in live cells. A significant strength of the paper is that the authors developed technological innovations to address this problem. Using a nanopipette delivery mechanism combined with light sheet microscopy, the authors could observe Myddosome signaling in the whole cell volume of live macrophages. This allowed them to accurately quantify the Myddosome number, size, and kinetics of complex formation and compare cells stimulated with amyloid-beta and LPS. The authors discovered differences in Myddosomes formed under LPS versus amyloid-beta stimulation. In general, amyloid-beta TLR4 stimulation resulted in slower Myddosome formation with altered morphology. One limitation of the work, which the authors point out in the discussion, is that they could not distinguish signaling-competent Myddosomes. Future work will be needed to understand whether these amyloid beta induced Myddosomes assembly have a similar or altered complement of downstream signaling proteins (such as the IRAK4/1 and TRAF6). Secondly, the structural basis for how TLR4 would distinguish between different radically agonists remains speculative, and will need further investigation. Nonetheless, this paper is important for the technological innovation to look at the molecular dynamics of signal transduction, a technology that could be adapted to study other receptor signaling pathways.</p><p>It is already known that the subcellular location of intracellular TLRs is important for limiting the recognition of self-derived ligands and maintaining tolerance. This work hints at another possible layer of regulation: that a cell surface TLR (TLR4) generates diverse signaling outcomes to extrinsic or intrinsically derived agonists by changing the dynamic behavior of signaling proteins. If correct (and much further work is required to understand endogenous TLR ligands better), it might suggest that the innate immune system employs the same molecular hardware but with altered kinetics to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous inflammatory signals. Thus, pathological aggregates or markers of sterile inflammation might be recognized and responded to by a specific signaling program that is defined kinetically. It will be an interesting direction for future studies to investigate whether and how diverse pathogen and endogenous inflammatory signals modulate the dynamics of signaling complexes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92350.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Suresh</surname><given-names>Prasanna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brelstaff</surname><given-names>Jack</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kedia</surname><given-names>Shekhar</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bryant</surname><given-names>Clare E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Klenerman</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Public Review:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors set out to understand how different TLR4 agonists trigger Myddosome assembly and seek to examine how the potent LPS agonist induces a heightened TLR4 response. A strength of the study is that the authors employ a novel light sheet imaging modality coupled to nanopipette delivery of TLR4 ligands. The authors use this technological innovation to resolve the dynamics of Myddosome formation within the whole cell volume of macrophage cell lines expressing MyD88-YFP. The main finding is that the kinetics of Myddosome formation is slower for the weaker agonist Abeta than LPS. However, Abeta amyloids resulted in the formation of larger MyD88-YFP puncta that persisted for longer. The authors suggest the slower kinetics of formation and larger puncta size reflect how Abeta amyloids are a less efficient TLR4 agonist. Many Toll-like receptors are now known to recognize endogenous produced danger signals and microbially derived molecules. This work is the first to compare the signaling kinetics of endogenous versus microbially derived TLR agonists.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A key strength of this work is the technological achievement of imaging Myddosomes within the entire cell volume and using a nanopipette to administer ligands directly to single cells. The authors also combine this light sheet microscopy with STORM imaging to gain a super-resolved view of the assembly of Myddosomes. These findings suggest that Myddosomes formed in response to Abeta have a more irregular morphology. We conclude that these technological achievements are significant in improving our understanding of the dynamics of TLR4 signaling in response to diverse agonists. Given the limited literature on the molecular dynamics of innate immune signal transduction, this study is an important addition to the field.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One limitation of the paper is that a suitable explanation for how larger Myddosomes would contribute to an attenuated downstream signaling response. Do the larger clusters of nucleated MyD88 polymers reflect inefficiency in assembling fully formed Myddosomes that contain IRAK4/2? Could the MyD88-GFP puncta be stained with antibodies against IRAK4 (or IRAK2) to determine the frequency and probably of the two ligands to stimulate signal transduction beyond MyD88 assembly?</p><p>A second weakness is the discussion. The authors should explore other explanations for the observed differences in Myddosome formation between TLR4 agonists. For example, could the observed delay in Myddosome assembly in response to Abeta be due to different binding affinity or kinetics to TLR4? Can this be ruled out?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments.</p><p>To address the first comment we have added a section on the limitations of the current study and suggested that future work could use IRAK4 or 2 staining to identify Myddosomes that are functional as well as working with cells where the Myddosome expression levels is at physiological levels, which may reduce the formation of larger Myddosomes.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that the difference in delay time for Myddosome formation could be due slow formation of a TLR4 dimer or binding to the TLR4 dimer, rather than the time take to assemble the Myddosome after TLR4 dimerisation and binding since we have only measured the delay time for Myddosome formation when triggered by LPS or Aβ aggregates. This delay times involves dimerization of TLR4, binding of LPS or Aβ aggregates to the TLR4 dimer followed by Myddosome formation. These other processes might contribute to the difference in delay time that we observed between LPS or Aβ aggregates. It is worth noting that in our experiments we deliver the LPS or Aβ aggregates directly onto the surface for 5 seconds and that we previously showed the presence of the preformed TLR4 dimers on the cell surface (Latty et al., 2018). The affinity of Aβ aggregates for TLR4 is not known but LPS has a high affinity for TLR4, estimated to ∼3 nM for lipid A–TLR4-MD-2 (Akashi et al., 2003). However, even with this high affinity which implies fast binding, direct delivery directly onto the surface and the presence of preformed TLR4 dimers on the cell surface we observed that it took 80 s to observe Myddosome formation. This indicates that Myddosome formation is the slow step for LPS triggering. This is likely to be the case Aβ aggregates, since pM concentrations of aggregates can trigger TLR4 signalling (Hughes et al., 2020) indicating high affinity. However, it is not possible to rule out a contribution of a difference in affinity to observed difference in delay time without measuring the affinity directly.</p><p>We have added both these points to a new paragraph on the limitations of the study in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
