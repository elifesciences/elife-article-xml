We have previously used single-virion measurements of fusion kinetics to study the molecular mechanism of influenza-virus envelope fusion. Published data on fusion inhibition by antibodies to the 'stem' of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) now allow us to incorporate into simulations the provision that some HAs are inactive. We find that more than half of the HAs are unproductive even for virions with no bound antibodies, but that the overall mechanism is extremely robust. Determining the fraction of competent HAs allows us to determine their rates of target-membrane engagement. Comparison of simulations with data from H3N2 and H1N1 viruses reveals three independent functional variables of HA-mediated membrane fusion closely linked to neutralization susceptibility. Evidence for compensatory changes in the evolved mechanism sets the stage for studies aiming to define the molecular constraints on HA evolvability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11009.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11009.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11009.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Influenza (or flu) viruses can infect humans and other animals and can lead to life-threatening illness. To multiply, the virus particles must first enter a host cell. The final step in the entry process is the fusion of the membrane that surrounds the influenza virus with the membrane of the host cell. This event releases the core of the virus particle into the cell, where it can stimulate the cell to make more copies of the virus.</p><p>To ensure that membrane fusion takes place at the right place and time, influenza virus decorates the surface of its membrane with a protein called hemagglutinin. This protein senses cues provided by the target cell and then undergoes a series of transformations that lead to membrane fusion. During this process, hemagglutinin molecules insert into the target cell membrane to bring together the viral and cellular membranes.</p><p>In 2013, a group of researchers developed a computer simulation algorithm to study the events that lead to membrane fusion. In the model, the hemagglutinin molecules on a virus particle are activated at random to insert into the cell membrane. Now, Ivanovic and Harrison – two of the researchers from the earlier work – compared the predictions of this model to experimental data from previous studies of membrane fusion by influenza virus particles.</p><p>This approach shows that a substantial fraction of hemagglutinin molecules fail to contact the target-cell membrane and are permanently inactivated instead. Fusion nonetheless proceeds efficiently. Ivanovic and Harrison suggest that these inactive hemagglutinins provide an evolutionary backup store. For example, the proportion of hemagglutinins on a virus particle that insert into the cell membrane affects how fast fusion occurs and how sensitive the virus is to attack by host immune-system proteins called antibodies. Therefore, an ability to control how often hemagglutinins insert into the membrane could allow the virus to adapt to host immune responses. In the future, Ivanovic and Harrison’s findings could aid the discovery of drugs that inhibit the entry of influenza into human cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11009.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11009.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>enveloped virus</kwd><kwd>cell entry</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd><kwd>fusion-protein catalysts</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54AI057159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivanovic</surname><given-names>Tijana</given-names></name><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mechanism of membrane-fusion catalysis in influenza viral infection of target cells is robust against the presence of a large fraction of non-productive viral fusion proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane fusion is the mechanism for directed interchange of contents among intracellular compartments.

The influenza hemagglutin (HA) is the best studied and most thoroughly characterized of the viral fusion proteins. Crystal structures determined in the 1980s and 1990s captured the fusion endpoints and showed that extensive structural rearrangements, triggered during entry by the low pH of an endosome, are part of the catalytic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilson et al., 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Skehel et al., 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bullough et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al.,1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1999</xref>).

The following picture emerged from experiments we described in 2013, in which we combined single-virion fusion observations with structure-guided mutation of HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>). Trimeric HA ‘spikes’ densely cover the surface of an influenza virus particle. The contact zone between virus and target membrane (a supported lipid bilayer in the case of our experiments) contains between 50 and 150 HA trimers—a number that may be even larger for filamentous virions. When the pH drops below a critical threshold, individual HAs within the contact zone adopt an ‘extended state’, in which the fusion peptide at the N-terminus of HA<sub>2</sub> engages the target membrane, while the C-terminal transmembrane anchor remains embedded in the viral membrane. Note that the ‘extended state’ might represent an ensemble of folded-back conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The probability of this stochastic event increases with proton concentration over the range at which groups on the protein titrate. A single HA trimer in the extended conformation cannot then fold back to its most stable, postfusion conformation, because of elastic resistance from the two membranes. Only when several neighboring HAs have extended and engaged can their joint action pull the two membranes together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When the critical number of extended neighbors is present, foldback is cooperative and progression toward fusion is fast.</p><p>These observations led us to propose that the cooperativity of foldback comes simply from the mutual insertion of the cooperating HAs in both fusing membranes and that the number of HAs required is a function of the free energy released from individual HA fold-back events. When the total free energy is enough to overcome the ‘hydration-force’ barrier to merger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rand and Parsegian, 1984</xref>), fusion can ensue. We called this a ‘tug-of-war’ mechanism—(N-1) trimers are not enough, but adding one more immediately precipitates a change, just as adding a critical extra team member will promptly snap a rope pulled against a fixed force. The team members need not touch each other as long as all are pulling on the same rope. An alternative model for cooperative action of fusion proteins comes from structural observations on alphavirus membrane fusion proteins, which suggest that a ring of five envelope-protein trimers might work as a single-unit fusion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibbons et al., 2004</xref>). This picture is a particular instance of mechanisms that require a defined, lateral interaction between participating proteins.</p><p>The probability of assembling a group of HA neighbors inserted into the target membrane depends on the fraction of <italic>active</italic> HAs. Some positions in the contact zone may be occupied by uncleaved HA<sub>0</sub>, which cannot undergo the fusion-inducing conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1998</xref>), and others, by the viral neuraminidase, NA (although NA appears to cluster on one side of the budded particle: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calder et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wasilewski et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the fusion peptides of some HAs that do undergo the low-pH induced conformation change might fail to insert into the target membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Exposure of unattached virions to low pH leads to inactivation, with the fusion peptides of rearranged HAs inserted back into the viral membrane, providing an experimental demonstration that non-productive conformational changes can indeed occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Weber et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wharton et al., 1995</xref>).

(2014)</xref> could yield new information about these parameters (see what follows and the next results section, The gamma-distribution approximation). The simulations showed that the yield of hemifusion is relatively insensitive to the presence of inactive HAs for N<sub>h</sub> between 3 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For N<sub>h</sub> = 3, more than 70% (<italic>f</italic><sub>np </sub>= 0.7) of the sites on a virion surface must be unproductive or inactive in order to detect any reduction in fusion yield; for N<sub>h </sub>= 6, we saw reduced yield whenever more than 50% of the sites lacked the potential to participate. The simulations also yielded relatively large increases in mean lag time to hemifusion for the tested range of <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). For N<sub>h </sub>= 3, we found a tenfold, and for N<sub>h </sub>= 6, a fivefold increase in mean time to hemifusion. In contrast to our simulation results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otterstrom et al. (2014)</xref> observed sudden decreases in hemifusion yield for even the small numbers of bound antibodies or Fabs, and at most about a two-to-threefold increase in hemifusion lag times until complete inhibition of hemifusion. This difference could not be explained by a smaller patch size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and suggested to us that even for virions with no bound antibodies, a significant portion of surface sites lacked the potential to participate in fusion (i.e. the experiment was sampling from the right-hand portion of an entire theoretical inhibition curve). This qualitative conclusion is independent of the actual value of N<sub>h</sub> or <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub>.</p><p>For all values of N<sub>h</sub>, the mean hemifusion-lag times had the same overall dependence on <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub>. As <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> increased, a phase of relatively shallow dependence of the lag time gave way to a much stronger rate of increase, at about the same fraction at which the overall yield of hemifusion began to decline (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). For <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> values at which more than half of the simulated virions no longer yielded hemifusion, the lag time dependence reached a plateau. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otterstrom et al. (2014)</xref> indeed observed a plateau in mean hemifusion lag times as a function of increasing antibody or Fab concentration, thus offering experimental support for the prediction derived from the proposed mechanism of fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>). Plateau occurs when additional reduction in the fraction of participating HAs is more likely to result in complete inhibition of hemifusion rather than further increase in the lag time. Indeed, for Fab concentrations in the plateau region for hemifusion delay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otterstrom et al. (2014)</xref> found a continuing decrease in hemifusion yield as Fab concentrations increased. The result is intuitively reasonable. A high fraction of non-participating sites in a contact patch corresponds to a high probability that any particular HA will fail to engage the target membrane, either because it cannot change conformation (unprocessed HA<sub>0</sub> or inhibitor bound HA<sub>1</sub>:HA<sub>2</sub>) or because it has irreversibly inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). When this probability becomes high enough, it becomes almost impossible to achieve N<sub>h</sub> membrane-engaged neighbors within a contact patch of fixed size (consider, for example, the number of ways one can fit N<sub>h </sub>= 6 active HA neighbors within the contact patches illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> for different <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> values).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The gamma-distribution approximation</title><p>The gamma probability distribution represents the kinetics of a process in which N rate-limiting events of (uniform) rate constant <italic>k</italic> occur in sequence.

On the other hand, the experimental values do rule out 6, for which the simulation derived <italic>N</italic><sub>gamma</sub> was greater than 4, even for the highest <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> values. Furthermore, in the simulations, <italic>k</italic><sub>gamma</sub> derived from hemifusion-delay distributions was larger than the value for the rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub>) corresponding to the probability used in the computation, but it approached this value at high <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, plateau regions yield <italic>k</italic><sub>gamma</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub> between 1.5 and 2).

Thus, to determine the rate constant for membrane engagement by individual HAs, one needs to determine the fraction of non-participating sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Evidence for non-productive HA refolding</title><p>We have examined as follows the relative contributions to non-participating sites from NA, HA<sub>0</sub> and non-productive HA<sub>1</sub>:HA<sub>2</sub> refolding.

(We consider only their Fab data here, to avoid potential complications from divalent binding of IgGs.) We simulated inhibition, taking 375 as the number of HAs per virion (1125 Fab sites) (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The yield of hemifusion for H3N2 X31 virions reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otterstrom et al.

Although approximate, this rescaling takes into account the experimental uncertainties that will make the observed yield lower than modeled by the simulation; for example, the program used to select virus particles will with some frequency pick non-particles (fluorescent spots) that will certainly fail to fuse (at least 7-9% in our published experiments: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovic et al, 2013</xref>). Imperfections in the planar bilayer would prevent detection of potential fusion events from particles that might land on them (e.g., stick to glass exposed at a hole in the bilayer).

In that model, the number of HAs needed to generate a fusion event is not fixed by the organization of some intermediate state (e.g., by lateral interactions within a ring of HAs), but rather by the relationship between the free energy needed to overcome the kinetic barrier to hemifusion and the free energy gained in the HA<sub>2</sub> conformational transition. Variation in N<sub>h</sub> between influenza strains supports this mechanism. The new simulations extend the earlier model by including inactive (or inactivated) HAs and by showing that data on Fab inhibition can help restrict the estimates for the number of HAs required to generate hemifusion and the fraction of participating HAs.</p><p>Our new simulation results further expose limitations of the original analytical model that we and others used to interpret single-virion fusion kinetic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floyd et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otterstrom et al., 2014</xref>). The standard analytical treatment of sequential kinetics (the gamma distribution) falls short, because the fusion mechanism involves stochastic events across a large enough interface that one of several potential initiating events will go on to completion. Even in the context of targeted HA inhibition analyzed here, and in a particular instance when most of the virions that are fusion competent have only a single potential region with N<sub>h</sub> active HA neighbors, the gamma distribution parameters, <italic>N</italic> and <italic>k</italic> do not reflect the underlying number of HA participants or the rate of their extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), because the N<sub>h</sub> HAs can extend in any order and there are more ways for the initial event to occur than for the next. Although the gamma distribution continues to be a useful tool to correlate experiment and simulation results, an updated analytical model would be needed to capture the fusogenic molecular events at the virus target-membrane interface, as we now understand them. Moreover, while our current simulation model does well in the context of accumulating single-virion membrane fusion data, it is likely that this model also will evolve as we gain new experimental insight. The experiment, computer simulation, and mathematical modeling will continue to evolve together, because they serve as independent tests for mutual validity and reliability and because each can lead to predictions that can be tested by one of the other, complementary approaches.</p><p>We showed in our previous paper that the rate of fusion-peptide release from the pocket near the three fold axis sets the rate constant for target-membrane engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>). This rate in turn depends on the overall stability of the pre-fusion conformation and (at a given pH) on the overall pK of the particular HA species. Simulations described here and comparisons with data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otterstrom et al. (2014)</xref> identify two additional parameters that determine the overall rate of HA-mediated fusion — the number (N<sub>h</sub>) of participating HA trimers required to distort the apposed membranes into a hemifusion stalk and the fraction within the contact zone of participating (active and productively refolded) HAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We show by comparing data from an H3N2 strain and an H1N1 strain that N<sub>h</sub> can vary from one strain to another even under the same experimental conditions. (These differences may or may not represent subtype specific differences.) N<sub>h</sub> times the free energy recovered in the fold-back step from an extended intermediate to the postfusion ‘trimer of hairpins’ must exceed the kinetic barrier to hemifusion, estimated to be at least 50 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison, 2015</xref>). It is reasonable to expect that the free-energy recovery, and hence the required N<sub>h</sub>, will depend on the particular HA in question.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11009.023</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Independent functional determinants of HA-mediated membrane fusion and their effects on the influenza virus susceptibility to neutralization.</title><p>Conclusions are presented in the context of the PS = 121 contact patch. (<bold>A</bold>) The rate of irreversible HA extension (<italic>k</italic><sub>e</sub>) and the frequency of unproductive or inactive HAs determine the rate of target membrane engagement by individual HAs.

In addition to governing the rate of release, the fusion-peptide amino-acid sequence, which is very highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nobusawa et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cross et al., 2009</xref>), may influence the efficiency of target-membrane insertion. It is also plausible that continued receptor engagement by HA<sub>1</sub> might contribute to the probability of target-membrane engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Ordering of HA conformational transitions in the context of membrane fusion may vary among strains, but some features are suggested by studies of soluble HA ectodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Godley et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia et al., 2015</xref>). If the C-terminus of HA<sub>2</sub> becomes disordered before the rest of the conformational changes that allow HA extension, then HA<sub>1</sub>-receptor engagement will increase the probability that fusion peptide sequences project toward the target membrane instead of inserting back into the viral membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The general approach developed in our previous papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floyd et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>) has also been used to study the flavivirus fusion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al, 2014</xref>). Flaviviruses have about 25% the surface area of even the smallest influenza virions and can display at most 60 trimers (about 15% of the number on a typical small influenza virus particle). A transition from dimer-clustered E-protein subunits to fusogenic trimers is a component of the mechanism not required when the fusogen is already trimeric like influenza virus HA. Nonetheless, the fusion mechanisms for the two groups of viruses are relatively similar. Trimerization of the flavivirus E-protein subunits and target-membrane engagement of their fusion loops are rate-limiting; hemifusion requires at least two adjacent trimers. Simulations show that trimerization is a bottleneck because of limited availability of competent monomers within the contact zone between virus and target membrane, so that trimer formation must await monomer activation (e.g., dimer dissociation). The basic concepts revealed by our current analyses might thus be generalizable to other viral membrane fusion systems.</p><p>The constraints imposed by fitting the hemifusion yield and the hemifusion delay time as functions of the number of Fab-inactivated HAs have allowed us to determine the fraction of unproductive HAs. This determination has in turn allowed us to associate the <italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub> value with the rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>e</sub>) for the limiting step during membrane engagement. Although the specific value for <italic>f</italic><sub>un</sub> depended on patch size, the underlying rate constant did not (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have previously concluded from the fusion kinetics of HA mutants that the rate-limiting step of membrane engagement is the release of the fusion peptide from its ‘prefusion’ pocket near the threefold axis of the trimeric HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>). Reversible fluctuations at HA<sub>1</sub>:HA<sub>1</sub>, HA<sub>1</sub>:HA<sub>2</sub> and HA<sub>2</sub>:HA<sub>2</sub> interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, ‘open state’) determine a ‘window of opportunity’ for fusion-peptide release and for their irreversible projection beyond the outer margins of adjacent HA<sub>1</sub> heads. The link between <italic>k</italic><sub>e</sub> and the rate constant for a specific molecular rearrangement should in the longer term allow us to derive direct information for individual fusion catalysts in a functionally relevant context.</p><p>In our analysis of conformational changes for virion-associated HA in the absence of target membranes, we have made the unexpected observation that the rate of irreversible inactivation for X31 HA is accelerated at the target membrane interface. It took 10 min at pH5.2 and 37C for about half of the HAs on a virion surface to inactivate irreversibly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The same virions hemifuse with a mean delay of ~1 min at the same pH and at a much lower temperature (23°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>). According to our current simulation model, for <italic>f</italic><sub>np </sub>= 0.5 and N<sub>h </sub>= 3, at the time of hemifusion, an average of 34% of HAs at the target-membrane interface are no longer in the pre-fusion conformation (i.e. have inserted in the target membrane or become inactivated). This is at least an order of magnitude greater than their rate of inactivation on free virions. Because the frequency of non-productive HA refolding is high (at least ~50%), the presence of a target membrane appears to accelerate both productive and non-productive refolding. We illustrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> a model that could explain these observations. Receptor engagement might retain HA<sub>1</sub> in a configuration separated from HA<sub>2</sub> (an ‘open-HA&quot; conformation) and thereby increase the time interval for fusion peptide release and irreversible HA extension. Receptor engagement might also influence the ratio of membrane insertion to HA inactivation (see our earlier comment), but an overall increase in the rate of committed HA extension would in any case increase the rate at which HAs reach one or the other of those endpoints. The degree of rate increase (with respect to inactivation of HAs on free virions) will depend on the relationship between the lifetime of the open state and the probability of fusion-peptide release during the interval when HA<sub>1</sub> is not in the way. Udorn HA does not exhibit the same relative increase in the rate of refolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). After 1 minute of incubation at low pH, most of its virion-associated HAs have assumed the low-pH conformation, but the rate of Udorn hemifusion at pH 5.2 is only ~twofold higher than that of X-31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovic et al, 2013</xref>). Udorn HA, with a destabilized docking of the fusion peptide, appears to have a much greater probability of fusion-peptide release during its unconstrained (i.e. on free virions) open-state lifetime than does X-31 HA, which requires, for comparably rapid extension, the increased open-state lifetime afforded by receptor interactions with HA<sub>1</sub>. The Udorn fusion peptide might, however, be less efficient at inserting into the target membrane, because of the mutation of Gly to Ser at its fourth position. If so, the ratio of non-productive to productive HA transitions might be higher for Udorn than for X-31. The proposed role for HA-receptor contacts in catalysis of membrane fusion, not just in cell attachment, should be directly testable by future single-virion membrane fusion experiments. An important consequence of this possibility is that adjustments in receptor affinity would effectively modulate not only the yield and kinetics of fusion, but also the susceptibility of the virus to neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>The rate of fusion-peptide exposure is higher for HA from PR8 H1N1 virus than for HA from X-31 H3N2, but a greater N<sub>h</sub> and potentially also a decreased productivity of refolding for the former strain leads to a somewhat lower overall rate of fusion (panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, compensatory changes appear to maintain the overall rate within an acceptable range and imply some degree of independence of the molecular mechanisms that modulate the three fusion-rate determinants. Influenza virus penetrates from low-pH endosomes, and the rate of fusion may have an optimum determined by a balance between the rate of acidification of the virion interior (required to release viral RNPs from the matrix protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin and Helenius, 1991</xref>]) and the efficiency of penetration before the virus particle undergoes lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivanovic et al., 2012</xref>). Replication of influenza virus in birds, humans and pigs is constrained by different kinds of pressures on its cell-entry machinery (stability of HA in the extracellular environment and its roles in receptor binding and membrane fusion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schrauwen and Fouchier, 2014</xref>). Distinct mechanisms that independently modulate the properties of this molecular machinery might determine the potential of a given strain to adapt to replication in a new host. Similar considerations will determine the potential of HA to evolve resistance to inhibitors that target it.</p><p>Higher N<sub>h</sub> (combined with relatively low productivity of HA refolding) reduces the baseline yield of fusion and increases the susceptibility of the H1N1 strain used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otterstrom et al. (2014)</xref> to a fusion inhibitor (antibody) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). A recent study of HIV-1 cell entry combined experiment and simulation to show infectivity differences among HIV-1 strains that differ in the number of participating fusion proteins required for entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brandenberg et al., 2015</xref>). Further studies of the range over which N<sub>h</sub> can vary among influenza strains, even within subtypes, and molecular determinants of N<sub>h</sub>, will be valuable for assessing levels of antibodies (or other entry inhibitors) required for protection.</p><p>The high percentage of unproductive HAs is probably the most unexpected result of our analysis. In our own experiments, cleavage was complete, so remaining HA<sub>0</sub> is not the reason for this observation. After release of the fusion peptide and formation of an extended intermediate (driven, presumably, by the strong α-helical propensity of the segment between the α1 and α2 helices in HA<sub>2</sub>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carr and Kim, 1993</xref>), the relative efficiency of membrane engagement, which traps the extended intermediate, and HA<sub>2</sub> fold-back will determine whether the HA is productive or not. Under the conditions of our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floyd et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>) and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otterstrom et al. (2014)</xref>, the two efficiencies appear to be comparable, and fusion occurs even with more than half of the HAs inactive. The relatively large proportion of non-productive conformational transitions (<italic>f</italic><sub>un</sub> ~0.65-0.75) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) lies within the region of the fusion inhibition curve in which small changes in <italic>f</italic><sub>un</sub> will influence both yield and rate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The large effect on fusion of a small number of bound antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otterstrom et al., 2014</xref>) is consistent with this prediction. A potential evolvability benefit for the virus is that a small decrease in <italic>f</italic><sub>un</sub> will have a comparably strong effect, directly offsetting the effects of antibodies or potential fusion inhibitors. The relative insensitivity of the fusion mechanism to a high ratio of unproductive to productive HAs, and the potential for a direct contribution to the efficiency of fusion from adjustments in the fraction of non-productive events, combine to produce an extremely robust general mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Virions</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Strains</title><p>Virions used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floyd et al.

In brief, we defined a circular contact patch incorporating either 121 or 55 HAs arranged in a hexagonal lattice, where each internal HA has exactly 6 HA neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For simulations involving virions with a reduced fraction of active HAs, a defined fraction of HAs in random positions within the contact patch were flagged as inactive or unproductive (different random positions for each analyzed virion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We assumed a single-step process for the irreversible extension of individual HAs leading either to membrane insertion (active HA; productive path, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or inactivation (unproductive HA; non-productive path, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first derived lag times for each HA (both active and inactive/unproductive) in the contact patch by random drawing from an exponentially decaying function with rate constant, k<sub>sim</sub> (see below).

We show this result here for WT virions of two different X31HA-Udorn and UdornHA-Udorn virus preparations used in that study (each was derived from a separate plaque during initial purification). We further demonstrate the ability of these virion-associated HAs to convert to their low-pH form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Western blots</title><p>All samples were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a 0.45-µm PVDF membrane and probed with A2 antibody specific for HA<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Copeland et al., 1986</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>HA processing</title><p>Purified virions were stored in virion buffer (20 mM Hepes-NaOH pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA).

Neutral-pH samples were directly mixed with 52.5 µl reneutralized buffer (47.5 µl pH 5.2 buffer pre-mixed with 5 µl neutralization buffer). At indicated time points reneutralized and neutral samples were split into equal aliquots (0.4 µl original virus stock equivalents). One aliquot was loaded directly onto the gel (no trypsin samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> or input samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A second aliquot was treated with trypsin (40 µg/ml final trypsin concentration) for 30 min on ice (trypsin was inactivated using 0.5-1mM PMSF). The remaining aliquot was subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with conformation-specific anti-HA antibody, LC89 (specific for the low-pH form of HA, HA<sub>2</sub> epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wharton et al., 1995</xref>)), as follows. Samples were mixed with ~1.4 µg (LC89) antibody in a 12 µl reaction additionally consisting of 1% NP40 and incubated overnight at 4C. Protein G beads (Dynabeads, Life Technologies) were washed twice with IP buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40) and then resuspended in this buffer. An equivalent of 10 µl beads was added to each IP sample in 8 µl total buffer volume. Bead-containing reactions were incubated for 2 hours with gentle rotation at 4C. Total IP supernatant was mixed with reducing gel sample buffer and boiled. IP pellet (beads) were washed three times with IP buffer, then resuspended in reducing gel sample buffer and boiled. Total IP pellet and supernatant were loaded onto gels.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Antoine van Oijen for comments on the manuscript.

The simulation process is outlined within the main code text and in the Computer Simulation subsection of the Materials and methods. The code was adapted from Ivanovic et al (2013) to include a possibility of N<sub>h</sub>=6 and the unproductive HA population, and to measure hemifusion delay from the start of the simulation rather

Your submission has been generally favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor (Axel Brunger), and three reviewers, but they identified several areas that require some revision.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents a quantitative analysis of influenza single particle membrane fusion data that represents an important contribution to understanding this process at the molecular level. The authors have previously developed a simulation model for these single virion fusion studies and in this manuscript substantially extend this analysis to gain insight into the dependency of experimental observables (e.g. fusion delay times and fusion yield) as a function of non-active HA trimers, the number of HA trimers required for fusion and the number of antibody Fabs that inhibit fusion. The parameters that govern the overall process of fusion and its susceptibility to inhibition by Fabs suggest why some influenza strains may be more easily neutralized by antibody and how physical attributes of the individual HA trimers can influence both fusion and neutralization. The simulation model also makes specific predictions about individual HA trimer activation rates and contributions to the free energy requirements to drive membrane fusion that are likely to be testable in future experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The current manuscript is quite dense and takes significant effort to work through many details of both the model and the simulation data presented. The authors are encouraged to simplify some of the figures and to divide some of these further (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) so that the main points can be more easily followed by a reader who is unfamiliar with the approach. Specific suggestions by one of the reviewers are provided below. Some of the detailed graphs could be provided as supplementary data figures.</p><p>2) The predicted N from the gamma model is dependent on the fraction of non-productive HA trimers (quite striking in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, one would not expect the number of required active trimers to trigger fusion be dependent on the fraction of non-productive or antibody-inactivated HA trimers. Thus, the gamma distribution model is indeed questionable if there is a significant fraction of non-productive &quot;molecules&quot;. Perhaps this limitation of the gamma function treatment should be made more explicit since it has rather general implications (as hinted in the manuscript).</p><p>3) Although the simulation model seems physically more reasonable than the gamma distribution model, the derived parameters (<italic>k, N</italic>, etc.) are not entirely unique as discussed in this work. Moreover, the simulation model itself may not be unique. Future experimental data may require further revision of the model or even perhaps a different model. Some discussion of this point might be appropriate.</p><p>4) Cooperativity of the action of fusion proteins in conjunction with the membrane has been inferred from the simulation model analysis of kinetic traces. However, is there direct evidence for the arrest to be in an extended conformation prior to HA fold-back?</p><p>5) Paragraph two, subheading “Simulations of molecular events at the virus-target membrane interface”: how do these increases in time to hemifusion compare to those from the Otterstrom data?</p><p>6) Paragraph three, subheading “Simulations of molecular events at the virus-target membrane interface” regarding lag time plateaus: is there an increase in bound virus that does not fuse when the hemifusion lag plateau is reached?</p><p>7) The fusion kinetics for X31 and Udorn are faster than the 10-minute incubation times shown in the immunoblots. It would be helpful to see time courses with time points better corresponding to fusion timescales.</p><p>8) The simulation model uses the parameter <italic>k</italic>, the rate of activation of independent HA. In the present manuscript, a somewhat different rate is used compared to the 2013 <italic>eLife</italic> work where <italic>k</italic> = 0.0025 /s for all simulations of X31 (H3N2) influenza. Here <italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub> was changed so that it matched experiments in Otterstrom 2014 (paragraph two, subheading “Fab inhibition of H3 HA” and paragraph two, subheading “Fab inhibition of H1 HA”). Question: is the resulting fit rather insensitive to changes of 5-10 in this rate? This point may need some discussion.</p><p>9) Abstract: comparing only 2 strains and one mutant might be too few to make a general statement about HA evolvability. Perhaps this statement should be softened.</p><p>Specific suggestions on the figures:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> should be revised to represent each of the parameters of the modeling more clearly. A schematic of the model that explicitly shows how each of the main parameters (N<sub>h</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub>, <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub>, antibody Fab, and patch size) plays a role in the process of fusion is important. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows prefusion productive vs. non-productive HA refolding, but a more comprehensive schematic overview of all of the key steps that are being modeled would be useful in order to quickly grasp what is being simulated.</p><p>Leave out the HA structural details in an overall schematic of the modeling, although it is still useful for showing productive vs. non-productive HA.</p><p>Use a simple representation for active HA trimers, inactive HA trimers, or Fab-inhibited trimers.</p><p>Make the schematic multiple panels, displaying the HA molecules (active and inactive) at the interface of the viral and cellular membranes.</p><p>Within each panel one can highlight/define two model parameters – the fraction of non-participating trimers (<italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub>) and the patch size (PS).</p><p>Use multiple panels to show individual HA trimers being activated (to highlight/represent <italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub>) and also use the number of panels to indicate the number of activated HA trimers required for driving membrane fusion (e.g three activation panels for N<sub>h</sub> of 3).</p><p>There could be an indicator for the overall fusion delay time above the panels that helps tie this observable to the discrete steps affected by <italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub>, <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> and N<sub>h</sub></p><p>Split <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> into two figures. The first could show the hemifusion and hemifusion delay predictions and the second could show the <italic>N</italic><sub>gamma</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>gamma</sub>. There may be other ways to divide these up (e.g. separated by patch size).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, consider putting the PS55 panels into supplementary information. The PS121 are really the most interesting with comparisons to the experimental data.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Although the figure has boxes around the parameter sets of N<sub>h</sub> and <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> that agree best with the Fab inhibition data, the main point is still mostly buried. The figures could be simplified somehow, by de-emphasizing the majority of the bars that are not relevant to the main point being made (e.g. using different colors or some other approach).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: Same as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Consider moving the left panels to supplementary figures and just show the predictions with the experimental data. The authors should discuss why they think the experimentally observed hemifusion delay could increase as a function of the bound Fabs in contrast to the model.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: panel A could be removed if a comprehensive schematic is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In this current panel 8A the model parameters are insufficiently represented. <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> is shown as an arrow, similar to k<sub>fp</sub> (or <italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub>). The participating HA trimers go immediately to two postfusion trimers, indicating N<sub>h</sub>. However, this is too similar to a standard representation of fusion that loses the key point that there are multiple independent HA activation events contributing to the accumulation of N<sub>h</sub> trimers, which can then drive fusion. Panel 8B also could use some revision to make the H3N2 and H1N1 comparison more clearly. Question: what do the filled diamonds represent?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11009.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:1) The current manuscript is quite dense and takes significant effort to work through many details of both the model and the simulation data presented.

Specific suggestions by one of the reviewers are provided below. Some of the detailed graphs could be provided as supplementary data figures.</italic></p><p>We have complied with all the suggestions for modifying the figures as outlined here and in our responses to the reviewer’s specific suggestions below. We have also made textual changes to simplify the description of the simulation analyses and to improve the manuscript flow. Key textual changes are highlighted in red in the tracked-changes version of the manuscript text (figure legends were substantially modified to reflect figure changes and reshuffling but were not highlighted unless in a reference to a specific question below).</p><p>Figure revisions:</p><p>1) All PS55 panels have now been moved to figure supplements. The description of the simulation results now primarily focuses on the larger patch size, PS121. PS55 panels are now referenced only in a few places in the main text without emphasizing detail, but rather focusing on general trends and conceptualizing results for the smaller patch size as a unique instance of a larger patch size with a smaller number of participating sites. See the Results section (subsections “Simulations of molecular events at the virus-target membrane interface”, “Fab inhibition of H3 HA”, and “Fab inhibition of H1 HA”) and the Materials and methods subsection, “Patch size”.</p><p>2) We have included additional detail in the diagram of HA conformational changes leading either to productive or non-productive HA refolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) with two main goals: 1) to better illustrate a model for the extended state of HA (your revision comment 4 below) and 2) to facilitate discussion of the proposed active role of HA-receptor contacts in membrane-fusion catalysis (paragraph seven, Discussion). This detailed image has also allowed us to remove a similar diagram from the model figure at the end (per your specific suggestion below).</p><p>3) We have added a 3D illustration of our fusion model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, adapted from our 2013 <italic>eLife</italic> publication) to facilitate its description in the Introduction and to conceptualize diagrams of contact patches we went on to introduce in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>4) We have added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which illustrates all the simulated fusion parameters using diagrams of contact patches.</p><p>5) To all the simulation figures, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and their corresponding PS55 supplements, we have added illustrations of what is being simulated using patch-size diagrams introduced in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>6) We have introduced a new parameter (<italic>f</italic><sub>un</sub> – fraction unproductive HAs – to replace <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> in several instances where its use might have been confusing previously). We introduce this parameter at the end of the Results section titled “Evidence for non-productive HA refolding”, and explain in the Methods under “Fab inhibition and unproductive HAs” how this fraction combines with the frequency of antibody-bound HAs to yield the value for <italic>f</italic><sub>np</sub> used in simulations that generated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>-8.</p><p>7) We have generated a new model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. The main mechanistic conclusions are now summarized in panel A using patch-size diagrams to illustrate both N<sub>h</sub> and <italic>f</italic><sub>un</sub>. We use vertical bars to illustrate the theoretical fusion yield. We show mean first-event delays to illustrate the effect of <italic>k</italic><sub>e</sub>, which we contrast with the overall hemifusion-delay values just below them. Panel B now illustrates consequences of the evolved fusion mechanistic features for the two analyzed strains on their susceptibilities to neutralization.</p><p>8) We have simplified both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8–figure supplement 2</xref>: our tests of sensitivity of the key conclusions to potential uncertainty in the measurements for the number of antibodies needed for hemifusion inhibition, and we have removed PS55 panels altogether and simplified their descriptions in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>2) The predicted N from the gamma model is dependent on the fraction of non-productive HA trimers (quite striking in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, one would not expect the number of required active trimers to trigger fusion be dependent on the fraction of non-productive or antibody-inactivated HA trimers. Thus, the gamma distribution model is indeed questionable if there is a significant fraction of non-productive &quot;molecules&quot;. Perhaps this limitation of the gamma function treatment should be made more explicit since it has rather general implications (as hinted in the manuscript).</italic></p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added a paragraph in the Discussion to make the statement of the limitations of the gamma function more explicit (paragraph two).</p><p><italic>3) Although the simulation model seems physically more reasonable than the gamma distribution model, the derived parameters (</italic>k, N<italic>, etc.) are not entirely unique as discussed in this work. Moreover, the simulation model itself may not be unique. Future experimental data may require further revision of the model or even perhaps a different model. Some discussion of this point might be appropriate.</italic></p><p>We agree with the general comment and have added a statement in the Discussion (paragraph two) suggesting that the simulation model is likely to evolve as new data are gathered. We have also added the description of a couple of new research directions this work will lead us into (see Discussion, paragraphs seven and ten). However, we feel that current data strongly favors values for certain fundamental parameters despite some remaining uncertainty. While it is correct that the exact value for the fraction of non-participating sites is patch-size dependent, the values for the number (N<sub>h</sub>) of participating HA neighbors and the derived rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>e</sub>) of membrane engagement are patch-size independent, and, thus, unique for the current simulation model. We have revised the text to make that clear – see for example the Results (paragraphs two and three, subheading “Fab inhibition of H3 HA” and paragraph two, subheading “Fab inhibition of H1 HA”) and the Discussion (paragraph six). It is the differences between the two strains, rather than the specifics of the particular numbers, from which we draw the majority of our conclusions. For example, the different values for N<sub>h</sub> for the H1 and H3 strains support the ‘tug-of-war’ model of membrane fusion (see Discussion, paragraph one). Further, differences in independent functional variables provide evidence for compensatory features in the evolved mechanism (see Discussion, paragraph eight) and establish a direct link between the fusion mechanism and viral neutralization susceptibility (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> and the Discussion section).</p><p><italic>4) Cooperativity of the action of fusion proteins in conjunction with the membrane has been inferred from the simulation model analysis of kinetic traces. However, is there direct evidence for the arrest to be in an extended conformation prior to HA fold-back?</italic></p><p>This question relates back to our previous <italic>eLife</italic> 2013 publication, upon which this manuscript builds. In that prior paper we provided evidence that the arrest results from target membrane insertions of several HAs anywhere in the area of target-membrane contact. At that time, we also discussed that in order for fusion peptides to reach the target membrane and insert, they need to extend beyond the outer margins of adjacent HA1 heads (see also the Discussion section, paragraph six). While there is no direct information for the specific molecular structure of the ‘extended state’, in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we now illustrate two general ways this extra length could be gained. The extension of the N-terminal helical coiled-coil in HA2 that projects the fusion peptides toward the target membrane is essential, while the C-terminal portion of the molecule could either retain the pre-fusion conformation (the first extended-HA intermediate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or unfold to allow the onset of fold-back (the second and third extended-HA intermediates). <italic>The key point is that rather than representing a unique conformation, the extended state is likely an ensemble of folded-back conformations</italic>. We have added a sentence in the Introduction to reflect this point (paragraph three). We have also added a statement in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend that the corresponding distance between the two membranes linked by inserted HAs might fluctuate around a different set of values depending on how many HAs are cooperating.</p><p><italic>5) Paragraph two, subheading “Simulations of molecular events at the virus-target membrane interface”: how do these increases in time to hemifusion compare to those from the Otterstrom data?</italic></p><p>Thank you for this question. This was a good opportunity to compare our initial simulation results (current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) to experiment data reported by Otterstrom et al. (2014) and draw some preliminary conclusions. In the Results, paragraph two, subsection “Simulations of molecular events at the virus-target membrane interface”, we have now commented on their observations of the effects of targeted HA inhibition on both the fusion yield and increases in time to hemifusion. The difference between the theoretical predictions and their experiment data suggested to us that in addition to HAs inactivated by antibodies, there are HAs that abort anyway (are unproductive). This initial comparison might also improve the flow of our analyses in reference to your revision-point 1 above by setting the stage for subsequent detailed comparisons with their data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) Paragraph three, subheading “Simulations of molecular events at the virus-target membrane interface” regarding lag time plateaus: is there an increase in bound virus that does not fuse when the hemifusion lag plateau is reached?</italic></p><p>Yes, for antibody/Fab concentrations in the plateau region for hemifusion delay (≥100 to 1000 nM), Otterstrom et al. found a continued decrease in hemifusion yield as antibody/Fab concentrations increased. We have added this observation in the Results (please see “Simulations of molecular events at the virus-target membrane interface”).</p><p><italic>7) The fusion kinetics for X31 and Udorn are faster than the 10-minute incubation times shown in the immunoblots. It would be helpful to see time courses with time points better corresponding to fusion timescales.</italic></p><p>The purpose of this figure was to show that all HAs on virions we had used in fusion experiments (<italic>eLife</italic>, 2013) have the potential to convert to the low pH state, which they do (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>–figure supplement). However, the kinetics of inactivation of HAs on free virions (at least for X31) is significantly slower than in the context of membrane fusion, and this is the reason for including longer time courses for the virion-HA inactivation experiments (shorter time courses for X31 virions would not be informative). We did, however, in response to your suggestion, include an earlier time point for Udorn, which exposes an interesting difference between the two HAs and suggests a model that explains both the slow inactivation of X31 HA on free virions and the differential acceleration of X31 vs. Udorn HAs in association with target membranes. The proposed model fits quite nicely with our evolving interpretations, and we have now included it in the Discussion (paragraph seven). We have now also included a brief mention of the disproportionately slow inactivation kinetics for X31 HAs on free virions in the revised legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>8) The simulation model uses the parameter</italic> k<italic>, the rate of activation of independent HA. In the present manuscript, a somewhat different rate is used compared to the 2013</italic> eLife <italic>work where</italic> k <italic>= 0.0025 /s for all simulations of X31 (H3N2) influenza. Here</italic> k<italic><sub>sim</sub> was changed so that it matched experiments in Otterstrom 2014 (paragraph two, subheading “Fab inhibition of H3 HA” and paragraph two, subheading “Fab inhibition of H1 HA”). Question: is the resulting fit rather insensitive to changes of 5-10 in this rate? This point may need some discussion.</italic></p><p>This is correct; the resulting fit is completely insensitive to the changes in this rate. We have added a statement to this effect in the Computer simulations section of the Methods, within the subheading titled <italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub>. We have also added a similar brief statement in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and a more extensive explanation in the Methods for requiring different <italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub> values to recapitulate Otterstrom et al. data in the light of our new conclusions (<italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub> subheading in the Methods). The bottom line is that hemifusion delays measured by Otterstrom et al. (2014) are comparable to our own measurements with X31HA-Udorn virions (Ivanovic et al., 2013). The value for <italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub> we had used previously was quite arbitrary (as we had stated at the time) because we had no information about the frequency of unproductive events. It is the new determination of this relative frequency that allowed us to relate the <italic>k</italic><sub>sim</sub> value to the rate of individual HA insertion events.</p><p><italic>9) Abstract: comparing only 2 strains and one mutant might be too few to make a general statement about HA evolvability. Perhaps this statement should be softened.</italic></p><p>Yes, thank you.
