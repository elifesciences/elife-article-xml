In this study, we characterized a <italic>TIMM50</italic> disease-causing mutation in human fibroblasts and noted significant decreases in TIM23 core protein levels (TIMM50, TIMM17A/B, and TIMM23). Strikingly, TIMM50 deficiency had no impact on the steady-state levels of most of its putative substrates, suggesting that even low levels of a functional TIM23 complex are sufficient to maintain the majority of TIM23 complex-dependent mitochondrial proteome. As TIMM50 mutations have been linked to severe neurological phenotypes, we aimed to characterize TIMM50 defects in manipulated mammalian neurons. TIMM50 knockdown in mouse neurons had a minor effect on the steady state level of most of the mitochondrial proteome, supporting the results observed in patient fibroblasts. Amongst the few affected TIM23 substrates, a decrease in the steady state level of components of the intricate oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ribosome complexes was evident. This led to declined respiration rates in fibroblasts and neurons, reduced cellular ATP levels, and defective mitochondrial trafficking in neuronal processes, possibly contributing to the developmental defects observed in patients with TIMM50 disease. Finally, increased electrical activity was observed in TIMM50 deficient mice neuronal cells, which correlated with reduced levels of KCNJ10 and KCNA2 plasma membrane potassium channels, likely underlying the patients’ epileptic phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial protein import</kwd><kwd>TIM23</kwd><kwd>TIMM50</kwd><kwd>TIMM50 disease</kwd><kwd>import disease</kwd><kwd>Action potential</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1389/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azem</surname><given-names>Abdussalam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1057/22</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azem</surname><given-names>Abdussalam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1001576154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ashery</surname><given-names>Uri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2141/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ashery</surname><given-names>Uri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006312</institution-id><institution>BrightFocus Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A2022029S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ashery</surname><given-names>Uri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000864</institution-id><institution>Michael J.

In humans, these functions are executed by ~1500 different mitochondrial proteins, of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filograna et al., 2021</xref>). The remaining mitochondrial proteins are nuclear-encoded and thus imported into the mitochondria. The translocated proteins are sorted to their specific mitochondrial compartment via several intricate protein translocation pathways, including the presequence pathway, which is used for the import of nearly ~60% of the mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfanner, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The TIM23 complex mediates the import of some intermembrane space (IMS) proteins, many mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) proteins, and all mitochondrial matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mokranjac and Neupert, 2010</xref>). The TIM23 complex in yeast comprises three essential subunits, Tim23, Tim17, and Tim50 (TIMM23, TIMM17A/B, and TIMM50 in mammals). Association of Tim21 (TIMM21 in mammals) and Mgr2 (ROMO1 in mammals) promotes the lateral translocation of proteins into the MIM, while the association of the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) complex with the TIM23 core promotes the import of matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mokranjac et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ieva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richter et al., 2019</xref>). Recent structural analysis showed that Tim17 forms the protein translocation path, whereas the associated Tim23 protein likely plays a structural role, serving as a platform that mediates the association of other complex subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fielden et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Tim50, first discovered in yeast some two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geissler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mokranjac et al., 2003</xref>), is thought to be the first TIM23 complex component to interact with presequences of precursor proteins as they emerge from the Tom40 channel, thus playing a pivotal role in presequence-containing protein sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamamoto et al., 2002</xref>). It was further suggested that normal Tim50 functionality is required for maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meinecke et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, TIMM50, the mammalian homologue of Tim50, was shown to be involved in steroidogenesis and plays a preventive role in pathological cardiac hypertrophy and several types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bose et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sankala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Recently, TIMM50 has generated immense interest in human health research, as mutations in the encoding gene have been linked in geographically and ethnically varied populations to the development of a severe disease characterized by mitochondrial epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay, optic atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. To date, seven different mutations have been identified in children from ten unrelated families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Serajee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shahrour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tort et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reyes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moudi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Although TIMM50 mutants are mostly associated with neurological disorders, functional characterization of TIMM50 has yet to be reported in neuronal cells. Additionally, despite being involved in the import of nearly 60% of the mitochondrial proteins, the impact of TIMM50 deficiency on the entire mitochondrial proteome has yet to be characterized. In this study, using a proteomics approach, we show the impact of TIMM50 deficiency on the mitochondrial and cellular proteome and characterize, for the first time, the neurological role of TIMM50 by knocking it down in mouse neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>TIMM50</italic> disease-causing mutation reduces the levels of TIM23 complex components in patient fibroblasts</title><p>A previous study reported the clinical features of a rare genetic disease in several patients from two unrelated Arab families residing in Israel and Palestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shahrour et al., 2017</xref>).

Human <italic>TIMM50</italic> mutations lead to neurological effects, including mitochondrial epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability, seizure disorders like infantile spasms, and severe hypotonia accompanied by 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Serajee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shahrour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tort et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reyes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moudi et al., 2022</xref>). Despite being involved in the import of the majority of the mitochondrial proteome, little is known about the effects of TIMM50 deficiency on the entire mitochondrial proteome. Additionally, despite the fact that human TIMM50 mutations lead mainly to neurological symptoms, no study has yet addressed the effects of TIMM50 deficiency in brain cells. Therefore, in this study, we utilized two research models – TIMM50 mutant patient fibroblasts and TIMM50 KD primary mouse neuronal cultures, to study the impact of TIMM50 deficiency on the mitochondrial proteome and its impact on neurophysiology.</p><p>Interestingly, in both model systems, TIMM50 deficiency reduced the levels of TIM23 core subunits, yet did not alter steady-state levels of a majority of TIM23 substrates. These observations are similar to the recent analysis of patient-derived fibroblasts which demonstrated that <italic>TIMM50</italic> mutations lead to severe deficiency in the level of TIMM50 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reyes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crameri et al., 2024</xref>). Notably, this decrease in TIMM50 was accompanied by a decrease in the level of the other two core subunits, TIMM23 and TIMM17. However, unexpectedly, proteomics analysis in our study and that conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crameri et al., 2024</xref> indicate that steady-state levels of most TIM23-dependent proteins are not affected despite a drastic decrease in the levels of the TIM23<sup>CORE</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crameri et al., 2024</xref>). The most affected proteins constitute of intricate complexes, such as OXPHOS and MRP machineries. Thus, both these studies might indicate that even reduced levels of the TIM23<sup>CORE</sup> components are sufficient for maintaining the steady-state levels of most presequence-containing substrates. This is surprising, as normal TIM23 complex levels are suggested to be indispensable for the translocation of presequence-containing mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mokranjac et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamamoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vögtle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pfanner and Geissler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>). Even more surprising was that the amounts of some TIM23 substrates related to intricate metabolic and maintenance activities (e.g. ALDH2, GRSF-1, OAT, etc.) were increased.</p><p>These observations can be explained by several plausible mechanisms: it is possible that unlike what occurs in yeast, normal levels of mammalian TIMM50 and TIM23 complexes are mainly essential for maintaining the steady-state levels of intricate complexes/assemblies. Another explanation for this scenario is that the normal quantities of unaffected matrix proteins might be low, and hence, even ~10–20% of functional TIMM50 protein might be sufficient to maintain their steady-state levels. Alternatively, the presequence of such proteins might contain mitochondrial targeting signals (MTSs) that receive priority over other presequence-containing precursor proteins, thus enabling their translocation even in the presence of very few functional TIM23 complexes. However, further experiments examining these possibilities are needed to understand the compromised TIM23-mediated protein import.</p><p>As stated earlier, the loss of TIMM50 led to a significant reduction in the steady-state levels of other TIM23 core subunits (i.e. TIMM23 and TIMM17A/B). Notably, TIMM23 and TIMM17A/B are thought to be imported by the TIM22 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Káldi et al., 1998</xref>). However, we observed that the steady-state levels of TIM22 complex subunits had not been affected by TIMM50 deficiency (Files 1-3<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>). This indicates a hitherto unknown relation between steady state levels of TIMM50 and other TIM23 core subunits, which might affect the complex assembly process. Various structural and biochemical studies have attempted to elucidate the intricate structure of the TIM23 complex and the complicated interactions between its different subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fielden et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gevorkyan-Airapetov et al., 2009</xref>), however, little is presently known of the dynamic assembly processes of the complex. The fact that TIMM50 KD leads to a major reduction in the levels of TIMM23 and TIMM17A/B, despite a lack of direct dependency on the import of these proteins on TIMM50, and does not affect the levels of other TIM23 complex subunits, could provide a basis for future studies examining the assembly process of import complexes.</p><p>Our proteomics data and Seahorse XF analysis, paired with cellular ATP measurements, indicated that lower ATP levels were present in TIMM50-deficient cells. Specifically in the case of neurons, such ATP deficiency could be responsible for the negative impact seen on mitochondrial trafficking in neuronal cell processes, which could contribute to the various neurodegenerative phenotypes linked to the TIMM50 disease. Additionally, the detected increase in action potential firing rate in TIMM50-deficient neurons can explain the presence of epileptic seizures, a hallmark of all TIMM50 patients studied thus far. A plausible explanation for the increased action potential firing rate could be the 2.5-fold reduction in the levels of the KCNA2 (K<sub>v</sub>1.2) and KCNJ10 (K<sub>ir</sub>4.1) voltage-dependent potassium channels, as revealed by our proteomics and immunoblot analysis. The KCNA2 (K<sub>v</sub>1.2) channel is a slowly inactivating channel that regulates neuronal excitability and firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). In peripheral sensory neurons, K<sub>v</sub>1.2 helps to determine spike frequency, while in neurons of the medial trapezoid body, the Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.6 subunits are important regulators of repetitive spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glazebrook et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dodson et al., 2002</xref>). While the inactivation of several of the potassium channels like K<sub>v</sub>1.2, K<sub>v</sub>1.1, and Kcnj10 (K<sub>ir</sub>4.1) are important for neuronal excitability, action potential width, and firing properties, in general, mutations in the genes encoding these channels that alter their inactivation are known to lead to temporal lobe epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaczmarek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schulte et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, blocking the activation of the K<sub>v</sub>1.2 by α-DTX had no effect on the resting membrane potential and only small effects on the amplitude and duration of the action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glazebrook et al., 2002</xref>), similar to what we observed in TIMM50 KD neurons, that showed a reduction in K<sub>v</sub>1.2 levels. Furthermore, blocking K<sub>v</sub>1.2 activation by α-DTX increased the frequency of action potentials in visceral sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glazebrook et al., 2002</xref>), which, again, agrees with our observation that α-DTX application increased the firing rate in Scr control-transduced neurons, while hardly affecting the firing rate of TIMM50 KD neurons as they express lower levels of K<sub>v</sub>1.2. Hence, similar changes in the neuronal firing rate, as observed in our TIMM50 KD neurons, might occur in TIMM50 patients, and could lead to the epileptic phenotype seen in these patients. However, more studies are needed to verify this hypothesis.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that even low levels of TIMM50 and TIM23<sup>CORE</sup> components suffice in maintaining the majority of the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane proteome. Nevertheless, a reduction in TIMM50 levels leads to a decrease of many OXPHOS and MRP complex subunits, which indicates that normal TIMM50 levels might be mainly essential for maintaining the steady state levels and assembly of intricate complex proteins. The consequently reduced cellular ATP levels and the detected mitochondrial abnormalities in neurons provide a plausible link between the TIMM50 mutation and the observed developmental defects in the patients. Moreover, the increased electrical activity resulting from decreased steady-state levels of KCNA2 and KCNJ10 potassium channels plausibly links the TIMM50 mutation to the epileptic phenotype of patients, thus, providing a new direction for therapeutic efforts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of primary human fibroblasts</title><p>Four mm punch biopsy samples were obtained from two TIMM50 patients Patient 1 (P1) and Patient 2 (P2) carrying the mutation c.446C&gt;T; p.Thr149Met and a normal family member that served as a healthy control (HC).

Go-term analysis was performed using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sherman et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Seahorse XF mito-stress and glycolysis stress tests</title><p>Fibroblasts were plated in Seahorse XF 96-well plates (Agilent, 103775–100) at 20–30% confluency, with experiments being carried out at ~90% confluency. For neurons, ~1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were plated in each well of Seahorse XF 96-well plates, transduced with the Scr control or Sh2 constructs on 4 DIV and the experiment was carried out on 18 DIV. One-two hours prior to the experiment, the fibroblasts or neuronal cultures were washed and the medium was replaced with Seahorse XF DMEM, pH 7.4 (Agilent, 103575–100).</p><p>For the mito-stress test, the medium was supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma, S8636-100ML), 10 mM glucose (Merck, 1.08337.1000), and 2 mM glutamine (Biological Industries, 03-020-1B). The plates were loaded with oligomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, O4876), carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, Sigma-Aldrich, C2920), and rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, R8875) together with antimycin A (Sigma-Aldrich, A8674), at final well concentrations of 1, 2, 0.5, and 0.5 μM, respectively. For the glycolysis stress test, the medium was only supplemented with glutamine. The plates were loaded with glucose, oligomycin, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG, Sigma-Aldrich, D8375-1G) at final well concentrations of 10 mM, 1 μM, and 50 mM, respectively. Plates were then loaded into the Seahorse XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer and the experiments were carried out using the manufacturer’s protocol. To normalize the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) or extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) values, fibroblasts were dyed with SynaptoGreen (Biotium, 70022) immediately at the end of each experiment and fluorescence levels were measured using a plate reader (BioTek Synergy HTX). In the case of neurons, the cells were dyed with DRAQ5 (BioLegend, 424101) immediately at the end of each experiment, and imaged on an Incucyte SX5 live cell imaging and analysis system. Dyed nuclei were counted using the ImageJ particle analysis function. Three to six biological repeats, each involving three to six technical repeats, were performed for each experimental and control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mitochondrial DNA content</title><p>Total DNA was isolated form near-confluent fibroblasts or 18 DIV transduced neuronal cultures using a GeneElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep kit (Sigma, G1N350-1KT). Quantitative real-time PCR (StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System) was then performed on each sample in the presence of SYBR green (PCR Biosystems, PB20.16–05). Expression levels were determined using the comparative cycle threshold (2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup>) method, with the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT)-encoding gene serving as housekeeping gene. Primer sequences used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mitochondrial trafficking</title><p>Neuronal cultures were plated in a similar manner as described for membrane potential measurements. Neuronal cultures (4 DIV) were co-transfected with the TIMM50 KD or control plasmids, as well as a mito-dsRed-expressing plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindenboim et al., 2013</xref>), using 0.6 µg of each plasmid and 0.6 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668–027). A transfection rate of 2–5% was seen the next day. This sparse transfection allowed for visualization of single neurons and their mitochondria, given the dramatically reduced background that allowed for tracking of mitochondrial movement in individual neurites. Following transfection, 10 DIV cultures were live-imaged with an iMIC inverted microscope equipped with a Polychrome V system (TILL photonics) and an ANDOR iXon DU 888D EMCCD camera (Andor, Belfast, Northern Ireland). Cells were imaged using a 60 x oil immersion objective (Olympus), under temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> control. Fields of view containing neurites stretching for at least 50 μm and not more than 100 μm from the cell body were imaged for 5 min, with a 3 s interval between each image. Individual neurites in each image set were selected using the segmented line tool in ImageJ. The images were then calibrated in time and space and turned into kymographs using the KymoToolBox ImageJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zala et al., 2013</xref>). Each individual mitochondrion present in the neurite was then manually tracked on the kymograph using the segmented line tool to extract various parameters. Mitochondria were defined as static if they moved at a speed lower than 0.02 μm/s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Determination of cellular ATP levels</title><p>Neuronal cells were plated into a 96-well cell culture plate at a density of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well. Cells were transduced with the Sh2 or Scr control constructs on 4 DIV and cellular ATP measurements were performed on 18 DIV using a Luminescent ATP Detection Assay Kit (Abcam, ab113849). To block luminescence signal contamination from adjacent wells, the lysis step of the assay was performed in the clear cell culture plate and the lysates were transferred to a white, flat-bottom 96-well plate. Luminescence signals were read using the GloMax Navigator System.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Intrinsic neuronal excitability and spontaneous activity</title><p>Neurons were plated at a density of 1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well of a 12-well plate and transduced on 4 DIV, with experiments being carried out on 16–20 DIV. Conventional whole-cell recordings were performed with borosilicate thin wall glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, TW150-3) with an input resistance of 4–5 MΩ. Series resistance ranged from 8 to 25 MΩ. An EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier was used in conjunction with PatchMaster software (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany). The external solution consisted of 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, supplemented with 2 mg/ml glucose, pH 7.4, and osmolarity adjusted to 305 mOsm. The internal solution consisted of 110 mM K gluconate, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM Na creatine phosphate, and 10 mM EGTA, pH 7.4. Osmolarity adjusted to 285 mOsm.</p><p>To measure the rheobase and assess repetitive and maximal firing, long (250 ms) depolarization square current steps of varying intensity (from –100–600 pA, at 2 pA intervals) were applied. Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. For α-dendrotoxin (α-DTX) measurements, long (250 ms) depolarizing square current steps of varying intensity (From 0–500 pA, at 100 pA intervals) were applied to the cells, before and after application of an external solution containing 100 nM α-DTX (Alomone Labs, D-350). Clear traces in the range of 100–300 pA were chosen in the before-α-DTX measurements and compared to the respective traces in the after-α-DTX measurements. To measure spontaneous activity, an external solution containing 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX; Alomone Labs, T550_1 mg) was perfused onto the cells, followed by a high current injection to assure that no action potentials were being generated. The mode was then switched to a voltage clamp, the holding voltage was adjusted to –60 mV and mEPSCs were recorded for 2 min (at repeating 10 s intervals). The data were analyzed with Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The TaroTools procedure set (for Igor Pro) was used to analyze spontaneous activity measurements.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was conducted under Helsinki license (202227695) and was approved by the university ethics committee (0005773-6).

Most of those are synthesized in the cytosol as precursor proteins, imported into mitochondria, and sorted into one of the four sub-mitochondrial compartments. The TIM23 complex, which is embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane, facilitates the import of proteins that harbor Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) at their N-terminus. Such proteins are sorted mainly to the mitochondrial matrix while some sub-groups are destined also to the inner membrane or the intermembrane space. TIMM50 (Tim50 in yeast) is an essential component of the TIM23 complex and mutations in this protein were reported to cause several diseases.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the current study, the authors analyzed the impact of TIMM50 mutations on the mitochondrial proteome in both patients' cells and mouse neurons. They provide compelling evidence for several surprising and highly interesting observations: (i) TIMM50 mutations affect the steady-state levels of only a portion of the putative TIMM50 substrates, (ii) such mutations result in increased electrical activity in mice neurons and in reduced levels of some potassium ion channels in the plasma membrane. These findings shed new light on mitochondrial biogenesis in mammalian cells and hint at an unexpected link between mitochondria and ion channels at the plasma membrane.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors used both cells from patients and neurons from mice to investigate the impact of mutations in TIMM50 on mitochondrial proteome and function.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors addressed all my concerns regarding the original submission.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99914.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Mitochondria import hundreds of precursor proteins from the cytosol. The TOM and TIM23 complexes facilitate the import on the matrix-targeting pathway of mitochondria. In yeast, Tim50 is a critical and essential subunit of the TIM23 complex that mediates the transition of precursors from the outer to the inner membrane. The human Tim50 homolog TIMM50 is highly similar in structure and a comparable function of Tim50 and TIMM50 was proven by several biochemical and genetic studies in the past.</p><p>In this study, the authors characterize human cells which express lower levels or mutated versions of TIMM50. They found that in these TIMM50-depletion cells, the levels of other TIM23 core subunits are also diminished but many mitochondrial proteins are unaffected. Moreover, they observed alterations in the electrical activity and the levels of potassium channels in neuronal cells of TIMM50-deficient mice. They propose that these changes explain the pathology of patients who often suffer from epilepsy.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper is written by experts in the field, and it is very clear. The experiments are of high quality and sufficiently well-controlled. The study is interesting for a broad readership.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors show that even upon low levels of Tim50, mitochondrial proteins are not considerably depleted. However, it remains somewhat unclear why this is. TIMM50 and the TIM23 complex might not be rate-limiting for the biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins. Alternatively, the import defect is compensated indirectly, for example by a reduced growth of cells. It will be interesting to study the physiological consequences of TIMM50-depletion in more depth in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99914.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Paz</surname><given-names>Eyal</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tel Aviv University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tel Aviv</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Sahil</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tel Aviv University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tel Aviv</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gottfried</surname><given-names>Irit</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tel Aviv University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tel Aviv</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Staretz</surname><given-names>Orna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05tkyf982</institution-id><institution>Ben-Gurion University of the Negev</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beersheba</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mahajnah</surname><given-names>Muhammad</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Technion-Israel Institute of Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bagchi</surname><given-names>Pritha</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03czfpz43</institution-id><institution>Emory University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Atlanta</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Seyfried</surname><given-names>Nicholas T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03czfpz43</institution-id><institution>Emory University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Atlanta</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ashery</surname><given-names>Uri</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tel Aviv University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tel Aviv</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Azem</surname><given-names>Abdussalam</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tel Aviv University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tel Aviv</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank the reviewers and editor for their positive view and constructive valuable comments on the manuscript.

This will help to understand whether some of the observed changes in levels of OXPHOS subunits are related to alterations in the amounts of this insertase.</p></disp-quote><p>OXA1 was not detected in the untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, most likely due to the fact that it is a polytopic membrane protein, spanning the membrane five times (1,2). Consequently, we measured OXA1 levels with immunoblotting, comparing patient fibroblast cells to the HC. No significant change in OXA1 steady state levels was observed.</p><p>These results are now displayed (Fig. S3B and C) and discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: How do the authors explain that although TIMM17 and TIMM23 were found to be significantly reduced by Western analysis they were not detected as such by the Mass Spec. method?</p></disp-quote><p>The untargeted mass spectrometry in the current study failed to detect the presence of TIMM17 for both, patient fibroblasts and mice neurons, while TIMM23 was detected only for mice neurons and a decrease was observed for this protein but was not significant. This is most likely due to the fact that TIMM17 and TIMM23 are both polytopic membrane proteins, spanning the membrane four times, which makes it difficult to extract them in quantities suitable for MS detection (2,3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) How do the authors explain the higher levels of some proteins in the TIMM50 mutated cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The levels of fully functional TIM23 complex are deceased in patients' fibroblasts. Therefore, the mechanism by which the steady state level of some TIM23 substrate proteins is increased, can only be explained relying on events that occur outside the mitochondria. This could include increase in transcription, translation or post translation modifications, all of which may increase their steady state level albite the decrease in the steady state level of the import complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Can the authors elaborate on why mutated cells are impaired in their ability to switch their energetic emphasis to glycolysis when needed?</p></disp-quote><p>Cellular regulation of the metabolic switch to glycolysis occurs via two known pathways: (1) Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by increased levels of AMP/ADP (4). (2) Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complexes by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK) (5). Therefore, changes in the steady state levels of any of these regulators could push the cells towards anaerobic energy production, when needed. In our model systems, we did not observe changes in any of the AMPK, PDH or PDK subunits that were detected in our untargeted mass spectrometry analysis (see volcano plots below, no PDK subunits were detected in patient fibroblasts). Although this doesn’t directly explain why the cells have an impaired ability to switch their energetic emphasis, it does possibly explain why the switch did not occur de facto.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99914-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors claim in the abstract, the introduction, and the discussion that TIMM50 and the TIM23 translocase might not be relevant for mitochondrial protein import in mammals.

The authors show in Figures 3 and 4 several times the same volcano plots in which different groups of proteins are indicated. It would be good to add (a) a principal component analysis to show that the replicates from the mutant samples are consistently different from the controls, (b) a correlation plot that compares the log-fold-change of P1 to that of P2 to show which of the proteins are consistently changed in P1 and P2 and (c) a GO term analysis to show in an unbiased way whether mitochondrial proteins are particular affected upon TIMM50 depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 3 and 4 have been changed to avoid redundancy. Figure 3 now focuses on fibroblasts proteomics (with additional analysis), while Figure 4 focuses on neurons proteomics. PCA analysis was added in Fig S1, showing that the proteomics replicates of both patients (P1 and P2) are consistently different than the healthy control (HC) replicates. Correlation plots were added in Figure 3C and D, showing high correlation of the downregulated and upregulated mitochondrial proteins between P1 and P2. These plots further highlight that MIM proteins are more affected than matrix proteins and that the OXPHOS and MRP systems comprise the majority of significantly downregulated proteins in both patients. GO term analysis was performed for all the detected proteins that got significantly downregulated in both patients. The GO term analysis is displayed in Figure S3A, and shows that mitochondrial proteins, mainly of the OXPHOS and MRP machineries, are particularly affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 1. The figure shows the levels of TIM and TOM subunits in two mutant samples. The quantifications suggest that the levels of TIMM21, TOMM40, and mtHsp60 are not affected. However, from the figure, it seems that there are increased levels of TIMM21 and reduced levels of TOMM40 and mtHsp60. Unfortunately, in the figure most of the signals are overexposed. Since this is a central element of the study, it would be good to load dilutions of the samples to make sure that the signals are indeed in the linear range and do scale with the amounts of samples loaded.</p></disp-quote><p>The representative WB panels display the Actin loading control of the representative TIMM50 repeat (the top panel).

Notably, this decrease in TIMM50 was accompanied with a decrease in the level of other two core subunits, TIMM23 and TIMM17. However, unexpectedly, proteomics analysis in our study and that conducted by Crameri et al., 2024 indicate that steady state levels of most TIM23-dependent proteins are not affected despite a drastic decrease in the levels of the TIM23CORE complex (7). The most affected proteins constitute of intricate complexes, such as OXPHOS and MRP machineries. Thus, both these studies indicate a surprising possibility that even reduced levels of the TIM23CORE components are sufficient for maintaining the steady state levels of most presequence containing substrates.</p><p>(1) Homberg B, Rehling P, Cruz-Zaragoza LD.
