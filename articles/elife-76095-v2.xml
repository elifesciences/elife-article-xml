of double-strand breaks. We report the discovery that yeast cells arrest harmful intramitochondrial superoxide production by shutting down respiration through genetically controlled deletion of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes. We show that this process critically involves the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 and two-way mitochondrial-nuclear communication through Rtg2 and Rtg3. While mitochondrial DNA homeostasis is rapidly restored after cessation of a short-term superoxide stress, long-term stress causes maladaptive persistence of the deletion process, leading to complete annihilation of the cellular pool of intact mitochondrial genomes and irrevocable loss of respiratory ability. This shows that oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial impairment may be under strict regulatory control. If the results extend to human cells, the results may prove to be of etiological as well as therapeutic importance with regard to age-related mitochondrial impairment and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial DNA</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial impairment</kwd><kwd>genome

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial impairment is strongly associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2016</xref>) and the pathogenesis of age-related human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ammal Kaidery and Thomas,

2018</xref>). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions are perceived to contribute markedly to this impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krishnan et al., 2008</xref>). The general conception is that mtDNA deletions are deleterious events related to either faulty mtDNA replication or the mis-repair of mtDNA of double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nissanka et al., 2019</xref>). However, considering that mtDNA deletions are prone to cripple oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fontana and Gahlon, 2020</xref>) (OXPHOS), and thus turn off the production of intramitochondrial superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup>), it is conceivable that mtDNA deletion is also under genetic control. The main rationale is that compared to a mitophagic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bess et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palikaras and Tavernarakis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sedlackova and Korolchuk, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gustafsson and Dorn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ng et al., 2021</xref>), it would serve as a less costly defense mechanism against an abrupt increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) inundating the primary antioxidant defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sies et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shpilka and Haynes, 2018</xref>). The disclosure of an additional genetically controlled defense layer against O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> damage, situated between the primary antioxidant defenses and mitophagy, would bring a fresh perspective to what causes mitochondrial impairment and how it can be mitigated. This motivated us to search for the existence of such a regulatory layer in wild budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Paraquat impairs cell growth through mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> production</title><p>Domestication has systematically enhanced fermentative and reduced respiratory asexual growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Chiara et al., 2020</xref>), with common lab strains harboring multiple defects in mitochondrial respiratory biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaisne et al., 1999</xref>). To avoid possible confounding effects of domestication we therefore chose to work with the wild strain YPS128 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liti et al., 2009</xref>). We exposed haploid YPS128 cell populations expanding clonally on glucose to the mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> generator and redox cycler paraquat (N,N-dimethyl-4–4′-bipiridinium dichloride) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cochemé and Murphy, 2008</xref>). Paraquat generates O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> by passing electrons from OXPHOS complex III and mitochondrial NADPH dehydrogenases to O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cochemé and Murphy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castello et al., 2007</xref>), a mode of O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> generation that is a good proxy for the in vivo situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We titrated the paraquat dose to cause a 2.5-3 fold increase in cell doubling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At the chosen concentration (400 µg/mL), key mitochondrial oxidative stress response genes, copper/zinc dependent O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD, Sod1), manganese-dependent O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> dismutase (MnSOD, Sod2) and mitochondrial cytochrome C peroxidase (Ccp1), increased their transcript levels 2–12-fold in early lag-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The cells maintained the elevated expression of these antioxidant transcripts throughout the exponential growth phase and the following two growth cycles without causing any detectable reduction in the cell doubling time.

We combined population genetics and population dynamics theory with existing data on yeast mutation rates and our experimental measures of effect sizes of loss-of-function mutations and aneuploidies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gjuvsland et al., 2016</xref>). The numerical model was completely unable to reproduce the observed extraordinarily swift response to paraquat, indicating that nuclear mutations were unlikely to explain the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We then tested experimentally whether a Darwinian adaptive process driven by selection of new mutations could account for the observed paraquat adaptation in a stress-release experiment. To this end, we exposed new cell populations to paraquat over many consecutive growth cycles. After each growth cycle, a fraction of the adapting cells was placed in a paraquat-free medium for 1–10 growth cycles before being exposed to paraquat once more. The rationale being that if the adaptation is due to accumulation of random mutations, loss of the adaptation would progress gradually and take many growth cycles. All 96 cell populations retained their acquired tolerance to paraquat (mean reduction in cell doubling time: 106 min) for only 1–3 growth cycles before abruptly losing it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When employing the same experimental procedure to 96 cell populations from each of the two other environments to which adaptation was also fast (arsenic and glycine), we found that despite the presence of a much stronger Darwinian counterselection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), these populations lost their acquired adaptations more slowly and gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, while a Darwinian mutation/selection-based adaptive process could potentially explain the data for seven of the eight tested stressors, the paraquat adaptation could hardly be reconciled with such a process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mitophagy is not responsible for the swift first adaptation phase</title><p>As the fast adaptation was unlikely to be a result of canonical mutation/selection dynamics, we went on to investigate whether a mitophagic response was responsible. Mitochondrial fragmentation is a well-documented prelude to canonical mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sprenger and Langer, 2019</xref>). We therefore first assayed mitochondrial morphology before, during and after paraquat exposure by confocal and electron microscopy. In both cases, paraquat caused a rapid shift (&lt;5 hr) from a tubular to a fragmented mitochondrial organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We therefore tested the respiratory growth capacity of the adapted populations by growing them on glycerol and found that the early paraquat adaptation coincided almost perfectly with loss of respiratory growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, the rapid loss of the acquired adaptations after removal of the O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> stress coincided with the restoration of the capacity for respiratory growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To ensure that this restoration was associated with restoration of the mtDNA pool, we repeated the stress release experiment on the five sequenced populations and tracked, by short-read sequencing, the change in copy numbers of the lost mtDNA segments over the course of the experiment. As expected, the five populations quickly restored their capacity for respiratory growth after removal of paraquat, and this restoration coincided with the reestablishment of the wild type mtDNA profile and the loss of the acquired paraquat adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>).</p><p>Together with the observation that <italic>ρ</italic><sup>0</sup> yeast cells devoid of mtDNA devoid of OXPHOS growing on a normal glucose medium show a twofold decrease in cellular O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reddi and Culotta, 2013</xref>), the data led us to hypothesize that the reduction of paraquat toxicity, leading to a substantial reduction in cell doubling time during the first adaptation phase, was closely associated with the loss of OXPHOS caused by loss of critical mtDNA segments.</p><p>We therefore predicted that cells already deprived of mtDNA would be preadapted to paraquat, i.e. their growth rate would be on par with that of cells that had just gone through the initial swift adaptation. To test this, we deleted the sole mitochondrial DNA polymerase Mip1 (Pol γ homolog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lodi et al., 2015</xref>), and cultivated the resulting <italic>ρ</italic><sup>0</sup> cell populations (n=12) in the presence and absence of paraquat. In the absence of paraquat, the growth of <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells was slower than that of the wild type cells (mean doubling time, <italic>mip1Δ</italic>=3.54 hr, WT = 1.55 hr). However, they did not show the pronounced petite phenotype (very small colonies) that characterizes <italic>mip1</italic>Δ lab strains, and which is caused by defects in the mitochondrial amino acid biosynthetic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vowinckel et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the <italic>ρ</italic><sup>0</sup> state was not likely to have spurred major compensatory cellular reconfigurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>) that could possibly have caused a response to paraquat distinctly different from that of the wild type. The <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells were clearly preadapted to paraquat as their growth was equivalent to that of wild-type populations after these had undergone nine generations of adaptation to paraquat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Together with the finding that the adaptation rate of <italic>mip1</italic>Δ populations exposed to paraquat was on par with the adaptation rate of wild-type cells in their second phase of adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>), this implies that loss of OXPHOS due to loss of mtDNA segments was indeed the most important factor underlying the first adaptation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To further test the validity of the <italic>mip1</italic>Δ results in different genetic backgrounds, we exposed the &gt;4.700 gene knockout strains in the lab strain BY4741 yeast deletion collection to paraquat. Genes encoding mitochondrial proteins were overrepresented in the 100 most paraquat-resistant deletion strains (32.3% vs 18.6%, permutation test, p=0.00314). We also considered all gene deletion strains recently reported to have a low mtDNA copy number (mean &lt; 1 copy per cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Puddu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grant et al., 1997</xref>). As a group, these strains convert a cell doubling time defect in absence of paraquat (mean 16 min slower than deletion strains with a normal mtDNA copy number of 5–35 copies, p=3.05*10<sup>–6</sup>) into a cell doubling time advantage in presence of paraquat (mean 13 min faster than deletion strains with a normal mtDNA copy number of 5–35 copies, p=0.045). In addition to being fully consistent with the <italic>mip1</italic>Δ data, these results demonstrate the considerable phenotypic penetrance of mtDNA loss across a range of genetic backgrounds and perturbed cellular physiologies.</p><p>Contemplating the possibility that mtDNA loss does not drive paraquat resistance by crippling OXPHOS, but causes enhanced cellular exclusion or inactivation of paraquat by some unknown mechanism specific to paraquat, we next exposed wild type populations, at different stages of paraquat adaptation, to menadione. As menadione is a mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> generator that is structurally distinct from paraquat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukui et al., 2012</xref>), paraquat adapted cells should in this case not be preadapted to menadione. However, they were strongly preadapted to menadione, and this preadaptation became manifest during the early paraquat adaptation, that is concomitant with the mtDNA loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The deletion of mtDNA segments requires <italic>SOD2</italic></title><p>Together, the above results strongly implied that mtDNA deletion was the predominant mechanism underlying the first adaptation phase. However, the data did not allow any firm judgement of whether the deletions were under regulatory control or were just due to unspecific paraquat-induced oxidative damage. We reasoned that if mtDNA deletion was part of a deliberate regulatory scheme for handling supraphysiological O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> production, then deletion of genes coding for proteins being key for this regulation would delay the adaptation. On the other hand, if the mtDNA deletions were just due to paraquat-induced unspecific oxidative damage there would be no such delay. Because paraquat exposure induces supraphysiological production of O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup>, we tested these mutually exclusive outcomes by deleting the two key actors in mitochondrial redox sensing and signaling, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> dismutases Sod1 and Sod2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reddi and Culotta, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Cells lacking either one of the O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> dismutases showed virtually no growth when exposed to the original paraquat dose (400 μg/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), demonstrating the importance of enzymatic O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> dismutation. The kinetics of adaptation depends heavily on the strength of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couce and Tenaillon, 2015</xref>) in the sense that the adaptation rate is positively correlated with the stress level as long as the selection pressure is not overwhelming. In the case of paraquat, it was recently shown that 335 single gene deletion strains adapted near exactly as fast as predicted by the level of stress they experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Persson et al., 2022</xref>). In order for the stress level, that is the cell doubling time, of the mutant cells to be comparable with that of the wild type at 400 μg/mL, and thus provide a relevant deletion test, we reduced the paraquat concentration to 12.5 μg/mL.

Moreover, in the five sequenced cell populations, the capacity to restore the copy numbers of intact mtDNA and the respiratory growth after removal of stress was lost between 15 and 42 generations of paraquat exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Together, these data suggested that the deletion of mtDNA genes continued after the first adaptation phase, ultimately leading to a complete loss of intact mtDNA genomes. We therefore assayed the mtDNA loss in 44 sequenced endpoint (<italic>t<sub>50</sub></italic>) populations. Out of these, 25 populations had almost completely lost their entire 77 kb mtDNA (97–99%), retaining only small (&lt;1 kb) segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fangman et al., 1989</xref>). 18 endpoint populations remained in a rho negative (<italic>ρ</italic><sup>-</sup>) state, retaining 6–34 kb mtDNA segments with copy numbers somewhat above the original founder levels (mean: 20% increase).

Intriguingly, the latter group consistently grew slower on paraquat than the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This suggests that the sustained mtDNA depletion under long-term stress, leading to irreversible loss of intact mtDNA genomes, is an artifactual response driven by prolonged induction of a regulatory mechanism dimensioned by natural selection to handle O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> stress it can successfully deal with before the pool of intact mtDNA genomes disappears.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Chromosome duplications explain the second adaptation phase</title><p>Wild type cells realized 23.3% of their adaptation potential in the second adaptation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This may, for example, be adaptation to the effects of mtDNA loss as such (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>), or to paraquat-induced O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> production not dependent on the presence of an intact mtDNA pool (e.g. through association with the cytosolic Yno1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rinnerthaler et al., 2012</xref>). In any case, the much slower doubling time reduction characterizing this second phase suggested that a Darwinian mutation/selection process was involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To search for nuclear genome changes that could explain the second adaptation phase we analyzed the sequence data of 44 random endpoint (<italic>t<sub>50</sub></italic>) populations. We did not find evidence for adaptive point mutations, that is mutations rarely occurred in the same gene across populations or coincided with growth improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>, C). However, all but four endpoint populations carried extra copies of chromosomes II (n<italic>=</italic>29), III (n<italic>=</italic>21) and/or V (n<italic>=</italic>16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>) at near fixation (mean <italic>p</italic>: 0.97). In the five sequenced populations for which we had time-resolved data, these chromosome gains appeared after the early and very swift O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> adaptation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5B</xref>). To assess their contribution to the second phase of adaptation, we crossed clones carrying the individual aneuploidies back to wild type cells over three consecutive meiotic generations. We then compared the tolerance for paraquat, and the capacity for respiratory growth, in offspring with and without extra chromosomes. Part of the paraquat resistance and part of the loss of respiratory growth co-segregated with chromosomes II and V aneuploidies. The duplications of chromosome II and V caused a reduction in respiratory growth relative to the wild type (cell doubling times: 5.7 hr (chr II), 4.9 hr (chr V), 3.3 hr (WT)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5C</xref>). They also reduced the cell doubling time during paraquat exposure by 31 and 38 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5D</xref>). Duplication of chromosome III caused no apparent reduction in cell doubling time. Assuming an additive phenotypic effect of the chromosome II and V duplications, the cell doubling time would be reduced by 69 min. Together with the effect from the mtDNA deletions disrupting OXPHOS function, this would correspond to cells realizing 81% of the possible adaptation. As the cells actually realized on average 72.6%, an approximately additive phenotypic effect of these duplications appears to fully explain the second phase of adaptation in populations having both duplications genetically fixed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As argued above, the lack of adaptation of the <italic>sod2</italic>Δ, <italic>rtg2</italic>Δ, and <italic>rtg3</italic>Δ populations are hard to reconcile with the operation of random O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> induced mtDNA deletions (e.g. caused by genomic instability) and subsequent selection of cells possessing OXPHOS-impaired mitochondria. Instead, the data support the notion that the observed deletion of mtDNA segments causing loss of OXPHOS activity is under regulatory control. We think it is apt to denote this regulatory process as ‘mtDNA editing’ as it alters the mtDNA content to suit a particular purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merriam-Webster’s Coll Thes, 2021</xref>). However, the fidelity of the mtDNA deletion mechanism in terms of which mtDNA segments are lost in the first adaptation phase does seem to be moderate. Still, there was a clear preference for deletions within the <italic>COX1-VAR1</italic> region, and the segment containing <italic>COX3, RPM1,</italic> and 15 S RNA were not deleted in this phase, and more rarely also in the second adaptation phase.</p><p>Any mtDNA deletion that removes an enzymatic function required for electron transfer at, or before, the point of electron leakage to oxygen, such as the <italic>COB</italic>-encoded cytochrome B in the cytochrome c reductase complex, or any of the rRNA or tRNA genes that are essential to expression of these functions, would be sufficient to interrupt the electron transfer to oxygen. Thus, the moderate specificity of the mtDNA deletion mechanism makes sense from an evolutionary point of view: natural selection would not be able to increase the fidelity of the mtDNA editing program beyond the point where no further adaptation is achieved. But it should be noted that all our paraquat adapting cell populations lost either <italic>COB</italic> itself, or genes required for <italic>COB</italic> expression, during the first adaptation phase. It cannot be excluded that deletions of some individual genes, e.g. of <italic>COX1</italic>, may cause increased O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> production through mechanisms driven by paraquat or by excessive natural leakage of electrons to oxygen. But such single gene deletions cannot be present in our material for the simple reason that because of their negative effect on growth rate they would be exposed to purifying selection. That is, the gain in growth rate during the first adaptation phase is so huge that cells with a reduced growth rate due to increased O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> production would not be able to propagate.</p><p>The speedy restoration of the wild type mtDNA pool after release from paraquat is most probably due to proliferation of heteroplasmic cells that become homoplasmic through recovery of their wild type mtDNA profile. However, the lack of selective advantage for the wild type mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) implies that this recovery is not caused by a Darwinian process based on differences in cell doubling time. Thus, either the replication of the mtDNA genomes possessing deletions has to stop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jakubke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), or the standing pool of these mtDNA genomes specifically has to be removed by some sort of targeted mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Twig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ban et al., 2017</xref>) . Both processes may also be simultaneously operative. Regardless of the finer details of how this restoration is orchestrated, one would expect that it is under homeostatic control.</p><p>Our data bring fresh perspectives to the table concerning (i) the relationship between stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and canonical mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zorov et al., 2019</xref>), (ii) under which conditions do mitochondria deprived of OXPHOS genes produce more O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> due to increased electron leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aerts et al., 2017</xref>), (iii) whether clonal expansion is the main mechanism underlying the propagation of mitochondria containing deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nido et al., 2018</xref>), and (iv) under which conditions, and to which degree, does the main retrograde response to mtDNA deletion in yeast mediate two-way mito-nuclear communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guaragnella et al., 2018</xref>). They also support the emerging notion that selective mitophagy is an important mechanism for local mitochondrial repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gustafsson and Dorn, 2019</xref>), and that selective mitophagy may be deliberately repressed while the cell experiences O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> stress.</p><p>Our results strongly suggest that there is an additional genetically controlled defense layer against ROS induced damage in budding yeast, situated between the primary antioxidant defenses and mitophagy. Budding yeast and humans share a range of evolutionary conserved mechanisms concerning respiratory chain biology and mitochondrial quality control, including antioxidant enzymes and key proteins regulating mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montava-Garriga and Ganley, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumar and Reichert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrientos, 2003</xref>). As our experimental yeast strain has a fully intact OXPHOS system very similar to higher eukaryotes, it is reasonable to expect that important features of the disclosed mtDNA editing mechanism may also be evolutionary conserved. In light of this, the available data on the cancer therapeutics doxorubicin and cisplatin suggest that our main results may extend to post-mitotic cells. They both accumulate in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalyanaraman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genc et al., 2014</xref>), where they induce O<sub>2</sub><sup>∙−</sup> production through redox cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malhi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Their long-term administration cause oxidative injury to a variety of cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Songbo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moruno-Manchon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ren et al., 2019</xref>), and they both increase the frequency of mtDNA deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genc et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 1993</xref>). Arrestment of OXPHOS activity by mtDNA editing, followed by homeostatic restoration of the pool of intact mitochondrial genomes, may therefore possibly be a generic eukaryotic adaptation to obviate a costlier mitophagic response in a variety of situations. If so, the biomedical implications in terms of the etiology of age-related disease and therapeutic opportunities appear to be noteworthy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast cells</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Founder strain</title><p>We used a single, haploid clone of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain YPS128 (<italic>MAT<bold>α</bold> ura3::NatMX</italic>-barcode <italic>ho::HYGMX</italic>) as the background genotype.

A subsample of these founder cells were stored. We poured a sample of the stationary phase culture on top of a solid plate (background medium) and allowed the lawn of cells to grow, again until stationary phase (72 hr). We then repeatedly sampled the lawn using 384 short pin pads to generate eight solid plates with 1,152 colonies each.

For each of the eight selection environments, we systematically sampled (1,536 short pin pads) the same 96 populations at the end of growth cycles 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50, to generate a dense chronological adaptation record of 768 populations. We transferred the samples to a liquid selection medium (100 μL), expanded the populations until stationary phase (72 hr), added 100 μL of glycerol (final concentration: 20% (w/w)) and stored them at –80 °C. We thawed and re-suspended these frozen stocks, and transferred cells (96 short pin pads) to a solid background, or a nitrogen background medium. To generate a randomized design, we used the <italic>randint</italic> function in the Python package NumPy (version 1.15.4). We pre-cultivated cells until stationary phase (72 hr), sampled and transferred pre-cultures (1,536 short pin pads) to selection environments plates, interleaving (384 short pin pads) 384 separately pre-cultivated, wild type, founder controls among the evolving populations on each plate.

We evolved these populations over ten growth cycles (~84 generations) on no stress plates, sampled each population at the end of each growth cycle and stored samples at –80 °C (as above) to create a chronological record of samples first adapted to paraquat for different time-periods, and then released from the paraquat selection, again for different time periods. We thawed, re-suspended, sampled, randomized and pre-cultivated (no stress) this second chronological record, and sampled and transferred stationary phase cells to paraquat selection plates. Second, to compare the kinetics of loss of paraquat adaptive gains to that of populations adapting to other challenges characterized by fast adaptation, we repeated (3x) the above selection relaxation experiment, including also those adapting to arsenic and glycine. We selected the time point in the chronological record where the populations had achieved 70–90% of their endpoint adaptation. We then thawed, re-suspended and sampled these stocks, expanded revived cells under relaxed selection for 10 growth cycles and created a frozen chronological record, which was revived, randomized, pre-cultivated and cultivated in the original stress, as above (n<italic>=</italic>5). For the glycine-adapting populations a nitrogen-limited background medium was used. Third, to compare the kinetics of loss of paraquat adaptation to that of the restoration of wild type mtDNA and of respiratory growth, we again repeated the release-from-paraquat experiment, but only for the five sequenced paraquat-adapting populations (A7, A8, B12, B5, and B8).

Cells had 4947 nuclear encoded protein genes, and 16 chromosomes specified by the sequenced reference genome (R64-1-1). Cells had no mitochondrial genome. Essential genes were not included. Cells independently and randomly acquired nuclear genome mutations as chromosome duplications and point mutations in protein coding genes at the end of each cell division. Mutation rates were constant, equal for all genomes, for all chromosomes and for all nucleotide sites. Chromosomes and nucleotide sites were only allowed to mutate once. Sites on new chromosomes did not mutate. Chromosome duplications occurred at rate of <italic>µ</italic>=4.85*10<sup>–5</sup> duplications/cell division.

Mutations and cell division time were passed to daughter cells. Cells began at a cell division time equal to the founder population doubling time. Change in cell division time was affected by mutations only, and mutations only affected cell division time. Because chromosome duplication and loss-of-gene function point mutations are the most common drivers of adaptive evolution in experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chevereau et al., 2015</xref>), we assumed these to be the only sources of change in cell division time. We estimated the cell division effect size of chromosome duplications as described above. We estimated the cell division effect size of point mutations by downloading the SIFT yeast database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sift-db.bii.a-star">http://sift-db.bii.a-star</ext-link>. edu.sg/public/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae/EF4.74/) and extracting all possible stop gain base changes and nonsynonymous mutations, with attached SIFT scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vaser et al., 2016</xref>). All stop gain base changes and all nonsynonymous mutations with a SIFT score &lt;0.05 affected cell division time with an effect size equal to the population doubling time effect of the corresponding gene deletion. Reproductive age did not affect cell division time and there were no cell-cell interactions. We assumed that the cell doubling time under stress at any instance could not become shorter than the measured mean founder cell doubling time in absence of stress. We implemented the well documented principle of diminishing return of mutations with increasing fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 2011</xref>), by letting a mutation <italic>m</italic> define the cell division time, <italic>D<sub>m</sub></italic>, obtained from the equation,  <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> is the cell division time of the genotype before the mutation occurred, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> <inline-graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif" xlink:href="elife-76095-inf001-v2.gif"/>. <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>founder, stress</italic></sub> is the measured mean doubling time of the founder in presence of stress, and <italic>D<sub>r</sub></italic> is the estimated doubling time effect size of the mutation assuming no epistasis.

The samples were revived in 3 mL liquid background media supplemented with 400 µg/mL paraquat, expanded to stationary phase (72 hr). DNA was extracted from harvested cells using a MasterPure Yeast DNA purification kit (Epicentre), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers were designed for each of the protein and rRNA encoding mtDNA genes and for one nuclear control: <italic>CDC5</italic>. The small size and extreme AT richness of the RNA subunit of RNase P (<italic>RPM1</italic>) prevented the design of working PCR primers for this mtDNA gene. We ran qPCR for duplicates of the entire frozen chronological record of one mtDNA gene in a single run, together with <italic>CDC5</italic> controls. The qPCR was performed using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (total volume: 20 µL) and run on a Bio-Rad CFX Connect using Bio-Rad Hard-Shell PCR 96-well thin-wall plates sealed with adhesive transparent film. The PCR protocol was: initial denaturation (95 C; 15 min) followed by 45 cycles of: denaturation (95 C; 15 s), anneal (60 C; 30 s), extension (72 C; 30 s), and a melting curve analysis. We quantified PCR products at the annealing step of each cycle due to the low melting temperature of all PCR products, which follows from extremely low GC% of the mtDNA.

Pelleted cells were frozen under high pressure using a Wohlwend Compact 03 (M. Wohlwend GmbH, Sennwald, Switzerland).

Freeze substituted cells were washed (2 x) in 100% acetone and the temperature was raised 2.9 C/hr to –50 °C. Cell pellets were broken into smaller pieces to improve resin infiltration. Infiltration of cells was performed using a ladder of Lowicryl HM20 (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) diluted in decreasing acetone concentrations (1:4, 2:3, 1:1, 4:1) followed by three changes in pure Lowicryl. Each step lasted 2 hr. The resin was polymerized with UV light, first for 72 hr at –50 °C and then for 24 hr at room temperature. Resin embedded blocks were sectioned in 70 nm ultra-thin sections using a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E Ultramicrotome (C.

The signal was averaged between 4 frames to reduce noise. Z-stacks were color-coded according to Z-dimension (slice) using Temporal-Color Code in Fiji/ImageJ v. 1.52. We pre-processed images using the difference of Gaussians (DoG) to enhance the objects to be measured, that is either cells or mitochondria. To measure cells, we calculated the 3D gradient of the DoG filtered images, using triangle algorithm. To measure mitochondria, we calculated the 3D median filter of the DoG filtered images before segmentation. We segmented images using Otsu’s method, separating touching objects processed using seed-assisted watershed algorithm. The used seeds were suggested automatically, with a human blinded to sample identities correcting for mistakes. The final quantification of shape descriptors for each cell and the mitochondria within were done in MATLAB, with the relevant code and readme files available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/CamachoDejay/SStenberg_3Dyeast_tools">https://github.com/CamachoDejay/SStenberg_3Dyeast_tools</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stenberg, 2022</xref> copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:895f1538a0d631c088bb3ec6260151856787c4a6;origin=https://github.com/CamachoDejay/SStenberg_3Dyeast_tools;visit=swh:1:snp:ac5183da9e781260fa588c16a510bafe4091683b;anchor=swh:1:rev:a047daf337fa05f75f7cb3affb498ed70b6d7703">swh:1:rev:a047daf337fa05f75f7cb3affb498ed70b6d7703</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data and materials availability</title><p>Sequence data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in Sequencing Read Archive (SRA) with the accession codes PRJNA622836.

using yeast as their model system. The authors propose that reversible loss of mtDNA leads to reduced ETC function and diminished free radical production and that this represents an evolved survival mechanism. The idea that reversible loss of mtDNA may be an adaptive response under genetic control that is triggered to permit survival under adverse conditions where oxidative stress is elevated is novel and potentially important, especially given critical questions on how chronic or acute oxidative stress may contributes to loss of mtDNA integrity and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76095.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04g9wch13</institution-id><institution>Yale-NUS College</institution></institution-wrap><country>Singapore</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Toledano</surname><given-names>Michel B</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/052wcqj17</institution-id><institution>IBITECS, SBIGEM, CEA-Saclay</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.11.20.391110">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.20.391110v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michel B Toledano (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Comments regarding validity of the proposed mechanism:</p><p>1) The reviewers comment that the key conclusions of the paper depend on interpretation of data that is correlative in nature and are concerned that no direct evidence is provided e.g. for the claim that mtDNA loss CAUSES specific adaptation to paraquat. Would you be able to demonstrate that the mtDNA mutation specifically reduces ROS production and that cells with these mutations are therefore able to grow in the presence of PQ.</p><p>2) The reviewers point out that yeast mitochondria produce superoxide mainly in the bc1 complex and that loss of Cox1 would be expected to increase electron leak at the bc1 complex. Please address this concern with specific reference to yeast mtDNA mutations and ROS production.</p><p>3) To expand on the above concern, an alternative explanation was suggested based on work from Prof. Alexander Tzagoloff, showing that destabilization of mtDNA may lead to irreversible mtDNA loss. The reviewer suggests that under such conditions, a percentage of cells may become rho-minus by amplifying small segments of mtDNA into tandem repeats. This reviewer is concerned that this may be what was detected by qPCR. Consistent with this notion would also be your observation that the copy number of some mtDNA segments is increased above levels seen in the wild type genome.</p><p>4) Also, a small fraction of the cells in such a population would be expected to be heteroplasmic. The reviewer suggests that such cells can then rapidly become rho plus by recovering the wild-type mtDNA and thus become homoplasmic and respiratory competent when paraquat is withdrawn. The review suggests that this scenario might result in observations similar to what you report but in this scenario the mtDNA would represent the retained mtDNA from only a few percent of the original cell population and would not have much to do with the majority of cells in the population. We would invite you to specifically address / provide further evidence for why you think that the above scenario (points 3 and 4) cannot explain the data that you obtained.</p><p>5) Related to this alternative explanation, One reviewer suggests also carefully reading and discussing some of the early literature of mtDNA genetics in yeast to re-evaluate your claims. Specifically, the reviewer suggests to discuss existing publications showing that increased oxidative stress is a condition for inducing rho- cells in which a specific mtDNA segment is amplified into tandem repeats (see full reviewer comment for details).</p><p>6) The authors observed that loss of mtDNA from mip1 cells makes them resistant to paraquat. In fact, loss of mtDNA itself causes a crisis of cell survival followed by adaptation (see Cell. 2009 Jun 26;137(7):1247-58. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.014). mip1 cells may simply have reduced paraquat uptake or epigenetic changes to resist superoxide. Thus, mtDNA deletion as a specific adaptive process is unfounded.</p><p>7) Given these concerns, one of the reviewers felt that describing paraquat-induced mtDNA mutation as a regulatory &quot;gene editing&quot; program is inappropriate. You may want to address this concern, either by changing the term of arguing why you feel that it is appropriate here.</p><p>8) Finally, a fundamental concern is that budding yeast is normally anaerobic and that physiological implication of mtDNA mutations therefore would be quite different from those in mammalian cells. The reviewer suggests that more care should be taken when interpreting your data in terms of their implications to mitophagy, cancer therapy and aging-related diseases in mammals.</p><p>Further comments:</p><p>9) Figure 5 – loss of rtg2 and rtg3 may affect anaplerosis thereby reducing adaptive growth.

It is not clear how the growth rate is calculated? How are experiments performed on solid, liquid medium? The figure only shows gene expression data? What is a growth cycle and what is its length?

How do you calculate that 106 min doubling time reduction equals 49.3 % of the maximum possible reduction? And what is this maximum? Figure 1B is confusing: it is understandable that cells are exposed to PQ enough to adapt, then grown without PQ, and then again with PQ, but over the generations shown in the picture, do one not expect to see adaptation after a few &quot;cycles&quot;?</p><p>17) Page 5.

The experiment described in S6A cannot be used to rule out signaling by H2O2: adding 3 mM H2O2 to cells that have already adapted to PQ, whether or not by use of an H2O2 signal, amounts to a severe H2O2 stress, exacerbated by the lack of a functional respiratory chain (petite cells are more sensitive to H2O2, relative to WT). One way of tackling this question would be to see whether adaptive doses of H2O2 (100-300 microM) prior to exposure to paraquat would speed up growth adaptation or not (cross adaptations have been described in the past). Similarly, the WT PQ adaptative response of cells lacking Yap1 or other antioxidants does not prove anything: signaling by H2O2 is mostly localized in confined areas, and this should persist even in a Yap1 mutant.</p><p>20) Page 8. The need of SOD2 for PQ adaptation to occur is not really convincing because of the sickness of SOD mutants in general. Further, it shows that there is no adaptation at 12 microG/mL PQ, but then adaptation occurs at a higher dose, but slower, relative to WT. What is the point authors want to make? That SOD by dismutation of the superoxide anion produces H2O2 needed for signaling ? But, authors already ruled out the need for H2O2 to signal adaptation? Please don’t be too peremptory in your conclusion on this experiment. In addition, it is hard to follow the writer: “in four populations, the copy number…” then “two of these fail to adapt” then “the remaining four populations”, but which ones?

Figure S6D shows delayed reduction in cell doubling time that coincided with acquisition of a single mtDNA deletion in 4 out of 8 sod2 cultures. Loss of mtDNA in sod2 mip1 double mutant seems to increase adaptation for cell growth. This led to the interpretation that delayed adaptation to superoxide production is due to lower rate of mtDNA deletions. The author concluded that (1) loss of OXPHOS is the predominant mechanism responsible for adaptation; (2) Sod2 plays a role in initiating mtDNA deletion that seems to help adaptation, (3) mtDNA deletion and loss of OXPHOS is under regulatory control by “mtDNA editing”. I have numerous concerns with these conclusions.</p><p>(1) These data just show a correlation between mtDNA loss and adaptation. mtDNA is vulnerable to oxidative stress and mtDNA loss after paraquat treatment is not unexpected. No direct evidence is shown to support the idea that mtDNA loss CAUSES specific adaptation to paraquat. The authors observed that loss of mtDNA from mip1 cells makes them resistant to paraquat. In fact, loss of mtDNA itself causes a crisis of cell survival followed by adaptation (see Cell. 2009 Jun 26;137(7):1247-58. Doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.014). mip1 cells may simply have reduced paraquat uptake or epigenetic changes to resist superoxide. Thus, mtDNA deletion as a specific adaptive process is unfounded.</p><p>(2) mtDNA instability and deletions can be caused by many mutations in mtDNA. The use of the term “mtDNA editing” is inappropriate.</p><p>(3) Throughout the manuscript, the authors did not consider the dynamics of mtDNA mutations in yeast. Increased oxidative stress is a condition for inducing rho- cells in which a specific mtDNA segment is amplified into tandem repeats. Rho- mtDNAs are typically 1-2 kb in length, and can be rapidly segregated into homoplasmy within 6 generations. As such, the qPCR data for the detection of mtDNA deletions may not reflect the genetic status of most cells in cell populations. The “retained” mtDNA segments may just reflect for formation of rho- mtDNA in a cell population in which most cells are rho-zero. I am surprised that the authors can recover rho- genomes of 6 and 34 kb. Some cells are called rho-is odd. The authors should read the early literature of mtDNA genetics in yeast, please.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76095.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Comments regarding validity of the proposed mechanism:</p><p>1) The reviewers comment that the key conclusions of the paper depend on interpretation of data that is correlative in nature and are concerned that no direct evidence is provided e.g. for the claim that mtDNA loss CAUSES specific adaptation to paraquat. Would you be able to demonstrate that the mtDNA mutation specifically reduces ROS production and that cells with these mutations are therefore able to grow in the presence of PQ.</p></disp-quote><p>The instability of the molecule makes separating O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production and breakdown very challenging. Measuring O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> levels would be insufficient to address the causality issue as these would decrease in paraquat adapted cells, even if paraquat adaptation was due to paraquat exclusion or inactivation. However, we maintain that we already have provided compelling evidence for the conclusion that mtDNA loss causes specific adaptation to paraquat.</p><p>One of the most efficient ways to test a claim about a causal relation is to do an intervention. Our <italic>mip1</italic>Δ experiment is such an intervention (please see the justification of the representativeness of the <italic>mip1</italic>Δ results in our response to comment 6). Removal of Mip1—the sole mitochondrial DNA polymerase—is the gold standard to validate effects of mtDNA loss/reduction in yeast because in contrast to other proteins associated with mtDNA maintenance, and in contrast to ethidium bromide treatment, Mip1 is not known to affect cellular biology through mechanisms other than those mediated by the mtDNA loss. There is absolutely no support for the possibility that Mip1 would be responsible for paraquat exclusion or inactivation, neither in the literature nor in our data. If the mtDNA deletions had nothing to do with the observed adaptation and were just a side effect due to random oxidative mtDNA damage, then <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells would not be preadapted to paraquat. But in the original manuscript, we showed that <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells are indeed preadapted to paraquat.</p><p>The <italic>mip1</italic>Δ intervention demonstrates that cells lacking OXPHOS activity are much more capable to grow in the presence of paraquat than wild-type cells. Since the most prominent effect of paraquat is that it causes enhanced O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production in OXPHOS-active mitochondria by redox-cycling, it follows that the O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production is lower in <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells than in wild type cells when they are exposed to the same paraquat concentration. This explains the <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells’ resistance to paraquat. Indeed, it has been extensively documented that the natural leakage of electrons to oxygen is 2-fold lower in fermenting rho0 yeast cells (<italic>1</italic>). Now, one may object that the total lack of mtDNA in <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells cannot be directly compared with the more modest mtDNA deletions we observe in the early, but still most prominent, adaptation phase. However, even small deletions in the mtDNA tend to cripple the OXPHOS system (e.g. (<italic>2</italic>)). And our mtDNA segmental deletions cover several protein, rRNA and tRNA encoding genes that are absolutely required for the expression or function of OXPHOS. Moreover, paraquat-mediated shuffling of electrons occurs at complex III, with cytochrome B having the critical enzymatic role (<italic>3</italic>). Cytochrome B is encoded in the mtDNA gene <italic>COB</italic>, and as all our paraquat adapting cell populations lose either <italic>COB</italic> itself, or genes required for <italic>COB</italic> expression, it follows that paraquat dependent O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production is perturbed in our paraquat adapting cell populations.</p><p>As a response to the concerns of the reviewers, we exposed paraquat-adapted populations to menadione and found them to be much more resistant than wild type cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B). Like paraquat, menadione enhances mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production(<italic>4</italic>, <italic>5</italic>). But the compound is structurally completely distinct from paraquat, and if an export or inactivation mechanism was responsible for the adaptation to paraquat, it is unlikely that menadione would be exported or inactivated through exactly the same mechanism. We therefore think it is highly legitimate to claim that the preadaptation of paraquat-adapted cells to menadione is because menadione causes much less ROS production in these cells than in wild-type cells. As the source for the ROS production is the OXPHOS system, it follows that the OXPHOS system has to a large degree become deactivated in cells adapted to paraquat. With reference to the paragraph above, the absolutely most straightforward explanation of this deactivation is that it is caused by mtDNA deletion.</p><p>We also added vitamin C to paraquat exposed cells. Addition of vitamin C, an antioxidant that accepts electrons from PQ<sup>+</sup>, the free radical (or ‘damaging’) state of paraquat(<italic>6</italic>), caused the doubling time of not only paraquat exposed wild type cells, but also of paraquat exposed <italic>sod2</italic>Δ cells, to be on par with that of unexposed wild type cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D). Thus, the paraquat concentration of 400 µg/mL impaired cell growth entirely through its effect on O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production, and the doubling time adaptation observed must be understood solely as an adaptation to the elevated O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production.</p><p>Finally, we measured the growth of all viable deletion strains in the BY4741 deletion collection in the presence and absence of paraquat. We found a strong tendency for the loss of mitochondrial proteins to lead to paraquat resistance. Moreover, gene deletion strains reported to have low mtDNA copy numbers tended to grow slower than the wild type in absence of paraquat, but better than the wild-type in presence of paraquat (<italic>7</italic>). While these deletion strains are less suitable as controls than <italic>mip1</italic>Δ, because of their many varied functions that affect ROS resistance and growth independently of their effect on mtDNA, the results are still fully in tune with the <italic>mip1</italic>Δ and menadione results, supporting the conclusion that “mtDNA loss CAUSES specific adaptation to paraquat”.</p><p>Thus, we find it difficult to acknowledge the possibility that mtDNA deletions leading to shut-down of OXPHOS activity, and consequently shut-down of both natural and paraquat-induced mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production, is just correlated with the observed paraquat adaptation.</p><p>However, the intervention data and the other data discussed above establish only that paraquat causes mtDNA deletion and that this mtDNA deletion causes the adaptation to paraquat. They do not allow any conclusion about whether this is due to unspecific mitochondrial damage or deliberate regulation. We deal with this issue below.</p><p>We have renamed the section “mtDNA loss drives the first adaptation phase” to “mtDNA segmental deletions cause the swift adaptation to paraquat”, included new data and analyses, and expanded the text considerably to make our reasoning more explicit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers point out that yeast mitochondria produce superoxide mainly in the bc1 complex and that loss of Cox1 would be expected to increase electron leak at the bc1 complex. Please address this concern with specific reference to yeast mtDNA mutations and ROS production.</p></disp-quote><p>The lost segments cover several genes encoding proteins, rRNA and tRNA. When we talked about the <italic>COX1</italic>-<italic>VAR1</italic> region which was shown in our plots, we were explicitly talking about the genes <italic>COX1</italic>, <italic>COB</italic>, <italic>ATP6</italic>, <italic>ATP8</italic>, <italic>OLI1</italic> and <italic>VAR1</italic>. And due to a lack of well-functioning qPCR probes (the tRNA genes are too short to be targeted by qPCR directly) we were implicitly talking about tRNA genes in between these. The observed loss of multiple mtDNA segments containing genes essential for the expression and function of OXPHOS, and the observed loss of respiratory capacity accompanying mtDNA deletions, hardly open for any other interpretation than what we proposed, i.e. the mtDNA deletions cause a reduced OXPHOS activity and electron flow through the ETC in the affected cells. Without the latter, and, in particular, without the enzymatic cytochrome B function in complex III, paraquat is not capable of producing O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> through redox-cycling.</p><p>We cannot exclude that deletions of some individual genes in complex IV, e.g. of <italic>COX1</italic> which codes for the enzymatic function of complex IV, may cause increased O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production through mechanisms driven by natural leakage of electrons to oxygen, or by paraquat. But such single gene deletions are not present in our material, and cannot be, for the simple reason that they would be totally wiped out by natural selection because of their negative effect on growth rate. The adaptive gain in growth rate during the first adaptation phase is huge, which implies that cells with a reduced growth rate due to increased O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production would not be able to propagate in a population. In other words, after the first adaptation phase, every cell population produces less O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> than what they did immediately after becoming exposed to paraquat because the vast majority of mitochondrial genomes possess mtDNA deletions that have effectively shut down OXPHOS activity.</p><p>In the section “mtDNA segmental deletions cause the swift adaptation to paraquat<bold>”</bold> we now mention tRNAs specifically, and we have included a paragraph under Discussion explaining why we will not find mtDNA deletions causing enhanced O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To expand on the above concern, an alternative explanation was suggested based on work from Prof. Alexander Tzagoloff, showing that destabilization of mtDNA may lead to irreversible mtDNA loss. The reviewer suggests that under such conditions, a percentage of cells may become rho-minus by amplifying small segments of mtDNA into tandem repeats. This reviewer is concerned that this may be what was detected by qPCR. Consistent with this notion would also be your observation that the copy number of some mtDNA segments is increased above levels seen in the wild type genome.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer envisions a paraquat-induced mtDNA destabilization process that is exclusively driven by unspecific oxidative mtDNA damage and which is accompanied by natural selection for cells with disrupted mtDNAs causing reduced OXPHOS activity. The resulting fragmentation of the mtDNA genome, with cells amplifying different small fragments into tandem repeats, which are retained and inherited through unknown mechanisms, would in this model be what we detect with qPCR and the sequence data. This explanation can in principle account for the intervention data and the other data alluded to above. However, it is strongly contradicted by the sequence data, the qPCR data, the Rtg2/3 data and the data on respiratory ability.</p><p>As shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, sequence coverage across both retained and deleted regions, is remarkably even. This is fully consistent with segmental deletions, but highly inconsistent with fragmentation and amplification of different small segments to various extents. We also visually inspected sequence data for five populations (A7, D1, A11, A5 and D9) using the Integrated Sequence Viewer (https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/), which specifically marks tandem amplifications based on changes in the read orientation of read-pairs. We found tandem amplifications of small fragments to be exceedingly rare and similar in number and size to what we observed in these populations before paraquat exposure. Moreover, the qPCR data for one of our large segments was in fact constituted by several very small qPCR probes complementary to small sections of DNA in adjacent genes along the segment. And it is extremely unlikely that several qPCR probes will show the same mtDNA copy number, and the same change in mtDNA copy number unless they are part of the same continuous mtDNA segment. In the same vein, mtDNA fragmentation and amplification of small segments would not be expected to be consistent with the qPCR data either, as it would be highly unlikely that our small qPCR probes would, by coincidence, correspond to the small mtDNA fragments that have been amplified.</p><p>To further demonstrate that amplification of many small mtDNA fragments in different cells can be ruled out, we isolated single cells from two paraquat adapted populations, clonally expanded these and sequenced their genomes with long-read nanopore sequencing. With this sequencing technology many of the reads have a length that approaches the length of the retained segments. The read alignment shows that most of the long reads span the entire, or almost the entire segment, i.e. they correspond to one, intact mtDNA molecule and not many small fragments (Figure 6—figure supplement 3). In contrast, despite the dynamic nature of mtDNA, we rarely observed tandem amplifications of smaller mtDNA segments.</p><p>As the majority of the yeast mtDNA is normally mostly composed of linear, tandemly duplicated mtDNA molecules, we probed whether the retained long mtDNA segments existed as tandem duplications in very long mtDNA molecules as well. We did this by letting the PCR be directed outwards from segment ends, across a potential breakpoint (Figure 6—figure supplement 2C). The PCR data show that at least in one cell population, a tandem arrangement of the retained segment exist. And the existence of tandem duplications is also supported by the read alignments (Figure 6—figure supplement 3). Although this result is a side-point, we think it is worthwhile to point it out, as it is entirely in line with normal yeast mtDNA biology.</p><p>We exposed <italic>rtg2</italic>Δ and <italic>rtg3</italic>Δ cell populations (<italic>n=</italic>16) to paraquat (400 μg/mL) for 80 generations. In both cases, all cell populations failed to adapt (Figure 5A), and their capacity for respiratory growth was virtually unperturbed at the end of the experiment (Figure 5B). Importantly, the growth of the <italic>rtg2</italic>Δ and <italic>rtg3</italic>Δ populations was similar to that of the wild type in the presence, as well as the absence, of paraquat. This implies that the lack of these proteins did not cause reduced adaptive growth by affecting the cellular growth physiology, such as anaplerosis. Considering the paraquat concentration used, i.e. <italic>rtg2</italic>Δ and <italic>rtg3</italic>Δ cells experiencing the same paraquat stress as wild type cells, the lack of adaptation after 80 generations of selection and the retainment of OXPHOS function, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production was arguably, throughout the 80 generations, on par with the production In the wild type immediately after exposure to paraquat. This puts a very restrictive upper bound on the frequency of mtDNA deletions that are caused by unspecific oxidative damage due to the increase in O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production following paraquat exposure. It follows that unspecific oxidative damage is incapable of explaining the swiftness of the mtDNA deletion process.</p><p>Moreover, our data on respiratory ability clearly show that we are not dealing with a small percentage of cells having become rho-minus. The vast majority of cells must experience an almost complete deprivation of OXPHOS ability during the initial very swift adaptation phase in order for these data to make sense.</p><p>An increase in copy numbers of segments of the mtDNA are frequently encountered in connection with clonal expansion. However, due to the above, we find it much more likely that the temporary increase we observe in our data, and its disappearance during restoration back to wild-type levels, is part of the homeostatic regulatory response (as pointed out in the Discussion).</p><p>We have now expanded the text under the sections “mtDNA segmental deletions cause the swift adaptation to paraquat” and “The mtDNA deletion process requires mito-nuclear communication” to highlight that the above model is not capable of explaining the data. However, despite some effort, we have not been able to identify papers by A. Tzagoloff that should be cited in this connection. The provision of some further coordinates would be highly appreciated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Also, a small fraction of the cells in such a population would be expected to be heteroplasmic. The reviewer suggests that such cells can then rapidly become rho plus by recovering the wild-type mtDNA and thus become homoplasmic and respiratory competent when paraquat is withdrawn. The review suggests that this scenario might result in observations similar to what you report but in this scenario the mtDNA would represent the retained mtDNA from only a few percent of the original cell population and would not have much to do with the majority of cells in the population. We would invite you to specifically address / provide further evidence for why you think that the above scenario (points 3 and 4) cannot explain the data that you obtained.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the statement: “Also, a small fraction of the cells in such a population would be expected to be heteroplasmic. The reviewer suggests that such cells can then rapidly become rho plus by recovering the wild-type mtDNA and thus become homoplasmic and respiratory competent when paraquat is withdrawn.” This ‘point 4’ scenario does indeed explain parts of the data concerning the recovery after short-term paraquat stress, and it was part of the explanation we proposed in the original manuscript to account for the rapid restoration of wildtype mtDNA copy numbers in populations released from short-term paraquat stress (see end of section “Sustained mtDNA deletion causes.” in the original manuscript). However, because the data tell us that there is no Darwinian selection pressure favoring the removal of mtDNA genomes causing loss of OXPHOS activity, this scenario does not account for the speed at which this restoration occurs, i.e. it does not explain why there is not a sustained replication of non-intact mtDNA genomes after release from paraquat. In fact, according to the current clonal expansion theory, one would expect that mtDNA genomes possessing deletions would outcompete the wild-type mtDNA genomes. But this is contrary to what we observe.</p><p>More specifically, the mtDNA genomes possessing deletions causing cessation of OXPHOS activity are faithfully replicated until the cells are released from paraquat. After the release, the heteroplasmic cells “then rapidly become rho plus by recovering the wild-type mtDNA and thus become homoplasmic and respiratory competent”. But in order for this to happen with the speed we observe, either the replication of the mtDNA genomes possessing deletions has to stop or the standing pool of these mtDNA genomes has to be removed by some sort of mitophagy. Both processes may also be simultaneously operative. In any case, it implies that a considerable amount of regulation has to be introduced in order to explain our experimental data. Such a regulatory machinery is well supported by recent publications, and we now expand on this in the discussion.</p><p>If the mtDNA deletions are just due to unspecific oxidative damage then, according to the vast literature on the topic, one would expect that while the cells are exposed to paraquat, the mitophagic machinery would be activated to remove these mitochondria. But it is not. And after release from paraquat, one would expect, according to current clonal expansion theory, that mtDNA genomes possessing deletions would outcompete the wildtype mtDNA genomes in individual cells. But they do not. Instead they disappear remarkably fast. Thus, one may claim that the existing literature implies that the combined ‘points 3 and 4’ explanation is internally inconsistent, as well as being in conflict with the experimental data by not acknowledging any sort of regulatory control of the replication and maintenance of non-intact mtDNA genomes as a function of paraquat exposure.</p><p>So, if there is no deliberate regulation involved, why do two genes documented to play a key role in mito-nuclear communication, in particular in connection with mtDNA deletions, have such an impact on the adaptation to paraquat? The fragmentation hypothesis suggested under point 3 is not in conflict with the existence of signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus as a result of mtDNA deletion. But how does it explain that the supposed random mtDNA deletion process due to oxidative damage is hampered in <italic>rtg2</italic>Δ and <italic>rtg3</italic>Δ populations? The Rtg2/3 signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus activates a whole range of responses dedicated to compensate for the anticipated damage and restore cellular integrity. Thus, a direct prediction by the «point 3 fragmentation» hypothesis is that if there is a cellular response from deletion of Rtg2 or Rtg3, it should be opposite of what we actually observe, i.e. more damage, more fragmentation and more mtDNA deletion. We therefore think that in this case the «point 3 fragmentation» hypothesis is in direct conflict with the data.</p><p>In conclusion: Yes, the ‘points 3 and 4’ scenario is capable of explaining some of the experimental data we provided. But we think it is fair to demand that an alternative explanatory scenario is, at least to some degree, able to account for all the data we presented in the original manuscript and not just a subset. In any case, it should not be in conflict with any of the data, unless it is justified that these data can be neglected. However, the ‘points 3 and 4’ scenario is in direct conflict with the Rtg2/3 results, the qPCR and sequence data. And these can hardly be dismissed as irrelevant. In addition, the ‘points 3 and 4’ scenario is incapable of explaining the dynamics of non-intact mtDNA genomes during and after paraquat exposure. Thus, we think it is fair to claim that this scenario does not represent a valid alternative explanatory scheme.</p><p>In addition to the revisions mentioned under the previous point, we revised one of the paragraphs under Discussion to make some of the above reasoning clearer, and we contrast our explanatory scenario with the one proposed above, using their mutually exclusive predictions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Related to this alternative explanation, One reviewer suggests also carefully reading and discussing some of the early literature of mtDNA genetics in yeast to re-evaluate your claims. Specifically, the reviewer suggests to discuss existing publications showing that increased oxidative stress is a condition for inducing rho- cells in which a specific mtDNA segment is amplified into tandem repeats (see full reviewer comment for details).</p></disp-quote><p>As explicated above, our data do not support the amplification of tandem repeats of small mtDNA fragments. The newly generated long read Nanopore data show that some of the mtDNA molecules in our paraquat adapted populations exist as linear, tandem duplications of the entire mtDNA segment, as discussed below. But such a duplicated linear arrangement is the normal state for yeast mtDNA and is not in any way in conflict with the argumentation in the paper. So, we do not see the need to re-evaluate our claims. But we have revisited the early literature, and we are incapable to see how this literature contradicts the existence of an active mtDNA deletion process. We may have overlooked something, but to find this information it needs to be pointed out to us.</p><p>We have now included to two older references:</p><p>– Fangman WL, Henly JW, Churchill G, Brewer BJ (1989) Stable maintenance of a 35-base-pair yeast mitochondrial genome. <italic>Mol Cell Biol</italic> 9(5):1917–1921.</p><p>– Maleszka R, Skelly PJ, Clark-Walker GD (1991) Rolling circle replication of DNA in yeast mitochondria. <italic>EMBO J</italic> 10(12):3923–9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors observed that loss of mtDNA from mip1 cells makes them resistant to paraquat.

Thus, mtDNA deletion as a specific adaptive process is unfounded.</p></disp-quote><p>We interpret this comment to say that <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells will undergo dramatic cellular reconfiguration to adapt to the loss of mtDNA even when growing on a rich glucose medium, and that this reconfiguration causes reduced paraquat uptake or epigenetic changes to resist paraquat. We have already dealt with this in our reply to Comment 1 above. But we want to restate that to the best of our knowledge there is absolutely no evidence in the literature supporting that mip1Δ, or mtDNA loss, would be responsible for paraquat exclusion or inactivation. The cited Cell paper does not provide such a backing. Moreover, it describes a mechanism for mtDNA loss in response to replicative aging, an inherently multifactorial process, and any crisis of cell survival would then need to be considered in the context of the other aging factors also accumulating.</p><p>Moreover, in terms of cell division time, our <italic>mip1</italic>Δ populations do by no means indicate that they have undergone a crisis of cell survival. Yes, their doubling time on glucose without paraquat is higher than that of the wild type (3.5. vs. 1.5h), so they certainly suffer from the total lack of mtDNA. But this slowing-down of growth is hardly large enough to justify a claim about “a crisis of cell survival”. We constructed and generated this deletion strain in the lab. Considering the short time span (20-30 cell generations) that passed from the isolation of <italic>mip1</italic>Δ clones to the onset of paraquat experiments, it seems quite unlikely that a purely Darwinian process of mutation and selection would be able to create and fix solutions that dramatically change the physiological configuration of <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells. As mentioned above, paraquat exposure tends to suppress the growth defects of rho0 deletion strains, which instead enjoy a growth advantage compared to the wild type. Thus, the argument that the preadaptation of the <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells to paraquat is because of effects other than their complete lack of an active ETC system is hard to reconcile with the data, as well as our knowledge of how paraquat acts.</p><p>Moreover, our respiratory capacity experiments demonstrate that a large fraction of paraquat adapted populations was totally stripped of OXPHOS activity shortly after the first adaptation phase. This is consistent with the conception that their large mtDNA deletions prevent the expression of a functional OXPHOS. Thus, the cells in these populations do indeed lack an intact ETC system, and this, in turn, impairs both paraquat-induced O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production at complex III, as well as base-line O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production. The fact that these cells homeostatically maintain the copy numbers of undeleted mtDNA, while at the same time growing dramatically better than the wild type, implies that the concerns attached to the <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells do not apply here. Still, their behavior is fully consistent with the behaviors of the <italic>mip1</italic>Δ cells and the rho0 deletion strains. And, still fully in line with the <italic>mip1</italic>Δ results, the growth rate of every single paraquat adapted cell population becomes much less perturbed by the ROS-inducer menadione than that of wild type populations. One can of course claim that this preadaptation of the paraquat-adapted cells to menadione is not caused by their demonstrated lack of OXPHOS activity due to mtDNA deletions, but that each and every one of them developed independently other mechanisms that prevent uptake of menadione. However, as we find absolutely no support for this idea in the sequence data, we cannot see any biological justification for why the most straightforward explanation should be discarded.</p><p>With all due respect, we think our responses to points 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 show very clearly that the statement “mtDNA deletion as a specific adaptive process is unfounded<bold>”</bold> is not justified. Instead, we think our comments on points 1-6 fully justify that there is ample reason for claiming that mtDNA deletion drives the adaptation to supraphysiological mitochondrial oxidative stress. Given how beneficial these mtDNA deletions are in terms of fitness, and how rapidly they emerge and disappear, the most straight-forward conclusion is that the mtDNA deletion represents an evolutionary favored defense mechanism over which the cell has some level of regulatory control. And this is very strongly supported by the results showing that the process depends on Sod2, Rtg2 and Rtg3.</p><p>We now deliberately deal with this concern regarding mip1 cells under the section “mtDNA segmental deletions cause the swift adaptation to paraquat”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given these concerns, one of the reviewers felt that describing paraquat-induced mtDNA mutation as a regulatory &quot;gene editing&quot; program is inappropriate. You may want to address this concern, either by changing the term of arguing why you feel that it is appropriate here.</p></disp-quote><p>According to Merriam-Webster Unabridged one of the meanings of the transitive verb edit is “to alter, adapt, or refine especially to bring about conformity to a standard or to suit a particular purpose». As the mtDNA deletions cause cessation of paraquat-induced supraphysiological mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production and that the deletion process depends on the retrograde pathway, we think we are fully justified to use the term gene-editing in the sense that the cells deliberately alter their mtDNA profile to suit a particular purpose.</p><p>Justification of the term is made more explicit in the Discussion, and now the term is introduced for the first time in the Discussion. In line with this, we have also replaced “edit” with “deletion” in the title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Finally, a fundamental concern is that budding yeast is normally anaerobic and that physiological implication of mtDNA mutations therefore would be quite different from those in mammalian cells. The reviewer suggests that more care should be taken when interpreting your data in terms of their implications to mitophagy, cancer therapy and aging-related diseases in mammals.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the evolutionary distance between yeast and humans should have been given greater consideration. However, we intentionally used a wild yeast strain for our experiments. The perception that yeast is very strongly oriented towards fermentative metabolism derives from experiments on domesticated strains. Recent comparisons of wild to domesticated yeast show that domestication has led to a loss of respiratory growth capacity in domesticated lineages and a gain of fermentative growth capacity (<italic>8</italic>). Extreme orientation towards fermentative growth may thus constitute a relatively recent yeast adaptation to man-made niches with highly concentrated sugar, while a more extensive aerobic respiration, and concomitant higher O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production, is a natural part of the biology of wild and ancestral yeast lineages. The physiological implications of mtDNA deletion in the context of aerobic respiration is thus not likely to be very different from those of mammalian cells.</p><p>It is therefore entirely reasonable to be open for the possibility that the disclosed mtDNA editing system emerged in the shared ancestor of yeast and men, and that it has been retained in both lineages – as is the case for core components of both the antioxidant defense (e.g. Sod1, Sod2), and mitophagy(<italic>9</italic>–<italic>14</italic>).</p><p>We have made these points clearer in the text, while at the same time being less conclusive on whether our results extend to mammals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further comments:</p><p>9) Figure 5 – loss of rtg2 and rtg3 may affect anaplerosis thereby reducing adaptive growth. It does not necessarily involve an antioxidant mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, <italic>rtg</italic>∆ strains have a glutamate auxotrophic phenotype (<italic>15</italic>, <italic>16</italic>). The RTG pathway is believed to be activated by glutamate starvation, and the activations result in the induction of Cit1, Cit2, Aco1, Idh1 and Idh2 expression. These enzymes catalyze the first three steps from the Krebs cycle, generating glutamate precursors (<italic>17</italic>). However, our experiments were performed on a synthetic complete medium, in which a very substantial excess of glutamate and other amino acids and nucleotides is added externally. This suppresses and vastly reduces the need for glutamate, and for anaplerosis more generally. Moreover, we would expect anaplerosis to be important in both the presence and absence of paraquat, and perhaps more important in absence of paraquat when growth and metabolic needs are generally higher. However, the growth of <italic>rtg2</italic>Δ and <italic>rtg3</italic>Δ remained as for wild-type cells in both the presence and absence of paraquat. Thus, any anaplerotic effect is clearly within bounds the cells can handle well. Moreover, the fact that cells missing Rtg2 and Rtg3 not only fail to adapt to paraquat, but also retain normal respiratory growth, shows that the mtDNA remains functional in these cells. Clearly, if paraquat was just causing unspecific oxidative damage of mtDNA leading to mtDNA deletion, then one would not observe this mtDNA retainment even if the deletion of Rtg2 and Rtg3 just affected anaplerosis and caused reduced growth. So, this explanation can hardly be reconciled with the Rtg2/3 results.</p><p>Thus, we think the most parsimonious explanation of the Rtg2/3 results is that these two proteins are critical for the observed rapid emergence of mtDNA deletions by being mediators of two-way mito-nuclear communication being part of the deliberate regulatory response to excess mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> production. We can, at this stage, not discount completely that glutamate deficiency, e.g. by very extensive oxidative damage to glutamate uptake mechanisms, plays a role in activating RTG under ROS exposure. However, whether glutamate deficiency or a pure ROS signal activate the RTG pathway has no bearing on the conclusion that the RTG pathway is necessary for the mtDNA deletions that drive the O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> adaptation. Hence, speculation along these lines is premature in this paper.</p><p>We have addressed this concern in the section “The mtDNA deletion process requires mito-nuclear communication”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The data on chromosome duplication (Figure S9) are again just correlative rather than causative to reduced adaptive potential.</p></disp-quote><p>If we only had observed the emergence of chromosome duplications in the later stages of adaptation, then this objection would be fully justified. But, as reported in the original manuscript, we validated a causal effect through an intervention experiment. We backcrossed adapted cells with chromosome duplications to unadapted founder cells over three consecutive meiotic generations to generate highly recombined gametes with and without chromosome duplications (i.e. the intervention). As a part of the paraquat tolerance and a minor part of the loss of respiratory growth co-segregated with two of the chromosome duplications across these three meiotic generations, the data are clearly not just correlative.</p><p>We cannot completely exclude that undetected mutations contributing to these effects were located on the duplicated chromosomes. However, we detected no genes that were mutated in more than two populations and no mutations that coincided in time with the early paraquat adaptation. We also ensured that the cells used for backcrossing were chosen from populations containing no, or very few, detectable mutations. Due to this, we think the backcrossing experiment counts as a genuine causality test.</p><p>We have slightly revised the text in the section “Chromosome duplications explain the second adaptation phase” to make it more transparent that the data are based on an intervention allowing causal inference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 2 – Mitochondrial morphology changes in function of culture medium and growth stage.

At the time of sampling, all cell populations were far from entering into stationary phase, which is associated with a mitochondrial morphological shift.

We note that Rtg2 and Rtg3 have no other known cellular functions besides “regulation”. The results showing that mitophagy is repressed as long as the cells are exposed to paraquat, and that this repression is lost after release from paraquat, must also be part of this regulatory circuitry. So, we think it is justified to allude to the existence of regulation that involves Sod2/Rtg2/Rtg3. Admittedly, however, we have not explored the role of other components of the retrograde pathway, i.e. of Rtg1, Mks1, Bmh1/2, Grr1 and Lst8.

The former reads:</p><p>“We then tested experimentally whether a Darwinian adaptive process driven by selection of new mutations could account for the observed paraquat adaptation in a stress-release experiment. To this end, we exposed new cell populations to paraquat over many consecutive growth cycles. After each growth cycle, a fraction of the adapting cells was placed in a paraquat-free medium for 1 to 10 growth cycles before being exposed to paraquat once more. The rationale being that if the adaptation is due to accumulation of random mutations, loss of the adaptation would progress gradually and take many growth cycles. All 96 cell populations retained their acquired tolerance to paraquat (mean reduction in cell doubling time: 106 min) for only 1-3 growth cycles before abruptly losing it (Figure 1B). When employing the same experimental procedure to 96 cell populations from each of the two other environments to which adaptation was also fast (arsenic and glycine), we found that despite the presence of a much stronger Darwinian counterselection (Figure 1C), these populations lost their acquired adaptations more slowly and gradually (Figure 1B). Thus, while a Darwinian mutation/selection-based adaptive process could potentially explain the data for seven of the eight tested stressors, the paraquat adaptation could hardly be reconciled with such a process.”</p><p>In a classical Darwinian scenario, the loss of the paraquat adaptation during growth in absence of paraquat, emerge as selection against nuclear gene variants underlying this paraquat adaptation and for other variants. To generate the observed quite dramatic drop of mean cell doubling time in paraquat, over just a few generations of Darwinian evolution in absence of paraquat, there would need to be a truly massive disadvantage of the gene variants that caused the paraquat adaptation. But, in Figure 1C we show that there is no disadvantage at all – a paraquat adapted population grows as fast in absence of paraquat as it did before its paraquat adaptation. This gives very compelling support for the conclusion that the recovery from paraquat adaptation, and implicitly also the paraquat adaptation itself, is not due to Darwinian selection on nuclear gene variants – but to something else. We show this else to be regulated deletions of the mtDNA.</p><p>The text has been revised as shown by the above quotes.</p><p>While we originally defined and described these concepts in the Methods, we agree that also covering these aspects in the Results makes reading more convenient for the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Page 5. How can we compare in parallel mitochondrial morphology and growth if the metrics used in the two experiments are different?</p></disp-quote><p>Electron microscopy was performed exactly as in the growth experiments – on cells cultivated on solid growth medium. The confocal microscopy was done on cells cultivated in liquid. As the results from the electron and the confocal microscopy data are very similar, the liquid/solid cultivation medium distinction appears irrelevant for the conclusions drawn. Moreover, in the confocal microscopy, we estimated mitochondrial volume by stacking confocal micrographs of sectioned cells. However, stacking of electron micrographs into a complete 3-dimensional image of cells, is time consuming and the sample size would therefore be very limited. We consequently used the 2-dimensional information present in single electron micrographs of thin sections to extract measures of the cell area occupied by mitochondria in cells. The use of the 2D area covered by organelles, and mitochondrial area specifically, as proxy for volume is standard in the field (<italic>19</italic>–<italic>21</italic>). The electron microscopy and the confocal microscopy show similar result: that the size of the mitochondrial network does not change substantially but it is re-arranged from a tubular to fragmented organization following paraquat exposure. That two distinct methods, and metrics, support this conclusion increases our confidence in its validity.</p><p>We have now described the experiment design better in Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Page 6: &quot;cells retained the mtDNA segments that were not lost at near…&quot; revise the grammar of this sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>Revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Page 7. The experiment described in S6A cannot be used to rule out signaling by H2O2: adding 3 mM H2O2 to cells that have already adapted to PQ, whether or not by use of an H2O2 signal, amounts to a severe H2O2 stress, exacerbated by the lack of a functional respiratory chain (petite cells are more sensitive to H2O2, relative to WT). One way of tackling this question would be to see whether adaptive doses of H2O2 (100-300 microM) prior to exposure to paraquat would speed up growth adaptation or not (cross adaptations have been described in the past). Similarly, the WT PQ adaptative response of cells lacking Yap1 or other antioxidants does not prove anything: signaling by H2O2 is mostly localized in confined areas, and this should persist even in a Yap1 mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that we should have been more careful when addressing this topic, and that our data do not allow us to rule out H2O2 signaling.</p><p>We have completely revised the section “The deletion of mtDNA segments requires <italic>SOD2</italic>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) Page 8. The need of SOD2 for PQ adaptation to occur is not really convincing because of the sickness of SOD mutants in general. Further, it shows that there is no adaptation at 12 microG/mL PQ, but then adaptation occurs at a higher dose, but slower, relative to WT. What is the point authors want to make? That SOD by dismutation of the superoxide anion produces H2O2 needed for signaling? But, authors already ruled out the need for H2O2 to signal adaptation? Please don't be too peremptory in your conclusion on this experiment. In addition, it is hard to follow the writer: &quot;in four populations, the copy number…&quot; then &quot;two of these fail to adapt&quot; then &quot;the remaining four populations&quot;, but which ones? Lastly the text of Figure 4c indicates 12.5 mG/mL, but the figure 50?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, <italic>sod2</italic>Δ showed an expected enhanced sensitivity to paraquat, which forced us to reduce the paraquat concentration to achieve an initial fitness reduction similar to the initial fitness reduction of the wild type. But we had to do exactly the same for <italic>sod1</italic>Δ<italic>,</italic> showing that the two deletions have a similar negative effect on growth rate compared to the wild type. The deletion of <italic>SOD1</italic> had no effect on paraquat adaptation, though, and we think this is the best negative control for a <italic>sod2</italic>Δ specific effect one can achieve. Thus, if one discards our <italic>sod2</italic>Δ results with reference to the sickness of these cells, then one should at the same time explain why there is such a striking contrast with the equally sick <italic>sod1</italic>Δ cells. We are not aware of any data providing such an explanation.</p><p>We acknowledge that we should have done a better job when presenting these data. But the point we wanted to make was the following: The reason for why we did not get any adaptive response in <italic>sod2</italic>Δ at 12.5 ug/mL could be that the actual stress level relative to the one the wild type experienced at 400 ug/mL was lower than anticipated – for some unknown reason. We therefore increased the paraquat concentration to 50 ug/mL to check out this possibility. We did not want to go beyond this concentration as we assumed this would cause too high O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> stress compared to what the wild type experienced. In this case, we did get a very much delayed response in four out of eight populations. In all of these four cases we observed a single large mtDNA deletion that clearly caused the adaptive response. It can very well be that increasing the concentration somewhat more would have caused that all eight populations had shown an adaptive response. But given the Sod1 results, we would still be left with the conclusion that Sod2 is indeed crucial for the swift deletion of mtDNA segments. The fact that we do get a very postponed deletion in the <italic>sod2</italic>Δ case, and not at all in the <italic>rtg2</italic>Δ and <italic>rtg3</italic>Δ cases, strongly suggests that the observed deletions are not due to accidental oxidative damage. One possible explanation is that when the O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> concentration in the matrix gets above a certain level, its auto-dismutation rate may become high enough to trigger a H2O2 signal that induces mtDNA deletion. We have not elaborated on this idea in the paper though. In the absence of more conclusive data, we prefer to remain agnostic as to whether Sod2 has a signaling function that is separate from its enzymatic activity or H2O2 accumulating in the mitochondrial matrix serves as a signal.</p><p>We have corrected the detected typo in the figure legend.
