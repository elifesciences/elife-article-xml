The intricate respiratory system ensures the homeostatic state of the arterial partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> (<italic>P</italic>O<sub>2</sub>) and CO<sub>2</sub> (<italic>P</italic>CO<sub>2</sub>) in the blood by executing rhythmic movement of the respiratory pump, which includes the intercostals and the diaphragm muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). The inception of this respiratory rhythm occurs within the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), a functionally specialized region in the ventrolateral medulla of the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Smith et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). Activities of the preBötC are modulated by specialized peripheral and central chemosensors that adjust the respiratory drive to regulate homeostatic levels of <italic>P</italic>O<sub>2</sub> and <italic>P</italic>CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heymans and Bouckaert, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">O’Regan and Majcherczyk, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guyenet, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">van der Heijden and Zoghbi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guyenet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Most studies on homeostatic control of breathing have been done in rodent models, in which the experiments are mostly performed during the day, rodents’ normal inactive period. Since, in general, rodents have relatively reduced chemosensitivities compared with primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hazari and Farraj, 2015</xref>), the use of non-human primates (NHPs) has been proposed to fill the gap and translate rodent breathing data to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">SheikhBahaei, 2020</xref>). The common marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) is a New World NHP with a small body size (250–600 g) similar to that of a rat. Ease of handling, high reproductive efficacy, and lack of zoonotic risks compared to Old World NHPs make marmosets an attractive and powerful NHP model for biomedical and neuroscience research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2003</xref>). Marmosets have been proposed as a primate model to study behavioral neuroscience, leading to a recent increase of their use in research settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prins et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). However, the basic characteristics of breathing behaviors in marmosets are not yet defined.</p><p>Whole-body plethysmography has been widely used in studying breathing behaviors in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Besch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Iizuka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hosford et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hutchison et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hoffman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Valente et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tattersall et al., 2002</xref>). However, analyzing whole-body respiratory data in awake animals requires algorithms to distinguish different respiratory signals. To avoid this problem, respiratory activities are often recorded when the animal is asleep, awake with minimal movement, or anesthetized. Yet studying the homeostatic control of breathing physiology in awake animals has absolute advantages, despite the increased variability. Therefore, to overcome this challenge, we developed an open-source Python tool using Neurokit2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Makowski et al., 2021</xref>), for unsupervised analysis of respiratory signals obtained from rats and common marmosets. We then characterized the ventilatory responses in marmosets at rest as well as during acute hypoxia (decrease inspired O<sub>2</sub> to 10%) and hypercapnia (increased inspired CO<sub>2</sub> to 6%). We found that while exposure of marmosets to hypoxia increased sigh rate and decreased overall animal metabolic rate, the hypoxia-induced augmentation of ventilation was diminished. On the other hand, hypercapnic conditions increased both frequency and depth of breathing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Validation of the analysis toolkit in experimental animal models</title><p>Analysis of breathing data from plethysmography is usually time-consuming, laborious, and often involves measurements of rate of breathing (f<sub>R</sub>), tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>), and minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>). f<sub>R</sub> is usually calculated in intervals when the animal is asleep or stationary from the time of peak-to-peak inspiratory or expiratory signal. V<sub>T</sub> is often measured by integration of signal over a specified period of time. Therefore, analysis of minute-to-minute changes in breathing may be difficult and take more time. In addition, the fact that conventional analysis is usually subjective might affect the reproducibility of reported results. To overcome this problem, we wrote a custom, open-source Python script using Neurokit2, NumPy, and Pandas software packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McKinney, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">van der Walt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Makowski et al., 2020</xref>) to analyze breathing signals in awake, freely-moving animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While using this script, the user has the option to define the start and end intervals for baseline as well as experimental challenges, which the script uses to import the data and perform analysis. To validate our script, we benchmarked the data analyzed against a conventional method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2017</xref>) by analyzing simple respiratory data (f<sub>R</sub>,V<sub>T</sub>, and V<sub>E</sub>) in conscious marmosets and rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We did not identify any differences in values of f<sub>R</sub>, V<sub>T</sub>, and V<sub>E</sub> between those generated using our script or by the conventional method (n = 3 per species) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Specialized peripheral chemoreceptors located in the carotid bodies (and aortic bodies in some species) are responsible for the remaining 30% of hypercapnia-induced augmentation of breathing. In awake, freely behaving marmosets, hypercapnia increased both breathing rate (f<sub>R</sub>) and tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the augmentation of ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) was mainly due to increase in V<sub>T</sub> (by ~160%) rather than f<sub>R</sub>. These data are comparable to data obtained from rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhandare et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duffin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ogoh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Serebrovskaya, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maxwell et al., 1986</xref>). In this study we used hyperoxic hypercapnia. In humans and rodents, hyperoxia is proposed to suppress the activity of carotid bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chavez-Valdez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gonzalez et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bates et al., 2014</xref>). By extrapolation, since marmosets lack aortic bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke and de B Daly, 2002</xref>), we assumed that hyperoxia attenuates marmoset’s carotid body activity, and therefore, the hypercapnic ventilatory response presented here may represent the central CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensitive activity. Hypercapnia also increases frequency of sighs (i.e., augmented breath) in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forsberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ramirez, 2014</xref>). Consistent with these data, we also found that hypercapnia increased sigh frequency in marmosets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Nevertheless, our data suggest that the common marmoset is a good animal model for studying respiratory responses to hypercapnia. However, more experiments are required to show that increases in CO<sub>2</sub> actually activate classical chemosensitive regions in marmosets.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The ventilatory response to acute hypoxia</title><p>The hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) in common marmosets was noteworthy, as there was little or no increase in f<sub>R</sub> during hypoxic exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We believe the level of O<sub>2</sub> during hypoxia was sufficient to elicit HVR, as a similar level of O<sub>2</sub> (10% O<sub>2</sub>) decreased the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) to 89% in humans after 180 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerlach et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, increases in sigh rate and the existence of post-hypoxic depression (see below) strongly suggest that the respiratory circuits were activated by the hypoxic challenge to prevent hypoxic ventilatory decline (HVD).</p><p>Although hypoxic conditions in marmosets’ natural habitat (sea-level forests of the Amazon) are rare, hypoxia might occur as a result of disease or during sleep. Acute HVR is likely biphasic in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Easton et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rehan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vizek et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Waites et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gozal and Gaultier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Greer and Funk, 2013</xref>). During acute hypoxia, ventilation shows an initial increase followed by a subsequent decline to a value at or above the baseline (i.e., HVD). This biphasic hypoxic response has been reported in humans, rats, and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eden and Hanson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fung et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vizek and Bonora, 1998</xref>). However, earlier reports suggest that there is considerable interindividual variation in HVR in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hirshman et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Weil and Zwillich, 1976</xref>). Recent data in awake adult humans showed no increase of f<sub>R</sub> during acute hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerlach et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that any changes in ventilation may be due to changes in V<sub>T</sub>, not f<sub>R</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tarbichi et al., 2003</xref>). Our data support these reports, as we see variable responses to acute hypoxia in marmosets as well as a slight increase in V<sub>T</sub> and V<sub>E</sub> during the first minute of HVR followed by a decrease in V<sub>T</sub> and V<sub>E</sub> as hypoxia continues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, ventilatory efficiency (V<sub>E</sub> /M<sub>R</sub>) was not affected by hypoxia (see below). It is possible that the large gas-exchange capacity of marmosets’ lungs (due to the increased oxygen diffusion capacity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbier and Bachofen, 2000</xref>) maintains the adequate blood oxygenation, and therefore, blunts the HVR during hypoxia.</p><p>Hypoxia increases sigh frequency in mammals, even in animals whose carotid bodies are non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartlett, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schwenke and Cragg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cherniack et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with these data, hypoxia also increased sigh frequency in marmosets. In addition, the fact that sigh frequency, but not breathing frequency, increased during hypoxic challenge, supports the hypothesis that distinct cells may be responsible for the generation of rhythmic sighs and normal breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Toporikova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>). Recent data from behaving rats suggest that purinergic signaling from astrocytes (numerous star-shaped glial cells) in the respiratory rhythm-generating circuits of the preBötC may play a significant role in regulation of sigh generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the mechanism of HVD is not fully understood. It is proposed that desensitization of peripheral chemoreceptors might play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bascom et al., 1990</xref>), though significant evidence suggests that, at least in rodents, astrocytes in the preBötC are capable of acting as central respiratory oxygen chemosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rajani et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, preBötC astrocytes might contribute to the HVD via release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>). Existence of ATP receptors in the brainstem respiratory regions in marmosets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yao et al., 2000</xref>) further strengthens this hypothesis in primates. In addition to the preBötC, RTN, rostral ventrolateral medulla, and the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem are proposed to have oxygen sensing capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accorsi-Mendonça et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mazza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Uchiyama et al., 2020</xref>). However, more research is required to understand if this ‘distributed central oxygen chemosensors’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">SheikhBahaei, 2020</xref>) can be generalized to primates.</p><p>Decrease of post-hypoxic ventilation in human is also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tarbichi et al., 2003</xref>). This post-hypoxic depression is also illustrated in conscious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>) and anesthetized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rajani et al., 2018</xref>) rats. Similarly, we observe such a respiratory response in marmosets. However, we did not detect any sex differences during post-hypoxic recovery from hypoxia as reported in rat’s in vitro models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>). Our data are consistent with that reported in humans, namely that there are no differences in ventilation between sexes during post-hypoxic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tarbichi et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We also examined marmoset activity during hypoxic challenges. Our data, however, suggest that animal activity was not affected by hypoxia (or hypercapnia). This suggests that decreases in metabolic rate during hypoxic challenge are not due to decrease in spontaneous activity, but may be accounted for by changes in other processes with metabolic demand such as thermoregulation or cardiovascular activities.</p><p>Other than an increase in ventilatory response during hypoxia, mammals can reduce oxygen demand by optimizing and decreasing their rates of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dzal et al., 2015</xref>). During acute hypoxia, adult marmosets decreased their metabolic rates (M<sub>R</sub>) by ~50%, which is similar to data reported in other primates (pygmy marmosets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tattersall et al., 2002</xref>] and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Robinson and Haymes, 1990</xref>]), but two to three times more than the calculated rates from cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gautier et al., 1989</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mortola et al., 1994</xref>). This decrease in metabolism together with increase in sigh frequency might be sufficient for homeostatic control of blood oxygen during acute hypoxia in primates. We also analyzed ventilatory efficiency (V<sub>E</sub>/M<sub>R</sub>) to understand the changes in ventilation in response to CO<sub>2</sub> production. Although we saw a slight increase in ventilatory efficiency, acute hypoxia did not have a significant effect on V<sub>E</sub>/M<sub>R</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We believe ventilatory efficiency gives a more comprehensive view on ventilation compared to just measuring V<sub>E</sub>. It also suggests that acute hypoxia does not increase ventilation in the common marmoset.</p><p>We acknowledge that our characterization of breathing behaviors in the common marmoset is not complete and more experiments are needed to fully characterize hypoxic breathing behaviors in common marmosets. For instance, the respiratory response to hypoxia in rodents is non-linear, as a decrease in inspired O<sub>2</sub> to 15% elicits a minimal ventilatory response, but a decrease to 10% elicits a strongly robust one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">SheikhBahaei, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hosford et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheikhbahaei et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, a decrease in metabolic rate strongly suggests that the core body temperature is affected by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morgan et al., 2014</xref>). Since we did not measure core body temperature in the marmoset, we reported the tidal volume as arbitrary units. Future experiments (using telemetry probes or other devices) to measure core body temperature in marmosets are needed to accurately measure changes in tidal volume during stepwise changes of inspired O<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub>. However, our data suggest that the analysis toolbox presented in this study is a powerful means to analyze breathing data in awake animal models under different experimental O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>We used 16 common marmosets (<italic>C. jacchus</italic>) (8 males, 8 females; 394 ± 5 g; 40 ± 1 months) and three male Sprague-Dawley rats (320 ± 11 g) for measuring and defining breathing behaviors.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Melissa Bates, and Michael Taffe as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers point out that the major contributions of this study, particularly for people that are not experts in respiration, are not immediately clear. While Reviewer #1 saw the value in an automated system to quantify breathing, it is evident from Reviewer #2's comments that the value of this compared to current manual methods of quantification is not immediately apparent. It will likely also not be apparent to readers who have not toiled through manual breath analysis. As Reviewer #1 notes, these analysis tools are not widely available, so it is worth expanding on how analysis is typically performed versus how this new tool may enhance research in this field.</p><p>2) Reviewers #1 and 2 note questions about the marmoset model and both remark that it is unclear whether this is a paper that investigates similarities between non-human primates and humans, or a presentation of a new methodology. Reviewer #2 notes that the rationale for measuring ventilatory drive is not clear, nor whether the marmoset is a superior model to the rodent. Reviewer #1 notes serious concerns about some of the limitations to the hypoxic ventilatory drive measurements. It is possible that there is too much being done in this single paper and that this has tempered the reviewers' enthusiasm. Some of the limitations to the method of measuring the ventilatory response limit its ability to be compared to humans, as the marmoset changes its metabolic rate more like a rodent. In fact, this is a novel finding in a primate model but the paper may not benefit from having the characterization of the ventilatory drive as its central focus.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The absolute strongest contribution that this paper makes is the NeuroKil2 tool and the demonstration of its use in a novel research model. I think it would make the paper stronger to refocus the section on the hypoxic and hypercapnia responses as tools to provoke changes in ventilation without claiming to have completely characterized the response, given the limitations addressed in the public review.</p><p>There are also some generalizations that are made that are not necessarily true. For example, the authors claim in line 74 that rodents have not necessarily informed human disease, which is not true (see https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc1311092 and https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00985.2002). The authors also discuss variability in the human ventilatory, response, and allude to the biphasic response. I did not understand the sentence in line 428 &quot;In awake adult human, even one-hour hypoxic condition did not affect mean pulmonary minute ventilation (i.e., VE) (Robinson and Haymes 1990; Seo et al., 2017).&quot; This implies that humans lack a hypoxic ventilatory response. Is this the authors' intent?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below are specific comments to the individual parts of the text.</p><p>There are quite a few places where language needs corrections.</p><p>“In this study, we described breathing behaviors of common marmosets in a variety of O2 and CO2 conditions.”</p><p>As conclusion one wants to see a statement of novel findings and how they relate to the previous state of knowledge. What is the key finding of the paper?</p><p>“We also modified and optimized an analysis toolkit for automated characterization of respiratory indices in laboratory animals.”</p><p>This makes the scope of the paper unclear. Is it about some unexpected/interesting findings in NHP or is it a methodological paper to describe an evaluation protocol? If so, how do we know that it is any better than what was used before?</p><p>“All experiments were performed at the same time of day (between 10:00 and 14:00 hours)”</p><p>While the logic is clear it actually would have make the study much more exciting to see day/night comparisons</p><p>“To prevent any acclimatization confound, each animal was only placed once in the plethysmography chamber and randomly assigned to either hypoxia or hypercapnia experiment.”</p><p>But this raises a concern that some of the noted effects were induced by stress.</p><p>“We tracked 10 points on the marmoset head and body (n = 3 animal per challenge) from an overhead view of the plethysmograph using WhiteMatter e3Vision cameras (e3Vision camera; e3Vision hub; White Matter LLC).

We have revised the manuscript and added more details about our new analysis script. We further demonstrated the applicability of the model by adding new analysis in rodents. We believe the major contribution of this manuscript to the field is providing an analysis tool to study complex breathing behavior in conscious, awake, and active laboratory animals. Thus, in this manuscript, we have applied and optimized our script on analysis breathing behaviors in common marmosets and rats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewers #1 and 2 note questions about the marmoset model and both remark that it is unclear whether this is a paper that investigates similarities between non-human primates and humans, or a presentation of a new methodology.

We believe it is difficult to assume one animal model to be <italic>the best model for all research questions</italic>! Although utilizing rodent models have some advantages, including availability of genetic tools, certainly having a primate model to study human physiological studies is more advantageous.</p><p>Because marmosets are primates, their brain circuits more closely resemble humans’, especially when compared to rodents. For instance, it is important to study cortical control of breathing, which is necessary for many voluntary activities, including speech/vocal production. This volitional control of breathing has not been shown in rodent models, and so marmosets, whose vocal production mirrors that of humans in numerous domains, would be the best fit for these types of studies. Therefore, it is advantageous to study the brain circuits involved in controlling respiratory behaviors in marmosets. In our opinion, designing necessary tools and characterizing basic marmoset breathing is the first and most important step in studying cortical control of breathing.</p><p>In terms of mirroring study methodology in humans and non-human primates, we believe that it is not a simple task. The experimental set ups are different when human subjects are being studied (i.e., using masks, whole-body plethysmography, subject laying down or sitting, etc.). These different methods certainly will affect the data. In addition, existing data on breathing behaviors between human and rodent models are not consistent (for example see PMID: 31445081).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The absolute strongest contribution that this paper makes is the NeuroKil2 tool and the demonstration of its use in a novel research model.

In the revised manuscript, we have shifted the focus to be on our analysis tool. We have also mentioned that we used ‘acute hypoxia/hypercapnia’ to perturb the ventilatory response, thus clarifying the findings and limitations of this study. In addition, we have removed any indication/claims that the breathing behaviors are <italic>completely</italic> characterized in marmosets, viewing this paper as a necessary but not sufficient contribution to the complete characterization of breathing behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are also some generalizations that are made that are not necessarily true.

However, we believe there are other possible explanations for the studies provided by the reviewer. For example, many lines of evidence suggest that astrocytes in the ventrolateral medulla act as oxygen sensors and can modulate the activities of respiratory circuits (for instance see PMCID: PMC5785528; PMCID: PMC4510287; PMCID: PMC6068109). Moreover, matching rodent age to human age is questionable as rodents mature rapidly compared to humans. Therefore, we believe comparing animal studies to human studies is not as straightforward as we would hope. However, to respond to the comment of the reviewer, we have removed the sentence in line 74.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also discuss variability in the human ventilatory, response, and allude to the biphasic response.

Is this the authors' intent?</p></disp-quote><p>Several studies showed variability of hypoxic ventilatory responses in humans (for instance see PMID: 1141125). Even in the paper provided by the reviewer (PMCID: PMC4769592, previous comment), there are considerable variations in hypoxic responses in both control and experimental subjects.</p><p>In line 428, Robinson and Haymes, applied hypoxia for 1.5 hrs and in the first 1 hour, there was no increase in V<sub>E</sub>. We do not believe that these data suggest that humans lack hypoxic ventilatory response, rather further points toward variability of responses (possibly due to different experimental methods). However, to prevent any confusion, we have removed the sentence from our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Below are specific comments to the individual parts of the text.</p><p>52 In this study, we described breathing behaviors of common marmosets in a variety of O2 and CO2 conditions.</p><p>As conclusion one wants to see a statement of novel findings and how they relate to the previous state of knowledge.

Most marmosets calm down in 20-30 minutes. Although we cannot rule out any stress involvement in our recordings (since we did not sample blood from animal), it is highly unlikely that the animals are stressed as they do not show any stress behavior/vocalization. It has to be noted that this acclimatization time is also sufficient for rodents to get used to the plethysmography chamber.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“ We tracked 10 points on the marmoset head and body (n = 3 animal per challenge) from an overhead view of the plethysmograph using WhiteMatter e3Vision cameras (e3Vision camera; e3Vision hub; White Matter LLC).
