optical microscopy. The aberrations intrinsic to the mouse eye, however, prevent high-resolution investigation of retinal structure and function in vivo. Optimizing the design of a two-photon fluorescence microscope (2PFM) and sample preparation procedure, we found that adaptive optics (AO), by measuring and correcting ocular aberrations, is essential for resolving putative synaptic structures and achieving three-dimensional cellular resolution in the mouse retina in vivo. Applying AO-2PFM to longitudinal retinal imaging in transgenic models of retinal pathology, we characterized microvascular lesions with sub-capillary details in a proliferative vascular retinopathy model, and found Lidocaine to effectively suppress retinal ganglion cell hyperactivity in a retinal degeneration model. Tracking structural and functional changes at high-resolution longitudinally, AO-2PFM enables microscopic investigations of retinal pathology and pharmacology for disease diagnosis and treatment in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fluorescence microscopy</kwd><kwd>adaptive optics</kwd><kwd>optical imaging</kwd><kwd>retinal vasculature</kwd><kwd>retinal degeneration</kwd><kwd>retinal pharmacology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01NS103489</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Na</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01NS118300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Na</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1MH120680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Na</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32EY029983</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY024334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Richard H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30EY003176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Richard H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH/EY013849</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gong</surname><given-names>Xiaohua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A properly designed two-photon fluorescence microscope allows high-resolution visualization of neurons and capillaries in healthy and diseased mouse retinas in vivo, while to visualize subcellular structures, adaptive optics is required to correct the eye-induced optical aberrations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retina is a layered tissue in the back of the eye that transduces light into electrochemical signals to be further processed by the brain for visual perception and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kandel et al., 2021</xref>). As one of the most energy-demanding tissues, the retina is metabolically sustained by an intricate vasculature with several laminar plexuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Selvam et al., 2018</xref>). Vascular and neuronal abnormalities in the retina are associated with both ocular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schachat et al., 2017</xref>) and systemic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">London et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lechner et al., 2017</xref>), underscoring the importance of studying retinal pathology and pharmacology.</p><p>With well-developed genetics and similar physiology to the human retina, mouse models have been widely utilized for mechanistical studies of retinal diseases. Behind highly transparent mouse eye optics (i.e. cornea and crystalline lens), the retina is uniquely accessible to light and the only part of the nervous system that can be probed non-invasively by optical imaging. Recent advances in mouse genetics have enabled fluorescence microscopy investigations of vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivanova et al., 2021</xref>) as well as neurons and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martersteck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eme-Scolan and Dando, 2020</xref>) of the mouse retina. Among fluorescence microscopy techniques, two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denk et al., 1990</xref>) utilizing near-infrared (NIR) excitation is particularly suited for retinal imaging. Its intrinsic optical sectioning capability permits depth-resolved three-dimensional (3D) imaging throughout the retina. With the retinal photoreceptors minimally responsive to NIR light, 2PFM is also an ideal tool for functional studies of retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baden et al., 2016</xref>). However, as a far-from-perfect imaging system, the optics of the mouse eye introduce severe aberrations to the NIR excitation light, preventing high-resolution visualization of subcellular features in vivo. As a result, the vast majority of microscopy studies have been carried out ex vivo on dissected retinas, preventing longitudinal investigations of retinal pathology under physiological conditions.</p><p>Adaptive optics (AO) is a collection of technologies that actively measure and correct for optical aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hampson et al., 2021</xref>), and has been applied to optical microscopy for high-resolution imaging of neural tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ji, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodríguez and Ji, 2018</xref>). It has also been combined with ophthalmological imaging modalities to restore diffraction-limited imaging performance for the human retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akyol et al., 2021</xref>). Because of the severe aberrations of the mouse eye, AO has also been applied to in vivo imaging of the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palczewska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biss et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wahl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2020</xref>). However, there are disagreements in the reported spatial resolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palczewska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biss et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wahl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2020</xref>), characteristics and magnitude of aberration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palczewska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biss et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wahl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2020</xref>), and the effectiveness of AO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biss et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wahl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2020</xref>). For example, whereas previous papers reported cellular resolution without AO, a recent AO-2PFM study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2020</xref>) reported extremely large aberrations in the mouse eye and found AO to be required in order to resolve microvasculature and cell bodies in 2D in vivo. These discrepancies have led to uncertainty over the imaging performance achievable with conventional 2PFM and the necessity of AO for microvascular and cellular investigations of retinal physiology. Together with a lack of detailed imaging protocols, they have prevented the routine application of AO-2PFM to disease diagnosis and therapeutic intervention in the retina of mouse models of ocular, cerebral, and systemic diseases.</p><p>The aims of this work are to provide a resource for in vivo retinal imaging using 2PFM, by optimizing the design of a 2PFM for in vivo imaging of the mouse retina, characterizing mouse ocular aberration, developing a guideline for adaptive optical 2PFM (AO-2PFM) imaging, and demonstrating its applications to retinal pathology and pharmacology. Using a carefully engineered 2PFM and following an optimized sample preparation procedure, we were able to achieve two-dimensional (2D) cellular resolution imaging performance in the mouse retina without AO. For synaptic, subcellular, and three-dimensional (3D) cellular resolution imaging of the mouse retina, AO was essential in improving image brightness, contrast, and resolution. Testing the performance of AO-2PFM in various transgenic mouse lines, we proposed strategies to maximize its impact on image quality improvement. We extended the application of AO-2PFM to mouse retinal pathology and pharmacology by imaging the retinas of two transgenic models with proliferative vascular retinopathy and retinal degeneration, respectively. In our model of proliferative vascular retinopathy, AO enabled us to, for the first time, characterize retinal vascular lesions with sub-capillary details over multiple days and observe cell migration in vivo. In our model of retinal degeneration, AO allowed high-fidelity interrogation of pharmacologically modified hyperactivity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), indicating AO-2PFM as a promising tool evaluating retinal pharmacology in vivo. Together, by systematically optimizing and applying AO-2PFM to in vivo mouse retinal imaging, our work represents an important advancement in enabling high-resolution longitudinal studies of retinal pathology and pharmacology for disease diagnosis and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimized AO-2PFM for in vivo mouse retinal imaging</title><p>A home-built two-photon fluorescence microscope equipped with a segmented deformable mirror (DM) and a Shack-Hartmann (SH) sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2020b</xref>) was modified for in vivo mouse retinal imaging by replacing the objective lens with an add-on eye imaging module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grulkowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Materials and methods).

We found that aberrations introduced by the ETL at different control currents minimally affected image quality and that axial focal shift varied linearly with ETL current while field-of-view (FOV) size remained mostly constant. We also optimized sample preparation procedure. We discovered that a custom-designed 0-diopter contact lens (CL; design parameters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) in combination with a single application of eye gel between the CL and the cornea reduced aberrations, prevented cataract formation, and improved wavefront sensing and imaging for hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In order to achieve diffraction-limited imaging of the mouse retina in vivo, we measured and corrected ocular aberrations with a direct wavefront sensing method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), utilizing the SH sensor for wavefront measurement and the DM for wavefront correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, a 3D-localized fluorescence ‘guide star’ was formed in the retina via two-photon excitation and scanned over a user-defined 2D area with galvanometer scanning mirrors. The emitted fluorescence was collected and, after being descanned by the same pair of scanning mirrors, directed to the SH sensor. The now stationary fluorescence wavefront was segmented by a lenslet array and focused onto a camera, forming an SH image composed of an array of foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, inset 1). Local phase slopes of wavefront segments were calculated from the displacements of the foci from those taken without aberrations. Assuming spatially continuous aberrations, we computationally reconstructed the wavefront from the phase slopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Panagopoulou and Neal, 2005</xref>). We then applied a corrective wavefront, opposite to the measured aberrations, to the DM by controlling the tip, tilt, and piston of each segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, inset 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) so that mouse ocular aberrations could be canceled out, ensuring diffraction-limited focusing of the two-photon excitation light on the mouse retina.</p><p>All in vivo imaging experiments were conducted in anesthetized mice with dilated pupil (Materials and methods). In most experiments, an area of 19×19 µm<sup>2</sup> of the retina was scanned for 3–10 s for wavefront sensing. To estimate the spatial resolution of our AO-2PFM for in vivo mouse retinal imaging, we imaged Thy1-GFP line M transgenic mice that had green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed in a subset of RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2000</xref>). The image taken without AO showed dim and distorted RGC axons; after aberration correction, we achieved an 8.6× increase in signal and proper visualization of the fine RGC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The spatial frequency space representations of the images indicated that AO enhanced the ability of the imaging system to acquire higher resolution information and led to a lateral resolution that was better than ~0.8 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, insets). For some thin RGC processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), restoring diffraction-limited resolution led to an increase in signal (by 10.6×) and contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, i</xref>), and, for the first time, enabled in vivo 2PFM visualization of varicosities resembling synaptic structures in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, white arrowheads). From the axial profile of a thin process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, ii</xref>), we estimated the axial resolution after AO correction to be 6.7 µm. Both the lateral and axial resolution estimations were close to the theoretical diffraction-limited resolution for a fully-dilated mouse eye with 0.49 numerical aperture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geng et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>AO improves in vivo imaging of retinal vasculature</title><p>Retinal vasculature supports the physiological functions of the retina.

We found that AO performed at the superficial plexus was beneficial for imaging deeper layers, with the correction at superficial depth improving signal, resolution, and contrast of deeper vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). This result indicated that most aberrations of the mouse eye arose from cornea and crystalline lens, instead of retina. Because the crystalline lens of the mouse eye has a gradient refractive index distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Hughes, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Remtulla and Hallett, 1985</xref>), ocular aberrations should also be field dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>). Field-dependent aberrations might also be introduced when the mouse eye was positioned off-axis with respect to the eye imaging module. We therefore examined how aberrations varied with FOV position and characterized the area within which a single correction led to substantial signal improvement. We performed AO at different locations of the superficial plexus in the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, left column, red asterisks; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>) and compared their performance.

The resolution enhancement was especially striking along the axial direction, allowing retinal layers to be more clearly differentiated by better resolving neurons at different depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, XZ images). This improvement in axial resolution is especially important for functional imaging, because it minimizes neuropil contamination and ensures accurate characterization of the functional properties of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ji et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2016</xref>).

In contrast, correcting aberrations from a larger area reduced signal improvement in the center of the area but enlarged the overall area within which signal was enhanced, which now extended over the entire imaging FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, iii and iv</xref>). Here, the wavefront measured from scanning the guide star over a larger FOV averaged out the local variations and represented the wavefront distortions common to all field positions.

Replicating the characteristic phenotypes of human RAP, a transgenic mouse model, the very low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (VLDLR-KO) mouse, has been employed to study the underlying mechanism of RAP. In this model, the gene encoding VLDLR, which mediates anti-angiogenic signaling in retinal vasculature, is knocked out, leading to overgrown intraretinal vasculature and subretinal neovascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heckenlively et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2008</xref>).

Interestingly, in the VLDLR-KO/Sca1-GFP retina, images acquired with AO revealed a disruption in the capillary endothelium labeled by GFP, where the endothelial cells lined the walls of a short capillary branch but not its end face, leading to a ring-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>, yellow asterisks, insets i-ii; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, enabled by AO, we first located a microvascular lesion in a VLDLR-KO/Sca1-GFP mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, orange box, inset). Then we retro-orbitally injected the green fluorescent dye FITC into the non-imaged eye, which labeled the blood plasma within the retinal vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Immediately after dye injection, we observed dye leakage around the lesion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, orange dashed area). A control experiment was carried out by introducing FITC into the healthy WT/Sca1-GFP mouse retina retro-orbitally, where neither capillary disruptions nor dye leakage were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>To further study the association between dye leakage and microvascular lesions, we injected the NIR dye Evans Blue (EB) into the retinal vasculature and performed dual-color two-photon imaging of the VLDLR-KO retina. Similar to the experiments with FITC, we observed leakage in the knockout mouse retina, with EB persistently staining retinal tissue and the stained volume expanding over 3 days of consecutive imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We observed capillary lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, insets) in the stained volume, suggesting a spatial correlation between dye leakage and capillary abnormalities. Moreover, on the third day, we observed GFP-positive cells within the dye-stained retinal volume that were absent in previous 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The morphology of these cells resembled that of activated microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozaki et al., 2022</xref>). We speculated that the leakage of EB triggered local immune response and recruited ocular immune cells to the impacted area. With the subcellular resolution provided by AO-2PFM, we were able to track dynamic changes in the processes of the same cell over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, bottom). Control experiment in WT/Sca1-GFP retina showed local small-scale EB leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), probably resulting from normal remodeling of the retinal vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Selvam et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings revealed, for the first time, the microscopic morphological details of vasculature lesions and suggested that these capillary disruptions served as intraretinal origins of vascular leakage in the VLDLR knockout mouse. Here, AO was essential for 2PFM to achieve high-resolution identification and characterization of microvasculature lesions in vivo. Together with our optimized sample preparation, AO-2PFM also allowed us to track these lesions, dye leakage, and associated immune response longitudinally, making it possible to investigate the development and progression of vasculature-associated diseases at subcellular resolution in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>High-resolution in vivo imaging of retinal pharmacology</title><p>With the 3D cellular resolution imaging capability enabled by AO-2PFM, we can now image the functional activity of retinal neurons with high fidelity in healthy or diseased retina in vivo using activity sensors such as the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As a demonstration, we studied how pharmacological manipulation affects RGC activity in vivo in a mouse model of retinal degeneration. As the afferent neurons of the retina, RGCs deliver retinal circuit output to the rest of the brain and play a crucial role in visual perception. RGCs in the <italic>rd1</italic> mouse, the oldest and most widely studied animal model of retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2002</xref>), become hyperactive after photoreceptor death caused by a mutation in the <italic>Pde6b</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sekirnjak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Telias et al., 2019</xref>).

Studying RGC hyperactivity therefore is of great importance both for understanding the pathology of retinal degeneration and for developing pharmacological therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). However, RGC hyperactivity has been only studied ex vivo on dissected retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Telias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2021</xref>), preventing longitudinal evaluation of degeneration progression and therapeutic approaches.</p><p>Here, we characterized RGC hyperactivity in vivo and studied the effect of Lidocaine, a use-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker, on alleviating hyperactivity of RGCs in the <italic>rd1</italic>-Thy1-GCaMP6s mouse using AO-2PFM and calcium imaging.

Because RGC hyperactivity is usually studied by ex vivo tools such as multi-electrode array (MEA) or single cell electrophysiology recordings, to establish the calcium signature of RGC hyperactivity, we first carried out simultaneous cell-attached and ex vivo 2PFM calcium recordings of the same hyperactive alpha RGCs in a dissected <italic>rd1</italic> mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Consistent with previous reports on ex vivo retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Telias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Telias et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2021</xref>), RGC hyperactivity was observed as high-frequency action potentials. In terms of calcium signaling (quantified as calcium response magnitude ΔF/F, with F being baseline brightness and ΔF being the difference from baseline brightness), hyperactivity measured ex vivo was correlated with a heightened ΔF/F of the GCaMP6s-expressing soma. A temporally varying firing rate led to transient fluctuations in its calcium signal (ROI 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), whereas a sustained high firing rate led to heightened fluorescence brightness without obvious transients (ROI 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). After ~20 seconds of 2% Lidocaine bath perfusion, spontaneous spiking from the RGC was largely suppressed with a ΔF/F close to 0. After artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) washout, RGC hyperactivity partially recovered, which was associated with an increase of ΔF/F magnitude. The observed time course and suppressive effect of Lidocaine application on RGC hyperactivity were consistent with ex vivo multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Through the <italic>rd1</italic>-Thy1-GCaMP6s mouse eye, AO increased RGC brightness by on average 4× and enabled high-resolution visualization of both RGC somata and their processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The signal increase enabled by AO was particularly important for the <italic>rd1</italic>-Thy1-GCaMP6s mouse, because the RGCs here had dimmer fluorescence than the other lines that we investigated. For these RGCs, correcting the eye-induced aberration was essential for their visualization and high-fidelity functional investigations at cellular resolution in vivo. To maximize the fluorescence signal, we performed AO with a small (19×19 µm<sup>2</sup>) wavefront sensing area. Before injecting Lidocaine, we observed slow fluctuations in the brightness of GCaMP6s-expressing RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, i</xref>), similar to the slow dynamic events in RGC calcium traces measured ex vivo. One minute after retro-orbital injection of Lidocaine into the non-imaged eye, hyperactivities from these cells were substantially inhibited for an hour as indicated by the reduction of RGC GCaMP6s fluorescence brightness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, ii and iii</xref>). Imaging the same RGCs 60 min after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, iv</xref>), we detected partial recovery of RGC brightness, consistent with our ex vivo recordings after washing out. Here, by studying the suppression effects of Lidocaine on RGC hyperactivity within living mice, we demonstrated that AO-2PFM can monitor the pathology and pharmacology of retinal diseases at high resolution in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By optimizing optical design and sample preparation and using direct wavefront sensing AO to correct mouse eye aberrations, we demonstrated here the first in vivo visualization of putative retinal synaptic structures, the first in vivo identification of capillary lesions with sub-capillary details, and the first in vivo detection of RGC hyperactivity and its suppression by pharmacological reagents.</p><p>To image mouse retina in vivo with 2PFM, one can either utilize a standard objective lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palczewska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bar-Noam et al., 2016</xref>) or the mouse eye’s optics itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2020</xref>) to focus the excitation light and collect the fluorescence emission. The former approach requires long-working-distance objective lenses and, more importantly, suffers from severe aberrations caused by the refractive power of the ocular optics (mostly crystalline lens, as cornea was typically flattened in these systems). For this reason, to achieve the best image quality and the largest FOV size, using mouse eye itself as the focusing element as implemented here is preferable.</p><p>Among the studies that used the mouse eye optics for imaging, discrepancies exist in how large the mouse ocular aberrations are and how essential AO is for vasculature and cellular imaging in the mouse retina. For the multiple mouse strains investigated here (i.e. wild-type (C57BL/6), Thy1-GFP line M, Thy1-YFP-16, VLDLR-KO/Sca1-GFP, WT/Sca1-GFP, and <italic>rd1</italic>-Thy1-GCaMP6s), we found that their ocular aberrations were typically within the range of 3~5 µm peak-to-valley (P-V; after removing tip, tilt, and defocus) and 0.4~0.8 µm rms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) without notable differences in severity across strains. While consistent with most previously reported values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wahl et al., 2019</xref>), our study differs significantly from a recent AO-2PFM study that reported extremely large aberrations (e.g. 12–25 µm P-V, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2020</xref>) and found it difficult to resolve microvasculature and cell bodies in 2D in vivo without AO. In contrast, with our carefully designed microscope and system aberration correction procedure, we achieved capillary visualization, 2D single-cell resolution, and retinal layer differentiation by only correcting system aberrations (‘No AO’ in our case). Given that our system aberrations were much smaller than mouse ocular aberrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), our study indicated that a well-engineered 2PFM like ours should be sufficient for in vivo retinal imaging applications requiring only capillary and 2D cellular resolution.</p><p>One factor that strongly impacted image and wavefront sensing quality was the sample preparation procedure. We found that our specially designed 0-diopter contact lens encircled with a supportive flat base were essential for high-quality imaging by 2PFM both without and with AO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar improvement in imaging quality by 0-diopter contact lens was reported previously for in vivo optical coherence tomography imaging of the rat retina, where it was hypothesized that the application of the contact lens smoothed corneal defects and reduced wavefront error of the anterior segment of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). The supportive flat base encircling the optical zone of our contact lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeda et al., 2018</xref>) and the gel completely separated the eye surface from air and prevented cataract formation. Together, they enabled high-quality SH images and accurate corrective wavefronts to be acquired throughout the experiment.</p><p>Incorporating direct-wavefront-sensing-based AO with 2PFM, we found that location-dependent aberrations led to local improvement in the mouse retina in vivo. To enlarge the high-resolution area enabled by AO, one way is to stitch images from smaller areas, each with its own local AO correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, this procedure can be time-consuming and thus nonideal for in vivo functional studies. By scanning differently sized areas for wavefront sensing, we identified a trade-off between AO performance (i.e. resolution and signal enhancement) and effective area. We demonstrated that a single corrective wavefront acquired by scanning the guide star over a more extended area led to 3D cellular resolution imaging over a larger retinal volume, simplifying the procedure for future functional studies of neuronal populations in the retina. It is worth noting that, instead of incorporating scan lenses optimized for large scanning angles, our homebuilt 2PFM system utilized regular achromatic doublet lenses, which reduced cost but limited the overall imaging FOV of our microscope. The effective AO area and imaging FOV would be further increased by incorporating high-performance scan lenses.</p><p>To study retinal pathologies for physiological and clinical insights, it is ideal to conduct longitudinal investigations in vivo. As demonstrated recently with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2020a</xref>), direct visualization of RGCs provides more sensitive readout of RGC degeneration than in vivo retinal characterization techniques such as optical coherence tomography and pattern electroretinogram. SLO has been combined with calcium imaging to characterize the dynamic functional changes of RGCs in disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Although the current commercial availability of SLO systems can make them more easily adoptable than our homebuilt AO-2PFM, the visible excitation light utilized in SLO activates photoreceptors, requiring additional considerations in experimental designs. Without correcting the wavefront distortion introduced by the ocular tissue to both excitation and emission light, the resolution of SLO is limited to cellular level. In contrast, the NIR excitation light utilized in 2PFM minimizes photoreceptor activation; aberration correction by AO also enables subcellular resolution to be achieved in vivo.</p><p>Importantly, to probe microscopic early-stage pathologies, high spatial resolution is needed. In human applications, investigation of retinal vascular abnormalities are limited to capillary resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hormel et al., 2021</xref>). Sub-capillary morphology and dynamics of the mouse retina were recently observed by light-sheet microscopy, however with ex vivo preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prahst et al., 2020</xref>). To our knowledge, sub-capillary features had not been observed in the living mouse eye previously. In this work, applying AO-2PFM, we studied retinal vasculature in a pathological mouse model with proliferative vascular retinopathy at sub-capillary resolution in vivo. Recovering diffraction-limited resolution, AO enabled us to identify capillary lesions as capillary endothelium disruptions that were associated with dye leakage in two-photon fluorescence angiograms. Moreover, the repeatable and reliable AO performance allowed us to track the same retinal region over multiple days and image cell migration at subcellular resolution.</p><p>We also applied our AO-2PFM to in vivo activity imaging of RGCs in a mouse model of retinal degeneration. Due to the dimmer brightness of the fluorescence indicator in this model, AO was essential in increasing signal strength and enabling high-sensitivity interrogation of the effects of pharmacological manipulation on RGC hyperactivity. Traditionally, pharmacological effects on retina are studied by electrophysiological and imaging tools on ex vivo retinal preparation, or in vivo by indirect assessments downstream in the visual pathway or through behavior test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Telias et al., 2022</xref>). Taking retinal degeneration as an example, treatment-induced photosensitization enhancement has been mainly evaluated through electrophysiology or ex vivo imaging of dissected retinas. AO-2PFM enabled us to evaluate how pathological RGC hyperactivity was suppressed by an example pharmacological agent, lidocaine, at single cell level noninvasively. Together with the capability for longitudinal investigations discussed above, we envision that the AO-enabled high-sensitivity subcellular and cellular 2PFM imaging would become a highly enabling technology for pathological and pharmacological investigations of the mouse retina in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-YFP)16Jrs/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #003709</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.Cg-Tg(Ly6a-EGFP)G5Dzk/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #012643</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6;129S7-Vldlr<sup>tm1Her</sup>/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #002529</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C3H/HeJ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #000659</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J-Tg(Thy1-GCaMP6s)<break/>GP4.3Dkim/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #024275</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GraphPad Prism software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://graphpad.com">https://graphpad.com</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_015807">SCR_015807</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lidocaine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Phoenix</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NDC: 57319-533-05</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal use</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research.

Briefly, 920 nm output from a femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent, Chameleon Ultra II) was expanded (2×, Thorlabs, GBE02-B) after a Pockel Cell (ConOptics, 350–80-LA-02-BK). The beam was then scanned with a pair of optically conjugated (by L1-L2, FL = 85 mm; Edmund Optics, 49–359-INK) galvanometer mirrors (Cambridge Technology, 6215H). A pair of achromatic lenses (L3-L4, FL = 85 and 300 mm; Edmund Optics, 49–359-INK and 49–368-INK) relayed the galvos to the DM (Iris AO, PTT489). The focal plane position of two-photon excitation in the mouse retina was controlled by an electrically tunable lens (ETL; Optotune, EL-16–40-TC-VIS-5D-C), which was conjugated to the DM (by L5-L6, FL = 175 and 400 mm; Edmund Optics, 49–363-INK and Newport, PAC090). The ETL was then relayed to the pupil of the mouse eye by L7 (FL = 200 mm; Thorlabs, AC254-200-AB) and L8, which was composed of two identical lenses (FL = 50 mm; Thorlabs, AC254-050-AB). The two 50-mm-FL lenses in L8 were used together with a combined FL of 25 mm, and they were mounted with their curved surfaces facing and almost touching each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and D</xref> ) to minimize aberrations during large-angle scanning. For 2PFM imaging, the emitted fluorescence from the mouse retina was collected by the mouse eye, travelled through L8-L7 and the ETL, reflected by a dichroic mirror (D2; Semrock, Di02-R785−25×36), focused by a lens (L9, FL = 75 mm; Thorlabs, LB1309-A), and detected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT, Hamamatsu, H7422-40). For direct wavefront sensing, D2 was moved out of the light path and the emitted fluorescence was descanned by the galvo pair, reflected by a dichroic mirror (D1; Semrock, Di03-R785-t3-25×36), and relayed to a Shack-Hartmann (SH) sensor by a pair of lenses (L10-L11, FL = 60 and 175 mm; Edmund Optics, 47–638-INK and 47–644-INK). The SH sensor was composed of a lenslet array (Advanced Microoptic System GmbH, APH-Q-P500-R21.1) and a camera (Hamamatsu, Orca Flash 4.0) that was placed at the focal plane of the lenslet array. Wavefront aberrations were measured from the shifts of SH pattern foci, reconstructed with custom MATLAB code, and the corresponding corrective pattern was then applied to the DM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>System correction</title><p>Before imaging the mouse retina, system aberration caused by imperfect and/or misaligned optics was corrected. Due to the path difference between the two-photon illumination and the fluorescence wavefront sensing paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sulai and Dubra, 2014</xref>), system correction was performed with a modal-based optimization approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wahl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Booth, 2014</xref>). Specifically, with 0 mA applied to the ETL, we imaged a fluorescent lens tissue sample at the focal plane of L7 and applied 11 values (–0.1~0.1 µm rms at an increment of 0.02 µm) for each of the first 21 Zernike modes excluding piston, tip, tilt, and defocus. The optimal value for each Zernike mode was determined by maximizing the fluorescence intensity of the sample and it was applied to the DM before proceeding to the next Zernike mode. An SH pattern was obtained with system aberration corrected and was used as the SH reference for calculating sample-induced aberrations. All images taken with system correction were indicated in the main text as ‘No AO’.</p><p>To change the focal plane within the retina, we varied the electric current applied to the ETL. We characterized how system aberrations varied with the ETL current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We carried out system correction with 0 mA ETL current applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Additional aberrations introduced by setting ETL current to 20, 40, 60, and 80 mA were negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) compared with eye-induced aberrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and minimally affected in vivo imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also evaluated how system aberrations varied with the distance D between the mouse eye pupil and the imaging module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Using Zemax for ray tracing, we found its effect to be similarly minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Our typical in vivo retinal imaging was performed with 10~60 mA of ETL currents and 2~4 mm D values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Simulating the mouse eye as an ideal lens behind a 0-diopter contact lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) made of PMMA (1.49 refractive index) and 0.5-mm-thick eye gel (1.33 refractive index), we calculated the focal shifts and FOVs for different ETL currents using Zemax and found a linear focal shift with ETL current and relatively constant FOV during 3D imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

In vivo imaging was carried out on mice under isoflurane anesthesia (~1.0% by volume in O<sub>2</sub>). Prior to imaging, the mouse pupil was dilated with one drop of 2.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride (Paragon BioTeck, Inc) and one drop of 1% tropicamide (Akorn, Inc). A 0-diopter customized rigid contact lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, Advanced Vision Technologies) was placed on the eye, with eye gel (Genteal) applied in between the eye and the contact lens to prevent cornea drying and clouding. Excessive eye gel was removed by gently pressing the contact lens onto the mouse eyeball. One single application of eye gel was sufficient in keeping the cornea moist for a 2~4 hr imaging session. During imaging, mice were stabilized on a bite-bar on a 3D translational stage with two rotational degrees of freedom (Thorlabs, PR01) and the body temperature was maintained with a heating pad (Kent Scientific, RT-0515). The mouse head was carefully aligned to make the eye perpendicular to the illumination beam, minimizing off-axis aberrations and illumination clipping by the contact lens and mouse pupil. Fluorescent dyes were injected retro-orbitally into the non-imaged eye. In wild-type mice, 40–80 µL of 5% (w/v) 2 M-Da dextran-conjugated FITC was injected for vasculature visualization.

Because individual electrodes can detect spikes from multiple RGCs, we utilized principal component analysis to sort unique units (Offline Sorter v3, Plexon), which accepted units having interspike intervals &gt;1ms. Each unit was compiled into a raster plot. The analysis code for processing sorted spike data into rasters is available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kevjcao/Multielectrode-array">https://github.com/kevjcao/Multielectrode-array</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao, 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell attached recordings of alpha-RGCs in <italic>rd1</italic>-Thy1-GCaMP6s retinas</title><p>Isolated ex vivo rd1-Thy1-GCaMP6s retinas were mounted onto filter paper (0.45 mm nitrocellulose membranes, MF-Millipore) with an optical window with the ganglion cell layer facing up.

Oxygenated ACSF was then perfused over the retina at 34 °C for 30 minutes with a flowrate of 1 mL/min. An initial imaging session performed to account for potential two-photon sensitivity. Experimental imaging was performed with the laser power at the sample ≤5 mW. For pharmacological blockade of actional potentials, Lidocaine (2% in saline) was applied to the bath during corresponding recordings.

This is related to Figure 6B, RGC #3,4,6 didn't seem to have spontaneous activity (the fluctuation of the GCaMP signal looks like noise, not real activation). Better to clarify. And they are very different after the Lidocaine washout. Similarly, in Figure 6D, cells #3-6 didn't seem to have hyperactivity to start with.</p><p>8) Need to provide reference of the rd1-Thy1-GCaMP6s mouse line that how this line is generated and shows GCaMP6s is only expressed in RGCs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84853.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should either tone down the conclusion or provide further supporting evidence.

Our identification of synaptic structures was therefore indeed based on morphology alone. Similar morphology-based approaches have been commonly used in spine and bouton imaging. However, we agree with the reviewer that morphology alone is insufficient evidence for the presence of synapses (also see Ref [1] for a thoughtful review on the limitation of the morphology-only approach). Therefore, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have toned down the conclusion of our observation in the manuscript:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Abstract (line 20-21): “…, is essential for resolving putative synaptic structures and achieving …”.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results – Optimized AO-2PFM for in vivo mouse retinal imaging (line 123-124): “… enabled in vivo 2PFM visualization of varicosities resembling synaptic structures in the mouse retina …”.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Figure 1 caption: “White arrowheads: putative synaptic structures.”</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results – Strategy for enlarging the effective area of AO correction for 3D cellular resolution imaging (line 202-203): “… this approach succeeded in resolving varicosities …”.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Discussion (line 346): “… we demonstrated here the first in vivo visualization of putative retinal synaptic structures …”.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When describing the resolution of our imaging system, we have chosen to keep our original statement: “synaptic resolution” (line 66 and 204). This is because “synaptic resolution” describes the technical capability of our AO-2PFM in resolving “synapse-sized” features, which, with sub-micron lateral resolution, our system is clearly capable of resolving synapses in 2D.</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another example is the claim of microglia observed (Line 165) without presenting evidence or description.</p></disp-quote><p>The mouse line we imaged was VLDLR-KO/Sca1-GFP. Sca1-GFP (a.k.a., Ly6a-GFP) transgenic mice express EGFP in “all functional repopulating adult hematopoietic stem cells in the adult bone marrow, and several other hematopoietic cell types” (https://www.jax.org/strain/012643, and Ref [2]). Microglia have been genetically verified to possess a myeloid nature [3]. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that retinal microglia in the Sca1-GFP mice may express GFP. The morphology and dynamics of the cells are consistent with activated microglial cells (e.g., Refs [4,5]). However, given the lack of labeling specificity for microglia, we have revised the claims in our manuscript:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Abstract (line 22-23): we changed from “we characterized microvascular lesions and observed microglial migration in a proliferative vascular retinopathy model” to “we characterized microvascular lesions with sub-capillary details in a proliferative vascular retinopathy model”.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Introduction (line 71-73): “In our model of proliferative vascular retinopathy, AO enabled us to, for the first time, characterize retinal vascular lesions with sub-capillary details over multiple days and observe cell migration in vivo.”</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results – High-resolution in vivo identification of abnormal capillaries in a pathological mouse model (line 274-281): “Moreover, on the third day, we observed GFP-positive cells within the dye-stained retinal volume that were absent in previous two days (Figure 5G). The morphology of these cells resembled that of activated microglia [4,5]. We speculated that the leakage of EB triggered local immune response and recruited ocular immune cells to the impacted area. With the subcellular resolution provided by AO-2PFM, we were able to track dynamic changes in the processes of the same cell over time (Figure 5G, bottom).”</p></list-item><list-item><p>Discussion (line 410-411): “and image cell migration at subcellular resolution”.</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please discuss the recent publication (PMID: 32410964) on in vivo ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of RGC activities using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. It will be helpful to compare the work with the 2PFM presented in the current study and point out the pros and cons of both methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing our attention to this paper. We have further identified additional references using SLO for calcium imaging to include in Discussion (line 391-400):</p><p>“As demonstrated recently with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy<sup>68</sup> (SLO), direct visualization of RGCs provides more sensitive readout of RGC degeneration than in vivo retinal characterization techniques such as optical coherence tomography and pattern electroretinogram. SLO has been combined with calcium imaging to characterize the dynamic functional changes of RGCs in disease models<sup>69-71</sup>. Although the current commercial availability of SLO systems can make them more easily adoptable than our homebuilt AO-2PFM, the visible excitation light utilized in SLO activates photoreceptors, requiring additional considerations in experimental designs. Without correcting the wavefront distortion introduced by the ocular tissue to both excitation and emission light, the resolution of SLO is limited to cellular level. In contrast, the NIR excitation light utilized in 2PFM minimizes photoreceptor activation; aberration correction by AO also enables subcellular resolution to be achieved in vivo.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by beautiful images and convincing data analysis, but some aspects of image presentation and additional data analysis may be needed to strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>1) Figure 1C: The AO image of RGC axons is clearly much improved, but more explanation is needed on how to define &quot;synaptic structures&quot; other than just enriched GFP signal along the axon shaft.</p><p>And also the dotted blue line &quot;No AO (self-normed)&quot; need to be defined and explained in the figure legend or text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that in the Thy1-GFP line M mice we imaged, retinal synaptic structures were not specifically labeled. Reviewer 1 raised the same concern. We have revised the manuscript as detailed in our response to Reviewer 1.</p><p>The “self-normed” was equivalent to artificially enhance the No AO profile so that its maximum is of the same value as the AO profile, in order to emphasize the much lower contrast of No AO images. However, the lack of contrast was evident from the original trace (solid blue line) and the inclusion of the self-normalized trace does not add much new info. Therefore, we now deleted this trace from Figure 1C (and Figure 2E) to avoid possible confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3E, the middle column of IPL images: Line 185 &quot;subcellular processes could not be visualized without aberration correction (e.g., processes in the inner plexiform layer, Figure 3E, middle column).&quot;, it seems even with AO, the subcellular process is also hard to recognize. If not, can you mark the processes in this figure?</p></disp-quote><p>Structures in the Thy1-YFP-16 mouse retina are densely labeled (Table 1 of Ref [8]), which makes it difficult to see subcellular processes. In Figure 3—figure supplement 1 we show some images (single sections or MIPs of thin stacks) with sub-cellular structures. It is evident from these images that visualization of subcellular structures was substantially improved by AO, as also indicated by the signal profiles across these features.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have highlighted the subcellular process of one neuron in Figure 3E with a zoomed-in view.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4C: needs quantification in addition to representative image presentation.

Similarly, in Figure 5C inset as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and we have marked the exact sites (the ring-like structure) with yellow asterisks (Figure 5A and C) more clearly.</p><p>We also updated the main text to describe these disruptions more clearly (line 250-254):</p><p>“Interestingly, in the VLDLR-KO/Sca1-GFP retina, images acquired with AO revealed a disruption in the capillary endothelium labeled by GFP, where the endothelial cells lined the walls of a short capillary branch but not its end face, leading to a ring-like structure (Figure 5A and C, yellow asterisks, insets i-ii; Video 3). Such ring-like structures were not observed in the WT/Sca1-GFP retina (Figure 5B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5D/E: using FITC, the same color as Sca1-GFP, is not helpful to determine leakage or increased background in general.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to use FITC in the first experiment because earlier literatures reported vascular leakage of FITC in the retina of the same mouse line (e.g., Ref [9]). Thus we included the images in Figure 5D and E to show agreement with earlier results.

This is related to Figure 6B, RGC #3,4,6 didn't seem to have spontaneous activity (the fluctuation of the GCaMP signal looks like noise, not real activation). Better to clarify. And they are very different after the Lidocaine washout. Similarly, in Figure 6D, cells #3-6 didn't seem to have hyperactivity to start with.</p></disp-quote><p>All the recorded activity in Figure 6 was spontaneous. We did not use a cutoff for identifying spontaneous RGC activity.</p><p>The reviewer’s comments may arise from the concern that, unlike the example neuron in the original Figure 6A, the fluorescence traces of RGC #3,4,6 in Figure 6B and RGC #3-6 in Figure 6D do not show transient ∆F/F fluctuations that are typically associated from temporally varying firing rate. In ex vivo simultaneous cell-attached and 2PFM recordings, we did see hyperactive RGCs that have much “smoother” traces associated with very high firing rates. We now include examples for both types of activity patterns in the revised Figure 6A. We added to the main text (line 316-318):</p><p>“A temporally varying firing rate led to transient fluctuations in its calcium signal (ROI 1, Figure 6A) whereas a sustained high firing rate led to heightened fluorescence brightness without obvious transients (ROI 2, Figure 6A).”</p><p>RGC #3,4,6 in Figure 6B and RGC #3-6 in Figure 6D have similar characteristics to ROI2 above. Their being hyperactive was determined by the decrease of their calcium signal magnitude upon Lidocaine administration.</p><p>Regarding the differences before Lidocaine and after recovery, we speculate that for ex vivo preparation (Figure 6B), the washout of Lidocaine was incomplete. For in vivo recording (Figure 6D), washout was not realistic, thus we simply recorded 30 and 60 minutes after Lidocaine injection, which likely caused only partial recovery of hyperactivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Need to provide reference of the rd1-Thy1-GCaMP6s mouse line that how this line is generated and shows GCaMP6s is only expressed in RGCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included how this line was generated in our manuscript (Materials and methods – in vivo imaging, line 483-485):</p><p>“The <italic>rd1</italic>-Thy1-GCaMP6s mice were generated by crossing <italic>rd1</italic> (C3H/HeJ, the Jackson laboratory) with Thy1-GCaMP6s (C57BL/6J-Tg(Thy1-GCaMP6s)GP4.3Dkim/J, the Jackson laboratory).”</p><p>The Thy1 promoter shows selective expression in the ganglion cell layer of the retina [10,11].
