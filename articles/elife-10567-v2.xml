They were hypothesized to originate from embryonic progenitor cells that acquire long-term self-renewal ability and multipotency at the end of organogenesis. The process through which this is achieved often remains unclear. Here, we discovered that long-term hair follicle stem cells arise from embryonic progenitor cells occupying a niche location that is defined by attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Hair follicle initiation is marked by placode formation, which depends on the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Soon afterwards, a region with attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling emerges in the upper follicle. Embryonic progenitor cells residing in this region gain expression of adult stem cell markers and become definitive long-term hair follicle stem cells at the end of organogenesis. Attenuation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a prerequisite for hair follicle stem cell specification because it suppresses Sox9, which is required for stem cell formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10567.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10567.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10567.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many tissues and organs in an adult’s body – including bone marrow, skin and intestines – contain a small number of cells called adult stem cells. These cells usually stay dormant within these tissues (at a site called a ‘niche’) until they are required to repair damaged or lost cells. At this point, adult stem cells can specialize, or ‘differentiate’, into the many different cell types that make up the tissue or organ where they reside.</p> <p>The cells that produce hairs are an example of adult stem cells. In mammals, hairs grow from structures called hair follicles that are found in the skin, and over the life of an animal, old hairs are shed and replaced. Previous research had suggested that certain embryonic cells are set to become hair follicle stem cells before the hair follicles emerge in the adult tissue. However it remained unclear how this decision is made, and which genes and molecules are involved in this process.</p> <p>Xu et al. have now found that, in mice, the fate of hair follicle stem cells is decided at an early stage in development, when the hair follicle is a simpler structure called a ‘hair peg’. Cells near the upper part of the hair peg tend to become dormant and adopt an adult stem cell fate, while the ones in the lower part are more likely to differentiate straight away. This shows that the position, hence the niche environment, plays a key role in determining these different cells’ fates.</p> <p>Xu et al. went on to discover that the decision for a cell to become a hair follicle stem cell relies on reduced signaling through the so-called Wnt signal pathway. Understanding how adult stem cells become established during development may help future efforts to grow tissues and organs in the laboratory for research purposes or organ transplantation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10567.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10567.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>hair follicle</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>niche</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>self-renewnal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB518700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Zijian</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Wenjie</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Kaiju</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Zhou</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Huagnwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Fengchao</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014CB849602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Zijian</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Wenjie</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Kaiju</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Zhou</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Huagnwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Fengchao</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Long-term hair follicle stem cells arise by embryonic progenitor cells occupying a niche location that is defined by attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Long-term adult stem cells (SCs) are defined by their ability to continuously generate all downstream differentiated cell lineages as well as regenerate themselves throughout the lifetime of an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuchs and Chen, 2013</xref>). Although rudimentary tissue progenitor cells in embryos give rise to all cells in adult tissue, these cells are not SCs, because they are destined to change identity as development proceeds. It has been postulated that definitive tissue SCs originate from tissue embryonic progenitor cells that acquire the capacity for long-term self-renewal and multipotency at the end of organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Slack, 2008</xref>). However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of these processes remain unknown. Deciphering the process leading to localized SC emergence during normal embryonic development will likely reveal principles that can be used to acquire and maintain the long-term self-renewal and regenerative potentials that are prerequisites for SC-based therapies.</p><p>Adult SCs in hair follicles (HFs) are located at the so-called ‘outer bulge region’. The bulge region constitutes the bottom of the permanent portion of a HF. It contains two layers of epithelial cells: the CD34- inner layer niche cells and the CD34+ outer layer stem cells. Although HFs begin to develop in the embryo, the bulge structure is only formed when HFs enter the first postnatal telogen (resting phase); this delineates the end of organogenesis and the emergence of the adult SC niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paus et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tumbar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanpain et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Initiation of HF organogenesis is marked by placode emergence. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in basal epithelial cells by locally expressed Wnt ligands is both necessary and sufficient to induce placode formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Genderen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huelsken et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jamora et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Millar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reddy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu and Hsu, 2013</xref>). Concomitant with Wnt ligand production, placode epithelial cells also express the Wnt inhibitor Dkk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzi et al., 2007</xref>). The combination of the short-range activator Wnt and the long-range inhibitor DKK function in a reaction-diffusion mechanism to suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cells surrounding existing placodes, thereby regulating HF spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sick et al., 2006</xref>). Contrary to the required activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, inhibition of BMP signaling through the dermal BMP inhibitor Noggin is necessary for placode morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jamora et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Botchkarev et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kobielak et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>After placode formation, signaling events downstream of Wnts/BMPs drive HF to further develop into the hair germ and then the hair peg. Shh is expressed by placode epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oro et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgan et al., 1998</xref>). In the absence of Shh, dermal condensate fails to aggregate and HF development arrests at the placode stage instead of developing into the hair germ. This implicates Shh in establishing proper epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oro and Higgins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levy et al., 2007</xref>). Guard hairs, as the first HFs to appear in the embryonic backskin, are uniquely dependent on Eda/EdaR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laurikkala et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mustonen et al., 2004</xref>). Eda, which is itself a Wnt signaling target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laurikkala et al., 2001</xref>), can induce the expression of BMP inhibitors and <italic>Shh</italic> in guard hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pummila et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Placode progenitor cells generate all cells in adult HFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levy et al., 2007</xref>). Some of their progeny cease further development at a particular point and become definitive adult HFSCs. Previous studies using label-retaining methods demonstrated that putative HFSCs are present in postnatal developing HFs as slow cycling cells, and it was shown that their specification requires the transcription factor Sox9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nowak et al., 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, placode cells already express adult HFSC markers such as Lhx2 and Sox9, although in a largely non-overlapping pattern. Another HFSC marker, Nfatc1, appears in the subsequent hair peg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rhee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horsley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vidal et al., 2005</xref>). These dynamic expression patterns suggest that cells in the placode and hair peg are heterogeneous. However, whether or not HFSC fate is already pre-determined at these early developmental stages is not clear. Other critical unanswered questions include the following: Are adult HFSCs remnant of embryonic progenitor cells that maintain their embryonic developmental potential, or do they, alternatively, come from progenitor cells that gain long-term potential? What are the underlying mechanisms? What determines the niche location and where do HFSCs become localized? The current study addresses these key questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The embryonic cellular origin of adult hair follicle stem cells</title><p>To uncover the cellular origin of HFSCs and to identify the time point of their specification, it will first be necessary to perform lineage-tracing experiments.

Using <italic>Nfatc1-CreER::Rosa-stop-mTmG</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tian et al., 2014</xref>), we found that <italic>Nfatc1</italic>-expressing cells first appear at the upper hair peg and remain relatively dormant there, without actively contributing to HF down growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Then, at the end of organogenesis, <italic>Nfatc1</italic>-expressing hair peg cells become the sebaceous gland above bulge and most of the HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A second HFSC marker, Lgr5, follows a similar pattern, albeit with different cell fate preferences. Using <italic>Lgr5-GFP-CreER::Rosa-stop-tdTomato</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaks et al., 2008</xref>), we found that <italic>Lgr5</italic>-expressing cells appear first in the middle portion of the hair peg. They eventually become HFSCs in the lower bulge and secondary hair germ cells below the bulge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The labeling efficiencies of the CreER lines used here were very high; almost all the HFs in the chosen region targeted for quantifications were labeled, and we did not detect any leaky induction in the absence of Tamoxifen injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D-G</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest that HFSCs originate from progenitor cells in hair peg that lose <italic>Shh</italic> expression but gain the expression of adult stem cell markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The hair peg SC precursors are distinguished from the broader placode and hair germ cells in that they stop further development once they are specified. During subsequent HF down growth, these cells remain dormant in their original position until the end of organogenesis. At that point, they incorporate into the outer layer of the bulge and become HFSCs. This leads to an interesting question: is the reason these cells gain expression of stem cell markers and become dormant due to signals that they receive at the specific upper follicle position?</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Embryonic niche induces hair follicle stem cell fate</title><p>We used a two-photon laser to precisely ablate SC precursors in hair peg labeled by <italic>Nfatc1-CreER::Rosa-stop-tdTomato::K14H2BGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

Ablation of epithelial <italic>Sox9</italic> completely blocks HFSC specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nowak et al., 2008</xref>). To determine if the canonical Wnt signal suppresses Sox9 expression in HFs, first we observed that in normal developing HFs, Sox9 expressing cells and Wnt/β-catenin signal responsive cells are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Second, soon after activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in <italic>Nfatc1+</italic> cells, we observed small protrusions from HFs that were positive for nuclear β-catenin. Sox9 expression in these small protrusions was completely absent, while cells immediately next to these protrusions express Sox9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Lastly, in the Wnt/β-catenin loss of function mutant (<italic>K14-rtTA::teto-Cre::Ctnnb1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perl et al., 2002</xref>), HF development is defective but Sox9 expression is expanded to the extent that all remaining cells in HFs express Sox9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H-J</xref>). These results suggest that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling suppresses Sox9 expression in HFs. Given that the loss of Sox9 expression completely blocks HFSC specification, the requirement for attenuation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a prerequisite for HFSC specification is related to enabling Sox9 expression.

In the first growth phase (anagen) following the first telogen, these HFSCs contributed to both outer root sheath (ORS) cells and to matrix differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Of note, after two full hair cycles, in the third telogen, <italic>Axin2+</italic> hair peg cell formed HFSCs have been mostly exhausted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). On the contrary, <italic>Sox9</italic>+ hair peg precursor cells were the origin of most of the HFSCs at the first telogen. During the first anagen, these HFSCs contributed preferentially to ORS rather than to the differentiated lineages in the matrix. Instead of decreasing, HFSCs originated from <italic>Sox9</italic>+ hair peg cells persisted and expanded after one round of hair cycle to become essentially all of the HFSCs in the bulge and most of the secondary hair germ cells below the bulge. For the second anagen, the labeled HFSCs generate all of the downstream lineages including, ORS, matrix, and hair shaft cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that embryonic Wnt/β-catenin signaling diminishes the long-term potential of HFSCs. We have shown that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for terminal differentiation of the hair shaft. Also it suppresses Sox9 expression, which is important for HFSC maintenance through inhibition of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadaja et al., 2014</xref>). So it is possible that embryonic exposure to Wnt/β-catenin signaling primes the embryonic cells for differentiation via both positive induction and lack of Sox9 expression. This ultimately results in diminished long-term potential of the HFSCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Hierarchical events leading to long-term hair follicle stem cell emergence</title><p>Our study elucidates the cascade of events that lead to long-term SC emergence in HFs during organogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for HF initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito et al., 2007</xref>). Early placode cells are Wnt/β-catenin signal responsive cells, and they generate all of the cells in adult HFs. At the hair peg stage, a localized Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone emerges in upper HF. Progenitor cells residing in this embryonic niche position stop further development and become HFSCs at the end of organogenesis. These established HFSC precursor cells are not just remnants of embryonic progenitor cells, because they gain the expression of adult HFSC markers including <italic>Nfatc1</italic>. Embryonic cells residing in this Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone, together with a few other cells located below them that have active Wnt/β-catenin signaling, give rise to the adult HFSC pool. However, only the HFSCs derived from Wnt/β-catenin signaling negative precursor cells have long-term self-renewal ability and can continuously support regeneration. The small portion of HFSCs that are derived from embryonic cells with active Wnt/β-catenin signaling are highly prone to differentiation as the hair cycle progresses and are soon exhausted after regeneration. So, in embryos, the attenuation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling not only defines the adult niche position and HFSC fate, but also has a long lasting effect on the subsequent fate choice and long-term potential of cells in adults.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10567.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model illustrating that long-term hair follicle stem cell emergence results from progenitors occupying an embryonic niche location, which is defined by the absence of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that would otherwise block the expression of a key factor required for stem cell specification.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10567.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10567.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-10567-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>It’s noteworthy that we observed largely none overlapping labeling patterns of Lgr5+ and Axin2+ cells in hair peg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Also, Lgr5+ hair peg cells contributed HFSCs persist after multiple hair cycles instead of completely diminishing like Axin2+ cells contributed HFSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate it is possible that in hair follicle Lgr5 expression either reflects very low level of Wnt signaling, or it is induced by a different set of Wnt ligands than those induce Axin2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Restricted induction and maintenance of SC gene expression</title><p>Although we were able to pinpoint the main mechanism through which Wnt/β-catenin signaling blocks long-term HFSC formation, i.e. the suppression of <italic>Sox9</italic> expression, we suspect that this might not be the only mechanism involved in this process. It has been reported previously that <italic>Sox9</italic> expression is induced by Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vidal et al., 2005</xref>). Given that we observed extended activity of Shh signaling throughout follicle epithelial cells and observed only localized activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in lower follicle cells, we can explain the mutually exclusive pattern of <italic>Sox9+</italic> and Wnt/β-catenin signaling responsive cells. As development proceeds, the Sox9 expression pattern continues to expand and become wider than the actual future bulge region; for example, Sox9 is expressed in most of the ORS cells. So, following the emergence of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone in the hair peg, there are probably other mechanisms that help maintain the restricted niche position. One observation further supporting this hypothesis is that, once initiated in hair peg, the expression of <italic>Nfatc1</italic> is restricted to the upper HF where the future sebaceous gland and bulge will be; <italic>Nfatc1</italic> expression does not expand to the broader ORS like <italic>Sox9</italic> expression does. Nfatc1 was reported to be a target of BMP signaling in adult HFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horsley et al., 2008</xref>). However, we did not observe active BMP signaling at the hair peg niche location using a BMP reporter, a result similar to a published staining pattern of pSMAD1/5 in developing HFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kandyba et al., 2014</xref>). So, it remains to be determined which, if any, other mechanisms lead to the maintenance of a more restricted niche region that is reflected by the localized expression of stem cell markers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanism leading to the emergence of a localized Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone in the hair peg</title><p>Since attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling defines the niche location and long-term HFSC fate, the process of exactly how the Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone emerges is of great interest. We observed increased expression of Wnt inhibitors such as <italic>SFRP</italic>s in <italic>Nfatc1+</italic> hair peg cells as compared to <italic>Shh+</italic> hair peg cells. However, given that HFSC precursor cells can be replaced by embryonic cells occupying the same hair peg niche position, it is unlikely that Wnt inhibitors expressed by the precursor cells themselves are the main causes of attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in that position. Our RNA seq analysis revealed enrichment of <italic>Wnt</italic> and <italic>Dkk</italic> expression in Wnt/β-catenin signal positive <italic>Shh+</italic> hair peg cells as compared to <italic>Nfatc1+</italic> hair peg cells. We hypothesize that the combination of the lack of Wnt ligands, which are short-range signal molecules, and the presence of Wnt inhibitors such as DKK4, which are long-range signal molecules, at the embryonic niche location is the main reason contributes to the emergence of a Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone in upper hair peg. A similar model has been used to explain HF density determination and epidermal SC regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2013</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), and two reviewers.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>In this elegant and interesting study, Xu and colleagues ask a very important question, how are long term organ stem cells specified during development? Is hair follicle stem cell fate pre-determined at the early hair follicle developmental stages? Or, are they specified to be long term organ stem cells at different stages of development? They used multiple transgenic mice to trace cell lineage and found that Shh-expressing cells contribute to most of the HFSC, <italic>Nfatc1</italic>-expressing cells contribute to SG and upper bulge cells, and Lgr5-expressing cells contribute to lower bulge and SHG cells. By undertaking RNA-seq and using other transgenic lines, they also identified and demonstrated the attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for HFSC specification.</p> <p>The reviewers noted that this is a beautifully executed and extremely interesting paper that makes an important contribution to our understanding of adult stem cell development in the hair follicle, and likely has implications for understanding how adult stem cells are established in other biological systems as well. Therefore, the paper will be of interest to stem cell biologists in all fields. They raised a few major points, mostly around interpretation of the data presented and the need for some more caution in some of the conclusions drawn. It was felt that these concerns could probably be addressed without any further major experimentation.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) The authors show that laser ablation of <italic>Nfatc1-CreER</italic>-labeled cells in embryogenesis did not prevent formation of a new bulge from unlabeled cells; the authors interpret this result as meaning that the bulge can be formed from <italic>Nfatc1</italic>-negative cells. However, in the absence of data showing that 100% of <italic>Nfatc1</italic>-expressing cells are labeled in <italic>Nfatc1-CreER</italic> mice following a single injection of tamoxifen, this conclusion should include a caveat regarding labeling efficiency.</p> <p>And related to this point, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors mention that <italic>Nfatc1</italic>-expressing progenitor cells become SG cells and upper bulge cells. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the authors claim that the formed HFSCs are negative for <italic>Nfatc1</italic> at P23 after <italic>Nfatc1</italic> ablation at P1, indicating they came from hair peg cells that used to be <italic>Nfatc1</italic> negative. But the formed SG cells are <italic>Nfatc1</italic> positive in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> but negative in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, which is inconsistent. If <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> is correct, where do these cells come from?</p> <p>2) To understand the mechanisms underlying the different developmental potential of Shh-expressing and <italic>Nfatc1</italic>-expressing cells, the authors carried out transcriptional profiling on these two populations, and identified Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a pathway enriched in Shh-expressing and downregulated in <italic>Nfatc1</italic>-expressing cells. Lineage tracing with <italic>Axin2-CreER</italic> mice confirmed that while <italic>Axin2</italic>-expressing cells labeled at the hair placode stage can give rise to HFSCs, induction of Cre activity at the hair peg stage resulted in labeling of only a small percentage of HFSCs. The authors conclude that Wnt signaling attenuates the ability of cells to become HFSCs. In support of this, they demonstrate loss of HFSC markers in hair follicles following mutation of epithelial β-catenin to a constitutively active form. Conversely, deletion of epithelial β-catenin in late embryonic life causes expanded expression of the HFSC marker Sox9. While these data are consistent with the authors' hypothesis, it also remains possible that a minority of <italic>Axin2</italic>-positive (Wnt-responsive) cells, located in the upper follicle at the peg stage, does in fact contribute to HFSC rather than differentiating HF populations, and is distinguished from differentiating cells by lower levels and/or a different context of Wnt signaling. As it isn't clear that Lgr5+ and <italic>Axin2+</italic> cells represent identical (rather than overlapping) populations, this alternate hypothesis could be tested by determining whether <italic>Axin2</italic>-lineage traced cells in the bulge compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) are maintained and/or expand, or conversely disappear, through successive cycles of hair growth.</p> <p>3) The authors should consider further whether the conclusion at the end of the second paragraph of the subsection “Attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signal uniquely associates with embryonic niche “is correct or not. From placode to peg stage, a lot of proliferation, differentiation and other cellular events are involved. Is true that a specific group of cells can maintain active Wnt/β-catenin and then loss HFSC forming potential?</p> <p>The authors should consider whether Wnt signaling is a cause or a consequence of the differentiation process and modify their conclusions accordingly.</p> <p>4) By using Shh, <italic>Nfatc1</italic> and <italic>Lgr5-Cre</italic> lines to undertake lineage tracing from early development to the end of morphogenesis, the authors claim that HFSCs are specified at the hair peg stage.

We agree with the concerns and would like to first explain the experiment more fully. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: the lineage tracing experiments used the dorsal middle 1/3 section of the tail whole mount for quantification (as explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Although hair follicles in this chosen region all follow the developmental pattern we described, we did observe slight variation in labeling efficiency after one Tamoxifen injection (please see added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Specifically, hair follicles along the anterior-posterior midline of dorsal tail skin had the highest labeling efficiency compared to hair follicles on the sides. For this reason, we only conducted the ablation experiment in hair follicles along this midline in the chosen region. To illustrate our point please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>: control hair follicles surrounding the ablated hair follicles have almost all of their bulge cells labeled after just one Tamoxifen injection at E17.5. But as the reviewers pointed out, even in this situation, we still cannot prove that we labeled and then ablated all of the cells that were <italic>Nfatc1</italic> positive. Therefore, we have modified our conclusions accordingly based on the reviewers’ suggestions. Relevant labeling is also changed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</p> <p><italic>And related to this point, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors mention that Nfatc1-expressing progenitor cells become SG cells and upper bulge cells. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the authors claim that the formed HFSCs are negative for Nfatc1 at P23 after Nfatc1 ablation at P1, indicating they came from hair peg cells that used to be Nfatc1 negative. But the formed SG cells are Nfatc1 positive in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> but negative in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, which is inconsistent. If <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> is correct, where do these cells come from?</italic></p> <p>In Figure.2C, the labeled SG cells resulted from incomplete ablation of the <italic>Nfatc1-CreER</italic> labeled cells at the hair peg stage. Even though we did aim to specifically ablate all RFP positive cells in hair pegs, in a very few cases, we failed to fully achieve this. This was revealed by remnant RFP positive cells upon later observation. However, in the majority of our repeat experiments, we did successfully ablate all <italic>Nfatc1-CreER</italic> labeled hair peg cells, which resulted in neither SG nor bulges being labeled at later time points (as indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, H</xref>). We have changed the representative images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> to more accurately reflect the results of the majority of the ablation experiments.</p> <p><italic>2) To understand the mechanisms underlying the different developmental potential of Shh-expressing and Nfatc1-expressing cells, the authors carried out transcriptional profiling on these two populations, and identified Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a pathway enriched in Shh-expressing and downregulated in Nfatc1-expressing cells. Lineage tracing with Axin2-CreER mice confirmed that while Axin2-expressing cells labeled at the hair placode stage can give rise to HFSCs, induction of Cre activity at the hair peg stage resulted in labeling of only a small percentage of HFSCs. The authors conclude that Wnt signaling attenuates the ability of cells to become HFSCs. In support of this, they demonstrate loss of HFSC markers in hair follicles following mutation of epithelial β-catenin to a constitutively active form. Conversely, deletion of epithelial β-catenin in late embryonic life causes expanded expression of the HFSC marker Sox9. While these data are consistent with the authors' hypothesis, it also remains possible that a minority of Axin2-positive (Wnt-responsive) cells, located in the upper follicle at the peg stage, does in fact contribute to HFSC rather than differentiating HF populations, and is distinguished from differentiating cells by lower levels and/or a different context of Wnt signaling. As it isn't clear that Lgr5+ and Axin2+ cells represent identical (rather than overlapping) populations, this alternate hypothesis could be tested by determining whether Axin2-lineage traced cells in the bulge compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) are maintained and/or expand, or conversely disappear, through successive cycles of hair growth.</italic></p> <p>We agree with the reviewers’ point. We are also interested in finding out the fate of the <italic>Axin2</italic> positive cells located in the upper follicle that ended up in the bulge: are they long-term stem cells or not? Since it is not clear that Lgr5+ and <italic>Axin2+</italic> cell are the same, we followed the fate of <italic>Axin2+</italic> cells in long term lineage tracing experiments (please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). After injecting Tamoxifen once at E17.5 to label <italic>Axin2+</italic> hair peg cells, we got consistent labeling efficiency of the first telogen bulge (~15%). However, following just two rounds of successive hair cycles, most of the <italic>Axin2+</italic> cells contributed bulge stem cells disappeared (please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). This indicates that although a few Wnt signaling responsive cells in the hair peg participate in bulge formation, they are not long-term stem cells and tend to exhaust after participating in downstream proliferation and differentiation. These results suggest that embryonic exposure to Wnt/β-catenin signaling diminishes the long-term potential of adult HFSCs.</p> <p><italic>3) The authors should consider further whether the conclusion at the end of the second paragraph of the subsection “Attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signal uniquely associates with embryonic niche “is correct or not.

Therefore, we have modified the conclusions according to the reviewers’ suggestions.</p> <p>Although we don’t have direct evidence to distinguish whether Wnt signaling is a cause or a consequence of the differentiation process, in our K14rtTA,tetoCre,β-catenin cKO animals, hair coat formation was aborted (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I,J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This indicates at least that epithelium Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for terminal differentiation and hair formation. That being said, we do appreciate the reviewers’ suggestions that we should consider further and be more cautious when drawing conclusions. We have modified multiple statements in the paper to reflect this suggestion.</p> <p><italic>4) By using Shh, Nfatc1 and Lgr5-Cre lines to undertake lineage tracing from early development to the end of morphogenesis, the authors claim that HFSCs are specified at the hair peg stage.

It is more appropriate to conclude that HFSCs are derived from those progenitor cells. We have changed the corresponding conclusions based on this suggestion as well as multiple relevant statements in the paper.</p></body> </sub-article></article>
