Phenological shifts are one strategy, as species move their activity or life-history events in time to avoid extreme conditions. Species may also shift in space, moving their ranges poleward to escape extremes. However, whether species are more likely to exhibit one or both strategies, and whether this can be predicted based on a species’ functional traits, is unknown. Using a powerful macroecological dataset of European and North American odonate observations, we assessed range and phenology shifts between two time periods (1980–2002 and 2008–2018) to measure the strength and direction of the association between responses. Species with the greatest poleward range shifts also showed the largest phenological shifts toward earlier annual activity periods, with half of all species shifting in both space and time. This response was consistent across continents, despite highly divergent land use and biogeographical histories in these regions. Surprisingly, species’ range and phenology shifts were not related to functional traits; rather, southern species shifted their range limits more strongly, while increasing temperature variability hindered range shifts. By reducing risk through phenological shifts, the resulting larger populations may be more likely to disperse and expand species’ ranges. Species shifting in both space and time may be more resilient to extreme conditions, although further work integrating abundance data is needed. We also identified a small number of species (approximately 10%) that failed to shift at all; these species are likely to be particularly vulnerable to climate change and should be prioritized for conservation intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Odonata</kwd><kwd>dragonflies</kwd><kwd>range shifts</kwd><kwd>phenology</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>cross-continental</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h531d29</institution-id><institution>Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant and Discovery Accelerator Supplement</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kerr</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h531d29</institution-id><institution>Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sirois-Delisle</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03c4mmv16</institution-id><institution>University of Ottawa</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University Research Chair in Macroecology &amp; Conservation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kerr</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Across continents, half of odonate species shifted both ranges and phenologies in response to climate warming, with southern species and those experiencing less temperature variability shifting ranges more strongly.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Climate change alters climatic means and increases the frequency of extreme weather events, exposing species to conditions outside of their tolerances and often leading to population declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goulson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">IPCC, 2021</xref>). Species may avoid extreme conditions by dispersing to new areas where conditions pose fewer weather-related challenges, often leading to poleward range expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lawlor et al., 2024</xref>). Species’ biological timing could also shift, through adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, with earlier warming advancing the timing of early-season activities and life-history events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hällfors et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Novella-Fernandez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parmesan and Yohe, 2003</xref>). Both species’ geographical ranges and seasonal timing depend strongly on climate and habitat conditions, with shifts in space and time permitting species to remain within the limits of their ecological niches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engelhardt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grewe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Menzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parmesan and Yohe, 2003</xref>).

Greater phenological plasticity under warmer spring temperatures may increase reproductive success, leading to greater population growth and range expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Macgregor et al., 2019</xref>), as positive or stable trends in species abundance and habitat availability are essential for range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mair et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Platts et al., 2019</xref>). However, there could also be a tradeoff between phenological and geographical shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hassall, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Socolar et al., 2017</xref>). Species with greater dispersal abilities may have less need for phenological shifts as they track their climatic niche through space, while weaker dispersers may be confronted with greater selective pressure to shift phenology within their range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hassall, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Socolar et al., 2017</xref>). Since range shifts can also result from extirpations at species’ trailing range edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Parmesan et al., 1999</xref>), greater phenological shifts may mitigate the need for range shifts, as species better tolerate new climatic conditions. Cross-continental studies report converging effects of climate change on species’ range shifts and abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Neate-Clegg et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stephens et al., 2016</xref>), including among insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kerr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Neate-Clegg et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pinkert et al., 2022</xref>), but potential relationships between phenological and geographic responses have not yet been investigated at continental scales. Functional traits, such as dispersal, may determine species’ spatial and temporal responses to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kharouba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schuetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zografou et al., 2021</xref>). However, these relationships are inconsistent across taxa and regions, and cross-continental tests have not been attempted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckley and Kingsolver, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Estrada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">MacLean and Beissinger, 2017</xref>). Geographic locations and environmental characteristics of species’ ranges may also predict range shifts, as animal species with high latitude ranges have been shown to exhibit smaller range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">MacLean and Beissinger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pinkert et al., 2022</xref>), while increasing local temperature and loss of natural land cover may drive range retractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pacifici et al., 2020</xref>). However, exposure to extreme climate events (e.g. drought, heat waves, or storms) within species ranges may disrupt species’ dispersal abilities and capacities to tolerate new conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kerr, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Román-Palacios and Wiens, 2020</xref>). Exposure to thermal anomalies can rapidly change entire communities and create shifts toward new ecosystems, sometimes leading to local declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Day et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Harris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Román-Palacios and Wiens, 2020</xref>).</p><p>While global change research on insects often emphasizes butterfly and bee taxa, recently assembled databases of odonate observations provide a rare opportunity to investigate species’ spatiotemporal responses at larger taxonomic and spatial scales, particularly as most work has been done at national scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Córdoba-Aguilar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kalkman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sandall et al., 2022</xref>). Due to their use of aquatic and terrestrial habitat across life different stages, dragonflies and damselflies are also considered indicator species for both terrestrial and aquatic insect responses to changing climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hassall, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pinkert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Šigutová et al., 2025</xref>), giving the study of these species broad relevance for conservation. There is some evidence that functional traits relate to odonates’ interspecific variation in range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grewe et al., 2013</xref>), phenology shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diamond et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutiérrez and Wilson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zografou et al., 2021</xref>), extinction risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rocha-Ortega et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Suhonen et al., 2022</xref>), and rates of decline and expansion within limited geographic scopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Powney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rapacciuolo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rocha-Ortega et al., 2020</xref>). While relationships between morphological traits and range boundaries have been shown for some groups (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rundle et al., 2007</xref>), these may depend on species’ geographic context. For example, differences in habitat connectivity and dispersal ability may constrain range shifts for lentic species (those species that breed in slow-moving water like lakes or ponds) and lotic species (those living in fast-moving water) in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kalkman et al., 2018</xref>). More southerly lentic species may expand their range boundaries more than lotic species, as species accustomed to ephemeral lentic habitats are better dispersers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grewe et al., 2013</xref>), yet lotic species have also been found to expand their ranges more often than lentic species, potentially due to the loss of lentic habitat in some areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowler et al., 2021</xref>). While warm-adapted species with more equatorial distributions could expand their ranges poleward following warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devictor et al., 2008</xref>), they could also increase in abundance in this new range area relative to species that historically occupied those areas and are less heat-tolerant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Powney et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we tested whether species with stronger geographical range shifts also advanced their emergence phenologies, or if one response offsets the need for the other. We also asked whether functional traits, range geography (i.e. southerly vs. northerly), or temperature variability predict range shifts at species’ northern range limits, and whether these factors can also predict shifts in species emergence phenology. We predicted that species would exhibit shifts in both geography and phenology, as we expect species shifting in phenology to have larger populations, increasing likelihood of dispersal and successful range shifts. We predicted that species able to use both lentic and lotic habitats would shift their phenologies and geographies more than those able to use just one habitat type, as generalists outperform specialists as climate and land uses change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ball-Damerow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ball-Damerow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hassall and Thompson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Powney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rapacciuolo et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, species might respond to rapid climate changes in ways that reflect their geographical position, indicating that where they are found is a better predictor of their conservation risk from global change than their intrinsic biological characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Relationship between range and phenology shifts</title><p>Most species (52 of 76) expanded their northern range limits toward higher latitudes (mean range expansions of 180 km).

Species expanding their ranges poleward also emerged earlier in the spring on both continents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), with shifts predicted by range geography and climate variability, but not functional traits. These results suggest that some species may have an advantage with respect to climate change: they demonstrate the flexibility to respond both temporally and spatially to the onset of rapid climate change. Conversely, species that show neither geographic nor phenological shifts may be particularly vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>We found no evidence for a tradeoff between range and phenology shifts; instead, half of species shifted both range and phenology. Earlier seasonal timing allows species to stay within their climatic limits and maintain population growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Macgregor et al., 2019</xref>), although earlier emergence could expose individuals to early season weather extremes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McCauley et al., 2018</xref>). As only a small proportion of odonate adults undertake long-range dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conrad et al., 1999</xref>), greater local population sizes should contribute to higher dispersal rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mair et al., 2014</xref>), facilitating range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kerr, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leroux et al., 2013</xref>). This is consistent with results from other taxa: among British butterflies, early emergence increased population growth and facilitated range shifts for species with multiple generations per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Macgregor et al., 2019</xref>) Finnish butterfly species with the greatest population growth rates shifted both their phenology and ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hällfors et al., 2021</xref>). Such population growth or maintenance, and therefore the potential for range shifts, is only possible if habitat is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mair et al., 2014</xref>). Future work should consider habitat availability alongside range and phenology shifts, as it may help explain why some species are able to shift their phenology but not their range.</p><p>Southern species were more likely to expand their ranges northward than northern species or species present in both the north and south. Species’ ability to maintain large populations may be impaired in northern latitudes, where rates of climate change are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">IPCC, 2021</xref>), hindering dispersal and colonization that are precursors to range expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mair et al., 2014</xref>). Further mechanistic understanding of these processes requires abundance data. Southern species may have narrower niche breadths than widespread or northern species and may respond more rapidly to climate change to track this narrower niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hällfors et al., 2024</xref>). Emerging mean conditions in areas adjacent to the ranges of southern species may offer opportunities for range expansions of these relative climate specialists, which can then tolerate climate warming in areas of range expansion better than more cool-adapted historical occupants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Day et al., 2018</xref>). Adaptive evolution and plasticity may enable high population growth rates in newly colonized areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Usui et al., 2023</xref>), but this possibility can only be directly tested with long-term population trend data. While some species experienced range retractions, these may result from sampling variability or stochastic population fluctuations along the northern range edge.</p><p>Increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather limited species’ geographical range responses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This trend was independent of functional traits that are mechanistically linked to species’ climate change responses, such as dispersal ability or habitat preference. Extreme temperatures can reduce population sizes, leading to local extinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Román-Palacios and Wiens, 2020</xref>), and reducing the likelihood of range expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mair et al., 2014</xref>). In odonates, experimental evidence has demonstrated that larval mortality rises with short-term extreme weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McCauley et al., 2015</xref>). Individuals that shift phenologies earlier in the season to avoid climate extremes could still be exposed to harmful conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iler et al., 2021</xref>); for example, odonate populations that respond to unusually warm spring temperatures may experience high mortality if temperatures return to seasonal conditions. Species that experience extreme conditions may then be unable to successfully shift in time, reducing population sizes and reducing the likelihood of range shifts.</p><p>In contrast to previous work demonstrating that range and phenology shifts are at least partially determined by species traits (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sunday et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zografou et al., 2021</xref>), no functional trait, or combination of traits, explained these shifts in North American and European Odonata. While we could not capture all functional traits in this analysis, our results are consistent with other work that identifies climate velocity and sensitivity as the best predictors of range shifts and thermal preferences tracking in marine systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pinsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schuetz et al., 2019</xref>). Species’ tolerances to increasingly variable temperatures also help to predict extinction risk during climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kerr, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rocha-Ortega et al., 2020</xref>). The extent to which species’ traits actually determine rates of range and phenological shifts, rather than occasionally correlated with them, is worth considering further, but functional traits do not systematically drive patterns in these shifts among Odonates in North America and Europe.</p><p>The geographic positions of species’ ranges determine the local pressures and environmental factors to which they are exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">MacLean and Beissinger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pacifici et al., 2020</xref>), potentially masking or confounding the effects of traits that evolved under conditions determined by range geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schuetz et al., 2019</xref>). This process could cause trait-related trends to differ across levels of biological organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Srivastava et al., 2021</xref>), from local populations (where traits might be critical) to biogeographical extents (where traits might be unrelated to range or phenological shifts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grewe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutiérrez and Wilson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sunday et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zografou et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Given that species’ functional traits did not predict temporal or geographic responses, it is unsurprising that species’ responses were also independent of phylogenetic history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Franke et al., 2022</xref>). The phylogenetic approach did not improve model predictions in any model that we tested, and there was no phylogenetic signal in either response according to Pagel’s lambda and Blomberg’s <italic>K</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These results are consistent with previous work that found no phylogenetic trend in local odonate population extinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Suhonen et al., 2022</xref>). There may be strong variation in thermal niches among closely related species: species that are geographically isolated adapt to different local climates, while species that co-occur may experience divergent selection within their climate tolerances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schuetz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It remains unclear if range and phenology shifts relate to trends in abundance, but our results suggest that there may be ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ under climate change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Climate ‘winners’, species that are shifting in space and time, may require more limited conservation intervention. Species expanding their ranges could be better supported if habitat area and connectivity are conserved, facilitating climate-driven range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Littlefield et al., 2019</xref>). Species only shifting their phenologies may require further study, as phenology shifts may have positive or negative impacts on abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iler et al., 2021</xref>). Climate ‘losers’, species that are failing to shift in both space and time, may require more direct conservation intervention, such as managed relocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>). Species that did not shift their ranges northwards or advance their phenology included <italic>Coenagrion mercuriale</italic>, a European species that is listed as near threatened by the IUCN Red List (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">IUCN, 2021</xref>), and is projected to lose 68% of its range by 2035 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jaeschke et al., 2013</xref>). This group also includes <italic>Coenagrion resolutum</italic>, a common North American damselfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Swaegers et al., 2014</xref>), for which we could not find evidence of decline. This may be due in part to the greater area of intact habitat available in North America compared to Europe, enabling <italic>C. resolutum</italic> to maintain larger populations that are less vulnerable to stochastic climate events. Still, this and other species failing to shift in range or phenology should be assessed for population health, as this species could be carrying an unobserved extinction debt. Our analysis of phenology and range shifts should be repeated in other taxa, as it may offer a method of identifying conservation actions among species groups.</p><p>Understanding how range and phenology shifts vary across species, and what drives this variation, is increasingly urgent as climate change alters local and regional environmental conditions. Here, we showed that odonate species exhibit convergent responses of range and phenology shifts across continents. While species with southern distributions were more likely to shift their ranges, increasing temperature variation limited geographical range responses among species in both Europe and North America. Climate change is associated with increasing variability as well as shifting mean conditions, contributing to species decline and even local extinction risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duffy et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, where species are found (i.e. their range geographies) determines whether they are exposed and respond to such negative pressures. Simultaneous consideration of shifts in range and phenology is a powerful and necessary approach to test aspects of species’ vulnerabilities to rapid global changes. By considering both the seasonal and range dynamics of species, emergent and convergent climate change responses across continents become clear for this well-studied group of predatory insects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Biological records</title><p>We assembled ~2 million observations records for North American and European odonate species collected between 1980 and 2018.

However, if the same species on different continents was treated as different species, this would lead to uninterpretable outcomes (and the creation of pseudo-replication) in the context of phylogenetic analyses.

We retained emergence estimates between March 1<sup>st</sup> and September 1<sup>st</sup>, as well as species and quadrats that showed a difference in emergence phenology of –25 to 25, –30 to 30, or –35 to 35 days between both time periods, to include only phenology shifts that could be biologically meaningful to environmental climate change. 68 species found across 63 quadrats met these criteria. Large changes in phenology are likely explained by other anthropogenic or natural factors or could occur due to noise in the data, since these phenology calculations per region are extremely data intensive. We calculated the difference in the day of emergence per quadrat between both time periods, as well as mean phenology change across all quadrats for each species. The number of quadrats per species used to calculate their mean phenological shift varied between 2 and 46.</p><p>We used null models to assess whether our approach to estimating phenology shifts was robust, as potential issues may arise due to spatiotemporal biases in the underlying data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kujala et al., 2013</xref>). We constructed 1000 randomized datasets of species’ hypothetical days of occurrence, using the same number of quadrats and observations within quadrats as in each time period of the observation records. We assigned the maximum and minimum Julian day of occurrence from the observation records to limit values in the randomized datasets. We applied the same method and criteria of inclusion to the randomized datasets as we did to measure phenology shifts from the observation data. GLMs were built to test whether phenology shifts calculated using 1000 random datasets predicted the phenology shifts that we measured. No discernible pattern emerged, indicating that observed shifts in phenology are not consistent with expectations derived from differences in sampling intensity over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Range geographies and functional traits</title><p>To assemble trait data for the 76 species in the database, we used field guides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cannings, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paulson, 2012</xref>) and existing trait databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Powney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Waller et al., 2019</xref>). We considered any evolved morphological, physiological, behavioral, or life-history characteristic as a functional trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beissinger and Riddell, 2021</xref>). Geographic range and associated climatic characteristics are often considered ecological traits, as they are consequences of functional traits and their interactions with geographic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bried and Rocha-Ortega, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chichorro et al., 2019</xref>). Such ecological variables may predict species’ responses to climate change and can add significant value to predictive models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">MacLean and Beissinger, 2017</xref>). We identified whether species’ ranges were more northern, southern, or both northern and southern (both), and determined the range size of each species by counting the number of quadrats occupied by that species in the historical time period.</p><p>Along with the geographic and climatic attributes, temperature variability and distribution, we selected four functional traits likely to be biologically relevant to spatial and temporal responses to climate change: flight duration, breeding habitat type (lotic, lentic, or both), egg-laying habitat (exophytic vs. endophytic), and body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cannings, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paulson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Powney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Waller et al., 2019</xref>). Species’ flight period was measured as the total number of days of the flight period, estimated from the approximate time of the month of average first and last appearances. Breeding habitat was assigned according to a species’ uses of lotic, lentic, or both habitat types. Egg-laying habitat was assigned according to whether species use exophytic egg-laying habitat (i.e. eggs laid in water or on land, relatively larger in number), or endophytic egg-laying habitat (i.e. eggs laid inside plants, usually fewer in number); species using exophytic habitats are associated with greater northward range limit shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angert et al., 2011</xref>). Body size corresponded to the mean length of the abdomen of each species. We excluded overwintering stage and range size from our analysis as data were incomplete for many species, and excluded migratory behavior as the vast majority of species included in the study were non-migratory.</p><p>We tested for correlations among all predictors by calculating the Predictive Power Statistic (PPS) and Pearson correlations among traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Laken, 2021</xref>): we found no evidence of correlation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We conducted statistical analyses using R Statistical Software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">R Development Core Team, 2019</xref>). All continuous variables were transformed into <italic>Z</italic>-scores using the <italic>scale</italic> function in R. First, we investigated whether there was a relationship between species’ range and phenological shifts by modeling phenology shift as the dependent variable, and range shift and continent as independent variables. We used both species-level frequentist (GLM; glm function in R) and Bayesian (MCMCglmm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hadfield, 2010</xref>) models to improve the robustness of the results. We included a term to account for phylogeny in the MCMCglmm model, as species that are closely related are likely to have similar traits. We used the molecular phylogenetic tree published by the Odonate Phenotypic Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Waller et al., 2019</xref>), which used a morphological and taxonomic phylogeny as the backbone tree, allowing species to move within their named genera or families according to molecular evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Waller and Svensson, 2017</xref>). Trace and density plots for the MCMCglmm model revealed no issues with autocorrelation or model convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p> Next, we investigated whether functional traits, range geography, or temperature variability predicted range shifts at species’ northern range limits, and whether the same predictors explaining range expansions could also predict shifts in species emergence phenology. We constructed two sets of GLMs, in addition to two sets of MCMCglmm accounting for phylogeny; one of each with changes in species’ northern range limits as the response variable, and the other with changes in emergence phenology as the response variable. Non-significant variables, specifically all functional traits, were removed from the final geographic range shift model. No effects were significant in the model of phenology shifts. Trace and density plots for the MCMCglmm models did not indicate limitations related to autocorrelation or model convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the inclusion of phylogeny in statistical models to account for potential data non-independence, we measured the phylogenetic signal in range and phenological shifts. We used the <italic>phylosig</italic> function of the <italic>Phytools</italic> package version 0.7-70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Revell, 2012</xref>), which calculates phylogenetic signal using Pagel’s lambda and Blomberg’s <italic>K</italic>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-101208-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data are already published and publicly available, with those publications referenced in the methods section of the text.</p><p>The following previously published datasets were used:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Waller</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Willink</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Tschol</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Svensson</surname><given-names>EI</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2019">2019</year><data-title>Data from: The Odonate Phenotypic Database, a new open data resource for comparative studies of an old insect order</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.j1fd7</pub-id></element-citation></p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Powney</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Brooks</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Barwell</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Bowles</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitt</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Pavitt</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Spriggs</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Isaac</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2014">2014</year><data-title>British Odonata trait data</data-title><source>GitHub</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/Odonata_traits">Odonata_traits</pub-id></element-citation></p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>New</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lister</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Hulme</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Makin</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2002">2002</year><data-title>A high-resolution data set of surface climate over global land areas</data-title><source>Climate Research Unit</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/">CRU TS v.4.05</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the anonymous reviewers and the handling editor for this paper, whose comments and suggestions helped improve the manuscript.

raw dataset includes ~2 million Odonata occurrence records. We first removed inadequate records from our primary dataset. Inadequate records were identified as those with incomplete information for species identification, year, or locality, inaccurate georeferenced points, and duplicate records. We retained ~1,100,000 unique species–location–date observations. There are 452,929 records in the first time period (1980–2002) and 641,590 observations in the second time period (2008–2018).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Phenology and range position estimates</title><p>We have not tried to interpret noise in phenology shift estimates, which could occur due to sampling issues, or to another biologically meaningful eco-evolutionary response. Our methods do not enable tests of those ideas, however. For example, <italic>Aeshna umbrosa</italic> has a surprisingly high phenology shift (&gt;25 days) but a very strong range retraction (&lt;−300 km). For this species, we retained eight quadrats to calculate mean phenology shift estimate. It is possible that a section of the range was lost in which emergence was especially early, compared to other regions, due to local adaptations. This pattern may affect results where species appear to shift emergence dates earlier/later, but phenology shifts are affected by parts of the range that remain occupied.</p><p>We put in place criteria to make sure to include species with range shifts likely to result from climate change effects, rather than from sampling issues or to other anthropogenic pressures such as land use change or sudden land use intensification. <italic>Nehalennia irene</italic> was thus removed, as its range positions were highly unusual and likely due to other factors than global change (&gt;800 km). <italic>Libellula quadrimaculata</italic> was removed due to sampling intensity discrepancies between time periods, having over 10,000 extra points in the second period compared to the first.</p><p>Temporal and spatial bias are likely to be present in opportunistic data, but they are less likely to impact long-term factors of species’ distributions if including data from as many sources as possible, and that span across large geographic and temporal scopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pyke and Ehrlich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zattara and Aizen, 2021</xref>). Here, we put in place several criteria in careful interpretation of results, as described in the Methods section of the main text. Further, among preliminary examinations of the data, we test for the effect of sampling onto our phenology and range shift estimates. We found no effect of sampling on range of phenology responses that we calculated here. We tested a linear mixed model with species as a random effect that assesses whether sampling intensity change per quadrat (where sampling intensity corresponds to sampling per species/quadrat) predicts species’ phenology change per quadrat. The p-value of the predictor variable, sampling intensity change, was not significant. Secondly, we built a generalized linear model to assess whether greater sampling overall (measured as the number of quadrats in which each species is sampled) predicts species’ range shifts that we computed. The p-value of the predictor variable, sampling change per species, was not significant. If spatial bias was present here, we may expect the number of quadrats in which species are found to increase the position of species’ northern range boundaries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Model information and statements</title><p>We report the full model statements below as executed with the <italic>MCMCglmm</italic> R package, including the priors, and the model of trait evolution to account for phylogeny.

The family ‘gaussian’ or ‘threshold’ was selected depending on the continuous or binary nature of the data, respectively. The number of iterations, burnin, and thinning parameters were tested and confirmed with a visual assessment of model convergence using the trace and density plots.

2019</xref>) were used to build this dataset. Habitat type represents species’ breeding habitat and can have a value of lentic, lotic, or both types. Distribution shows the general geographic position of each species’ range, which can be widespread (W), southern (S), northern (N), southern and widespread (S–W), or northern and widespread (N–W). Oviposition type corresponds to egg laying inside plants (endophytic) as opposed to directly in water or on plants (exophytic). Body size is measured as body length in mm. In the case that body length was given as a maximum and minimum value, we used the average of both values.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"

It also teases out the relative importance of geographic context, temperature variability, and functional traits in predicting the shifts. The study system is large occurrence datasets for dragonflies and damselflies split between two time periods and two continents. Results indicate that more species exhibited both shifts than one or the other (or neither), and that geographic context and temperature variability were more influential than traits. The results have implications for future analyses (e.g. incorporating habitat availability) and for choosing winner and loser species under climate change. The results also seem to support climate vulnerability assessments for species that rely on geographic range size and geospatial climate data layers rather than more detailed information (like demographic rates, abundances, or traits) that may not be so readily available. The methodology would be useful for other taxa and study regions with strong participatory (&quot;citizen&quot;) science and extensive occurrence data.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an organized and well written paper that builds on a popular topic and moves it forward. It has the right idea and approach, and the results are useful answers to the predictions and for conservation planning (i.e. identifying climate winners and losers). There is technical proficiency and analytical rigor driven by an understanding of the data and its limitations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101208.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper explores a highly interesting question regarding how species migration success relates to phenology shifts, and it finds a positive relationship. The findings are significant, and the strength of the evidence is solid. However, there are substantial issues with the writing, presentation, and analyses that need to be addressed. First, I disagree with the conclusion that species that don't migrate are &quot;losers&quot; - some species might not migrate simply because they have broad climatic niches and are less sensitive to climate change. Second, the results concerning species' southern range limits could provide valuable insights. These could be used to assess whether sampling bias has influenced the results. If species are truly migrating, we should observe northward shifts in their southern range limits. However, if this is an artifact of increased sampling over time, we would expect broader distributions both north and south. Finally, Figure 1 is missed panel B, which needs to be addressed.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The revision has substantially improved the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101208.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In their article &quot;Range geography and temperature variability explain cross-continental convergence in range and phenology shifts in a model insect taxon&quot; the authors rigorously investigate the spatial and temporal trends in the occurrence of odonate species and their potential drivers. Specifically, they examine whether species shift their geographic ranges poleward or alter their phenology to cope with changing conditions. Leveraging opportunistic observations of European and North American odonates, they find that species showing significant range shifts also exhibited shifts to earlier emergence. Considering a broad range of potential predictors, their results reveal that geographical factors, but not functional traits, are associated with these shifts.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The article addresses an important topic in ecology and conservation that is particularly timely in the face of reports of substantial insects declines in North America and Europe over the past decades. Through data integration the authors leverage the rich natural history record for odonates, broadening the taxonomic scope of analyses of temporal trends in phenology and distribution. The combination of phenological and range shifts in one framework presents an elegant way to reconcile previous findings and informs about the drivers of biodiversity loss.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>To better understand whether species shifting both their ranges and phenology are more successful, or as stated here are 'clear winners', and hence whether those that do neither are more vulnerable would require integrating population trends alongside the discussed response. The ~10% species that have not shifted their distribution or phenology might have not declined in abundance, if they have rapidly adapted to local changes in climatic conditions (i.e. they might show a plastic response). These species might be the real 'winners', while species that have recently shifted their ranges or phenology may eventually reach hard limits. The authors are discussing this limitation but might want to adapt their wording, given the potential for misinterpretation. The finding that species with more northern ranges showed lesser northward shifts would speak to the fact that some species have already reached such a geographical range limit.</p><p>Achievements and impact:</p><p>The results support broad differences in the response of odonate species to climate change, and the prediction that range geography and temperature seasonality are more important predictors of these changes than functional traits. Simultaneously addressing range and phenological shifts highlights that most species exhibit coupled responses but also identifies a significant portion of species that do not respond in these ways that are of critical conservation concern. These results are important for improving forecasts of species' responses to climate change and identifying species of particularly conservation concern. Although not exhaustive regarding abundance trends, the study presents an important step towards a general framework for investigating the drivers of multifaceted species responses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101208.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sirois-Delisle</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Ottawa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ottawa</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Susan CC</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Ottawa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ottawa</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kerr</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Ottawa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ottawa</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Line 364-370: This paragraph is not very clear to me.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we agree our point could have been made clearer. We have clarified as follows:</p><p>“The geographic positions of species’ ranges determine the local pressures and environmental factors to which they are exposed (MacLean and Beissinger, 2017; Pacifici et al., 2020), potentially masking or confounding the effects of traits that evolved under conditions determined by range geography (Schuetz et al., 2019). This process could cause trait-related trends to differ across levels of biological organization (Srivastava et al., 2021), from local populations (where traits might be critical) to biogeographical extents (where traits might be unrelated to range or phenological shifts; Grewe et al., 2013; Gutiérrez and Wilson, 2021; Sunday et al., 2015; Zografou et al., 2021).” (Lines 370-377).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>L313: '...higher population growth' compared to what? Does this mean that species shifting to earlier emergence really show higher population growth over time?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we have clarified as follows: “Earlier seasonal timing allows species to stay within their climatic limits and maintain population growth rates (Macgregor et al., 2019), although earlier emergence could expose individuals to early season weather extremes (McCauley et al., 2018).” (Lines 316-319).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L336: Same here. Please refer to your comparative counterpart in such statements. Does 'plasticity may enable higher population growth' mean higher than for species shifting range or phenology or higher compared to the previous level for a given species. In many cases it seems you are referring to an overall baseline, so that the 'higher' means 'lesser decline'. Wouldn't plasticity maintain population growth at similar levels as before? The current wording suggests that plasticity results in species exceeding their previous population growth. Please rephrase.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it was confusing with no comparative counterpart, so we changed the sentence as follows: “Adaptive evolution and plasticity may enable high population growth rates in newly-colonized areas (Angert et al., 2020; Usui et al., 2023), but this possibility can only be directly tested with long term population trend data.” (Lines 341-343).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L307: The term 'universal winners' appears too strong and not well justified given the lack of the crucial third dimension of response. In fact, changes in phenology are less indicative than abundance trends. Combined with range shifts they would tell a story of success or failing, while phenological shifts would rather help to understand how species adapted. I am not saying the insight cannot stand alone, but it is important to adapt the wording in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, we have clarified the text as follows: “These results suggest that some species may have an advantage with respect to climate change: they demonstrate the flexibility to respond both temporally and spatially to the onset of rapid climate change.” (Lines 310-313).</p><p>We also softened language around winners and losers on line 388: “It remains unclear if range and phenology shifts relate to trends in abundance, but our results suggest that there may be ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ under climate change (Figure 4).” (Lines 387-388).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L326-240: I agree with line 330 that abundance trends are needed to clarify the situation of species shifting or not shifting ranges and phenology. However, this abstract should clarify that this is particularly important to understand whether non shifting species are really the 'losers'. If these species show adapted evolution or plasticity, we would expect they do not decline in abundance. Even without shifts in range or phenology they would be the 'ultimate winners' as you call it.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, we agree that abundance trends are necessary to understand potential winners and losers. We have made this addition to the abstract as follows: “Species shifting in both space and time may be more resilient to extreme conditions, although further work integrating abundance data is needed.” (Lines 16-18).</p></body></sub-article></article>
