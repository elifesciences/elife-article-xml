cause of congenital heart defects (CHD), yet the genetic and mechanistic causes of these defects remain unknown. To identify dosage-sensitive genes that cause DS phenotypes, including CHD, we used chromosome engineering to generate a mapping panel of 7 mouse strains with partial trisomies of regions of mouse chromosome 16 orthologous to Hsa21. Using high-resolution episcopic microscopy and three-dimensional modeling we show that these strains accurately model DS CHD. Systematic analysis of the 7 strains identified a minimal critical region sufficient to cause CHD when present in 3 copies, and showed that it contained at least two dosage-sensitive loci. Furthermore, two of these new strains model a specific subtype of atrio-ventricular septal defects with exclusive ventricular shunting and demonstrate that, contrary to current hypotheses, these CHD are not due to failure in formation of the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11614.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11614.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11614.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Down syndrome is a condition caused by having an extra copy of one of the 46 chromosomes found inside human cells. Specifically, instead of two copies, people with Down syndrome are born with three copies of chromosome 21. This results in many different effects, including learning and memory problems, heart defects and Alzheimer’s disease. Each of these different effects is caused by having a third copy of one or more of the approximately 230 genes found on chromosome 21. However, it is not known which of these genes cause any of these effects, and how an extra copy of the genes results in such changes.</p><p>Now, Lana-Elola et al. have investigated which genes on chromosome 21 cause the heart defects seen in Down syndrome, and how those heart defects come about. This involved engineering a new strain of mouse that has an extra copy of 148 mouse genes that are very similar to 148 genes found on chromosome 21 in humans. Like people with Down syndrome, this mouse strain developed heart defects when it was an embryo.</p><p>Using a series of six further mouse strains, Lana-Elola et al. then narrowed down the potential genes that, when in three copies, are needed to cause the heart defects, to a list of just 39 genes. Further experiments then showed that at least two genes within these 39 genes were required in three copies to cause the heart defects.</p><p>The next step will be to identify the specific genes that actually cause the heart defects, and then work out how a third copy of these genes causes the developmental problems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11614.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11614.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Down syndrome</kwd><kwd>congenital heart defects</kwd><kwd>mouse genetics</kwd><kwd>chromosome engineering</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>080174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Elizabeth MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Tybulewicz</surname><given-names>Victor LJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U117527252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tybulewicz</surname><given-names>Victor LJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Elizabeth MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Tybulewicz</surname><given-names>Victor LJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A panel of seven new mouse strains with chromosomal duplications is used to identify a minimal genetic region required in three copies to cause congenital heart defects typical of human Down syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation of a functional four-chambered heart is a complex process and perturbations in its development can lead to congenital heart defects (CHD). These affect almost 1% of the population and are a major cause of morbidity and infant mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fahed et al., 2013</xref>). The chance of being born with CHD is drastically increased (to ~50%) in DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vis et al., 2009</xref>) in which a range of heart defects is seen, including ventricular septal defects (VSD) and outflow tract abnormalities such as overriding aorta (OA) and double outlet right ventricle (DORV). Notably, defects that affect the atrioventricular (AV) junction, especially atrio-ventricular septal defects (AVSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freeman et al., 1998</xref>) are often seen in DS. AVSD comprise a spectrum of cardiac malformations characterized by a common AV junction, guarded by an essentially common valve, as opposed to separate AV junctions guarded by mitral and tricuspid valves. People diagnosed with AVSD can present with communication between left and right heart chambers (shunting) at the atrial level (ostium primum defect) or at the ventricular level or with shunting at both atrial and ventricular levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahle et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The process of forming the AV junction that divides the embryonic heart into a four-chambered structure involves the growth and fusion of a number of tissues from different precursor populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Webb et al., 1998</xref>). These include the atrial and ventricular septa (mainly of myocardial origin), the mesenchymal cap of the atrial septum, and the superior and inferior endocardial cushions (endocardial origin). In addition, the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion (DMP) first described as the ‘spina vestibuli’ by Wilhelm His the elder in 1880 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">His, 1880</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mommersteeg et al., 2006</xref>) makes an important contribution to septation of the AV junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Snarr et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Snarr et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Webb et al., 1998</xref>). The DMP is a mesenchymal structure at the venous pole of the developing heart derived from the second heart field (SHF) and perturbations of its development result in AVSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goddeeris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Webb et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2012</xref>). Abnormalities in the DMP have also been detected in human fetal hearts with trisomy 21, leading to the hypothesis that malformation of this tissue causes the AVSD in DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blom et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Hsa21 carries 233 protein-coding genes (genome assembly GRCh38.p5) and it is thought that DS phenotypes result from an increased dosage of one or more of the genes on Hsa21. The search for dosage-sensitive genes that when present in 3 copies cause DS phenotypes has been approached using both human and mouse genetics. In humans, rare cases of partial trisomy 21 have been used to identify critical regions that contain dosage-sensitive genes that when present in 3 copies cause DS phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delabar et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Korbel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korenberg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lyle et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, mouse strains have been generated to study the pathology and genetics of DS.</p><p>Hsa21 shares synteny with a large region on mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16) and with shorter regions on Mmu10 and Mmu17. The first two DS models generated, Ts65Dn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davisson et al., 1990</xref>) and Ts1Cje (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sago et al., 1998</xref>) have duplications of regions of mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16) that are orthologous to Hsa21, and have been used to identify dosage-sensitive genes contributing to some DS phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakrabarti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lana-Elola et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salehi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sussan et al., 2008</xref>). However, both models also have additional aneuploidy (trisomy of 60 genes on Mmu17 in Ts65Dn and monosomy of 7 genes on Mmu12 in Ts1Cje mice), making interpretation of their phenotypes difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duchon et al., 2011</xref>). Another DS model, the Tc1 mouse, carries a freely-segregating copy of Hsa21 and shows many DS phenotypes, including CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunlevy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Doherty et al., 2005</xref>), although the Hsa21 in this strain is not intact and the mice are mosaic for the human chromosome, again making interpretation difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gribble et al., 2013</xref>). Thanks to recent advances in chromosome engineering, a number of mouse strains with duplications of regions of mouse chromosomes orthologous to Hsa21 have been generated, resulting in partial trisomies, including the most complete mouse model for DS to date (Dp(16)1Yey/+;Dp(17)1Yey/+;Dp(10)1Yey/+), which carries a duplication of all Hsa21-orthologous regions on Mmu16, Mmu17 and Mmu10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brault et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). However, a comprehensive mapping panel to finely map dosage-sensitive genes in DS has not been available until now.</p><p>To identify dosage-sensitive critical regions and candidate genes, we now report the generation of a fine mapping panel of 7 partial trisomies of Mmu16 that can be used to identify the genetic basis of DS phenotypes where such genes reside in the region of Mmu16 orthologous to Hsa21. We use this panel to investigate the cardiac defects in DS, employing high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM) to analyze the precise three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the developing hearts. This combined approach enabled us to narrow down the critical region for CHD in DS to a minimal region containing 39 protein-coding genes and to show that this region contains at least two dosage-sensitive loci required in three copies to cause CHD. Furthermore using dual-wavelength HREM we show that the DMP develops normally in these DS models, and conclude that CHD in these DS models are not caused by failure in formation or growth of the DMP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A mouse genetic mapping panel for DS</title><p>To expedite the identification of dosage-sensitive genes required in 3 copies to cause DS phenotypes, we generated a novel high-resolution ‘mapping panel’ of 7 strains with duplications in Mmu16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Of the protein-coding genes on Hsa21 that have orthologues in the mouse, the largest fraction (~58%) is located in the telomeric region of Mmu16. Thus we used long-range Cre/loxP mediated recombination to engineer the Dp1Tyb mouse strain carrying a duplication from <italic>Lipi</italic> to <italic>Zbtb21</italic> on Mmu16 spanning 23 Mb and 148 coding genes. We then generated 3 further strains with contiguous segmental duplications completely covering the region duplicated in Dp1Tyb: Dp9Tyb (from <italic>Lipi</italic> to <italic>Hunk</italic>), Dp2Tyb (from <italic>Mis18a</italic> to <italic>Runx1</italic>) and Dp3Tyb (from <italic>Mir802</italic> to <italic>Zbtb21</italic>).

These methods are particularly suited to examination of complex 3D structures, such as the developing heart, overcoming limitations of conventional 2D histological methods. We observed a significant increase of CHD in E14.5 Dp1Tyb embryos compared to their wild-type (Wt) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Detailed examination of heart morphology in the mutant embryos revealed a range of defects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). About 18% of Dp1Tyb hearts show abnormal arterial trunk arrangements such as OA or DORV with subaortic communication and 62% had a VSD either alone or in combination with other defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>).

We and others have previously reported that this strain does not show CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunlevy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). However, in our earlier study we had examined Ts1Rhr on the mixed 129S8;C57BL/6JNimr genetic background, whilst Dp1Tyb and Dp3Tyb are maintained on the C57BL/6JNimr background. Thus in order to eliminate possible confounding effects of background differences, we backcrossed Ts1Rhr to the C57BL/6JNimr background and used HREM to look for CHD. Once again we found no increased frequency of CHD in the Ts1Rhr strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Thus an extra copy of one or more of the 8 genes duplicated in Dp3Tyb but not in Ts1Rhr is required to cause CHD. Next we analyzed Dp4Tyb, Dp5Tyb and Dp6Tyb mice each of which carry a duplication that between them cover the whole of the duplicated region in Dp3Tyb mice. Remarkably, none of these 3 strains showed significant increased rates of CHDs indicating that there are at least two dosage-sensitive loci in the Dp3Tyb mouse that contribute to CHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><p>Taken together these data show that a 4.9 Mb region of Mmu16 from <italic>Mir802</italic> to <italic>Zbtb21</italic> is sufficient when in 3 copies to generate cardiac defects similar to those seen in DS. Furthermore, the mapping analysis shows that there are two or more loci within this region that are required in 3 copies to cause CHD, and that at least one of these resides within the 8 genes duplicated in Dp1Tyb but not Ts1Rhr mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Development of the DMP</title><p>The DMP plays a crucial role in the formation of the AV junction, and defects in its development have been proposed to underlie the AVSD in DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blom et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs et al., 2012</xref>). In order to assess if DMP development was perturbed in the Dp1Tyb mouse model of DS, we first established a method to follow its development during formation of the AV junction. The <italic>Isl1</italic> gene is expressed in the SHF and also in the DMP which is derived from it and hence can be used as a marker for this tissue. We visualized expression of <italic>Isl1</italic> using 2 different mouse strains: the Isl1Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2008</xref>) strain crossed to Rosa26RLacZ reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soriano, 1999</xref>) to identify cells that are expressing or had expressed <italic>Isl1</italic>, and thus are derived from the SHF; and the Isl1nLacZ strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun et al., 2007</xref>) to visualize ongoing expression of <italic>Isl1</italic>. Gene expression studies have traditionally relied on staining individual sections and rendering a 3D expression pattern by compiling histological sections, but this approach results in loss of resolution and is constrained by the chosen sectioning plane. To get around this, we utilized dual-wavelength HREM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mohun and Weninger, 2011</xref>) to visualize β-galactosidase expression in the 3D context of the developing heart in order to get an accurate view of the development of the DMP. At E11.5 analysis of both strains shows there is an expansion of <italic>Isl1</italic>-expressing mesenchymal tissue from within the right pulmonary ridge, which forms the DMP and has started to protrude ventrally into the cavity of the right atrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). One day later at E12.5, the DMP has protruded more ventrally and it is now in contact with the inferior atrioventricular cushion. At these stages both reporters give a similar picture, as the DMP is actively expressing <italic>Isl1</italic>. Later in development (E13.5) the expression of <italic>Isl1</italic> diminishes and totally disappears by E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Snarr et al., 2007b</xref>). However development of the DMP can still be followed using the Isl1Cre/Rosa26RLacZ fate reporter strain. This revealed that by E14.5 the DMP forms the ventro-caudal buttress at the core of the AV junction sandwiched between the atrial septum and the endocardial cushions that have now developed into the tricuspid and mitral valves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Overall, using two different genetic lineage markers of the SHF, these data show a detailed 3D view of the spatio-temporal development of the DMP.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11614.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Development of the DMP.</title><p>Left panels show a series of 3D four-chamber views of hearts at embryonic stages E11.5, 12.5, 13.5 and 14.5.

To evaluate this issue directly we examined E14.5 Dp1Tyb hearts with AVSD for the presence of the DMP. Once again we used HREM with 3D modeling and examined the same Wt and Dp1Tyb hearts using three different views. In a short axis view across the AV junction we saw an AVSD in the Dp1Tyb heart with the superior and inferior bridging leaflets across the single AV junction while the Wt heart showed a normal AV junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, left panels). A long axis four-chamber view of the same hearts showed an intact ventricular septum in the Wt heart but a VSD in the Dp1Tyb heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, middle panels). Finally, a more dorsal plane of the long axis view of the same hearts showed that the DMP was located in the correct position at the AV junction in both the Wt and the Dp1Tyb hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, right panels, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). We performed the same analysis on the Dp3Tyb mice and once again found that the DMP was present in embryos with AVSD (not shown). Taken together these data show that the AVSD found in these new mouse models of DS are not caused by perturbations of the growth of the DMP. Importantly, we note that defects in the DMP have been previously shown to result in atrial septal defects or AVSD with atrial shunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs et al., 2012</xref>), neither of which are seen in Dp1Tyb or Dp3Tyb mice. In contrast these strains show AVSD with exclusive ventricular shunting, implying that this subtype of AVSD must be due to defects in tissues other than the DMP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cardiac abnormalities are very common in DS. Approximately half of all babies born with DS have a heart defect, many of which are serious and need to be surgically repaired. In order to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms that lead to CHD in DS it is essential to establish mouse models for DS that accurately recapitulate them. Here we report the generation of a new mouse strain Dp1Tyb with a 23 Mb duplication of the entire region of Mmu16 orthologous to Hsa21, and show that it recapitulates the main types of CHD seen in DS. The Dp(16)1Yey mouse strain carries a similar duplication to Dp1Tyb encompassing the same set of genes and was also reported to have heart defects during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the cardiac phenotypes in Dp1Tyb are very similar to the ones we previously observed in the transchromosomic strain Tc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunlevy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Doherty et al., 2005</xref>), despite differences in the Hsa21 orthologous gene content in the two strains and the different species origin for the duplicated genes: mouse in Dp1Tyb mice, human in Tc1 mice. This phenotypic similarity supports the conclusion that the CHD seen in these strains are caused by the same pathological mechanisms as those in people with DS. As with CHD in humans with DS we observed incomplete penetrance of the phenotype in Dp1Tyb mice. In humans this has been ascribed to genetic modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012</xref>). However the Dp1Tyb mouse strain was analyzed on an inbred background, suggesting that incomplete penetrance may be caused by stochastic effects during embryonic cardiogenesis. While the recovery of E14.5 Dp1Tyb embryos was consistent with expected Mendelian numbers (not shown), the recovery of Dp1Tyb mice at weaning was reduced to 50% of the expected numbers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Some of this loss could be due to the most severe CHDs, since AVSDs were found in ~25% of E14.5 Dp1Tyb embryos, but it is likely that there are other unknown causes for this perinatal lethality. The other strain to show AVSDs, Dp3Tyb, showed a 25% reduction in recovery of mice at weaning, similar to the observed frequency of AVSDs at E14.5, making this a likely cause of the reduced yield of mutant mice.</p><p>Together with the Dp1Tyb strain we generated a collection of 7 new mouse strains with segmental duplications ranging from 1.5 Mb to 23 Mb that provide a genetic resource for mapping dosage-sensitive genes required in 3 copies to cause DS phenotypes. We used this mapping panel to identify a 4.9 Mb genomic region (from <italic>Mir802</italic> to <italic>Zbtb21</italic>) that when present in 3 copies is sufficient to cause CHD. Furthermore, from analysis of shorter duplications, we show that the phenotype is caused by at least two distinct dosage-sensitive loci. By combining this data with analysis of the Ts1Rhr strain, we have determined that, minimally, one of the two loci lies either in an interval at the centromeric end of the duplication in Dp3Tyb (from <italic>Mir802</italic> to <italic>Setd4</italic>) or at the telomeric end (from <italic>Mx2</italic> to <italic>Zbtb21</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). These two segments between them contain only 7 coding genes (<italic>Setd4, Mx2, Tmprss2, Ripk4, Prdm15, C2cd2</italic> and <italic>Zbtb21</italic>) and one microRNA gene (<italic>Mir802</italic>), none of which had been previously implicated in causing CHD in DS. A previous study proposed that a 3.7 Mb genomic region of Mmu16 (<italic>Ifnar1</italic> – <italic>Kcnj6</italic>) in Dp(16)4Yey was sufficient to cause CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>); this region overlaps the centromeric end of the duplicated region of Dp3Tyb by 1.9 Mb from <italic>Mir802</italic> to <italic>Kcnj6</italic>, which may help to further narrow down the search for causative genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). We note that while the Dp5Tyb and Ts1Rhr strains did not show a statistically significant increase in CHDs compared to their wild-type littermate controls, in both strains we detected 2 mutant embryos with AVSDs (out of 20 or 21 embryos analyzed respectively). Thus it is possible that these strains have a weak phenotype – a larger number of embryos from these strains would need to be analyzed to establish whether this is significant. If true, it would suggest that one or more of the causative genes may reside within the Dp5Tyb interval (which is entirely contained within the Ts1Rhr interval).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11614.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Genetic and mechanistic dissection of CHD in mouse models of DS.</title><p>(<bold><bold>a</bold></bold>) Representation of Hsa21 and the conserved region of synteny with the telomeric part of Mmu16 (grey line).

An individual (PM) trisomic for the 7.7 Mb region from <italic>PSMG1</italic> to <italic>PRMT2</italic> had a VSD, whereas the shortest partial trisomy (individual BA) that gave rise to AVSD extended 10.0Mb from <italic>HLCS</italic> to <italic>PRMT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). We note that that while both of these intervals overlap substantially with the minimal Dp3Tyb region identified in our studies, the duplicated region in individual PM does not overlap at all with the <italic>Ifnar1</italic> – <italic>Kcnj6</italic> region identified by Liu et al as being sufficient to cause CHDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). In particular the human studies suggested that increased dosage of the <italic>DSCAM</italic> gene may be responsible for the CHDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Korbel et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast the mouse studies show that duplication of <italic>Dscam</italic> is neither necessary or sufficient to cause CHDs, since the gene is not within the minimal <italic>Ifnar1</italic> – <italic>Kcnj6</italic> region identified by Liu et al as being sufficient for CHDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) but is duplicated in the Dp6Tyb strain which we show here does not have CHDs. Taking the human and mouse data together, this suggests that several dosage-sensitive genes may contribute to CHDs, with potentially no single gene being absolutely required.</p><p>Dp1Tyb mice show AVSD with ventricular but not atrial shunting. Analysis of AVSD in people with DS showed that the most common subtype was a complete AVSD with both atrial and ventricular shunting and the next most common was AVSD with exclusive ventricular shunting similar to that seen in the Dp1Tyb mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freeman et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, although Dp1Tyb mice show AVSD, they only model one subtype of AVSD seen in people with DS – AVSD with ventricular shunting. It is not known why some cases of DS have complete AVSD whereas others have subtypes with only atrial or ventricular shunting, but it is tempting to speculate that there are distinct mechanisms driving defects in the atrial and ventricular septa.</p><p>AVSD have been shown to result from defects in development of the DMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goddeeris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Webb et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, a variety of different genetic manipulations that affect the DMP all resulted in AVSD with exclusive atrial shunting, demonstrating the importance of the DMP for the correct formation of the atrial side of the AV junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, in Dp1Tyb mice we found normal DMP development and no AVSD with atrial shunting, but instead saw exclusively AVSD with ventricular shunting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Thus we propose that defects in the atrial septum causing the ostium primum type of AVSD are caused by malformation of the DMP, whereas ventricular defects are due to perturbations in other tissues, such as endocardial cushions or myocardium. Interestingly, Gata4-deficient mice display AVSD and have a normal DMP, but show perturbations in myocardial signaling to the adjacent atrioventricular cushion mesenchyme, suggesting that defects in myocardial signaling could lead to AVSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Misra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rajagopal et al., 2007</xref>). To our knowledge the Dp1Tyb and Dp3Tyb mouse strains are the first to have been shown to have AVSD with ventricular shunting and thus will allow direct studies of the pathological mechanisms underlying this subtype of AVSD.</p><p>In conclusion, we have generated a mapping panel of 7 mouse strains that can be used to identify dosage-sensitive genes underlying the broad range of DS phenotypes, and we have exploited this panel to map the location of genes causing CHD in DS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>We generated ES cells with a duplication from <italic>Lipi</italic> to <italic>Zbtb21</italic> using Cre/loxP-mediated chromosome engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu and Bradley, 2001</xref>) following strategies similar to those previously used to make mice with duplications of Hsa21-orthologous regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brault et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Stylianos Antonarakis as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes the cardiac phenotype in seven mouse strains with partial trisomies of regions of mouse chromosome 16. These morphological analyses enable the identification of a minimal critical region which, when trisomic, causes congenital heart defects. It is further reported that there are two loci within this region that are required to be trisomic for the effect on heart development. In addition, the authors use the abnormal phenotype to show that AVSD with shunting at the ventricular level can develop in the presence of a morphologically normal dorsal mesenchymal protrusion (DMP).</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the sophisticated genetic manipulations and the high quality of the morphological data. However the following points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) In the comparison between human and mouse more discussion is required of the extent to which the studies of Down Syndrome translocation cases and the intervals defined by them match the mouse data presented here. The paper by Korbel et al. in PNAS 2009 is mentioned but the authors could be a bit clearer on the degree of genetic content overlap between the regions they define in their manuscript and the &lt;2-Mb DS-specific congenital heart disease (DSCHD) interval defined by Korbel.</p><p>There is a clear difference in phenotype that the authors discuss but rather underplay (“Dp1Tyb mice show AVSD with ventricular but not atrial shunting” – “it is tempting to speculate that there are distinct mechanisms driving defects in the atrial and ventricular septa”). About 80% of Down's hearts with AVSD have the &quot;complete&quot; type, with shunting at atrial and ventricular level, whereas none of the hearts from mouse partial trisomies had this phenotype. The authors speculate that different mechanisms might act in the atrial and ventricular aspects of AV septal formation. If so, it could be considered that their models encompass only one of those two mechanisms.</p><p>There is no mention in the Discussion of mouse trisomy 16, which is not a good model of Down's-type defects for other reasons, but Ts16 hearts do have AVSD with shunting at the atrial level (Webb et al., (1999) Circ. Research 84:897-905), which is what is absent in the partial trisomy models studied here. Interestingly, Ts16 hearts do have deficiencies in DMP development.</p><p>2) CHD are observed in 50% of people with Down Syndrome and usually necessitate cardiac surgery to avoid any late impairment. Here the results are limited to 14.5dpc embryos in which CHD and mainly AVSD are observed but little is described about the consequence of the CHD on perinatal viability. Kamp et al. (2010; PMID20511334) reported the identification of mouse congenital heart disease loci with most of them inducing perinatal lethality with CHD at birth. If the authors have data on the frequency of perinatal lethality and structural heart defects in the duplication carrier at birth, these should be included.</p><p>3) It would be interesting to see a table with the number of individuals studied showing the different types of CHD compared to the total of embryos in the different mouse cohorts from the 7 duplication.</p><p>The authors should also discuss the variability of the CHD and AVSD phenotypes observed in wt control animals analysed from the different cohorts of mice. For example, the wt in Dp5Tyb and DP6Tyb or Ts1Rhr showed almost 20% of CHD compared to Dp9Tyb (5%?) Dp2Tyb and Dp3Tyb (10%?). What are the origins of such discrepancies in wt cohorts? A comparison of the CHD in wild-type individuals from the different cohorts, presented as a supplementary table, would add value to the analysis.</p><p>4) The authors have done their analysis after 5 backcrosses on the C57BL/6JNimr genetic background. Could they assess if this level is sufficient in this particular situation? The presence of 2 copies of the 129S8 allele on the duplicated fragment versus the B6 allele may influence the outcome of the study (and may also explain the heterogeneity of the control littermates). Thus it would be interesting to check what is the real contribution of the B6 and 129 alleles, at least for the trisomic regions in the different models.</p><p>5) An important point is whether by crossing strains Dp4Tyb, Dp5Tyb and Dp6Tyb, the CHD can be reconstituted to narrow further the key genetic contributions. Incomplete penetrance is commonplace in CHD and the finding that two genes require three copies to produce CHD in these models is intriguing in this context and merits further discussion.</p><p>6) The conclusions about which regions of Dp1Tyb are required in three copies to induce Downs-type heart defects rely wholly on comparisons between some very small numbers of abnormal hearts, which are usefully summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Hearts from Ts1Rhr and Dp5Tyb each had 2 AVSD (of 21 and 20 examined respectively), which is undoubtedly statistically different from the incidences in Dp1Tyb and Dp3Tyb, but it is difficult to say with certainty that there is no effect in Ts1Rhr and Dp5Tyb, particularly given that there was only 1 AVSD observed in about 170 wild type hearts. There could be a weak combinatorial effect of a number of genes throughout the region. The authors should be more cautious in the wording of their conclusions. [One of the AVSD in Dp5Tyb did not have an ASD or VSD, an outlier which goes without explanation or mention].</p><p>7) For completeness, it would be useful to generate Isl1Cre lineage marked Dp1Tyb hearts, as well as the Isl1nLacZ expression (this is incorrectly termed &quot;lineage&quot; in the subsection “The DMP is present and largely unaffected in the Dp1Tyb mouse model for DS”) marked hearts. It would be informative to show these data at E14.5, in definitively AVSD hearts.</p></body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11614.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) In the comparison between human and mouse more discussion is required of the extent to which the studies of Down Syndrome translocation cases and the intervals defined by them match the mouse data presented here. The paper by Korbel et al.in PNAS 2009 is mentioned but the authors could be a bit clearer on the degree of genetic content overlap between the regions they define in their manuscript and the &lt;2-Mb DS-specific congenital heart disease (DSCHD) interval defined by Korbel.</italic> </p><p>We have amended the Discussion to include a fuller discussion of the CHD in humans with partial trisomy of Hsa21 as evaluated by Barlow et al. (2001) and Korbel et al. (2009), comparing their conclusions to our data and that of Liu et al. (2013) in the mouse (Discussion, third paragraph). To aid in this we have added a new panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) showing the extent of the shortest partial trisomies in humans with DS that lead to VSD or AVSD respectively. The figure also shows the shortest duplication that leads to CHDs in the mouse as reported in the study by Liu et al. (2013).</p><p>The 1.77 Mb region reported in Korbel 2009 as being a minimal critical region for CHD was derived from a region present in all individuals with partial trisomy of Hsa21 who had CHDs which was further limited to the overlap with the orthologous region on Mmu16, since mice with a duplication of just this orthologous region have CHDs (Dp1Yey mice, Li et al. 2007). In other words, this 1.77 Mb region has been identified based on several individuals and on mouse data, and there is no known individual trisomic just for this 1.77 Mb region who has CHD. In view of this, we thought it was more useful to show the extent of trisomy in two individuals (PM and BA) reported in Korbel 2009 who had the shortest trisomies leading to VSD and AVSD (7.7 Mb and 10.0 Mb respectively). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, these two regions overlap partly with the Dp3Tyb region reported in our study, but the trisomy in individual PM does not overlap with the <italic>Ifnar1-Kcnj6</italic> region identified by Liu et al. 2013. Taken together this suggests that several dosage-sensitive genes may contribute to CHDs, with potentially no single gene being absolutely required.</p><p><italic>There is a clear difference in phenotype that the authors discuss but rather underplay (“Dp1Tyb mice show AVSD with ventricular but not atrial shunting” – “it is tempting to speculate that there are distinct mechanisms driving defects in the atrial and ventricular septa”). About 80% of Down's hearts with AVSD have the &quot;complete&quot; type, with shunting at atrial and ventricular level, whereas none of the hearts from mouse partial trisomies had this phenotype. The authors speculate that different mechanisms might act in the atrial and ventricular aspects of AV septal formation. If so, it could be considered that their models encompass only one of those two mechanisms.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that Dp1Tyb models only one subtype of AVSD found in DS (with ventricular but not atrial shunting). As requested, we have added a sentence in the Discussion to clearly emphasize this point (“Dp1Tyb mice show AVSD with ventricular but not atrial shunting. Analysis of AVSD in people with DS showed that the most common subtype was a complete AVSD with both atrial and ventricular shunting and the next most common was AVSD with exclusive ventricular shunting similar to that seen in the Dp1Tyb mouse (Freeman et al., 2008)”).</p><p><italic>There is no mention in the Discussion of mouse trisomy 16, which is not a good model of Down's-type defects for other reasons, but Ts16 hearts do have AVSD with shunting at the atrial level (Webb et al., (1999) Circ. Research 84:897-905), which is what is absent in the partial trisomy models studied here. Interestingly, Ts16 hearts do have deficiencies in DMP development.</italic> </p><p>As noted by the reviewers, Ts16 is not a good model for DS heart defects because it is trisomic for large numbers of genes that are not orthologous to genes on Hsa21. Indeed only 25% of Mmu16 is orthologous to Hsa21. Nonetheless this is an interesting mouse strain because it has defects in DMP development and shows AVSDs. We now refer to the analysis of Ts16 mice and the AVSD and DMP defects (Webb et al. 1999) in the Introduction (second paragraph) and Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) CHD are observed in 50% of people with Down Syndrome and usually necessitate cardiac surgery to avoid any late impairment. Here the results are limited to 14.5dpc embryos in which CHD and mainly AVSD are observed but little is described about the consequence of the CHD on perinatal viability. Kamp</italic> et al. <italic>(2010; PMID20511334) reported the identification of mouse congenital heart disease loci with most of them inducing perinatal lethality with CHD at birth. If the authors have data on the frequency of perinatal lethality and structural heart defects in the duplication carrier at birth, these should be included.</italic> </p><p>We agree this is an interesting point, but we do not have data on structural defects at birth. We estimate it would take at least 4 months to generate this. However, we have data on lethality of the duplication strains. At weaning we recover only 50% of the expected number of Dp1Tyb pups, and 75% of the expected number of Dp3Tyb pups. Given that in both strains around 25% of embryos have the most severe AVSD defects, this is the most likely cause of the lethality in Dp3Tyb, and explains part of the lethality in Dp1Tyb. The additional lethality in Dp1Tyb is due to other causes, including hydrocephalus. We have added data on the recovery of pups from each of the 7 strains in a new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, present the data in the Results (subsection “A mouse genetic mapping panel for DS”) and comment on it in the Discussion (first paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) It would be interesting to see a table with the number of individuals studied showing the different types of CHD compared to the total of embryos in the different mouse cohorts from the 7 duplication.</italic> </p><p>This data is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> (used to be <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>The authors should also discuss the variability of the CHD and AVSD phenotypes observed in wt control animals analysed from the different cohorts of mice. For example, the wt in Dp5Tyb and DP6Tyb or Ts1Rhr showed almost 20% of CHD compared to Dp9Tyb (5%?) Dp2Tyb and Dp3Tyb (10%?). What are the origins of such discrepancies in wt cohorts? A comparison of the CHD in wild-type individuals from the different cohorts, presented as a supplementary table, would add value to the analysis.</italic> </p><p>Again, this data is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> (used to be <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), with the numbers of embryos showing specific types of defects shown against each of the 7 strains, for both WT and mutant embryos.</p><p>For convenience, the Table below shows a summary of all defects found in the WT embryos from all 7 strains together.</p><p><table-wrap id="tblu1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td><p><bold>Defect</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>Number of embryos</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>% embryos</bold></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASD</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1.2%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>VSD</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>12%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>OFT+VSD</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1.8%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AVSD+VSD</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1.2%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Total defects</p></td><td><p>27</p></td><td><p>16%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><bold>Total number of WT embryos</bold></p></td><td><p>164</p></td><td><p>100%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>We can see that the incidence of AVSDs in the WT embryos was very low (1.2%) and the most prevalent defect was a VSD (seen in 15.2%). These VSDs were generally very small and most likely represent slight developmental delay – developmental timing could vary between litters, giving the apparent differences in defects between strains.</p><p><italic>4) The authors have done their analysis after 5 backcrosses on the C57BL/6JNimr genetic background. Could they assess if this level is sufficient in this particular situation? The presence of 2 copies of the 129S8 allele on the duplicated fragment versus the B6 allele may influence the outcome of the study (and may also explain the heterogeneity of the control littermates). Thus it would be interesting to check what is the real contribution of the B6 and 129 alleles, at least for the trisomic regions in the different models.</italic> </p><p>All the analysis was carried out with embryos that had been backcrossed at least for 5 generations into B6, but in some cases much more. Specifically, Dp1Tyb was analyzed after backcrossing to C57BL/6JNimr for 6-9 generations (N6-N9), Dp2Tyb at N5, Dp3Tyb at N8, Dp4Tyb at N5-N7, Dp5Tyb at N5, Dp6Tyb at N5-N11, Dp9Tyb at N11 and Ts1Rhr at N11-N12. Note that the strains showing significant CHDs were analyzed at N6-N9 (Dp1Tyb) and N8 (Dp3Tyb). This information has been added to the Materials and methods (subsection “Mice”, last paragraph).</p><p>The reviewers ask if this level of backcrossing is sufficient and if the phenotype can be affected by the presence of 129P2 (not 129S8) alleles at the duplication. These are interesting issues but we are not able to address them directly. The first would require us to repeat the analysis at different backcross generations, which we have not done. We can point to our earlier study with Tc1 mice where we found the frequency of CHDs after N2 backcross to B6 was higher than that found in embryos on a 129xB6 F1 background (Dunlevy 2010), implying that more backcrossing to B6 makes the phenotype stronger. In the studies reported here the backcrossing was much more extensive (N6-N9 for Dp1Tyb, N8 for Dp3Tyb), but we don’t know if the phenotype would get even stronger with further backcrosses.</p><p>Regarding the contribution of the 129P2 alleles at the duplication, again we cannot judge this. The strains were all generated on a 129P2 background and then backcrossed. Such backcrossing dilutes away 129P2 alleles everywhere in the genome except around the site of the duplication. The sequences nearest the duplication will always be 129P2-derived, and the extent of remaining 129P2 DNA around this point is variable will depend stochastically on the location of meiotic crossovers. The only way to do a direct comparison would be to generate the duplications in both 129 and B6 ES cells and compare the resulting mice, something we have not done.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers ask if the extent of backcrossing could account for the difference in the incidence of defects recorded in WT mice. We don’t believe this can explain the variation in the frequency of defects. For example higher levels of defects were found in the WT mice from the Dp5Tyb (N5) and Ts1Rhr (N11-N12) strains and no defects at all in WT mice in Dp4Tyb (N5-N7) mice. So there appears to be no correlation between extent of backcross and incidence of defects in WT mice. Instead we think the large majority of defects seen in WT mice are very small VSDs, which are caused by slight developmental delay (see above).</p><p><italic>5) An important point is whether by crossing strains Dp4Tyb, Dp5Tyb and Dp6Tyb, the CHD can be reconstituted to narrow further the key genetic contributions.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is certainly interesting, and we are in the process of doing this, in order to get a better idea of where the key dosage-sensitive genes lie. These data will be used in a follow up paper and we estimate that it will take at least another 12 months before we would have sufficient data on heart structure in crosses of Dp4Tyb x Dp5Tyb, Dp4Tyb x Dp6Tyb and Dp5Tyb x Dp6Tyb (we need to analyse around 100 embryos from each cross). Of course it might turn out that all three intervals are needed, in which case we might need to make a triple Dp4Tyb x Dp5Tyb x Dp6Tyb cross to reconstitute the phenotype, which would take longer still. While interesting, this would give more information on which intervals contain dosage-sensitive genes, but would not identify the genes themselves. Thus in our view it would only be an incremental advance over what is presented in the current manuscript, and does not warrant the very long delay that would be incurred by waiting for this data.</p><p><italic>Incomplete penetrance is commonplace in CHD and the finding that two genes require three copies to produce CHD in these models is intriguing in this context and merits further discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have added text to the Discussion about incomplete penetrance of CHD seen in both humans with DS and in the mouse models (first paragraph). However, we are not sure why the reviewers think a requirement for 2 dosage-sensitive genes to be present in 3 copies would contribute to incomplete penetrance.</p><p><italic>6) The conclusions about which regions of Dp1Tyb are required in three copies to induce Downs-type heart defects rely wholly on comparisons between some very small numbers of abnormal hearts, which are usefully summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Hearts from Ts1Rhr and Dp5Tyb each had 2 AVSD (of 21 and 20 examined respectively), which is undoubtedly statistically different from the incidences in Dp1Tyb and Dp3Tyb, but it is difficult to say with certainty that there is no effect in Ts1Rhr and Dp5Tyb, particularly given that there was only 1 AVSD observed in about 170 wild type hearts. There could be a weak combinatorial effect of a number of genes throughout the region. The authors should be more cautious in the wording of their conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is certainly possible that there is a weak phenotype in Ts1Rhr and Dp5Tyb, which does not reach significance in these studies. As pointed out, each of these two strains showed 2 embryos with AVSD (out of 21 and 20 analyzed respectively). When the incidence of AVSD in these strains is compared to their littermate WT controls, the incidence in the mutants is not significantly different (p = 0.5). We estimate that if these strains have an incidence of AVSD at 10%, we would need to analyze around 60 mutant and 60 wt embryos to see a significance difference at p &lt; 0.05. We have added text to point out the possibility of a weak phenotype in these two strains (Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>[One of the AVSD in Dp5Tyb did not have an ASD or VSD, an outlier which goes without explanation or mention].</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We went back to look at the original data from this embryo again and confirmed that it did indeed have an AVSD, but it also had a very small perimembranous VSD, so it is not an outlier. We have reclassified it in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> under “VSD+AVSD”.</p><p><italic>7) For completeness, it would be useful to generate Isl1Cre lineage marked Dp1Tyb hearts, as well as the Isl1nLacZ expression (this is incorrectly termed &quot;lineage&quot; in the subsection “The DMP is present and largely unaffected in the Dp1Tyb mouse model for DS”) marked hearts. It would be informative to show these data at E14.5, in definitively AVSD hearts.</italic> </p><p>We do not have data from such a cross. We estimate that to breed the relevant mice and analyse the embryos could take 9-12 months. However in our view this would not add much to the paper.</p><p>The reviewers have asked for this because at E14.5 Isl1 is no longer expressed in the DMP, and so cannot be visualized using LacZ expression from the Isl1nLacZ reporter. The Isl1Cre x R26RLacZ cross referred to by the reviewers is a fate reporter and so LacZ expression persists in the DMP at E14.5. However we do not need to cross this to the Dp1Tyb in order to identify the DMP. We can readily identify the DMP in the 3D HREM data at E14.5 using morphological criteria, in part because we have previously used the Isl1Cre x R26RLacZ fate reporter in wild-type embryos to locate this tissue. Crossing it to Dp1Tyb, would make the study more complete, but, in our view, would not add any further insights into the pathology.</p><p>We have corrected the incorrect reference to lineage (subsection “Development of the DMP”).</p></body></sub-article> </article>
