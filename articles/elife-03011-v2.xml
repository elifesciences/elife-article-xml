and short-term synaptic plasticity. Whereas synaptotagmins are known to mediate vesicle fusion through binding of high local Ca<sup>2+</sup> to their C2 domains, the proteins that sense smaller global Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases to produce short-term plasticity have remained elusive. Here, we identify a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a form of plasticity thought to underlie short-term memory. We find that at the functionally mature calyx of Held synapse the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase C isoforms α and β are necessary for PTP, and the expression of PKCβ in PKCαβ double knockout mice rescues PTP. Disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the PKCβ C2 domain specifically prevents PTP without impairing other PKCβ-dependent forms of synaptic enhancement. We conclude that different C2-domain-containing presynaptic proteins are engaged by different Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases evoked by tetanic stimulation are sensed by PKCβ to produce PTP.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03011.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03011.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03011.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Brain function is dependent upon the rapid transfer of information from one brain cell to the next at junctions known as synapses. When an electrical signal called an action potential is generated by the cell before the synapse, the presynaptic cell, it triggers an influx of calcium ions into that cell. These ions activate specific calcium sensors, triggering release of molecules called neurotransmitters from the presynaptic cell through exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic cell, and produce an electrical signal whose size is a measure of synaptic strength.</p><p>The strength of a synapse can change over time—a property that is called plasticity. Synapses can undergo both long-term and short-term increases in strength. Post-tetanic potentiation is a short-term increase in strength that lasts for tens of seconds: it is triggered by a calcium increase in the presynaptic cell and involves an increase in the amount of neurotransmitter released in response to each presynaptic action potential. Post-tetanic potentiation is thought to underlie short-term memory. However, the identity of the sensor that detects the build-up of calcium in post-tetanic potentiation was not known.</p><p>Now, Fioravante, Chu et al. have provided the first direct evidence that an enzyme called protein kinase C is responsible. Electrophysiological recordings in brain slices from genetically modified mice revealed that animals that lack protein kinase C do not show post-tetanic potentiation. However, potentiation can be restored by re-introducing the enzyme into presynaptic cells. Importantly, a mutated version of protein kinase C that lacks the ability to bind calcium is unable to trigger post-tetanic potentiation.</p><p>Protein kinase C represents a new class of presynaptic calcium sensors that supports short-term plasticity. It is likely that future studies will identify additional members of this class of sensors that allow different synapses to have different forms of short-term plasticity. Further research is also needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying short-term plasticity and to understand how different forms of short-term plasticity are associated with different functions and behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03011.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03011.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>post-tetanic potentiation</kwd><kwd>short-term plasticity</kwd><kwd>protein kinase C</kwd><kwd>synaptotagmin</kwd><kwd>phorbol ester</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS032405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regehr</surname><given-names>Wade G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32NS007484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fioravante</surname><given-names>Diasynou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01DA029044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30-DC013716-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>YunXiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO 825.12.028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Jong</surname><given-names>Arthur PH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011 Medical Fellows Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>YunXiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and electrophysiology experiments provide the first direct evidence that protein kinase C is a calcium-sensing protein in post-tetanic potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity that supports short-term memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The complex manner in which patterns of action potentials (AP) are transformed into neurotransmitter release suggests the existence of multiple presynaptic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaeser and Regehr, 2013</xref>). Synaptotagmin-1, synaptotagmin-2, and synaptotagmin-9 have been identified as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for synchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sudhof, 2013</xref>), but the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors that regulate short-term use-dependent plasticity remain elusive. For a widespread form of short-term plasticity termed post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a high-frequency burst of presynaptic APs enhances subsequent AP-evoked release for tens of seconds. PTP requires sustained elevation of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and in most cases synaptic enhancement outlives Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Regehr et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brager et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Habets and Borst, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fioravante et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>). Although PTP is thought to contribute to short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Silva et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</xref>), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that mediates this plasticity has not been identified.</p><p>Three Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC<sub>Ca</sub>; PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCγ) play crucial roles in PTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fioravante et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chu et al., 2014</xref>). Because these isoforms contain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding C2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutton and Sprang, 1998</xref>), we hypothesize that they function as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for PTP. However, it is unclear whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding properties of the C2 domain of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kohout et al., 2002</xref>) are well-suited to mediate PTP, which is thought to rely, at least in part, on the waning residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> after the AP burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fioravante and Regehr, 2011</xref>). Moreover, diacylglycerol (DAG) binding to the C1 domain of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) can regulate the activity of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Newton, 2010</xref>), and it has been proposed that PKC could play a permissive role in PTP rather than function as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saitoh et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, presynaptic C2-domain proteins do not necessarily function as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors; rather, they can regulate release independent of their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding properties (for an example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, additional Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins have been implicated in short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Junge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mochida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), but it has not been established that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to these proteins is required for short-term plasticity. Thus, in order to determine whether PKC<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms are Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors that mediate PTP, it must be determined if PTP relies on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the PKC<sub>Ca</sub> C2 domain.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03011.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of PKCβ rescues synaptic potentiation in animals lacking calcium-dependent PKCs.</title><p>Synaptic plasticity was examined at the calyx of Held following tetanic stimulation (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>F</bold>) or bath application of the phorbol ester PDBu (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>G</bold>) for wild-type (wt, <italic>black</italic>), PKCαβ dko animals (<italic>purple</italic>), and PKCαβ dko animals expressing PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP (<italic>green</italic>).

We tested whether PTP could also be induced under more physiological conditions (34°C, 1.5 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 1.2 mM external Mg<sup>2+</sup>). In this recording from a representative cell, we first induced PTP with our standard stimulation protocol (100 Hz, 4 s) at 24°C (top). We then increased the temperature to 34°C, repeated the induction protocol, but failed to obtain PTP (middle). However, we successfully induced PTP at 34°C in the same cell with higher frequency stimulation (400 Hz, 2 s). We found that at elevated-temperature, PTP could not be reliably induced with the 100 Hz, 4 s stimulation protocol (2.9% ± 0.6%, n = 8 cells) but it could be readily obtained with the 400 Hz, 2 s protocol (83 ± 14%, n = 5 cells). These results indicate that PTP can be obtained under near-physiological conditions.

We recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from principal neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in response to extracellular stimulation. Tetanic stimulation induced PTP in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>black</italic>) but not in PKCαβ dko animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>purple</italic>). Thus, in contrast to the immature calyx of Held where a substantial component of PTP (∼20%) is independent of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fioravante et al., 2011</xref>), PTP at the functionally mature calyx of Held relies entirely on PKC<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms.</p><p>We further tested whether the contribution of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> to a related form of potentiation that occludes PTP also increases with development. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), a DAG analog, can enhance transmission by activating not only PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but also Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive PKC isoforms and other presynaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brose and Rosenmund, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Newton, 2010</xref>). At immature calyces, ∼35% of PDBu-mediated enhancement is independent of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fioravante et al., 2011</xref>). We found that PDBu enhances release at functionally mature wild-type calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>black</italic>) but not at age-matched αβ dko calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>purple</italic>). Thus, at the functionally mature calyx of Held, both PTP and PDBu-mediated enhancement rely entirely on PKC<sub>Ca</sub>, suggesting that the contributions of parallel mechanisms to these forms of plasticity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wierda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) diminish with development.</p><p>Although most of the studies presented here were performed at room temperature, we also examined PTP at near-physiological temperatures (34°C). Higher stimulus frequencies were required to induce PTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), but PTP was still dependent on PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed whether presynaptic expression of PKCβ in αβ dko animals rescues PTP. PKCβ was chosen because genetic deletion of PKCα had little effect on PTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that PTP is mediated primarily by PKCβ at the functionally mature calyx. We generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV), which we used to express wild-type PKCβ fused to yellow fluorescent protein (PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP) in αβ dko animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Two weeks after injection, virally expressed PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP localized to glutamatergic terminals positive for the marker vGlut1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast to non-injected αβ dko animals, we observed reliable PTP at synapses expressing PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <italic>green</italic>; compare to non-injected age-matched αβ dko animals, <italic>purple</italic>). Expression of PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP did not alter basal synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP expression supported PDBu-induced potentiation in αβ dko mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <italic>green</italic>), which was very similar in amplitude to that observed in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>black</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Thus, expression of PKCβ is sufficient to rescue PTP and PDBu-mediated enhancement in PKC αβ dko animals.</p><p>To determine whether rescued PTP and PTP in wild-type animals are mediated by the same synaptic mechanism, we calculated the paired-pulse ratios (PPR = EPSC2/EPSC1) before and at the peak of PTP. If PTP reflects an increase in vesicular release probability (<italic>p</italic>), which is inversely related to PPR, then PPR<sub>POST</sub>/PPR<sub>PRE</sub> should decrease. However, PPR<sub>POST</sub>/PPR<sub>PRE</sub> was unchanged in both wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <italic>black</italic>) and αβ dko animals expressing PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <italic>green</italic>). This suggests that in both groups PTP is not mediated by an increase in <italic>p</italic>. We next examined the contribution of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles to PTP by evoking EPSCs with AP trains before and at the peak of PTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) and found that PTP was mediated by equivalent increases in the RRP in wild-type and rescued groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Thus, at the functionally mature calyx, the same mechanism mediates PTP in wild-type animals and at synapses in PKCαβ dko animals that express PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP.</p><p>To determine if PKCβ is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for PTP, it is necessary to abolish Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to PKCβ. To this end, we mutated five C2-domain aspartates (D) to alanines (A) and examined the effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding using purified recombinant wild-type C2 (C2<sup>WT</sup>) and mutant C2<sup>D/A</sup> domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We utilized this property to test the effects of the D-to-A mutations on the response of PKCβ to Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases. We expressed PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP or PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP in HEK293T cells and monitored the subcellular distribution of the kinase. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin induced translocation of PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <italic>top left</italic>), but did not alter the intracellular distribution of PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <italic>top right</italic>). In contrast, PDBu, which binds to the C1 domain, caused both PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP and PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP to translocate. This result indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the PKC C2 domain is necessary for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced, but not PDBu-induced, translocation of PKCβ. Moreover, it suggests that D-to-A mutations in the C2 domain prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of PKCβ without interfering with C1-domain-mediated membrane recruitment of PKCβ.</p><p>We next tested whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the PKCβ C2 domain is required for PTP. Using AAV to express PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP, we found that PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP localized to vGlut1-positive areas and distributed similarly to PKCβ<sup>WT</sup>-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Expression of PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP in αβ dko calyces, similar to wild-type PKCβ, did not affect basal synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). However, in stark contrast to wild-type PKCβ, PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup> failed to rescue PTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>blue</italic>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, left). The inability of PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP to support PTP could be due to a loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to PKCβ; alternatively, the D-to-A mutations may have induced more profound impairments of PKCβ, rendering it unable to enhance neurotransmitter release. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested PDBu-induced potentiation in PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP-expressing calyces. Compellingly, PDBu-induced potentiation in PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP-expressing calyces was rescued to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>blue</italic>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right). This indicates that PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP retained its ability to enhance synaptic transmission. We conclude that PKCβ<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP is unable to mediate PTP because it is unable to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C2 domain of PKCβ is required for PTP.

Similar to synaptotagmin-1, synaptotagmin-2, and synaptotagmin-9, PKCβ requires binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to its C2 domain for its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, PKCβ acts upstream of vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Jong and Verhage, 2009</xref>), does not regulate basal transmission or paired-pulse plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), and is not expected to be activated by single stimuli. How do PKCβ and synaptotagmins respond to such different activity patterns and, consequently, such different Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals? It is likely a combination of differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding properties and subcellular localization that underlie these contrasting responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nalefski et al., 2001</xref>). Synaptotagmin-1 binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> cooperatively with low affinity and fast kinetics, and localizes close to release sites on synaptic vesicles; therefore, it is poised to detect large, transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals near open voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sudhof, 2013</xref>). In contrast, PKCβ is activated by lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with lower cooperativity and is cytosolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nalefski and Newton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kohout et al., 2002</xref>). Prolonged stimulation is necessary to produce a sufficient buildup of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to activate PKCβ, which is consistent with the prolonged activity requirement for PTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Habets and Borst, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>It is unlikely that PKCβ is the sole Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that triggers PTP. At the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse, PTP can be dependent on either PKCα or PKCβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fioravante et al., 2012</xref>), and at the calyx of Held synapse prior to the onset of hearing PTP depends on PKCγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chu et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive PKC isoforms, including PKCα and PKCγ, may constitute a class of proteins that acts as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for PTP, much as multiple isoforms of synaptotagmin act as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for fast synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sudhof, 2012</xref>). Further studies are required to determine whether PKCα, PKCγ, and other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive proteins implicated in PTP, such as Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wierda et al., 2007</xref>), calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Junge et al., 2004</xref>), and synaptotagmin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xue and Wu, 2010</xref>), can also act as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors to produce PTP.</p><p>PKCβ mediates PTP by phosphorylating downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Genç et al., 2014</xref>), which could explain how PTP outlives elevations of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fioravante and Regehr, 2011</xref>). We suggest that PKCβ is a founding member of a new class of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors that function upstream of vesicle fusion to regulate short-term plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs and viruses</title><p>Cloning was performed by Genscript.

PKCαβ double knockout (dko) mice were obtained through breeding of PKCα and PKCβ single knockout (ko) animals generated by M Leitges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leitges et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2002</xref>). The probability of obtaining an αβ double knockout animal from heterologous (het) crosses is very low (1:16), making viral injection experiments unfeasible. We therefore bred het-ko animals together to increase the probability of getting desired animals. Similarly, to increase the probability of obtaining wild-type mice, we crossed PKC het–het or het-wild-type mice to use as wild-type controls. Wild-type mice were derived from the same genetic line as αβ dko animals. To prevent genetic drift in the inbred ko lines, we backcrossed them every second generation to C57BL/6J or 129S2. For experiments, animals of both sexes were used and age-matched wild-type, PKCα ko and PKCαβ dko mice from our colony were interleaved.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgery</title><p>P4 pups were stereotactically and unilaterally injected under isofluorane anesthesia with AAVs into the VCn (from lambda: 1.3 mm lateral, 0.9 mm caudal, 3 mm ventral), where globular bushy cells that give rise to calyx of Held synapses in the contralateral MNTB reside. Injections (600 nl at a rate of 1 nl/s) were performed with an UltraMicroPump (UMP3, WPI, Sarasota FL) and Wiretrol II capillary micropipettes (Drummond Scientific, Broomall PA) pulled to a fine tip (10–20 µm diameter). At this age, the skull is sufficiently soft so it can be penetrated with a 28<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>–gage needle without the need for drilling. After the injection, the skin was closed with Gluture (Abbott Laboratories, Irving TX), and pups were allowed to recover on a heating pad prior to returning to the home cage. 14–18 days were allowed for expression prior to slice preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Preparation of brain slices</title><p>The calyx of Held synapse in the auditory brainstem was chosen for this study because of its monosynaptic innervation and its amenability to viral manipulations. Indeed, our study would not be possible at more ‘conventional’ polysynaptic preparations such as the CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapse because it is not possible to infect 100% of synapses with viruses. Transverse 190-µm to 200-µm-thick brainstem slices containing the MNTB were made with a vibratome slicer (VT1000S, Leica, Buffalo Grove IL) from juvenile (postnatal day 17–22) mice deeply anesthetized with isoflurane.

Slices were superfused at 1–3 ml/min with this external solution. Whole-cell postsynaptic patch-clamp recordings were made from visually identified cells in the MNTB region using glass pipettes of 2–3 MΩ resistance, filled with an internal recording solution of the following (in mM): 20 CsCl, 140 Cs-gluconate, 20 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na. Series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) was compensated by up to 70%, and the membrane potential was held at −70 mV.</p><p>EPSCs were evoked by stimulating presynaptic axons with a custom-made bipolar stimulating electrode midway between the medial border of the MNTB and the midline of the brainstem. For slice recordings from injected animals, principal neurons in the MNTB contralateral to the injection site were selected based on the presence of YFP-expressing presynaptic terminals. A Multiclamp 700B (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA) amplifier was used. Recordings were digitized at 20 KHz with an ITC-18 A/D converter (Instrutech Corp./HEKA Elektronik, Bellmore NY) using custom macros (written by MA Xu-Friedman) in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Portland OR) and filtered at 8 kHz.

PTP was induced with a 4-s stimulus train at 100 Hz, followed by low-frequency stimulation to test for PTP. For phorbol ester experiments, PDBu (1 µM; Tocris, UK) was washed in for 10 min once a stable baseline of at least 3 min was established. Synaptic strength was evaluated by afferent fiber stimuli, repeated every 20 s. During the inter-trial intervals, 5 s stretches of postsynaptic current were recorded to assess the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs. To assess PPR, pulses were delivered at an inter-stimulus interval of 10 ms. For all recordings, the access resistance and leak current were monitored, and experiments were rejected if either of these parameters changed significantly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using routines written in IgorPro (WaveMetrics). PTP magnitude was calculated as the ratio of EPSC amplitude 10 s after the 4-s, 100 Hz train over the average baseline. The magnitude of PDBu-induced potentiation was estimated by averaging the steady-state responses, 430–600 s from wash-in onset. To analyze spontaneous events, mEPSCs were detected using a threshold (average peak to peak noise in the baseline) of the first derivative of the raw current trace and confirmed visually. Statistical analyses were done using one-way ANOVA tests for multiple group comparisons followed by Tukey post-hoc analysis, or Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric ANOVA for data sets that were not normally distributed. Pairwise comparisons were performed with Student's <italic>t</italic> tests. Level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p><p>To determine the contributions of RRP and <italic>p</italic> to wild-type and rescued PTP, stimulus trains were used in the presence of kynurenate (1 mM) and CTZ (0.1 mM) to prevent postsynaptic receptor saturation and desensitization. Briefly, the amplitude of the first 40 responses to the stimulus train used to induce PTP and to a stimulus train (400 ms, 100 Hz) 10 s later (at the peak of PTP) were measured, and a plot of the cumulative EPSC for each train vs the stimulus number was made. The key to this approach is that the EPSC amplitude eventually reaches a steady-state level, and under these conditions the RRP is depleted and the remaining release is due to replenishment from a recycling/reserve pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>). The size of the RRP can then be determined by a linear fit to the steady-state responses (last 15 EPSCs), which is extrapolated back to the y-axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moulder and Mennerick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thanawala and Regehr, 2013</xref>). <italic>p</italic> is then calculated from EPSC1/RRP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>150-µm thick transverse brainstem slices were prepared as described above from P18–P22 animals injected with AAVs and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hr at 4°C.

For example, one reviewer noted:</p><p>“My only concern is whether the finding here is of general application. Several studies have proposed that other Ca2+ binding proteins are involved in PTP, such as Munc 13 (Rhee JS, et al 2002), Calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Junge et. al, 2004</xref>). Could these proteins also be calcium sensors or the downstream targets of PKC? Alternatively, synapse specificity may explain the difference in different synapses. In addition, a PKC independent form of PTP, which involves synaptotagmin 2 as the calcium sensor, has also been reported in the calyx (He et al., Nature, 2009; Xue and Wu, J Physiol., 2010). A discussion to justify why the finding here is of more general application is therefore needed.

In the ideal world we would prefer to perform all experiments at physiological temperatures, but this is impractical. The reviewers are right that it is important to show that PTP is also observed at physiological temperatures and that it is mediated by PKC<sub>Ca</sub>. We have been interested in this issue for some time and had begun to perform PTP experiments at near physiological temperatures. We found that higher stimulation frequencies were required to induce PTP at near physiological temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). We went on to investigate the role of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> in this PTP. We could have used knockout mice, but our colony is currently small and breeding would have to be ramped up to obtain the necessary mice. We therefore used a PKC<sub>Ca</sub> inhibitor that we had previously characterized using knockout mice to validate its specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chu et al. 2014</xref>). We found that the PTP at 34°C is also mediated by PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
