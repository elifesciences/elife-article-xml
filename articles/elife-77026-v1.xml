sulfonylurea receptor subunits (SUR1). The ATP sensitivity of these channels enables them to couple metabolic state to insulin secretion in β cells. Antidiabetic sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide target SUR1 and indirectly suppress Kir6.2 activity. Glibenclamide acts as both a primary and a secondary secretagogue to trigger insulin secretion and potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, respectively. We tested whether blocking Kir6.2 itself causes the same effects as glibenclamide, and found that the Kir6.2 pore-blocking venom toxin SpTx1 acts as a strong secondary, but not a strong primary, secretagogue. SpTx1 triggered a transient rise of plasma insulin and lowered the elevated blood glucose of diabetic mice overexpressing Kir6.2 but did not affect those of nondiabetic mice. This proof-of-concept study suggests that blocking Kir6.2 may serve as an effective treatment for diabetes and other diseases stemming from K<sub>ATP</sub> hyperactivity that cannot be adequately suppressed with sulfonylureas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>K<sub>ATP</sub> channel</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>SpTx1</kwd><kwd>venom toxin</kwd><kwd>insulin secretion</kwd><kwd>Diabetes</kwd><kwd>sulfonylureas</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK109979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM055560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK098517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoshi</surname><given-names>Toshinori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-DK19525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoshi</surname><given-names>Toshinori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The centipede peptide toxin SpTx1 blocks the pore of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic β cells to markedly enhance insulin secretion and mitigate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice insensitive to the anti-diabetic sulfonylurea glibenclamide.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases that all manifest elevated blood glucose levels but with different underlying causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">American Diabetes Association, 2011</xref>). Among these diseases, neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) was traditionally considered a variant in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and had accordingly been treated with insulin. Since the early 2000s, NDM has been recognized as a genetic disorder that stems from gain-of-function mutations in pancreatic ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gloyn et al., 2004</xref>). The octameric K<sub>ATP</sub> channel protein complexes, each of which consists of four pore-forming inward-rectifier 6.2 (<italic>Kcnj11</italic> or Kir6.2) subunits and four surrounding auxiliary sulfonylurea receptor 1 (<italic>Abcc8</italic> or SUR1) subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Bryan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inagaki et al., 1995</xref>), are present in the plasma membrane of β cells within islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. The discovery of the mutations underlying NDM was anticipated by the experimental demonstration in mice that the expression of Kir6.2 with gain-of-function mutations caused hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koster et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequently, this mutation-caused pathological phenomenon was further examined in mice by overexpressing another gain-of-function mutant Kir6.2 known to cause NDM at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Girard et al., 2009</xref>). Mutations in Kir6.2 tend to cause more severe phenotypes of NDM than those in SUR1, and the hyperactivity of the resulting mutant K<sub>ATP</sub> channels is less likely to be adequately suppressed by sulfonylureas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hattersley and Ashcroft, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pipatpolkai et al., 2020</xref>). The severe-phenotype-causing mutations of Kir6.2 are also associated with developmental delay, epilepsy, and permanent neonatal diabetes (DEND syndrome). In this regard, Kir6.2 represents a new potential drug target.</p><p>K<sub>ATP</sub> channels were originally discovered in the plasma membrane of cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noma, 1983</xref>) and later found to exist in many other tissue types. K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in pancreatic β cells are inhibited by both extracellular glucose and intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashcroft et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rorsman and Trube, 1985</xref>). The ATP sensitivity of these channels is thought to contribute to the regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells in the following manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashcroft and Rorsman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashcroft and Rorsman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nichols, 2006</xref>). When the blood glucose concentration is low, the overall metabolism in β cells remains low. Consequently, the ratio of intracellular ATP to ADP is relatively low, and the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels tend to be open, helping to maintain the hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>). An elevated blood glucose level increases the metabolism in β cells and thus the ratio of intracellular ATP to ADP. An increase in ATP relative to ADP inhibits K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, depolarizing <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and thereby increasing the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Ca<sub>V</sub>) activity. An increased Ca<sub>V</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx raises the concentration of intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>), a signal required for triggering robust exocytotic secretion of insulin.</p><p>As a class of the antidiabetic drugs, sulfonylureas act as impactful primary secretagogues, triggering insulin release in the presence of a nonstimulating, basal concentration of glucose. These drugs also act as strong secondary secretagogues, robustly potentiating the insulin secretion stimulated by an elevated concentration of glucose. Sulfonylureas bind to SUR1 and thereby indirectly inhibit currents through the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gribble and Reimann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henquin, 1992</xref>). The commonly used sulfonylurea glibenclamide is membrane permeable and has been shown to lodge inside SUR1, and its effect on insulin secretion cannot be rapidly reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schatz et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The suppression of K<sub>ATP</sub> activity undoubtedly contributes to the ability of glibenclamide to promote insulin secretion; however, some studies have suggested that glibenclamide also interacts with other proteins involved in the secretory process, in addition to K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eliasson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lehtihet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Renström et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shibasaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tian et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, while the plasma membrane of β cells is strongly depolarized by raising the concentration of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> to 30 mM, an application of glibenclamide under this depolarized condition can still promote additional insulin secretion without further changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2007</xref>). These findings about the glibenclamide action raise the question that to what extent, a direct blockade of the ion-conduction pore of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel alone mimics the primary and secondary secretagogue effects of glibenclamide. To address this question, an effective inhibitor of Kir6.2 itself is required.</p><p>Our group previously searched for inhibitors of human Kir6.2 (hKir6.2) and discovered that five small proteins in the venoms of certain centipedes inhibited hKir6.2. In particular, a 54-residue protein toxin isolated from the venom of <italic>Scolopendra polymorpha</italic>, dubbed SpTx1, is the most potent inhibitor with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 15 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramu and Lu, 2019</xref>). Here, using SpTx1, we set out to test the impact of a direct blockade of Kir6.2 on insulin secretion in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SpTx1 does not affect the blood glucose levels in wild-type mice</title><p>We examined whether SpTx1 had an influence on the fasting blood glucose levels of wild-type mice. The blood glucose level of the overnight-fasted wild-type mice was 173 (±3.18) mg/dl in the following morning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given that the blood glucose level of wild-type mice can be lowered by glibenclamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Remedi and Nichols, 2008</xref>), we used it as a positive control. As expected, a single intraperitoneal application of glibenclamide (40 mg/kg body weight) lowered the blood glucose level of wild-type mice by half at the end of a 2-hr observation period whereas that of the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) did not have any meaningful effect. To assess the effects of SpTx1 on the blood glucose levels, intravenous (IV) injection was used to administer SpTx1 to avoid the interpretation of the result being confounded by the toxin’s bioavailability. SpTx1 at a dose of 1 mg/kg neither had discernible effect on the blood glucose levels of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) nor caused other noticeable differences during the observation period, when compared to wild-type mice administered with the vehicle saline. Using total blood volume, this dose of SpTx1 is calculated to be 3 µM, ~200 times the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of SpTx1 against hKir6.2. The finding that SpTx1, estimated to be at 3 µM in the blood, had no effect on the blood glucose level, suggests that the toxin does not have any consequential actions (in the present context) by either inhibiting mouse Kir6.2 (mKir6.2) channels or acting on unintended targets in wild-type mice.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SpTx1 does not affect the blood glucose level or potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from isolated pancreatic islets of wild-type B6J mice.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Blood glucose levels (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], <italic>n</italic> = 5 independent experiments for each dataset) of overnight-fasted mice (8–12 weeks of age) measured at indicated time points during a 2-hr observation period.

To perform this test, we adopted a static assay of insulin release from isolated islets incubated in microwell plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remedi et al., 2009</xref>). We used high concentrations of SpTx1 between 0.2 and 1 μM in the bath solutions because there was likely a SpTx1 concentration gradient from the extracellular solution to the interior of an islet. In this concentration range, SpTx1 failed to alter insulin secretion in the presence of either 7 or 15 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, SpTx1 had no significant effects on GSIS either through acting on mKir6.2 or any unintended targets within the wild-type mouse islets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SpTx1 does not depolarize the membrane potential of β cells in pancreatic islets from wild-type mice</title><p>The prevailing excitation–secretion coupling paradigm regarding β cells postulates that a blockade of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in pancreatic β cells markedly depolarizes <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> to trigger insulin release. Previous studies reported that dissociated β cells exhibited altered electrophysiological properties, for example, a much greater cell-to-cell variation in glucose sensitivity, compared with the cells in isolated islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salomon and Meda, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scarl et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> responses of individual cells in isolated but intact islets were recorded in the perforated whole-cell mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In a typical mouse islet, up to 80% of the cells are β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steiner et al., 2010</xref>). In our measurements, β cells were identified by their characteristic glucose-stimulated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization and subsequent bursts of (non-overshooting) action potentials. Illustrative <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes in responses to an increase of the extracellular glucose concentration to 15 mM from the starting concentration of 0, 5, or 8 mM are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>. For example, increasing the glucose concentration from 0 to 15 mM led to <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization and a burst of action potentials in a reversible manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, blue and black segments), thus functionally confirming that the recorded cell was a β cell. Subsequent application of SpTx1 at 0.2 µM had little effect on <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, orange segment) but that of the sulfonylurea glibenclamide at 0.4 µM dramatically depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and triggered a train of action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, purple segment). Similar results documenting the ineffectiveness of SpTx1 and the contrasting effectiveness of glibenclamide in inducing <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization were also observed using the starting extracellular glucose concentrations of 5 and 8 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>).

First, we compared the effects of SpTx1 on currents through channels that consisted of hKir6.2 + hSUR1, hKir6.2 + mSUR1, mKir6.2 + mSUR1, and mKir6.2 + hSUR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>).

Because 0.2–1 μM SpTx1 did not potentiate insulin secretion from isolated wild-type mouse islets in 7 or 15 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we first tested the effect of a SpTx1 concentration within this range on GSIS from isolated islets of <sup>Endo</sup>mKir6.2<sup>V108E</sup> mice. Inclusion of 0.5 μM SpTx1 in the perifusion solution potentiated insulin secretion in 10 mM glucose to a level between that in 10 mM glucose alone and in 10 mM glucose plus glibenclamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, orange trace). Following removal of high glucose by subsequent perifusion with a solution containing 3 mM glucose, which also washed out extracellularly bound SpTx1, insulin secretion returned to the baseline level. This potentiating effect of SpTx1 on GSIS from islets of <sup>Endo</sup>mKir6.2<sup>V108E</sup> mice, not from those of wild-type mice, strongly implies that SpTx1 generated this effect by blocking Kir6.2 channels harboring the introduced V108E mutation.</p><p>We wondered whether SpTx1 diffused slowly into islets to reach β cells, and a preincubation of islets with SpTx1 would thus produce a greater potentiation of GSIS. To examine this possibility, we added SpTx1 10 min before raising glucose concentration to allow more time for equilibration. We found that, whether added earlier or at the same time as raising the glucose concentration, SpTx1 had comparable potentiating effects on GSIS in 10 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The potentiating effects of glibenclamide were also comparable regardless of whether it was applied concurrently with or before glucose elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Adding these two inhibitors 10 min before the high glucose challenge also provided us an opportunity to evaluate SpTx1 and glibenclamide as primary secretagogues, triggering insulin secretion in the presence of a nonstimulating concentration of glucose. In the presence of nonstimulating 3 mM glucose, glibenclamide triggered sizable secretion of insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, purple trace) whereas SpTx1 caused no detectable insulin secretion above the baseline level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, blue trace).</p><p>Furthermore, we also examined the effect of SpTx1 on insulin secretion in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose, which is an empirically determined optimal concentration commonly used to stimulate a very high level of insulin secretion from mouse islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcazar and Buchwald, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerasi, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malaisse et al., 1967</xref>). Either glibenclamide or SpTx1 was added into the perifusion solution containing 3 mM glucose, 10 min before raising glucose to 16.7 mM. In the presence of 3 mM glucose, glibenclamide again stimulated sizable secretion of insulin, which decreased somewhat with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, purple trace). Raising glucose to 16.7 mM in the presence of glibenclamide caused much greater secretion of insulin than it did in the absence of glibenclamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, purple trace versus black trace). The same procedure was repeated with SpTx1. In the presence of 3 mM glucose, 0.5 μM SpTx1 did not stimulate insulin secretion above the baseline level but did markedly potentiate insulin secretion in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, blue trace versus black trace), albeit less than that potentiated by 1 μM glibenclamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, blue trace versus purple trace). As we increased the SpTx1 concentration to 2 μM, SpTx1 potentiated insulin secretion in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose to a level comparable to that caused by 1 μM glibenclamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, vermilion trace versus purple trace in the ~30 to ~60 min region). These observations establish a pair of practically equivalent concentrations for the two inhibitors to act as secondary insulin secretagogues. This is perhaps not surprising because 1 μM glibenclamide in the presence of physiological concentrations of intracellular ATP and 2 μM SpTx1 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 20 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) are both expected to inhibit 99% of the K<sup>+</sup> current carried by their target channels on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Proks et al., 2013</xref>).

These comparable secondary secretagogue effects but differing primary secretagogue effects between glibenclamide and SpTx1 are more clearly shown by the ratio of the mean insulin secretion in the presence of 1 μM glibenclamide to that in the presence of 2 μM SpTx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, shaded area under the orange curve in the lower panel).

In the present study, we found that at 0.2 µM concentration, SpTx1 failed to depolarize β cells, and at a concentration as high as 1 μM, SpTx1 had no discernable effects on GSIS from β cells in isolated pancreatic islets of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). This ineffectiveness led us to determine that SpTx1 blocks mKir6.2 with much lower potency than it blocks hKir6.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Through a series of mutagenesis studies, we found that this low-affinity interaction between mKir6.2 and SpTx1 stems from the presence of a valine residue at position 108 in mKir6.2 whereas it is a glutamate residue in hKir6.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Replacing the valine residue in mKir6.2 by a glutamate residue confers the high affinity of hKir6.2 for SpTx1 on mKir6.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This mechanistic information led us to create the SpTx1-sensitive <sup>Endo</sup>mKir6.2<sup>V108E</sup> mouse line. Using isolated islets of these SpTx1-senstive-mutant mice, we found that contrary to the expectation of Kir6.2 inhibition causing sufficient <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization and robust insulin secretion, SpTx1 does not impactfully depolarize β cells in glucose concentrations less than 5 mM and it is not an effective primary insulin secretagogue in 3 mM glucose. Nonetheless, SpTx1 depolarizes β cells and elicits action potentials in higher concentrations of glucose and acts as an effective secondary secretagogue, strongly potentiating GSIS from these islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p><p>SpTx1 inhibits K<sub>ATP</sub> channels by blocking their ion-conduction pore whereas glibenclamide inhibits the channels by disrupting their nucleotide-dependent gating. Despite this difference, if both SpTx1 and glibenclamide promote insulin secretion solely by inhibiting K<sup>+</sup> currents through mKir6.2, increasing the concentration of SpTx1 to a sufficiently high level should produce effects that would match those produced by glibenclamide, in the presence of whether a nonstimulating or an optimal stimulating concentration of glucose. We observed that glibenclamide triggered sizable secretion of insulin in 3 mM glucose and potentiated insulin secretion in 16.7 mM glucose to a much higher level than glucose alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, 0.5 μM SpTx1 did not trigger observable insulin secretion in 3 mM glucose or potentiate insulin secretion in 16.7 mM glucose as strongly as glibenclamide. However, at 2 μM, SpTx1 did produce such a strong secondary secretagogue effect in 16.7 mM glucose that it potentiated GSIS to a level comparable to what was caused by glibenclamide, but it failed to act as a strong primary secretagogue to stimulate as much insulin secretion in 3 mM glucose as glibenclamide did. Thus, at a sufficiently high concentration, SpTx1 can act as an effective secondary insulin secretagogue like glibenclamide but it does not appear to act as an effective primary insulin secretagogue.</p><p>One possible reason for these differing effects of SpTx1 and glibenclamide in a nonstimulating glucose concentration versus an optimal stimulating glucose concentration is that SpTx1 potentiated GSIS by acting on an off-target. However, we did not observe any meaningful potentiating effects of SpTx1 on GSIS from isolated islets of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) before we conferred a high SpTx1 affinity on their endogenous mKir6.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Furthermore, SpTx1 can counteract the inhibitory effect of the K<sub>ATP</sub> opener diazoxide on GSIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Thus, a potential off-target mechanism is unlikely.</p><p>An alternative possibility is that SpTx1 does not have all of the pharmacological actions of glibenclamide because glibenclamide may stimulate insulin secretion not solely by inhibiting Kir6.2 channels in the plasma membrane of β cells. Glibenclamide has been shown to cause an additional amount of insulin secretion, even after the membrane potential was clamped to a depolarized level by raising the extracellular K<sup>+</sup> to a constant 30 mM such that the impact of any alteration of the Kir6.2 activity on the membrane potential of the β cells and consequently the Ca<sub>v</sub> activity would become negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, glibenclamide may have one or more additional effective targets other than the cell surface K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, and hence the extracellular Kir6.2-blocker SpTx1 cannot effectively mimic every action of glibenclamide. Indeed, many studies have shown that glibenclamide interacts with other proteins including syntaxin-1A and Epac2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eliasson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lehtihet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Renström et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shibasaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tian et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).

On the other hand, being an effective secondary but not an effective primary secretagogue, SpTx1 will only strongly promote insulin secretion when blood glucose level becomes highly elevated but it will not meaningfully stimulate insulin secretion at a resting level of blood glucose – a desirable outcome unlikely to cause unwanted hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asplund et al., 1983</xref>). Consistent with these predictions, we observed that administration of SpTx1 did not trigger insulin secretion or lower the blood glucose levels in <sup>Endo</sup>mKir6.2<sup>V108E</sup> mice, but it caused transient insulin secretion and markedly lowered the highly elevated glucose level in diabetic <sup>Rosa26</sup>mKir6.2<sup>NDM-V108E</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In the future, it will be interesting to learn in animal models whether the transient characteristic of insulin secretion caused by SpTx1 helps to mitigate problems associated with overstimulation of insulin secretion and ‘exhaustion’ of β cells, which can occur with the use of sulfonylureas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maedler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matthews et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>As experimental tools, sulfonylureas and SpTx1, while both inhibiting K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, have important and different characteristics. The pancreatic K<sub>ATP</sub> channels made of Kir6.2 and SUR1 are inhibited by ATP and activated by MgADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gribble and Reimann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Proks et al., 2013</xref>). The stimulatory effect of MgADP is antagonized by binding of sulfonylureas to SUR1. This apparent inhibitory effect of sulfonylureas, together with the ATP-mediated inhibition, decreases the channel open probability (<italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>) to near zero. However, without ATP, sulfonylureas alone can only inhibit about 2/3 of the channel current. Thus, the inhibitory effect of sulfonylureas depends on the cellular metabolic state. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of SpTx1 on the Kir6.2 pore in the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel complex is not expected to depend on the cellular metabolic state. This expectation stems from the observation that SpTx1 blocks, comparably well, currents through a constitutively active mutant Kir6.2 and those through K<sub>ATP</sub> channels activated with azide that lowers the concentration of intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). However, SpTx1 is of little use when the Kir6.2 pore in the K<sub>ATP</sub> protein complex is inherently insensitive or is experimentally rendered insensitive to SpTx1, such as that of the wild-type mice and those carrying natural or engineered SpTx1-resistant mutations. Sulfonylureas also have limitations in their inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Mutations in SUR1 could disrupt the nucleotide-dependent gating of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels such that a substantial amount of K<sub>ATP</sub> current would remain even in the presence of a near saturating concentration of sulfonylureas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Proks et al., 2004</xref>). The K<sub>ATP</sub> complexes containing SUR2 have apparently low sulfonylurea sensitivity, for example, in cardiac and some neuronal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nichols, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seino and Miki, 2003</xref>). Another important difference between the two inhibitors is that SpTx1 is not membrane permeable and acts from the extracellular side whereas sulfonylureas are membrane permeable and lodge into the transmembrane segments of SUR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schatz et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Because SpTx1 and sulfonylureas have different characteristics, these inhibitors may have different therapeutic potentials. For example, sulfonylureas have only limited effects on the neurological symptoms of patients with DEND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hattersley and Ashcroft, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pipatpolkai et al., 2020</xref>). To this end, it will be interesting to test whether SpTx1 can help to mitigate these neurological disorders in animal models by directly delivering it into the cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p>In summary, we have conferred high-affinity SpTx1 inhibition on mKir6.2 using the point-mutation V108E to mimic the human ortholog in a heterologous expression system, and introduced this mutation into mKir6.2 in wild-type and NDM-model mice via genome editing. By studying membrane potential and GSIS of β cells in isolated pancreatic islets of SpTx1-sensitive-mutant <sup>Endo</sup>mKir6.2<sup>V108E</sup> mice, we have found that SpTx1 inhibition of Kir6.2 channels causes <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization, eliciting action potentials only in the presence of sufficiently high glucose, and that like the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, it acts as an effective secondary secretagogue to potentiate GSIS. However, unlike glibenclamide, in a low glucose condition SpTx1 does not trigger action potentials or act as an effective primary insulin secretagogue. Furthermore, an application of SpTx1 in <sup>Endo</sup>mKir6.2<sup>V108E</sup> mice neither triggers meaningful insulin secretion nor lowers their blood glucose from the resting levels. By contrast, in diabetic <sup>Rosa26</sup>mKir6.2<sup>NDM-V108E</sup> mice, an application of SpTx1 causes a transient rise of plasma insulin and markedly lowers their highly elevated blood glucose level. These features of the present experimental tool SpTx1 point to the potential therapeutic benefit of a Kir6.2 inhibitor with required pharmacological and pharmaceutical characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mutagenesis and electrophysiological recordings</title><p>All mutant Kir6.2 cDNAs were produced through PCR-based mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Injection sites were sealed with a tissue adhesive (3M Vetbond) to prevent leakage of the injected liquid.</p><p>To make a liquid stock of tamoxifen (20 mg/ml) for injection, tamoxifen solids (Millipore-Sigma, T5648) were added into corn oil (Millipore-Sigma, C8267) in a polypropylene tube wrapped with aluminum foil to protect tamoxifen from light. The stock was placed on a nutator to dissolve overnight at room temperature. The dissolved tamoxifen stock was filtered through a sterilized Steriflip unit (Millipore) then aseptically aliquoted, stored at 4°C, and used within 5 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mouse blood glucose monitoring and plasma insulin assay</title><p>We evaluated the blood glucose levels of tested mice (8–12 weeks of age) using a digital glucometer (Clarity Diagnostics, BG1000). Induced diabetic mice were tested daily starting from the day after the final administration of tamoxifen until their blood glucose levels reached above 600 mg/dl. Following overnight (16 hr) fasting, blood glucose monitoring and plasma collection were then performed using specified mouse lines at designated time points over a 2-hr observation period in the next morning. Glibenclamide (40 mg/kg body weight) or its vehicle pure DMSO was administered through a single intraperitoneal injection whereas SpTx1 (1 mg/kg body weight) or its vehicle normal saline solution was intravenously administered by a lateral tail vein or retro-orbital sinus injection. At each given time point, the glucose level of a blood drop obtained from the cut tail tip was measured twice using a glucometer. For any case where the level was above 600 mg/dl, the blood sample was diluted by an equal volume of the phosphate-buffer solution titrated to pH 7.3 before the glucose level was remeasured for two times. Additionally, four to five drops (~12 μl) of tail vein blood were collected at individual specified time points into a tube containing K<sub>2</sub>EDTA (1.5 mg/ml blood) and centrifuged at 2000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. 5 μl of the resulting plasma was frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at −20°C, and assayed using a colorimetric insulin-detecting ELISA kit (CrystalChem, 90080) within a week. Mice were grouped according to genotypes. Using a previous study as reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remedi et al., 2009</xref>), we determined the number of mice for individual groups. The variations in data values reflected both biological variability and technical errors. No experiments were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, all data are reported as mean (± SEM).

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The paper presents interesting work on a high-affinity toxin for the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunit of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel. Because the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is a target for therapy of diabetes mellitus by sulfonylurea drugs that inhibit the channel less directly, this toxin is an interesting and potentially valuable tool for improving diabetes therapy. The authors have produced a mouse line that exhibits the high-affinity blockade seen for the human channel, and have compared the action of SpTx1 and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide on insulin secretion from pancreatic islets in vitro, and on blood glucose in vivo in a mouse model of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM).</p><p>The results are effectively in three parts, and (as summarized here and explained in the detailed reviews below), the reviewers had concerns about the latter two.</p><p>1) Identification of mutations needed to make the mouse channel susceptible to high affinity SpTx1 blockade, and construction of the mouse with the knock-in mutation.

These results are interesting at a superficial level – the difference between the drugs in what the authors term &quot;stimulation&quot; vs. &quot;potentiation&quot; – but the basis of the difference is unexplored and somewhat mysterious. It is neither explained by the known effect of glib on secretion from depolarized islets, nor by the known state-dependence of sulfonylurea effects. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the drugs' effect on β cell membrane potential or rather on a later step of secretion. Off-target effects of SpTx1 could be an alternative explanation, and comparison of the wt and mutant mouse could clarify this.</p><p>3) The in vivo test of the SpTx1-sensitive-plus-PNDM mouse. There are a number of problems with these experiments, as detailed in the reviews, and alternative approaches would be much better (as well as doing the glibenclamide vs. SpTx1 experiments in the same line of mice).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper describes some biological effects of the authors' previously reported toxin against the Kir6.2 channel, which provides the pore component of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in pancreatic β cells as well as other cells.</p><p>The SpTx1 toxin has much higher affinity for the human Kir6.2 pore than for the mouse Kir6.2, and the authors identify a specific point mutation (of the three sequence differences near the pore) that can interconvert the affinities. They then make this sensitivity-conferring mutation in two mouse lines, one with nominally normal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and another with an inducible transgenic with a chronically-active mutant Kir6.2 channel.</p><p>With these new mouse tools, they show that in isolated islets from &quot;normal&quot; mice with toxin sensitivity, doses of SpTx1 and the SUR1-acting drug glibenclamide that produce approximately the same effect on peak glucose-stimulated insulin secretion have slightly different effects on baseline (pre-glucose-challenge) secretion. They attribute this quantitative difference to an off-target effect of glibenclamide, but the evidence is weak as only one dose of glibenclamide and two of SpTx1 were examined.</p><p>They also show a slightly more potent reversal by SpTx1 than glibenclamide of the hyperglycemia in the mice with chronically-active Kir6.2 channels. This probably indicates that the affinity and pharmacodynamics of the injected toxin allow for better channel inhibition than with glibenclamide.</p><p>Although this possible improvement in pharmacology might be useful in extreme cases (despite the barriers to protein-based therapies as clinical drugs), it is hard to see that this is a clear general improvement, or that new biological understanding has emerged from this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting ms from the Lu laboratory that explores whether a pore-blocking centipede toxin (SpTx) targeting the mouse K<sub>ATP</sub> channel in pancreatic β cells can modulate insulin secretion from mouse pancreatic islets and in live mice. The role of K<sub>ATP</sub> in controlling insulin secretion is well established and a widely used class of antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs inhibit KATP by binding to the regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR). Although sulfonylureas are widely used to treat diabetes, they can have side effects, can lose efficacy with chronic usage and many mutations causing permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) render sulfonylureas ineffective. Moreover, sulfonylureas may target other proteins involved in insulin secretion and the role of K<sub>ATP</sub> in the plasma membrane of β cells has not been tested by directly blocking the pore of the channel. The authors begin by characterizing the affinity of SpTx1 for mouse K<sub>ATP</sub> formed by expressing mKir6.2 and mSUR1 and find that the toxin inhibits this channel with much lower affinity (~700 nM) compared to the human channel (~15 nM) formed by the equivalent subunits, representing a problem for undertaking studies on insulin secretion using mouse models. They undertake a systematic evaluation and show using multiple approaches that the lower affinity for mK<sub>ATP</sub> is not due to mSUR1, but the results of one residue difference in the outer vestibule of Kir6.2, where the human channel has a Glu and the mouse channel has a Val. They then engineer a mouse with the V108E mutation in Kir6.2 using CRISPR-Cas9 and examine whether SpTx1 promotes insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets and diminishes blood glucose live animals. The authors find that SpTx effectively promotes insulin secretion from islets when stimulated with 10 mM glucose, but tends not to promote insulin secretion at basal levels of glucose (3 mM) unless applied at much higher concentrations. These effects contrast with the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, which enhances both basal and stimulated insulin secretion. Using a mouse model of PNDM that they cross with the Kir6.2 V108E mouse, they show that SpTx1 lowers blood glucose more effectively than glibenclamide. Overall, this is a clearly presented, well-controlled and rigorous study demonstrating that a pore-blocking toxin can inhibit K<sub>ATP</sub> to promote insulin secretion and lower blood glucose, providing confirmation of the critical role of K<sub>ATP</sub> in regulating insulin secretion and demonstrating that pore-blockers of this channel could be useful for treating diabetes. The distinct features of pore-blockade compared to sulfonylureas, in particular for basal insulin secretion, will provide alternatives to sulfonylureas with fewer side effects and pore-blockers would be viable options for PNDM cases where sulfonylureas are not effective. The study also elegantly demonstrates that sulfonylureas influence insulin secretion though mechanisms not solely involving K<sub>ATP</sub> in the plasma membrane of pancreatic β cells. This study will make a cool <italic>eLife</italic> paper and I have only a few suggestions for revision.</p><p>1) The lack of effect of SpTx1 in promoting insulin secretion from islets obtained from wt mice (even up to 1 mM!!) is states as being not surprising, which is true given the lower sensitivity of the mouse K<sub>ATP</sub> channel to SpTx1. However, this experiment is also a critical control demonstrating that SpTx1 acts specifically on K<sub>ATP</sub> in the V108E mouse to promote insulin secretion and lower blood glucose. I suggest the authors move this result to the main ms after Figure 6 so its full impact is clear to the readers. It would also be good to convert it to a scatter plot with mean and error bars without connecting lines as there is no effect at the concentrations tested. The authors might also want to consider using color in more of their figures as <italic>eLife</italic> does not charge for color figures.</p><p>2) I am curious whether SpTx1 was well-tolerated by mice. I understand these are proof-of-concept experiments and the authors have not done formal behavioral or toxicity studies, I'm just curious if the authors notice anything interesting.</p><p>3) In Figures1-4, important control data from earlier figures and panels are replotted multiple times for comparison, but this could give the unintended impression that experiments were redone for each of the subsequent panels. It would be good to use a colored function obtained by fitting the equation to the data the first time and then to simple replot that function without data points so the reader can compare. It would also be helpful to add a table with SpTx1 Kd values to facilitate comparison of the large number of measurements reported here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This interesting paper describes the effect of a novel Kir6.2-specific pore blocker, SpTx1, on insulin secretion. It clearly shows that human Kir2 is more sensitive to SpTx1 than mouse Kir6.2 due to a single residue (E108 in humans, V108 in mice). It reports a novel Crispr mouse model containing the V108K mutation and shows that SpTx1 stimulates secretion from isolated islets and lowers blood glucose in an OGTT. The patch clamp experiments are clear and well conducted. However, the secretion experiments could be better described, the OGTT is not very informative, and it is unclear why SpTx1 does not stimulate insulin secretion at subthreshold (3mM) glucose. The paper could be written with greater clarity and the authors overplay some aspects of the study and downplay others.</p><p>A numbered summary of any substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The authors fail to mention that sulphonylureas like glibenclamide block the channel in a very complex fashion – their efficacy is influenced by the metabolic regulation of the channel by adenine nucleotides. In the absence of nucleotides, sulphonylureas never block the channel completely, but only by about 60-70%. In the presence of nucleotides, sulphonylureas displace MgADP binding, preventing MgADP activation and unmasking ATP inhibition at Kir6.2. This causes an apparent enhancement of sulphonylurea block, such that wild-type channels can be almost fully blocked by a maximal concentration of sulphonylurea. This interaction with nucleotides means sulphonylurea block is sensitive to the metabolic state of the cell. It also that drugs carrying PNDM mutations that strongly reduce the inhibitory effect of ATP will never be fully blocked by sulphonylureas even at maximal concentrations (Proks et al. Diabetes 62, 2909). An important point about SpTx1 action is that (I assume) it is independent of metabolic state of the cell or of the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2. The authors should mention this somewhere in the text.</p><p>2) The authors should state that another very important reason for searching for a specific Kir6.2 blocker is that the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is expressed in brain neurones and as a consequence many PNDM patients with Kir6.2 mutations have neurological problems, some of them very severe. Sulphonylureas have very limited effects on these problems, probably because they are rapidly pumped out of the brain. A drug that blocks overactive neuronal channels would be very valuable. Do the authors know whether their drug gets into the brain? If it does, some of the in vivo effects on glucose homeostasis could be mediated via a central effect. This should be discussed.</p><p>3) The reduced sulphonylurea sensitivity of PNDM channels is overplayed and should be toned down. While it is true that some patients with rare and very severe mutations cannot be transferred to sulphonylurea therapy (and need a different therapy) this is a very small number. Most PNDM patients do very well on sulphonylureas.</p><p>4) Reduced effectiveness of sulphonylureas. This is true but the phrasing might be misleading. There are many reasons why PNDM patients need a higher dose than type 2 diabetes patients, including, 1) their K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are more open. 2) the ability of sulphonylureas to block the channel is dependent on the ATP sensitivity of the channel (see below). I am not aware that there are any PNDM mutations (to date) that influence the binding of sulphonylureas.</p><p>5) While it is true that a major side effect of sulphonylurea therapy in type 2 diabetes is hypoglycaemia, it turns out that drug-induced hypoglycaemia in PNDM patients is rare (Bowman et al., Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 6, 637-646). So I think it is wrong to imply that SpTx1 is preferable to sulphonylureas in PNDM because it is likely to cause less hypoglycaemia.</p><p>6) There is no clear explanation for why SpTx1 does not work at low glucose. Blocking the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel should lead to membrane depolarisation and calcium entry and so stimulate secretion. Does this in fact occur at 3mM glucose? I think it important to perform perforated patch studies on β-cells from Rosa26mKir.2V108E mice and look at electrical activity at high SpTx1 concentrations (e.g. 2µM) in 3 and 10mM glucose. Does it in fact depolarise the cell as the authors suppose? Another, and perhaps easier, approach would be to do calcium imaging. Is calcium increased by SpTx1 in intact β cells at low glucose? Could SpTx1 block not only Kir6.2 but also the background inward current that mediates depolarisation when K<sub>ATP</sub> is blocked?</p><p>7) A problem with glibenclamide is that it is lipid soluble, and it tends to accumulate inside the β-cell. This may be one reason for its slow off-rate in the secretion studies. The other is that it unbinds slowly from the receptor so that the K<sub>ATP</sub> current never recovers fully on the time scale of an electrophysiological experiment (ref). The authors suggest this is a problem and a fast reversible blocker is needed. However, there are other sulphonylureas (like gliclazide), which are high affinity blockers with a fast off rate.</p><p>8) Overall, I don’t think there is a need to state sulphonylureas are inadequate in order to justify the development of SpTx1. The toxin is an important step forward in itself.</p><p>9) If it is really the case that SpTx1 has no effect at sub-stimulatory glucose concentrations, the authors might have found the pharmaceutical dream goal – a drug that is effective in type 2 diabetes only in response to a meal and not at resting glucose levels. A lot more work is needed to show that, and I don’t think the authors need to do that for this paper – but they might want to mention it more clearly in the Discussion as a possibility that they will explore in the future.</p><p>10) Glucose tolerance tests are not very helpful in severely diabetic mice as the blood glucose levels are already so high and usually off the glucometer scale. More valuable would be to see what happens to the fasting (or free fed) blood glucose in drug treated mice. This could be done by implantation of a subcutaneous slow-release pellet (or an osmotic minipump) and following blood glucose for a couple of days.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77026.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

In addition, we now show that SpTx1 could effectively counteract the inhibition on GSIS by the K<sub>ATP</sub> opener diazoxide.</p><p>Additionally, we now include membrane potential measurements recorded in the perforated whole-cell mode from individual β cells near the surface of isolated but intact islets. SpTx1 did not depolarize the membrane of β cells of wild-type mice, but it did depolarize the membrane of β cells of SpTx1-senstive-mutant mice under certain glucose conditions. Thus, in the present context, SpTx1 does not have any impactful off-target effects. In regard to the differing effects of SpTx1 and glibenclamide on insulin secretion in subthreshold 3 mM and stimulating concentrations of 10 mM glucose, we observed that SpTx1 did not depolarize the β cell membrane in the absence of glucose. In 5 mM glucose, it had variable effects on the β cell membrane potential and elicited no action potentials whereas glibenclamide caused depolarization more reliably, and triggered action potentials. In 8 mM glucose, SpTx1 also caused depolarization more consistently and triggered action potentials. Thus, SpTx1 apparently cannot mimic some effects of glibenclamide well, or cannot at all, which most likely occur downstream of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, as suggested by reviwer#3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The in vivo test of the SpTx1-sensitive-plus-PNDM mouse. There are a number of problems with these experiments, as detailed in the reviews, and alternative approaches would be much better (as well as doing the glibenclamide vs. SpTx1 experiments in the same line of mice).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by reviewer #3, we now present the in vivo data on the fasted SpTx1-sensitive NDM-model mice without glucose challenge, instead of those previous data obtained under a glucose-challenged condition. In addition, we show the corresponding plasma insulin levels along with the blood glucose levels. Also, the glibenclamide and SpTx1 in vivo experiments were performed with same <sup>Rosa26</sup>mKir6.2<sup>NDM-V108E</sup> mouse line. However, the glibenclamide experiment is merely carried out to show that <sup>Rosa26</sup>mKir6.2<sup>NDM-V108E</sup> mouse line retains the expected ineffectiveness of glibenclamide in lowering elevated blood glucose in the original <sup>Rosa26</sup>mKir6.2<sup>NDM</sup> mouse line from the Nichols’ group, as they reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper describes some biological effects of the authors' previously reported toxin against the Kir6.2 channel, which provides the pore component of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in pancreatic β cells as well as other cells.</p><p>The SpTx1 toxin has much higher affinity for the human Kir6.2 pore than for the mouse Kir6.2, and the authors identify a specific point mutation (of the three sequence differences near the pore) that can interconvert the affinities. They then make this sensitivity-conferring mutation in two mouse lines, one with nominally normal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and another with an inducible transgenic with a chronically-active mutant Kir6.2 channel.</p><p>With these new mouse tools, they show that in isolated islets from &quot;normal&quot; mice with toxin sensitivity, doses of SpTx1 and the SUR1-acting drug glibenclamide that produce approximately the same effect on peak glucose-stimulated insulin secretion have slightly different effects on baseline (pre-glucose-challenge) secretion. They attribute this quantitative difference to an off-target effect of glibenclamide, but the evidence is weak as only one dose of glibenclamide and two of SpTx1 were examined.</p></disp-quote><p>We now plot in Figure 7D the ratios between the amounts of insulin secretion in the presence of SpTx1 and glibenclamide along the glucose concentration steps. These plots clearly show that ratio varied between two tested glucose concentrations. The data suggest that in high (16.7 mM) glucose, SpTx1 is as a good secondary insulin secretagogue as glibenclamide is whereas it is not as a good primary insulin secretagogue in subthreshold (3 mM) glucose. Thus, SpTx1 apparently cannot mimic some effects of glibenclamide well, or cannot at all. As suggested by reviewer #3, one possibility is SpTx1 apparently cannot mimic some effects of glibenclamide in low glucose concentrations well, or cannot at all, which occur. e.g., downstream of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. This possibility predicts that SpTx1 would depolarize the cell membrane in high but not low glucose concentrations.</p><p>As mentioned under item #2 of editors’ summaries, we now show that the effect of SpTx1 on the membrane potential of β cells of SpTx1-senstive-mutant mice is indeed glucose concentration dependent. SpTx1 causes little depolarization of the β cell membrane potential in the absence of glucose. In 5 mM glucose, it had variable effects on the β cell membrane potential and elicited no action potentials whereas glibenclamide caused depolarization more constantly, and triggered action potentials. In 8 mM glucose, SpTx1 caused depolarization more consistently, and also triggered action potentials.</p><p>To understand the exact molecular mechanism underlying the observed difference between the inhibitors undoubtedly requires a major effort beyond the present scope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They also show a slightly more potent reversal by SpTx1 than glibenclamide of the hyperglycemia in the mice with chronically-active Kir6.2 channels. This probably indicates that the affinity and pharmacodynamics of the injected toxin allow for better channel inhibition than with glibenclamide.</p></disp-quote><p>Glibenclamide’s effect on K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibition is known to wash-off slowly, and we previously showed that the off-rate of SpTx1 is much more rapid (0.12 s<sup>-1</sup>). Thus, as the reviewer suggests, a better inhibition by glibenclamide is expected to occur during the wash-out period, but not when both glibenclamide and SpTx1 are maintained in sufficiently high steady-state concentrations. In any case, the difference in the apparent “off-kinetics” of SpTx1 and glibenclamide is remarkable. Give this difference is not our focus, we leave them as observations and no longer comment on them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although this possible improvement in pharmacology might be useful in extreme cases (despite the barriers to protein-based therapies as clinical drugs), it is hard to see that this is a clear general improvement, or that new biological understanding has emerged from this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We developed SpTx1 foremost as an experimental tool. One of its usages showcased here is to identify potential effects of targeting Kir6.2 itself in a proof-of-concept study. We do not suggest using SpTx1 as a therapeutic drug. We do not know a precedence that a high-affinity and relatively specific toxin inhibitor for a biologically important channel, which is effective both <italic>in intro</italic> and in vivo, is not an important development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The lack of effect of SpTx1 in promoting insulin secretion from islets obtained from wt mice (even up to 1 mM!!) is states as being not surprising, which is true given the lower sensitivity of the mouse K<sub>ATP</sub> channel to SpTx1. However, this experiment is also a critical control demonstrating that SpTx1 acts specifically on K<sub>ATP</sub> in the V108E mouse to promote insulin secretion and lower blood glucose. I suggest the authors move this result to the main ms after Figure 6 so its full impact is clear to the readers. It would also be good to convert it to a scatter plot with mean and error bars without connecting lines as there is no effect at the concentrations tested. The authors might also want to consider using color in more of their figures as eLife does not charge for color figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestions, we now present those results as a scatter plot with colors in Figure 1C and incorporate more colors in the other figures. We also more clearly emphasize that the lack of an effect of SpTx1 on insulin secretion from isolated islets of wild-type mice is a control for potential off-target effects. “In this concentration range, SpTx1 failed to alter insulin secretion in the presence of either 7 mM or 15 mM glucose (Figure 1C). Thus, SpTx1 had no significant effects on GSIS either through acting on mKir6.2 or any unintended targets within the wild-type mouse islets.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am curious whether SpTx1 was well-tolerated by mice. I understand these are proof-of-concept experiments and the authors have not done formal behavioral or toxicity studies, I'm just curious if the authors notice anything interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention in the Results: “SpTx1 at a dose of 1 mg/kg neither had discernible effect on the blood glucose levels of wild-type mice (Figure 1B) nor caused other noticeable differences during the observation period, when compared to wild-type mice administered with the vehicle saline.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figures1-4, important control data from earlier figures and panels are replotted multiple times for comparison, but this could give the unintended impression that experiments were redone for each of the subsequent panels. It would be good to use a colored function obtained by fitting the equation to the data the first time and then to simple replot that function without data points so the reader can compare. It would also be helpful to add a table with SpTx1 Kd values to facilitate comparison of the large number of measurements reported here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have implemented the reviewer’s suggestions in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>A numbered summary of any substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The authors fail to mention that sulphonylureas like glibenclamide block the channel in a very complex fashion – their efficacy is influenced by the metabolic regulation of the channel by adenine nucleotides. In the absence of nucleotides, sulphonylureas never block the channel completely, but only by about 60-70%. In the presence of nucleotides, sulphonylureas displace MgADP binding, preventing MgADP activation and unmasking ATP inhibition at Kir6.2. This causes an apparent enhancement of sulphonylurea block, such that wild-type channels can be almost fully blocked by a maximal concentration of sulphonylurea. This interaction with nucleotides means sulphonylurea block is sensitive to the metabolic state of the cell. It also that drugs carrying PNDM mutations that strongly reduce the inhibitory effect of ATP will never be fully blocked by sulphonylureas even at maximal concentrations (Proks et al. Diabetes 62, 2909). An important point about SpTx1 action is that (I assume) it is independent of metabolic state of the cell or of the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2. The authors should mention this somewhere in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We now state in the Discussion: “As experimental tools, sulfonylureas and SpTx1, while both inhibiting K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, have important and different characteristics. The pancreatic K<sub>ATP</sub> channels made of Kir6.2 and SUR1 are inhibited by ATP and activated by MgADP (Gribble and Reimann, 2003; Proks et al., 2013). The stimulatory effect of MgADP is antagonized by binding of sulfonylureas to SUR1. This apparent inhibitory effect of sulfonylureas, together with the ATP-mediated inhibition, decreases the channel open probability (P<sub>o</sub>) to near zero. However, without ATP, sulfonylureas alone can only inhibit about 2/3 of the channel current. Thus, the inhibitory effect of sulfonylureas depends on the cellular metabolic state. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of SpTx1 on the Kir6.2 pore in the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel complex is not expected to depend on the cellular metabolic state. This expectation stems from the observation that SpTx1 blocks, comparably well, currents through a constitutively active Kir6.2 mutant and those through K<sub>ATP</sub> channels activated with azide that lowers the concentration of intracellular ATP (Figures 3-5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should state that another very important reason for searching for a specific Kir6.2 blocker is that the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is expressed in brain neurones and as a consequence many PNDM patients with Kir6.2 mutations have neurological problems, some of them very severe. Sulphonylureas have very limited effects on these problems, probably because they are rapidly pumped out of the brain. A drug that blocks overactive neuronal channels would be very valuable. Do the authors know whether their drug gets into the brain? If it does, some of the in vivo effects on glucose homeostasis could be mediated via a central effect. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention in the Discussion: “Because SpTx1 and sulfonylureas have different characteristics, these inhibitors may have different therapeutic potentials. For example, sulfonylureas have only limited effects on the neurological disorders of patients with DEND (Hattersley and Ashcroft, 2005; Pipatpolkai et al., 2020). To this end, it will be interesting to test whether SpTx1 can help to mitigate these neurological disorders in animal models by directly delivering it into the cerebrospinal fluid.”</p><p>We do not expect that SpTx1 can effectively get across the blood-brain barrier.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reduced sulphonylurea sensitivity of PNDM channels is overplayed and should be toned down. While it is true that some patients with rare and very severe mutations cannot be transferred to sulphonylurea therapy (and need a different therapy) this is a very small number. Most PNDM patients do very well on sulphonylureas.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer’s advice, and we no longer emphasize this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reduced effectiveness of sulphonylureas. This is true but the phrasing might be misleading. There are many reasons why PNDM patients need a higher dose than type 2 diabetes patients, including, 1) their K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are more open. 2) the ability of sulphonylureas to block the channel is dependent on the ATP sensitivity of the channel (see below). I am not aware that there are any PNDM mutations (to date) that influence the binding of sulphonylureas.</p></disp-quote><p>We now merely present the glibenclamide experiment to show that <sup>Rosa26</sup>mKir6.2<sup>NDM-V108E</sup> mouse line retains the expected relative ineffectiveness of glibenclamide in lowering elevated blood glucose in the original <sup>Rosa26</sup>mKir6.2<sup>NDM</sup> mouse line from the Nichols’ group, as they reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) While it is true that a major side effect of sulphonylurea therapy in type 2 diabetes is hypoglycaemia, it turns out that drug-induced hypoglycaemia in PNDM patients is rare (Bowman et al., Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 6, 637-646). So I think it is wrong to imply that SpTx1 is preferable to sulphonylureas in PNDM because it is likely to cause less hypoglycaemia.</p></disp-quote><p>We no longer emphasize the point that sulfonylureas can cause hypoglycemia in Discussion. Instead, on one hand, we show that at the indicated dose, glibenclamide did expectedly lower blood glucose levels of fasted wild-type mice by about half during the observed period but did not markedly lower highly elevated glucose levels in the original <sup>Rosa26</sup>mKir6.2<sup>NDM</sup>. On the other hand, SpTx1 did not lower blood glucose levels of fasted wild-type or <sup>Endo</sup>Kir6.2<sup>V108E</sup> mice but did markedly lower highly elevated glucose levels in <sup>Rosa26</sup>mKir6.2<sup>NDM-V108E</sup> at the indicated dose during the observed period.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There is no clear explanation for why SpTx1 does not work at low glucose. Blocking the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel should lead to membrane depolarisation and calcium entry and so stimulate secretion. Does this in fact occur at 3mM glucose? I think it important to perform perforated patch studies on β-cells from Rosa26mKir.2V108E mice and look at electrical activity at high SpTx1 concentrations (e.g. 2µM) in 3 and 10mM glucose. Does it in fact depolarise the cell as the authors suppose? Another, and perhaps easier, approach would be to do calcium imaging. Is calcium increased by SpTx1 in intact β cells at low glucose? Could SpTx1 block not only Kir6.2 but also the background inward current that mediates depolarisation when K<sub>ATP</sub> is blocked?</p></disp-quote><p>We now show that at SpTx1 at 0.2 µM (10-fold of its K<sub>d</sub>) depolarized the membrane of β cells within isolated islets from <sup>Endo</sup>Kir6.2<sup>V108E</sup> mice consistently in 8 mM glucose, triggering action potentials, and variably in 5 mM glucose without triggering any action potentials though, but little in 0 mM glucose. SpTx1 at 0.2 µM did not depolarize β cells in islets from wild-type mice under these all three glucose concentrations. Regarding the possibility that SpTx1 blocks the background inward current, we did not observe statistically significant hyperpolarization caused by SpTx1 in wild-type β cells (Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A problem with glibenclamide is that it is lipid soluble, and it tends to accumulate inside the β-cell. This may be one reason for its slow off-rate in the secretion studies. The other is that it unbinds slowly from the receptor so that the K<sub>ATP</sub> current never recovers fully on the time scale of an electrophysiological experiment (ref). The authors suggest this is a problem and a fast reversible blocker is needed. However, there are other sulphonylureas (like gliclazide), which are high affinity blockers with a fast off rate.</p></disp-quote><p>We no longer comment on the biological consequence of apparent kinetics of glibenclaimide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Overall, I don't think there is a need to state sulphonylureas are inadequate in order to justify the development of SpTx1. The toxin is an important step forward in itself.</p></disp-quote><p>We heeded the reviewer’s advice and made appropriate adjustments, as quoted under comment#1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) If it is really the case that SpTx1 has no effect at sub-stimulatory glucose concentrations, the authors might have found the pharmaceutical dream goal – a drug that is effective in type 2 diabetes only in response to a meal and not at resting glucose levels. A lot more work is needed to show that, and I don't think the authors need to do that for this paper – but they might want to mention it more clearly in the Discussion as a possibility that they will explore in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show the effect of SpTx1 on the fasting blood glucose and the plasma insulin levels of diabetic and non-diabetic mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Glucose tolerance tests are not very helpful in severely diabetic mice as the blood glucose levels are already so high and usually off the glucometer scale. More valuable would be to see what happens to the fasting (or free fed) blood glucose in drug treated mice. This could be done by implantation of a subcutaneous slow-release pellet (or an osmotic minipump) and following blood glucose for a couple of days.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show the effect of SpTx1 on the fasting blood glucose and the plasma insulin levels of diabetic and non-diabetic mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
