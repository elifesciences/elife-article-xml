We recorded scalp electrical brain activity in 4–6 months infants viewing images of objects in their natural background at a rapid rate of 6 images/second (6 Hz). Widely variable face images appearing every 5 stimuli generate an electrophysiological response over the right hemisphere exactly at 1.2 Hz (6 Hz/5). This face-selective response is absent for phase-scrambled images and therefore not due to low-level information. These findings indicate that right lateralized face-selective processes emerge well before reading acquisition in the infant brain, which can perform figure-ground segregation and generalize face-selective responses across changes in size, viewpoint, illumination as well as expression, age and gender.

Computers, on the other hand, often find it difficult to categorize a face as a face. Indeed, a major challenge in face recognition arises because faces come in many different shapes and sizes. Moreover, both the lighting conditions and the orientation of the head can change, which makes the challenge even more difficult.</p><p>Young infants also show a preference for pictures of human faces over nonsense images, which suggests that the ability to recognise faces is at least partly hard-wired. Neuroimaging studies have revealed that face recognition depends on activity in specific regions of the right hemisphere of the brain, and adults who sustain damage to these regions lose their face recognition skills.</p><p>De Heering and Rossion have now provided the first evidence that the right hemisphere is specialized for distinguishing between natural images of faces and ‘non-face objects’ in infants as young as 4 to 6 months. By using scalp electrodes to record electrical activity in the brain as the infants viewed images on a screen, De Heering and Rossion showed that photographs of human faces triggered a distinct pattern of electrical activity in the right hemisphere: this pattern was clearly different to the patterns triggered by photographs of animals or objects.</p><p>A consistent response was triggered by faces of different genders and expressions, and by faces presented from various viewpoints and under different lighting conditions. In a control experiment, De Heering and Rossion demonstrated that low-level visual features such as differences in luminance or contrast do not contribute to this selective response to faces.</p><p>These results argue against the idea that face perception only becomes assigned to the right hemisphere of the brain when children learn to read (that is, when language processing begins to occupy parts of the left hemisphere). By generating significant responses in a short period of time (just five minutes or less), the protocol developed by De Heering and Rossion has the potential to prove very useful to researchers investigating developmental changes to the perception of visual images during childhood.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06564.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06564.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>face perception</kwd><kwd>infants</kwd><kwd>right hemisphere</kwd><kwd>natural images</kwd><kwd>visual categorization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>facessvep 284025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossion</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossion</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Diverse photographs of human faces against their natural background trigger a specific electrical response in the right hemisphere of the brain in infants aged 4–6 months.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A fundamental function of the human brain is to organize sensory events into distinct classes, that is, perceptual categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosch, 2007</xref>). This function is well illustrated in vision, the dominant sensory modality in humans: visual categorization in natural scenes occurs extremely rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thorpe et al., 1996</xref>) and in the near absence of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2002</xref>). Yet, visual categorization is extremely challenging. For instance, categorizing a visual stimulus as a face—arguably the most significant visual stimulus for human social ecology—requires to isolate the face from its natural background scene (‘figure-ground segregation’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appelbaum et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peterson, 2014</xref>) and distinguish the face from the wide range of non-face stimuli in the environment which share visual properties with faces. Moreover, a common response (i.e., generalization) should be given to faces appearing under various viewing conditions (i.e., changes of head orientation, size, illumination, etc) and varying greatly in terms of gender, age, expression, ethnic origin, so on. Despite this challenge, human performance at face categorization is impressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crouzet et al., 2010</xref>), surpassing even the most sophisticated automatic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scheirer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Up to now, the ontogeny of face categorization remains largely unknown. Classical studies have reported preference for facelike over non-facelike patterns at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goren et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson and Morton, 1991</xref>). At a few months of age, differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) have been found between face stimuli and meaningless patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halit et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kouider et al., 2013</xref>) as well as between faces and exemplars of a single object category segmented from its natural background (e.g., toys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Haan and Nelson, 1999</xref>; cars, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peykarjou and Hoehl, 2013</xref>; houses or cars, Gliga and Dehaene, 2007). However, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of infant vision in segmenting faces in natural images and representing them as a distinct, generalized category, or on the developing neural systems that may achieve this process. Clarifying this issue is also important for understanding the origin of hemispheric lateralization for face-selective processes in the human brain. In human adults, areas of the ventral and lateral occipito-temporal cortex are more active when viewing faces vs a variety of non-face objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sergent et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puce et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanwisher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haxby et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40a">Rossion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weiner and Grill-Spector, 2013</xref>). This face-selective activation is typically larger in the right than the left hemisphere and, in right handed individuals at least, right unilateral brain lesions can lead to selective impairment in face recognition (prosopagnosia: e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busigny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hecaen and Angelergues, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sergent and Signoret, 1992</xref>). According to a recent hypothesis, this right hemispheric dominance for face perception, which seems specific to humans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsao et al., 2008</xref>), is driven by the left hemispheric lateralization for words emerging during reading acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dundas et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, according to this view, right hemispheric lateralization for faces should not be present in infancy. Up to now, infant ERP studies have not been able to provide evidence for right hemispheric lateralization of face-selective processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Haan and Nelson, 1999</xref>; Gliga et al., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peykarjou and Hoehl, 2013</xref>) and right hemispheric lateralization has only been observed when comparing faces to meaningless stimuli that differ in terms of low-level visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kouider et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We addressed these outstanding issues by means of a simple ‘frequency tagging’ or ‘fast periodic visual stimulation’ (FPVS) approach, providing robust electroencephalographic (EEG) responses—steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Regan, 1989</xref>; for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Norcia et al., 2015</xref>)—over the left and right hemispheres of 4- to 6-month-old infants. This approach is ideal to study the infant brain because it is relatively immune from artifacts and provides high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) responses in a few minutes only. Moreover, compared to other approaches such as ERPs to transient stimulation, the FPVS approach is objective and predictive because the response appears exactly at the periodic frequency of stimulation defined by the experimenter. So far, infants have been tested with this approach only in response to low-level visual stimuli (i.e., acuity, contrast sensitivity, spatial phase, orientation, or motion; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Braddick et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Norcia et al., 1990</xref>). A recent EEG study tested infants with segmented faces and objects in different stimulation streams, but without testing face vs object discrimination or generalization across diverse face views, and without providing evidence of hemispheric lateralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farzin et al., 2012</xref>). Here, to achieve these goals, we isolated face-selective responses by means of a fast periodic oddball paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heinrich et al., 2009</xref>) recently adapted to characterize adults' individual face discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu-Shuang et al., 2014</xref>) and face-selective responses in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossion et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation of a face-selective right hemispheric response</title><p>We recorded 32-electrode EEG in a group of 15 4- to 6-month-old infants (5 females, mean age = 155 days, range 125–197 days) looking at complex images of various faces and objects presented one-by-one on a computer screen at a rapid frequency rate of 6 images/s (i.e., 6 Hz, stimulus onset asynchrony of 167 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), in sequences of 20 s.

On grand-averaged data, this high SNR response at 6 Hz (averaged SNR = 8.87 at channel Oz) focused over the medial occipital cortex, reflecting infants' visual system synchronization to the stimulus presentation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). On these grand-averaged data, a Z-Score computed as the difference between amplitude at the frequency of interest and the mean amplitude of 20 surrounding bins divided by the standard deviation of the 20 surrounding bins (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40a">Rossion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu-Shuang et al., 2014</xref>; see also ‘Materials and methods’) was highly significant at electrode Oz (Z = 52.9, p &lt; 0.00001). To ensure that this effect was not driven by the data of a few infants, a t-test against 1 (i.e., signal above noise level) was also performed using the individual SNR values at Oz (range: 0.19–17.07; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This response was highly significant (t(14) = 7.075, p &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, the high frequency resolution of the approach provides many frequency bins to estimate the noise so that the Z-score procedure could be applied to each individual infant's data. At electrode Oz, a significant response was observed in every infant tested but one (Z-score range of 14 infants: 6.10–35.46; not significant for 1 infant only).

For 12 infants out of 15, the signal at 1.2 Hz is above noise level (SNR range of all 15 infants at P8: 0.52–6.13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Using the Z-score approach for testing individual infants, the response at P8 is also significant for the individual data of 7 infants out of 15 (ps &lt; 0.05, Z-score &gt; 1.64 for signal vs noise computed over neighboring frequency bins, see ‘Materials and methods’). The other 7 infants showed a significant 1.2 Hz face categorization response on at least one other electrode (p &lt; 0.05), while none of the electrodes reached significance for one infant. Even though a 1.2 Hz response was also observed over the homologous left occipito-temporal channel P7 (SNR of grand-averaged data = 1.47, Z = 3.61; Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), this response was significantly lower than that at P8 (t(14) = 2.45, p = 0.013).</p><p>A significant response at 1.2 Hz indicates that the infant brain generates a <italic>specific</italic> response to faces compared to the other object categories presented in the stimulation sequences (i.e., discrimination) and that such a differential response is generated periodically, that is, for virtually every face presented in the sequence (i.e., generalization) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, although the faces and objects are relatively well centered, the color images are embedded in their natural and diverse backgrounds. Hence, to be identified as distinct shapes, both the face and object stimuli have to be segmented from their background, a nontrivial accomplishment for the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appelbaum et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peterson, 2014</xref>). Moreover, both the objects and faces substantially vary in size, color, lighting, and viewpoint, and the faces also vary in gender, age, ethnical origin, and expression. Thus, to generate a periodic discriminative 1.2 Hz response in the EEG, the infant brain has to categorize the face stimuli, namely to produce a response that is specific to face images and invariant to their differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossion et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experiment 2: replication and exclusion of low-level contributions</title><p>In theory, putative low-level visual cues differing between faces and objects cannot contribute to the periodic response unless they are systematically present in all or the large majority of face stimuli and if they differ systematically between faces and objects but not within non-face object categories. Given the naturalness and variability of the images used, this is highly unlikely. Thus, the constraint of periodicity provides an elegant way to identify a high-level face categorization response while preserving the natural aspect of the stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossion et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, to ensure that low-level visual cues do not contribute to the infant face-selective response, we exposed another group of 10 4–6 months infants (4 females, mean age = 163 days) to alternating 20-s sequences of phase-scrambled faces and objects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sadr and Sinha, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rossion and Caharel, 2011</xref>) and of natural stimuli replicating exactly those used in the previous experiment.

In both experiments, faces are temporally embedded in a rapid stimulation sequence of non-face objects, so that there is an inherent comparison, or contrast, without the need to perform a subtraction between conditions recorded at different times. That is, there is an oddball response only because the face is discriminated from all other object categories, activating a (face-)specific population of neurons at a rate of 1.2 Hz. Although this is unlikely, we cannot formally exclude at this stage that another visual category than faces would be represented by a distinct population of neurons and would therefore also elicit an oddball response of this amplitude at 4–6 months of age. However, to our knowledge, there is no other visual category that elicits such a large specific response, with a right hemisphere advantage, in the human adult brain. Moreover, the face is arguably the most frequent and socially relevant stimulus in the human (infant) visual environment, making it the best candidate for the early development of category-selective responses.</p><p>Thanks to this original fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) approach, the infant's face categorization response identified here goes beyond previous observations of discrimination between segmented faces and non-face stimuli in ERPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Haan and Nelson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halit et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gliga and Dehaene-Lambertz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peykarjou and Hoehl, 2013</xref>), near infrared spectroscopy responses (NIRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>) or positron emission tomography (PET; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</xref>) activations obtained with a standard presentation mode (i.e., transient, slow, and non-periodic stimulation). Despite the great interest of these studies, it is fair to say that it is difficult to define sensitive (i.e., high SNR) and objective face-selective responses in infants with a conventional stimulation mode as used in these studies, so that there is a lack of consistency across studies. Moreover, given time constraints, these studies used segmented stimuli rather than natural images, and could only compare faces to a limited number of categories. Hence, the face-selective responses obtained in previous studies could be due to systematic differences between categories in terms of a homogenous stimulus, such as contour for instance (e.g., all round faces vs rectangular pictures of cars). Finally, a significant contribution of low-level visual cues to faces vs objects responses could not be excluded from these studies, or precisely evaluated.</p><p>Here, in Experiment 2, removing shape information while preserving low-level visual differences in the power spectrum completely erased the 1.2 Hz face-selective response. In other words, the 1.2 Hz face-selective response identified here for natural face images cannot be attributed to low-level visual confounds, such as differences in power spectrum between faces and other object categories. Moreover, the face stimuli were always embedded within distinct natural backgrounds, suggesting that the infant's brain is able to perform complex figure-ground segregation. This is even more impressive considering the brief presentation duration of each face stimulus (i.e., 167 ms SOA, about 100 ms for stimulus duration above 20% contrast, see ‘Materials and methods’) and the rapid mode of stimulation where each stimulus interrupts the processing of the previous one. Considering the enormous amount of resources devoted to develop face segmentation algorithms in computer vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scheirer et al., 2014</xref>), this is not a trivial accomplishment.</p><p>Finding a dominant face-selective response over the right hemisphere in young infants has important implications for our understanding of hemispheric lateralization in humans. It demonstrates that the right hemispheric dominance for face-selective processes—typical of the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hecaen and Angelergues, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hillger and Koenig, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sergent et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanwisher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busigny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rossion, 2014</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossion et al., 2015</xref> with the present approach) is already present in infancy, independently of low-level cues. This observation refutes the view that the right hemispheric lateralization for faces arises only after a few years of age, following and being driven by the left hemispheric lateralization for words that emerges during reading acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dundas et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2014</xref>). Rather, even if literacy can refine cortical organization for vision and language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dehaene et al., 2010</xref>), the right hemispheric face-selective response identified here in young infants indicates that the right lateralization for face perception is present well before reading acquisition (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dehaene et al., 2010</xref> for right hemisphere lateralization in illiterate adults, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cantlon et al., 2011</xref> for right lateralization in 4 years old children). Instead, our findings are in agreement with an early emergence of right lateralization for faces during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Schonen and Mathivet, 1990</xref>), a view so far based on evidence collected with face stimuli only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Schonen and Mathivet, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le Grand et al., 2003</xref>) or by comparing faces to meaningless stimuli that also differ in terms of low-level visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kouider et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>What is the origin of this early face-selective response? Some authors have suggested a face-processing module pre-specified in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farah et al., 2000</xref>), compatible with newborns' preferential looking behavior for face patterns at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goren et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson and Morton, 1991</xref>; but see; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turati et al., 2002</xref>). However, infants are already extensively exposed to faces after a few months of life. Hence, face-selective responses observed here in 4–6 month-old infants may originate from a combination of initial biological constraints and of accumulation of visual experience with faces during early development. Neuroimaging studies in children show that the magnitude of face-selective neural responses is not adult-like at 7 years of age and keeps increasing until adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Golarai et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scherf et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that face-selectivity continues to increase during development. Given its advantages in terms of sensitivity, implicit recording and objectivity (i.e., measuring brain responses at a known, exact rate of periodic stimulation), the FPVS approach used here with electroencephalography is well positioned to test this hypothesis and characterize the full human developmental course of face processing and natural visual scene categorization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Nineteen full-term 4- to 6-month-old infants completed Experiment 1 approved by the Biomedical Ethical Committee from the University of Louvain (Belgian number: B403201215103). Their parents gave written informed consent and none of them reported their infant suffering from any psychiatric or neurological disorders. The data of one infant were excluded because of large artifacts recorded at one channel of interest (P8) during the whole experiment. Three infants paid fully attention only to one sequence and were therefore excluded from the study. Thus, the final sample consisted of 15 healthy full-term 4- to 6-month-old infants (10 males, mean age = 155 days, SE = 6 days). Note that a rejection rate of 4 datasets out of 19 is extremely low compared to typical EEG studies run with infants of that age, requiring much longer testing durations and a data rejection rate of at least 50% (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Haan and Nelson, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Stimuli</title><p>Two-hundred images of various objects (animals, plants, man-made objects) and 48 images of faces were collected from the internet.

They were all resized to 200 × 200 pixels, equalized in terms of luminance and contrast in Matlab (Mathworks, USA), and shown in the center of the screen at a 800 × 600 pixel resolution. At a testing distance of 40 cm, they subtended approximately 13 by 13° of visual angle. The same stimuli were used in grayscale versions and with a slightly different stimulation paradigm in a recent study with adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossion et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Procedure</title><p>Stimuli were presented through sinusoidal contrast modulation (0–100%) at a rate of 6 Hz (6 images/s) using the Psychtoolbox 3.0.9 for Windows in Matlab 7.6 (MathWorks Inc.). This base stimulation frequency rate was selected because it elicits large periodic brain responses to faces in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Alonso-Prieto et al., 2013</xref>). The stimulation cycle of each image presentation therefore lasted 166.66 ms (1000 ms/6) and started with a uniform grey background. A sinusoidal contrast modulation was used because it generates fewer harmonics (i.e., responses at exact multiple of the stimulation frequency, reflecting the nonlinearity of the brain response; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Regan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Norcia et al., 2015</xref>) and because it is a smoother visual stimulation than a squarewave stimulation mode. Full contrast was reached midway through each cycle, that is, at 83.33 ms from cycle onset. Each sequence was composed of 4 objects (O) followed, every fifth stimulus, by a face (F), all randomly selected from their respective category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Given this design, the face (F) stimulus was presented at the oddball frequency of 6 Hz/5 = 1.2 Hz and could be directly identified in the EEG spectrum as the signature of infants' face categorization response. Each trial lasted 20 s and was flanked by a 2-s fade-in and a 2-s fade-out, at the beginning and at the end of the sequence, respectively. This linear increase/decrease of contrast modulation depth at the beginning and end of each stimulation sequence was used to avoid abrupt onset and offset of the stimuli, which could elicit eye movements.</p><p>Infants were comfortably seated on their mother's laps (N = 5) or in a car seat (N = 10) in a dimly lit and sound-attenuated room during EEG recording. The mothers were instructed not to interact with their babies.

Electrode offset was reduced to between ±25 microvolts for each individual electrode by injecting the electrode with saline gel. Eye movements were monitored with a webcam fixed on the computer screen. The experimenter manually launched each sequence when the infant looked at the back-lit screen. If the infant did not look at the screen, the experimenter would attract his/her gaze towards it in between the stimulation sequences by means of her voice or of a ringing colored toy. During the experiment, triggers were sent from the stimulation computer through a parallel port to the recording computer at the start of each trial and at the minima of each stimulation cycle (grey background, 0% contrast) for the object (O) stimulus and the oddball face (F) stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>EEG analyses pre-processing</title><p>All EEG analyses were carried out using Letswave 5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nocions.webnode.com/letswave">http://nocions.webnode.com/letswave</ext-link>), and MATLAB 2012 (The Mathworks) following procedures described with adult participants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu-Shuang et al., 2014</xref>). EEG sequences could be removed because of (1) a technical problem during recording; (2) an electrode went off during recording; or (3) because the infant did not fixate for the majority of the 20 s. Additionally, the sequence was removed if the SNR was below 2 for the base rate frequency at all medial occipital electrodes Oz, O1, and O2. These criteria led to 1 to 5 sequences excluded per infant. As long as an infant performed one stimulation sequence satisfying these criteria, his/her data was considered into the analyses. EEG data were first filtered with a low cut-off value of 0.1 Hz and high cut-off value of 100 Hz using a FFT band-pass filter. They were then downsampled to 250 Hz to reduce file size and data processing time, and segmented in order to include 2 s of recording before and after each trial. The 28-s long sequences (i.e., 2-s baseline + 2-s fade-in + 20-s sequence + 2-s fade-out + 2-s baseline) were further examined in the time domain for possible channel artifacts. Only one electrode interpolation per infant had to be applied on the sequences of 3 infants only. A common average reference computation was applied to all channels.</p><p>After data pre-processing, the 28-s segments were reduced to the 20-s full contrast stimulation sequence, which is an integer number of 1.2 Hz cycles (i.e., 24 cycles, or 24 faces). Sequences were then averaged in the time-domain for each infant separately and examined for their amplitude spectra at all channels, which led to the exclusion of 8 noisy sequences over the whole group of infants. This preprocessed dataset is available in the public domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Heering and Rossion, 2013</xref>). A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was then applied to the data for examination in the EEG frequency-domain at the high frequency resolution of 0.05 Hz (=1/20 s). Grand-averaged spectra were computed by averaging the EEG spectra of all individual infants tested. SNR was computed for each individual spectrum as the ratio between the amplitude at each frequency and the average of the 20 surrounding bins (10 on each side, excluding the immediate adjacent bin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu-Shuang et al., 2014</xref>). On grand-averaged data, Z-Scores were computed at 6 Hz and 1.2 Hz as the difference between amplitude at the frequency of interest and the mean amplitude of 20 surrounding bins divided by the standard deviation of the 20 surrounding bins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu-Shuang et al., 2014</xref>). Given that the hypothesis is that the signal is above the noise, the threshold of significance was placed at a one-tailed Z-score of 1.64 (p &lt; 0.05). In Experiment 1, a test at all 32 electrodes on grand-averaged data was performed and a bonferroni corrected p-value of p &lt; 0.00156 (0.05/32) was considered to isolate the significant channels. Five channels reached significance (Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Jody Culham, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers were very positive about the manuscript, finding the approach interesting and the results intriguing.</p><p>One reviewer requested a number of clarifications regarding the statistics and technical aspects (these were straightforward and are appended below). These should be addressed in a revision.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) In the Results section, it is not clear why/when the authors chose to use <italic>t</italic>-tests versus <italic>z</italic>-tests. For example, in the third paragraph, a <italic>t-</italic>test is reported for the group-level SNR at the 6 Hz frequency. In the following paragraph, a <italic>z</italic>-test is reported for the group-level SNR at the 1.2 Hz frequency. Adding a description to the beginning of the Results section describing the statistics used (and why) would be helpful. Please clarify in the text; preferably at the beginning of the Results section which analyses required a <italic>t</italic>-test versus a <italic>z</italic>-test (particularly for grand-averaged data). A general outline of the statistics used, and why, would be helpful for those planning to use this technique in the future.</p><p>2) Please provide clarification on the meaning of the SNR ranges that are reported across all infants. For example, in the Results section, the authors state: “For 12 infants out of 15 it is above noise level (SNR range at P8: 0.52-6.13).” My understanding is that a SNR = 1.0 is the base of comparison to determine whether a response is above noise level. However, in the above sentence, the provided range includes values below 1.0. Please clarify what this range is referring to, as it does not appear to be the range for infants whose responses were significantly above noise level?</p><p>3) At the end of the subsection headed “Experiment 2: replication and exclusion of low-level contributions”, the authors report that the magnitude of the base frequency (6 Hz) response was “significant for every infant and did not differ between conditions (t(9) = 1.103, p = .3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).” It appears that the <italic>t</italic>-test is referring to the comparison between conditions? Could the authors please provide the statistics for the statement that the magnitude was significant for every infant as was done in the fifth paragraph of the Results?</p><p>4) I think a strong point of this paper is that the authors report statistics for grand-averaged data as well as for individual infants. This demonstrates that the ssVEP responses are relatively consistently seen across infants and that 1-2 infants are not driving the results. However, the current organization of the Results section causes the reader to constantly switch back and forth between statistics for grand-averaged data and for individual infant data. The authors might consider reformatting these sections to make this clearer. For example, it may be beneficial to have labeled subsections devoted to grand averaged data and individual infant data.</p><p>5) The authors do not report an impedance limit for the EEG recording, which is typically listed in ERP papers as well as previous adult ssVEP papers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prieto et al., 2013</xref>; Rossion &amp; Boremanse, 2011) and a previous infant ssVEP paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farzin, Hou, &amp; Norcia, 2012</xref>). Adding this limit is helpful for those trying to use this method in the future.</p><p>6) In the “EEG Analyses Pre-processing” section the authors state that 1-5 sequences were excluded per infant with the 2 listed criteria applied. Does this means that each infant in the final analyses had between 1-5 sequences excluded due to these criteria? What was the minimum number of sequences required to be included in analyses? In the beginning of the Results section, the authors note that all infants completed a minimum of 5 sequences, but as written, this suggests that all infants who participated completed at least 5 sequences, before any sequence exclusion criteria were applied. Can the authors add the minimum number of sequences necessary for an infant's data to be kept in analyses? If this cutoff is 5, please clarify whether the infants who only viewed 5 sequences also had at least 1 sequence excluded. If so, should these infants have not been kept in the analyses?</p><p>7) In the subsection headed “EEG analyses Pre-processing”, the authors state that data were “downsampled to 250 Hz”. Why was this done? What was the original sample rate?</p><p>8) The “Experiment 2, the Analyses Pre-processing” section should contain more details on how many sequences per infant were removed based on the exclusion criteria, following the format of the Experiment 1's section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06564.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) In the Results section, it is not clear why/when the authors chose to use</italic> t<italic>-tests versus</italic> z<italic>-tests.

As in our previous studies in adults with this approach (fast periodic oddball stimulation in EEG, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu-Shuang et al., 2014</xref>; Dzhelyova and Rossion, 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossion et al., 2015</xref>), a Z-score is computed on grand-averaged data to define significant electrodes. The Z-score procedure is explained in the Methods (in the subsection headed “EEG analyses Pre-processing”) and we refer to the first (adult) study that used this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu-Shuang et al., 2014</xref>): “On grand-averaged data, Z-Scores were computed at 6 Hz and 1.2 Hz as the difference between amplitude at the frequency of interest and the mean amplitude of 20 surrounding bins divided by the standard deviation of the 20 surrounding bins. Given that the hypothesis is that the signal is above the noise, the threshold of significance was placed at a one-tailed Z-score of 1.64 (p &lt; .05).”</p><p>For consistency in the revised version of the manuscript, we report the group Z-score at both 1.2 Hz (P8: Z = 12.16, p&lt; .001) and 6 Hz (Oz: Z = 52.9, p&lt; .00001), for both experiments. We also explain at the beginning of the Results section, the Z-score procedure and the different statistical tests used.</p><p><italic>2) Please provide clarification on the meaning of the SNR ranges that are reported across all infants. For example, in the Results section, the authors state: “For 12 infants out of 15 it is above noise level (SNR range at P8: 0.52-6.13).” My understanding is that a SNR = 1.0 is the base of comparison to determine whether a response is above noise level. However, in the above sentence, the provided range includes values below 1.0. Please clarify what this range is referring to</italic>, <italic>as it does not appear to be the range for infants whose responses were significantly above noise level?</italic></p><p>This was confusing indeed. In the parenthesis, we provided the SNR range for all 15 infants, and 3 infants out of 15 have a SNR below 1 at P8 (i.e., no signal above noise level). In the revised version, in the subsection “Isolation of a face-selective right hemispheric response”, we have clarified this: SNR range of all 15 infants at P8.</p><p><italic>3) At the end of the subsection headed “Experiment 2: replication and exclusion of low-level contributions”, the authors report that the magnitude of the base frequency (6 Hz) response was “significant for every infant and did not differ between conditions (t(9) = 1.103, p = .3;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>).” It appears that the</italic> t<italic>-test is referring to the comparison between conditions? Could the authors please provide the statistics for the statement that the magnitude was significant for every infant as was done in the fifth paragraph of the Results?</italic></p><p>As for Experiment 1, we added that: “This response at channel Oz was significant for every infant in each of the conditions (Z-score range of 10 infants for natural images: 1.66 – 29.58 and for scrambled images: 2.81- 27.76; SNR range for natural images: 1.9 - 13.65 and for scrambled images: 2.57–13.55).”</p><p><italic>4) I think a strong point of this paper is that the authors report statistics for grand averaged data as well as for individual infants. This demonstrates that the ssVEP responses are relatively consistently seen across infants and that 1-2 infants are not driving the results. However, the current organization of the Results section causes the reader to constantly switch back and forth between statistics for grand averaged data and for individual infant data. The authors might consider reformatting these sections to make this clearer. For example, it may be beneficial to have labeled subsections devoted to grand averaged data and individual infant data</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, the approach allows reporting statistics for grand-averaged data, using the variation across the many frequency bins around the frequency bin of interest. However, such an effect could be driven by 1-2 infants having a response well above noise level, so that it is important to complement it by an analysis that takes into account the variability across infants at the frequency bin of interest only. In addition, we are in a position to run a statistical test in each individual infant using an estimation of the noise across 20 bins surrounding the frequency bin of interest. We have modified the Results section to make this clear, describing results on grand-averaged data in a different paragraph than the analysis based on individual infants. We have also ensured that there is consistency across the two experiments in the report of the statistics.</p><p><italic>5) The authors do not report an impedance limit for the EEG recording, which is typically listed in ERP papers as well as previous adult ssVEP papers (e.g.,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35"><italic>Prieto et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>; Rossion &amp; Boremanse, 2011) and a previous infant ssVEP paper (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"><italic>Farzin, Hou, &amp; Norcia, 2012</italic></xref><italic>). Adding this limit is helpful for those trying to use this method in the future</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, in contrast with these previous studies, we use biosemi active electrodes, providing the best possible suppression of interference by impedance transformation directly on the electrode (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biosemi.com/faq/shielding%20vs%20active%20electrodes.htm">http://www.biosemi.com/faq/shielding vs active electrodes.htm</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biosemi.com/faq/shielding">http://www.biosemi.com/faq/shielding</ext-link> vs active electrodes.htm).</p><p>Active electrodes provide impedance transformation on the electrode: the input impedance is very high (so the EEG voltages are not influenced, even with high electrode impedances), while the output impedance is very low (&lt; 1 Ohm). Consequently, the interference currents now flow via very low impedances (the output of the active electrode), and cannot generate significant interference voltages anymore. In addition, the electrode impedance does no longer affect the level of interference.</p><p>Because the actual electrode impedance is not a very important variable, when active electrodes are used, the level of DC offset is used as an alternative indicator for the quality of the electrode contact. We added this information in the revised version of the paper: “Electrode offset was reduced between ± 25 microvolts for each individual electrode by injecting the electrode with saline gel.”</p><p><italic>6) In the “EEG Analyses Pre-processing” section the authors state that 1-5 sequences were excluded per infant with the 2 listed criteria applied. Does this means that each infant in the final analyses had between 1-5 sequences excluded due to these criteria?</italic></p><p>Yes, each infant in the final analyses had between 1-5 sequences excluded. The criteria for rejection of sequences have been clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>What was the minimum number of sequences required to be included in analyses? In the beginning of the Results section, the authors note that all infants completed a minimum of 5 sequences, but as written, this suggests that all infants who participated completed at least 5 sequences, before any sequence exclusion criteria were applied</italic>.</p><p><italic>Can the authors add the minimum number of sequences necessary for an infant's data to be kept in analyses? If this cutoff is 5, please clarify whether the infants who only viewed 5 sequences also had at least 1 sequence excluded. If so, should these infants have not been kept in the analyses?</italic></p><p>The minimum for a participant to be included in the sample was to have paid full attention to more than 1 sequence by condition. Infants who performed the lowest number of sequences viewed at least five sequences, in addition to the excluded sequences. The term “minimum” used in the Results section was misleading and has been removed: it was not a criterion.</p><p><italic>7) In the subsection headed “EEG analyses Pre-processing”, the authors state that data were “downsampled to 250 Hz”. Why was this done? What was the original sample rate?</italic></p><p>The original sampling rate was 1024 Hz. Data files were then downsampled to 250 Hz to reduce file size and data processing time. This has been clarified in the Methods section. Note that we used this procedure in all of our previous SSVEP studies with adults, and there is no loss of frequency resolution.</p><p><italic>8) The “Experiment 2, the Analyses Pre-processing” section should contain more details on how many sequences per infant were removed based on the exclusion criteria, following the format of the Experiment 1's section</italic>.</p><p>The same exclusion criteria were used as in Experiment 1, and this led to 1 to 8 sequences excluded. This has been corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
