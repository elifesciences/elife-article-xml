whose expression is normally restricted to the testis but anomalously activated in human cancer. In sperm, a number of CTAs support energy generation, however, whether they contribute to tumor metabolism is not understood. We describe human COX6B2, a component of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). <italic>COX6B2</italic> is expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and expression correlates with reduced survival time. COX6B2, but not its somatic isoform COX6B1, enhances activity of complex IV, increasing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and NAD<sup>+</sup> generation. Consequently, COX6B2-expressing cancer cells display a proliferative advantage, particularly in low oxygen. Conversely, depletion of COX6B2 attenuates OXPHOS and collapses mitochondrial membrane potential leading to cell death or senescence. COX6B2 is both necessary and sufficient for growth of human tumor xenografts in mice. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated, tumor-specific metabolic pathway hijacked from one of the most ATP-intensive processes in the animal kingdom: sperm motility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer testes antigen</kwd><kwd>COX6B2</kwd><kwd>oxidative phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>cytochrome c oxidase</kwd><kwd>lung cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA196905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Chun-Chun</given-names></name><name><surname>McGlynn</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitehurst</surname><given-names>Angelique W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA142543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Chun-Chun</given-names></name><name><surname>Wooten</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name><name><surname>McGlynn</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitehurst</surname><given-names>Angelique W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP180778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Prashant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cancer testis antigen COX6B2 enhances cytochrome c oxidase activity thereby promoting proliferation and survival in cancer cells and represents a therapeutic target for inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation selectively in tumors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumors frequently activate genes whose expression is otherwise restricted to testis; these genes are known collectively as cancer-testis antigens (CT-antigens, CTAs). The expression of these genes outside their native and immune privileged site has been the basis for immunotherapeutic approaches including vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hunder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gjerstorff et al., 2015</xref>). Historically, functional knowledge of the contribution of these proteins, if any, to neoplastic behaviors has significantly lagged behind immune-targeting. In recent years, the functional characterization of CTAs has gained broader interest and these proteins have been implicated in tumor cell survival, TGF-β signaling, mitotic fidelity, polyadenylation, mRNA export, tumor suppressor silencing, and DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gibbs and Whitehurst, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Viphakone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nichols et al., 2018</xref>). Multiple reports now indicate that anomalous expression of testis proteins can be engaged to support the tumorigenic program. The biased expression pattern of these proteins to tumors and testis may offer an extraordinarily broad therapeutic window if they can be targeted directly.</p><p>One unique aspect of mammalian sperm physiology is the tremendous energy demand required for motility while preserving the integrity of their precious DNA cargo within the hostile environment of the female reproductive tract. To meet this demand, sperm contain a number of tissue-specific protein isoforms for glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) that mediate the increase in ATP production. For example, lactate dehydrogenase C, LDHC, is a testis-specific isoform of the terminal enzyme in glycolysis that catalyzes the reduction of pyruvate to lactate essential for male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Odet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krisfalusi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 1989</xref>). Similarly, COX6B2 is a testis-specific subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hüttemann et al., 2003</xref>). mRNA encoding of either <italic>LDHC</italic> or <italic>COX6B2</italic> is undetectable in normal tissue, but both are upregulated in a number of different tumor derived cell lines, classifying them as CTAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maxfield et al., 2015</xref>, (CTpedia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cta.lncc.br/index.php">http://www.cta.lncc.br/index.php</ext-link>))). However, it is unclear whether these proteins support metabolic programs in tumor cells.</p><p>In a large-scale lossof-function analysis to annotate the contribution of individual CTAs to neoplastic behaviors, we found that COX6B2 is essential for survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maxfield et al., 2015</xref>). COX6B2 is a nuclear encoded, sperm-specific component of complex IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hüttemann et al., 2003</xref>). By transferring electrons from reduced cytochrome c to O<sub>2,</sub> complex IV is the rate-limiting step for ATP production by the electron transport chain (ETC). Thirteen subunits make up complex IV: three are mitochondrial encoded and ten are derived from nuclear DNA. Six of the 10 nuclear encoded subunits have tissue-specific isoforms that permit regulation of this complex in response to environmental cues (e.g. pH, hormones, metals, ATP/ADP ratio etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kadenbach and Hüttemann, 2015</xref>). The somatic isoform of COX6B2 is COX6B1. These two proteins share 58% amino acid identity and ~80% similarity. Based on structural information, it is apparent that COX6B1/2 are the only complex IV subunits that are not membrane bound. Instead, their localization is confined to the intermembrane space where cytochrome c associates. It is inferred that COX6B1/B2 participate in dimerization of complex IV and cytochrome c association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sampson and Alleyne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsukihara et al., 1996</xref>). While limited, studies on COX6B1 indicate that it is essential for complex IV activity. In particular, human mutations in COX6B1 (R20C or R20H) abrogate complex IV assembly and lead to severe cardiac defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulhag et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, biochemical analysis indicates that removal of COX6B1 from assembled complexes enhances complex IV activity, implying a negative regulatory role for COX6B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weishaupt and Kadenbach, 1992</xref>). To-date no reports detail the function of COX6B2 nor indicate the physiological relevance of this sperm-specific subunit to fertility. Furthermore, there are no reports describing mechanism(s) that regulate <italic>COX6B1</italic> or <italic>COX6B2</italic> expression. Overall, compared to the enormous data on complex IV in general, the COX6B proteins have been understudied.</p><p>We have undertaken a detailed investigation into the mechanism of action of COX6B2 when this protein is aberrantly expressed in NSCLC. Here, we report that COX6B2 enhances mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in tumor cells. This activity accelerates proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, silencing of COX6B2 attenuates OXPHOS, reduces tumor cell viability and dramatically decreases growth in vivo. Importantly, we find that hypoxia enhances <italic>COX6B2</italic> expression, which confers a selective advantage for proliferation under low oxygen. Indeed, elevated COX6B2 mRNA correlates with reduced survival of LUAD patients. Cumulatively, this study demonstrates the remarkable capacity of tumor cells to integrate primordial gene products into their regulatory environment as a means of promoting unrestrained proliferation. In turn, COX6B2 becomes a liability that may be exploited for tumor selective targeting of OXPHOS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>COX6B2 is expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors and correlates with poor survival</title><p>Using a large-scale functional genomics approaches, we previously found that depletion of COX6B2 activates cleaved caspase 3/7 in cell lines derived from breast, melanoma and NSCLC, with the most potent activation in H1299 NSCLC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maxfield et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these findings, we examined the relationship between <italic>COX6B2</italic> expression and patient outcome in human NSCLC. Strikingly, elevated expression of <italic>COX6B2</italic> is associated with significantly shorter overall survival (OS) time (p=5.3×10<sup>−6</sup>, log rank test; hazard ratio (HR): 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24–1.73) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, <italic>COX6B2</italic> expression positively correlates with time to first progression (FP) (p=4.1×10<sup>−4</sup>, log rank test; HR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.24–2.14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Separation of the two major histological subtypes of NSCLC revealed a strong correlation for both outcomes in LUAD (OS: p=1.6×10<sup>−4</sup>, log rank test; HR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.25–2.03; FP: p=9.4×10<sup>−5</sup>, log rank test; HR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.37–2.65) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, this correlation is not observed in lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) (OS: p=0.75, log rank test; HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.77–1.44; FP: p=0.96, log rank test; HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.59–1.65) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Analysis of TCGA data sets also revealed a significant upregulation of <italic>COX6B2</italic> mRNA in LUAD tumors as compared to normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We next immunoblotted for COX6B2 protein in a panel of human LUAD tumors and normal lung tissue using an antibody that detects COX6B2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We found that COX6B2 protein expression is low or undetectable in normal lung tissue, but present in all tumor-derived tissues irrespective of stage and grade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A similar pattern is also observed in LUAD-derived cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of COX6B2 in a panel of human non-malignant (n = 22) and LUAD tissues (n = 32) indicated accumulation of COX6B2 in tumor, but not non-malignant tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This expression of COX6B2 in tumors does not have an apparent correlation with the presence or absence of COX6B1, the somatic isoform of COX6B2. We did observe a moderate correlation with the complex IV subunit, COXIV, suggesting COX6B2 accumulation coincides with increased mitochondria in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, depletion or overexpression of either COX6B1 or COX6B2 does not impact protein accumulation of the corresponding isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These findings indicate that while the isoforms are closely related in sequence their regulation may be through independent mechanisms. Immunofluorescence of endogenous COX6B2 in intact LUAD cells revealed specific localization to the mitochondria as judged by overlap with Tom20, a mitochondrial resident protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, COX6B2 is frequently expressed in LUAD, correlates with poor survival and when ectopically expressed can localize to its native mitochondrial location.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>COX6B2</italic> mRNA expression correlates with poor outcome in LUAD.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and FP in NSCLC (<bold>A</bold>) LUAD (<bold>B</bold>) and LUSC patients (<bold>C</bold>).

This overexpression is not associated with an increase in mitochondrial DNA or total mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). We then measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) at baseline and following exposure to electron transport chain perturbagens. This analysis revealed a significant enhancement in basal, ATP-linked, maximal and reserve OCR in COX6B2-V5 expressing cells as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A similar trend is observed in an independent LUAD cell line, H2122, expressing COX6B2-V5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>).

In our original screen, we found that siRNA-mediated depletion of COX6B2 enhances cleavage of caspase 3/7, a phenotype that is rescued in COX6B2-V5 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maxfield et al., 2015</xref>).

These cell death markers are also induced in sgCOX6B2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The induction of cell death proteins is accompanied by an increase in Annexin-V staining, demonstrating activation of caspase-dependent programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Visual inspection of COX6B2-depleted cultures also revealed a population of cells that are flattened, accumulate vacuoles, and in some cases, are multi-nucleated, feature reminiscent of senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Staining of these cells revealed an increase in β-galactosidase, suggesting induction of a cellular senescence program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Our data indicate that COX6B2 enhances complex IV activity leading to an increase in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The function of COX6B2 appears to differ from COX6B1, which did not enhance OXPHOS when overexpressed, a finding consistent with previous biochemical analyses that indicate removal of COX6B1 enhances complex IV activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weishaupt and Kadenbach, 1992</xref>). Genetic studies demonstrate that human mutations in COX6B1 reduce assembly of complex IV and other ETC complexes. Based on this cumulative data, we hypothesize that COX6B1 (and perhaps B2) are essential for assembly and regulation of complex IV. In normal tissues, COX6B1 may regulate complex IV to prevent the generation of excessive and unused energy and also damaging ROS. In sperm, where ATP demand is high, COX6B2 expression could promote complex IV dimerization and incorporation into supercomplexes to promote efficient OXPHOS and limit ROS production that would otherwise damage DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agarwal et al., 2014</xref>). This function may be particularly important during early tumorigenesis, where a highly hypoxic environment can lead to proliferative arrest and excessive ROS generation. We propose that tumor cells that express and engage the COX6B2-based, sperm-specific mechanism can overcome this innate barrier to transformation that would otherwise restrict cell survival.</p><p>One of the most surprising aspects of our study was the loss of tumor cell viability following the depletion of COX6B2. As COX6B2 enhances OXPHOS, its loss would be expected to reduce ATP levels and the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio and slow proliferation, but not necessarily kill tumor cells. Tumor cell glycolytic pathways should theoretically compensate for reduced energy generation. Moreover, the presence of COX6B1 should be able to support complex IV function. Instead, we observe ROS production and an exit from the cell cycle either to death or senescence. This finding implies that these cells are highly dependent upon OXPHOS for survival. In addition, the loss of COX6B2 may promote apoptosis due to a collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smaili et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The majority of tumor metabolism studies have focused on the contribution of the Warburg effect and have led to the notion that OXPHOS is dispensable for many transformed cells. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that OXPHOS is essential for tumor cell division and survival. First, OXPHOS contributes to &gt;80% of total ATP production in tumor cells, which is essential for satisfying the demands of proliferation and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lissanu Deribe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zu and Guppy, 2004</xref>). Second, OXPHOS provides electron acceptors to generate metabolic intermediates (e.g. aspartate) that are required for continued cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Third, tumor cells exhibit enhanced sensitivity to inhibitors of OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nayak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scotland et al., 2013</xref>). Fourth, isoform switching of complex IV subunits is observed in tumors and is associated with aggressive malignant behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oliva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Minton et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, OXPHOS is upregulated and essential for survival during ER-stress, hypoxia and glucose limiting conditions, and exposure to targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balsa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikeda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guièze et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these and a vast array of additional data, it is accepted that inhibition of OXPHOS is a tractable therapeutic entry point for treating cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinberg and Chandel, 2015</xref>). Indeed, extensive studies with metformin have demonstrated anti-proliferative activities and reduction of tumor incidence through the inhibition of Complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinberg and Chandel, 2015</xref>). However, this and other ETC inhibitors cannot discriminate between tumor or normal cells, limiting their therapeutic window. We propose that enhanced accumulation of COX6B2 is an acquired trait that is essential for OXPHOS in LUAD and perhaps additional cancers. At minimum, elevated COX6B2 protein expression is a functional enrollment biomarker for OXPHOS-inhibitor-based treatment. Moreover, COX6B2 structural elements that are distinct from COX6B1 could represent targets for small molecule inhibitors. Finally, due to expression in an immune privileged site, CTAs have long been considered ideal targets for immunotherapy. However, no objective criterion exists to prioritize them for immunotherapy. We propose that COX6B2 represents an ideal candidate for immunotherapy because it has a bona fide tumorigenic function. Specifically, sequence differences between COX6B2 and COX6B1 could permit antigen recognition by patient immune cells and thus act as targets of adoptive T-cell transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus, female</italic>)</td><td>Athymic nude mice</td><td>Envigo</td><td>Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1<sup>nu</sup></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-3216;

Cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD LSRFortessa instrument and BD FACSDiva 6.2 software. A minimum of 20,000 cells were analyzed per condition. Data were analyzed by FlowJo (v10). Forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) parameters were used to exclude cellular debris, dead cells, and doublets to retain viable single cell events. The median fluorescent intensities in each group were used to calculate the fold change compared to the CTRL group. CM-H2DCFDA had to be used in COX6B2-depleted cells because MitoSOX Red is dependent upon mitochondrial integrity, which is lost under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zielonka and Kalyanaraman, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>EdU incorporation assays</title><p>Cells were exposed to ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) for 1 hr before fixing the cells in 4% formaldehyde.

Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1<sup>nu</sup> female mice were purchased from Envigo. At six to eight-weeks of age (23–25 grams) mice were randomly assigned to the indicated groups. Sample size was determined by the formula: n = 1+2C(s/d)<sup>2</sup>, in which C = 10.51, based on a power of 90% and a confidence interval of 95%, S = standard deviation of tumor volume (20%), D = tumor burden difference to be considered significant (50%). Therefore, five mice per condition were tested. 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 100 µl PBS were subcutaneously injected in the flank. Once tumors were visible, tumor volume was measured by caliper in two dimensions, and volumes were estimated using the equation V = length x width<sup>2</sup>/2.

identifying COX6B2, a subunit of complex IV of the electron chain normally only expressed in testis, as being upregulated in lung cancer and contributing to increased tumor growth and poor patient outcomes in lung cancer. This work is an example of cancers hijacking mechanisms usually restricted to a developmental or tissue-specific context in order to promote tumor growth.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Sperm-specific COX6B2 enhances oxidative phosphorylation, proliferation, and survival in lung adenocarcinoma&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alexander Muir (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work examines how lung cancer cells co-opt a sperm-specific isoform of COX6B, namely COX6B2, to promote OXPHOS, energy production and growth under nutrient poor conditions. The authors over-express or knockdown expression of COX6B2 in 2 different human lung adenocarcinoma cells lines and provide evidence that they claim shows that COX6B2 promotes tumor cell growth by promoting electron transport supercomplex formation, NAD+ and ATP production, limits ROS and promotes proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in SQ xenografts. Significantly, they suggest that COX6B2 is induced by hypoxia and allows tumor cells to survive in those conditions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the following essential revisions would be required before the manuscript would be acceptable:</p><p>1) The data indicating that COX6B2 is upregulated in lung cancers was not found to be convincing and the authors are requested as a minimum to use publicly available databases (such as TCGA and CCLE) to enhance this claim by comparing COX6B2 levels in normal and tumor tissue. The addition of IHC staining for COX6B2 levels on normal and tumor tissue would also strengthen the message and is also requested.</p><p>2) Data indicating that COX6B2 promotes ETC supercomplex formation was not found to be convincing, and additional experiments including imaging (IF for ETC components and/or EM for cristae density) and biochemical assays (measurement of Km and Kcat) on isolated mitochondria/cells to examine how COX6B2 versus COX6B1 affects activity of complex IV is required.</p><p>3) Greater analysis of the inter-relationship between COX6B1 and COX6B2 is needed for clarity, including an explanation of how they are related to each other and what is currently know about their regulation – how does the expression of one change when the other is knocked down or over-expressed. In particular, analysis of both COX6B1 and COX6B2 protein in the genetically modified lines versus controls in regular versus hypoxic conditions would be required to address why cells are not able to survive hypoxic stress despite apparently inducing endogenous COX6B2 while COXB2 over-expressing lines are able to survive.</p><p>4) There is overall some concern with the cell lines used with only one clone of each line using one set of shRNAs. These experiments do not control properly for off-target effects of shRNAs and there is some concern given the small scale of some effects that what is observed is due to those effects and not loss of COX6B2. Thus, it will be important for the authors repeat key experiments with either KO or knockdown lines that are reconstituted with COX6B2 to determine whether it can revert the phenotypes observed by knockdown with shRNAs. For example, the authors could use lines in which COX6B2 is CRISPRed out and then reconstituted with wild-type COX6B2 (or mutant COX6B2?), or alternatively, with lines utilizing multiple different sets of shRNA (targeting different defined regions of the mRNA) and again reconstituting with COX6B2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58108.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the following essential revisions would be required before the manuscript would be acceptable:</p><p>1) The data indicating that COX6B2 is upregulated in lung cancers was not found to be convincing and the authors are requested as a minimum to use publicly available databases (such as TCGA and CCLE) to enhance this claim by comparing COX6B2 levels in normal and tumor tissue.

This analysis shows a statistically significant (&lt; 0.0001) upregulation of COX6B2 in tumor tissues (Figure 1D). We have also included COX6B2 IHC staining of 22 normal and 32 tumor tissues (Figure 1G). Here, we were unable to detect COX6B2 expression in normal tissues, but observed robust expression in all but one of the tumor tissues. This data is consistent with the immunoblots presented in Figure 1E from the original submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Data indicating that COX6B2 promotes ETC supercomplex formation was not found to be convincing, and additional experiments including imaging (IF for ETC components and/or EM for cristae density) and biochemical assays (measurement of Km and Kcat) on isolated mitochondria/cells to examine how COX6B2 versus COX6B1 affects activity of complex IV is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that activity measurements of complex IV are important to the study and have included these for complex IV isolated from COX6B2 or COX6B1 overexpressing LUAD cells (Figure 3B-C). Here, we find that COX6B2 overexpression confers a significant increase (~25%) in complex IV activity. In contrast, a minimal, statistically insignificant increase in activity was observed following COX6B1 overexpression.</p><p>To more comprehensively examine supercomplex formation, we quantitated monomer, dimer and supercomplexes containing either endogenous and overexpressed COX6B1 or COX6B2 over multiple, independent experiments (Figure 3D-G). Collectively, this analysis demonstrates that ~90 % of COX6B2 (endogenous or overexpressed) is found in complex IV dimers or supercomplexes. This is in stark contrast to COX6B1, of which the majority of either endogenous or overexpressed is present in monomeric complex IV, even though there is a redistribution following overexpression. The data indicate that COX6B2 (but not COX6B1) preferentially incorporates into supercomplexes.</p><p>To further evaluate whether supercomplex formation was changing upon COX6B2 expression, we measured the distribution of the complex IV subunit, COXIV, in these complexes following COX6B1-V5 or COX6B2-V5 overexpression. Here, we found that ~40% of COXIV was in supercomplexes in the COX6B2-V5 expressing cells, while only 18% was present in supercomplexes in COX6B1-V5 expressing cells. These complex increases likely reflect the concomitant increase in OCR that we observe in COX6B2 overexpressing, but not COX6B1 cells. Together these results indicate that 1) COX6B2 preferentially integrates into dimeric complex IV and supercomplexes and 2) the expression of COX6B2 appears to shift complex IV to higher order complexes as compared to COX6B1. We have included immunofluorescence of complex IV that indicates no change in complex IV expression as we would expect (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). The text has been revised to more precisely describe these observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Greater analysis of the inter-relationship between COX6B1 and COX6B2 is needed for clarity, including an explanation of how they are related to each other and what is currently know about their regulation – how does the expression of one change when the other is knocked down or over-expressed. In particular, analysis of both COX6B1 and COX6B2 protein in the genetically modified lines versus controls in regular versus hypoxic conditions would be required to address why cells are not able to survive hypoxic stress despite apparently inducing endogenous COX6B2 while COXB2 over-expressing lines are able to survive.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a statement indicating that transcriptional regulation of COX6B1 and B2 has not previously been studied in the Introduction. Per the reviewer’s request, we measured COX6B1 and COX6B2 protein expression when the corresponding isoform is overexpressed or knocked down and did not observe any significant changes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, we have also included a measurement of COX6B1 and B2 protein accumulation in hypoxia following overexpression of the corresponding isoform (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). The data indicate that COX6B1 expression is not affected by COX6B2-V5 overexpression in normoxia or hypoxia and vice-versa.</p><p>With regard to the reviewer’s comment that the control cells are not able to survive hypoxic stress despite inducing endogenous COX6B2, we point out that this experiment measures proliferation (by EdU) not survival. We have now specified this point in the text. The control cells, inducing endogenous COX6B2, do continue to proliferate, albeit at ~40% of the original rate (this was incorrectly noted as a 30% decrease in the original text and has been corrected).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is overall some concern with the cell lines used with only one clone of each line using one set of shRNAs. These experiments do not control properly for off-target effects of shRNAs and there is some concern given the small scale of some effects that what is observed is due to those effects and not loss of COX6B2.</p></disp-quote><p>We think there was some confusion here. We performed loss of function experiments by three independent mechanisms: 1) transient transfection of siRNAs (2 independent siRNA sequences alone (Figure 5D) and in a pool (Figure 5B)); 2) lentiviral introduction of shRNAs (four independent shRNAs in a pool) and 3) transient transfection of sgRNA to perform CRISPR. The siRNA, shRNA and sgRNA sequences are all distinct from one another and target different parts of the COX6B2 mRNA. As stated in the manuscript, we were unable to establish a clone for stable knockdown (shRNA) or knockout (sgRNA) largely due to the loss of viability of these populations over time. We now indicate the method of knockdown as “siRNA”, “shRNA”, or “sgRNA” throughout the figures and text. We indicate siRNA or shRNA in the figure and legends for Figures 5-7. The sequences are all listed in the Materials and methods section. To help dispel confusion, we have noted “pool” for siRNA and shRNA where these pools were used in Figures 5-7. In addition, we have clarified this approach in the text that refers to these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, it will be important for the authors repeat key experiments with either KO or knockdown lines that are reconstituted with COX6B2 to determine whether it can revert the phenotypes observed by knockdown with shRNAs.

However, our gain of function experiments indicate that increasing COX6B2 expression leads to enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and proliferation (Figures 2 and 4). Given these gain of function phenotypes, introduction of COX6B2 in knockdown cells would likely work irrespective of off-target effects of the silencing mechanism. This issue was why we originally used siRNA, shRNA and sgRNA (CRISPR) to cross validate the loss of function phenotypes through multiple, distinct approaches. To the reviewer’s point, we have performed siRNA in the COX6B2-V5 overexpressing cells. Here, the increase in COX6B2 expression (2-fold) scales with a rescue of cleaved caspase-3 (50%), thus providing an indication that the siRNA phenotype of cleaved caspase-3 can be rescued by increasing COX6B2 expression. This figure is now in Figure 6—figure supplement 1C. To summarize, we have used three independent knockdown methods, each phenocopying one another. In addition, we use gain of function approaches, which exhibit the converse phenotype when COX6B2 but not when COX6B1 is overexpressed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
