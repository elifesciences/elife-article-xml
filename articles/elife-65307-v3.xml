heterotrimer composed of scaffolding (A), catalytic (C), and regulatory (B) subunits. PP2A complexes with B56 subunits are targeted by Shugoshin and BUBR1 to protect centromeric cohesion and stabilise kinetochore–microtubule attachments in yeast and mouse meiosis. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the closest BUBR1 orthologue lacks the B56-interaction domain and Shugoshin is not required for meiotic segregation. Therefore, the role of PP2A in <italic>C. elegans</italic> female meiosis is unknown. We report that PP2A is essential for meiotic spindle assembly and chromosome dynamics during <italic>C. elegans</italic> female meiosis. BUB-1 is the main chromosome-targeting factor for B56 subunits during prometaphase I. BUB-1 recruits PP2A:B56 to the chromosomes via a newly identified LxxIxE motif in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and this recruitment is important for proper chromosome congression. Our results highlight a novel mechanism for B56 recruitment, essential for recruiting a pool of PP2A involved in chromosome congression during meiosis I.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PP2A</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>Bub1</kwd><kwd>B56</kwd><kwd>SLiM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R008574/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bel Borja</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Soubigou</surname><given-names>Flavie</given-names></name><name><surname>Pelisch</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>208833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheerambathur</surname><given-names>Dhanya K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM074215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Budrewicz</surname><given-names>Jacqueline</given-names></name><name><surname>Lara-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM114471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sorensen Turpin</surname><given-names>Christopher G</given-names></name><name><surname>Bembenek</surname><given-names>Joshua N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105606/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelisch</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Training Programme</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Samuel JP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BUB-1 recruits PP2A/B56 to regulate chromosome congression in meiosis I.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Formation of a diploid embryo requires that sperm and egg contribute exactly one copy of each chromosome. The cell division in charge of reducing ploidy of the genome is meiosis, which involves two chromosome segregation steps after a single round of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marston and Amon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohkura, 2015</xref>). Female meiosis is particularly error prone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hassold and Hunt, 2001</xref>), which can lead to chromosomally abnormal embryos. Therefore, understanding the molecular events that guarantee proper chromosome segregation during female meiosis is of paramount importance. Cell division is under tight control of post-translational modifications (PTMs), of which phosphorylation is the most studied. The balance between kinase and phosphatase activities plays a central role, but we still lack a clear picture of how this is achieved during meiosis, especially when compared to mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gelens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Novak et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase composed of a catalytic subunit C (PPP2C), a scaffolding subunit A (PPP2R1), and a regulatory subunit B (PPP2R2–PPP2R5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cho and Xu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). While the core enzyme (A and C subunits) is invariant, diversity in PP2A holoenzyme composition arises from the different regulatory B subunits. Four families of B subunits have been characterised: B55 (B), B56 (B′), PR72 (B′′), and Striatin (B′′′) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moura and Conde, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seshacharyulu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi, 2009</xref>). In mammals and yeast, PP2A:B56 regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Espert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayward et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vallardi et al., 2019</xref>), chromosome congression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), and centromeric cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kitajima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riedel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>PP2A:B56 can be targeted to distinct sites by different proteins, and two mechanisms have been characterised at the structural level. While an N-terminal coiled coil domain in Shugoshin/MEI-S332 binds PP2A:B56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2009</xref>), other substrates and/or regulatory proteins contain short linear motifs (SLiMs) following the consensus LxxIxE, which interact directly with B56 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hertz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Roey and Davey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). BubR1 is one of the most widely studied LxxIxE-containing proteins and has been well characterised during mitosis, where it plays a role in targeting PP2A:B56 to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kruse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</xref>). BubR1 is also required during mouse meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Homer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Touati et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>) where kinetochore–microtubule attachments are stabilised through kinetochore dephosphorylation by PP2A:B56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the meiotic role of PP2A remains unexplored. The core components of the PP2A holoenzyme in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are LET-92 (catalytic C subunit) and PAA-1 (scaffolding A subunit), and the regulatory B subunits are B55<sup>SUR-6</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sieburth et al., 1999</xref>), B56<sup>PPTR-1</sup> and B56<sup>PPTR-2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Padmanabhan et al., 2009</xref>), B72<sup>RSA-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlaitz et al., 2007</xref>), and CASH-1/Striatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pal et al., 2017</xref>). PP2A complexes containing B55<sup>SUR-6</sup> and B72<sup>RSA-1</sup> play important roles during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlaitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2011</xref>), and while PP2A likely plays a role during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlaitz et al., 2007</xref>), this has not been studied. Interestingly, the closest <italic>C. elegans</italic> BubR1 orthologue, Mad3<sup>SAN-1</sup>, does not localise to unattached kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Essex et al., 2009</xref>) and lacks the domain responsible for PP2A:B56 targeting. Additionally, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Shugoshin orthologue, SGO-1, is dispensable for protection of cohesion in meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>) and for counteracting Aurora B-targeting histone H3T3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrandiz et al., 2018</xref>). These observations suggest the existence of additional unknown mechanisms of PP2A regulation.</p><p>In the present work, we used <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes to establish the role and regulation of PP2A during female meiosis. We found that PP2A is essential for female meiosis, and its recruitment to meiotic chromosomes and spindle is mediated by the B56 regulatory subunits PPTR-1 and PPTR-2. Targeting of the B56 subunits is mediated by the kinase BUB-1 through a canonical B56 LxxIxE motif, which targets both PPTR-1 and PPTR-2 to the chromosomes and central spindle during meiosis. Overall, we provide evidence for a novel, BUB-1-regulated role for PP2A:B56 in chromosome congression during female meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PP2A is essential for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during meiosis I</title><p>We used dissected <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes to assess the role and regulation of PP2A (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for schematic) during female meiosis by following spindle and chromosome dynamics using GFP-tagged tubulin and mCherry-tagged histone. During meiosis I, six pairs of homologous chromosomes (bivalents) are captured by an acentrosomal spindle. Chromosomes then align and segregate. For our analysis, we defined metaphase I (t = 0) as the frame before we detected chromosome separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In wild-type oocytes, chromosome segregation is associated with dramatic changes in microtubule organisation as anaphase progresses, with microtubule density decreasing in poles and the bulk of GFP::tubulin is detected in the central spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). In contrast, depletion of the PP2A catalytic subunit LET-92 drastically affects meiosis I with chromosomes failing to align in 84% of the oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, cyan arrow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; p&lt;0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). During anaphase, chromosomes collapse into a small area where, in some cases, two chromosome masses were visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, yellow arrow). Interestingly, severe chromosome segregation defects do not necessarily lead to polar body extrusion (PBE) defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schlientz and Bowerman, 2020</xref>). In the absence of PP2Ac, only 15% of oocytes achieved PBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, p&lt;0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). Similar defects were observed by depleting the sole PP2A scaffolding subunit, PAA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

GFP::ASPM-1 displays two focused poles in 100% of wild-type oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>, cyan arrows). In contrast, GFP::ASPM-1 foci fail to coalesce in 95% of <italic>let-92(RNAi)</italic> oocytes, displaying a cluster of small foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, orange arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is essential for meiosis I in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the PP2A heterotrimer highlighting the single catalytic and scaffold subunits in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (LET-92 and PAA-1, respectively).

PPTR-1 has the highest sequence identity with human B56α2 (68.3%) and ε3 (71.87%), whereas PPTR-2 displays the highest sequence identity with human B56δ3 (66.19%) and B56γ1 (68.97%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Closer analysis of the C-terminal sequence in B56 which plays a key role in specifying centromere versus kinetochore localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vallardi et al., 2019</xref>) further confirmed that PPTR-1 displays the highest sequence identity with the centromeric B56s, α and ε (93.75% and 87.5%, respectively), while PPTR-2 displays the highest sequence identity with the kinetochore-localised B56, γ and δ (93.75% and 100%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We will henceforth refer to PPTR-1 as B56α<sup>PPTR-1</sup> and PPTR-2 as B56γ<sup>PPTR-2</sup>. We used endogenous GFP-tagged versions of B56α<sup>PPTR-1</sup> and B56γ<sup>PPTR-2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) and analysed their dynamic localisation pattern in greater spatial and temporal detail.

These effects are likely brought about by a combination of different PP2A subcomplexes with varying regulatory B subunits. PP2A:B56 regulates chromosome dynamics prior to segregation since depletion of the two B56 orthologues, PPTR-1 and PPTR-2, leads to alignment defects. We have uncovered a new phospho-regulated B56 LxxIxE motif in <italic>C. elegans</italic> BUB-1 that recruits PP2A:B56 and is important for chromosome alignment during meiosis I.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Dissecting the role of PP2A during oocyte meiosis</title><p>Depletion of the sole catalytic or scaffold PP2A subunits leads to massive meiotic failure and embryonic lethality. The earliest effect we could see in our experimental set up is a failure to assemble a bipolar spindle. This will of course have a direct impact on any process that should occur after spindle assembly, including chromosome alignment and segregation, followed by PBE. However, BUB-1 depletion leads to severe spindle assembly and alignment defects, yet in the majority of cases, chromosomes segregate (with visible errors – lagging chromosomes) and polar bodies do extrude. Therefore, lack of a proper bipolar metaphase spindle is not sufficient to result in lack of segregation or PBE. PP2A complexes harbouring the B56 subunits PPTR-1 and PPTR-2 are required to target the phosphatase to chromosomes to regulate chromosome alignment in metaphase I. Furthermore, this chromosomal B56 pool is recruited by BUB-1 through its LxxIxE SLiM motif. Mutation of this motif that prevents binding to B56 subunits leads to alignment defects. B56 subunits however are not involved in spindle pole targeting of PP2A, suggesting that this spindle pole pool is the one relevant for spindle assembly. Our attempts to address a possible role for other B subunits were focused on RSA-1 and SUR-6 given their reported centrosomal roles during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlaitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2011</xref>). However, neither RSA-1 nor SUR-6 was required for meiotic spindle assembly. It is likely that the role of PP2A on spindle assembly is achieved by a combination of B subunits and that could also include uncharacterised B subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">UniProt Consortium et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>B56 targeting during different stages of meiosis I</title><p>Chromosomal PPTR-1 and PPTR-2 and the ensuing PP2A targeting prior to chromosome segregation depend on the BUB-1 LxxIxE motif. Interestingly, this dependency changes during anaphase, where PPTR-2 chromosomal targeting is BUB-1 dependent but LxxIxE motif independent and depends on the kinase domain. The regulation of protein localisation during meiosis I in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes is highly dynamic, and differences have been observed between metaphase and anaphase. For example, while kinetochore localisation of the CLASP orthologue CLS-2 during metaphase depends on BUB-1, a pool of CLS-2 is able to localise in the anaphase central spindle in a BUB-1-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laband et al., 2017</xref>). In this line, since its role during meiosis was first described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumont et al., 2010</xref>), there has been no clear explanation as to the cause of the alignment and segregation defects upon BUB-1 depletion. Our results provide a plausible explanation for the role of BUB-1 in chromosome alignment during oocyte meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> through the recruitment of PP2A:B56.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Possible function of chromosome-associated PP2A</title><p>As mentioned above, the PP2A complexes are likely playing a number of important roles during meiosis. Our work uncovers a function during chromosome congression involving B56 subunits targeted by BUB-1. Similar to mice and yeast, it is therefore likely that PP2A complexes at the chromosome control proper chromosome-spindle attachments. The alignment defects we observed upon PPTR-1/2 depletion (or in the LxxIxE motif mutant) resemble those reported in the absence of kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Danlasky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumont et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, PP2A:B56 complexes containing PPTR-1 and PPTR-2 are present at the meiotic kinetochore, and it is therefore possible that PP2A:B56 works in parallel to and/or regulates kinetochore protein(s). Furthermore, we detected GFP::PAA-1 on anaphase chromosomes, similar to kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Danlasky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumont et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>During meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Aurora B orthologue, AIR-2, concentrates in the interface between homologous chromosomes (i.e. the midbivalent; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaitna et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schumacher et al., 1998</xref>), and its activity is counteracted by PP1, which is recruited by the protein LAB-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tzur et al., 2012</xref>). PP1 counteracts Aurora B<sup>AIR-2</sup> during meiosis by antagonising Haspin-mediated H3T3 phosphorylation in the long arm of the bivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrandiz et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, PP1 depletion leads to loss of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaitna et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>). During prometaphase and metaphase I, Aurora B<sup>AIR-2</sup> is retained in the bivalent, whereas PP1 resides mainly in kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>) and it is therefore likely that other phosphatase(s) will be involved in controlling Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation events during metaphase I. Since PP2A:B56 is concentrated in the midbivalent during meiosis I, we hypothesise that it could be balancing AIR-2 activity during meiosis. In this respect, we found that serine 612 in BUB-1 is phosphorylated and this serine is embedded in a sequence (RRL<underline>S</underline>I) closely resembling the consensus for PP2A:B56 reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kruse et al., 2020</xref>. Furthermore, the sequence also fits into the loosely defined Aurora B consensus RRxSφ (where φ is a hydrophobic aa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cheeseman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deretic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>).

The membrane was then imaged using LI-COR Odyssey CLx.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Expression and purification of PPTR-2</title><p>PPTR-2 was expressed from pHISTEV30a vector as a 6xHis- and Strep-tagged protein (plasmid fgp_445) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) and the bacterial culture was incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking at 220 rpm. Bacteria were grown in TB medium at 37°C with shaking at 220 rpm until OD600 reached ~0.6–0.8 and induced with 150 μM IPTG. Induction was performed at 18°C with shaking at 220 rpm for ~16 hr. Cells were pelleted and lysed by sonication in 50 mM NaP, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP, (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) and protease inhibitors. After binding to a Ni-NTA column, protein was washed with 20 mM imidazole and then eluted with 350 mM imidazole. The tag was cleaved with 6xHis-tagged TEV (Tobacco Etch Virus Protease) protease overnight at 4°C, and the tag and protease were removed from the sample by binding to Ni-NTA. PPTR-2 was concentrated and further purified using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg size exclusion column.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Fluorescence polarisation</title><p>The following peptides were synthesised by peptides and elephants GmbH: BUB-1 FITC-Ahx-NPRRRHLSPVSEKTVDDEEE, pBUB-1 FITC-Ahx-NPRRRHLphSPVSEKTVDDEEE, and LAVA FITC-Ahx-NPRRRHASPASEKTVDDEEE. Reactions (35 µl) were set up in FP buffer (50 mM NaP pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP) containing peptide concentrations 0.5–1 µM. These were then used to create a 1:2 serial dilution series using FP buffer containing the same peptide concentrations as above as well as the indicated concentration of PPTR-2. Reactions were left for 30 min before triplicates of each dilution were aliquoted into a black 384-well plate, centrifuged (2 min, 2000 rpm), and analysed using the PheraStar FS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Image analysis and statistics</title><p>For time-dependent analysis, metaphase I was taken as time = 0 s. This frame was chosen as the previous frame where the first indication of chromosome separation was visible. All image analysis was done in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). For total intensity measurements within the meiotic spindle, images were thresholded and binary images were generated using the ReinyEntropy method and used to automatically generate the regions of interest (ROIs) for each slice (z) and time point (t) or in the sum-projected image. Going through all the slices was particularly necessary when measuring protein intensity associated with a specific structure/location, since the angle of the spindle can lead to erroneous analysis. All ROIs were recorded and, in order to get background measurements, the ROIs were automatically placed on a different oocyte region, away from the spindle. Background-substracted intensity values were then normalised to the maximum intensity value of the control video using Graphpad Prism 7.0 and are presented as mean ± s.e.m.</p><p>Central spindle to chromosome ratio for PPTR-2::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) was obtained as follows. Images were selected at early anaphase (t = 40 s), and to obtain the chromosome ROIs, we used the mCherry::histone channel to create a mask. These ROIs were transferred to the PPTR-2::GFP channel, and the intensity was measured as described above. The region between the chromosomes was selected intensities were measured to obtain the central spindle intensity. Background corrected values were used to obtain the ratio central spindle/chromosome. Results are shown as median with interquartile range, and differences were analysed using an unpaired two-tailed t-test with Welch’s correction.</p><p>For the alignment/congression analysis, we selected videos in which the spindles were contained in a single Z-plane at −80 s. There, we established the spindle axes with a line extending from pole to pole and the ‘metaphase plate’ with a perpendicular line in the middle of the spindle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). A line was drawn on the long axes of the bivalents, and the angle between this line and the spindle axis was measured (‘θ’). Additionally, for each bivalent, the distance (‘d’) between the centre of the bivalent and the metaphase plate was measured.</p><p>Contingency tables were analysed using the Fisher’s exact test (two tailed), and the p values are presented in the figures and/or in the text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Generation of supplementary videos</title><p>The 4D TIFF files were converted to video (.avi) files using a custom-made macro that uses the StackReg Fiji plugin for image registration. Videos were assembled using maximum-intensity projections; hence, the videos might not match a specific panel within the main figures, which are single slices or partial projections in order to highlight specific characteristics.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Peter Askjaer, Guy Benian, Needhi Bhalla, Bruce Bowerman, Arshad Desai, Tony Hyman, and Enrique Martinez-Perez for sharing <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and antibodies.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Using a combination of biochemistry, genetics and live imaging, Borja et al. show that the kinase BUB-1 recruits, through two regulatory subunits, the phosphatase PP2A to meiotic spindle chromosomes during oocyte meiosis I to promote proper congression of the chromosomes prior to anaphase. This recruitment occurs independently of the conserved protein Shugoshin, which has been shown by others to promote PP2A recruitment to chromosomes during mouse oocyte meiosis I. Moreover, Borja et al. show that phosphorylation of a peptide motif in BUB-1 promotes this recruitment, and that this BUB-1motif is likely targeted by CDK-1 for phosphorylation to provide proper temporal regulation of these events.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;PP2A:B56 Regulates Meiotic Chromosome Segregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> Oocytes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jakob Nilsson (Reviewer #2); Patrick Meraldi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>You will see from the reviews that all the reviewers agree that your study will be of interest to the meiosis community in identifying that BUB1 rather than Sgo recruits PP2A, but that also all agree that more experiments are required to provide firm evidence for a number of your conclusions that would be necessary for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>; in particular whether BUB1 directly binds to PP2A, through the LxxIxE motif, and whether Cdk phosphorylation of this is important. After discussion, they concluded that the amount of time and effort that will be required for these experiments is such that the fairest thing to do is to return the manuscript to you.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Borja et al. describe their analysis of the requirements for the phosphatase PP2A during <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocyte meiotic cell division. They show that PP2A and two conserved B56-type regulatory subunits are localized to spindle poles, chromosomes and the central spindle (with some differences for the B56 subunits), and that all required for spindle assembly, chromosome congression to the metaphase plate, and for chromosome segregation (with some redundancy for the two B56 subunits). The further show that a conserved LxxIxE motif in BUB-1 recruits most of one and some of the other B56 subunit, and that the kinase domain of BUB-1 is required to recruit the other (presumably through an intermediary). Thus in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a novel form of PP2A recruitment functions, with the other known recruiters, Shugoshin and Mad3 (also with LxxIxE motifs), appearing not be required. The authors use mutational analysis to nicely document the requirements for both parts of BUB-1 in PP2A recruitment, and also identify a phosphorylated residue in BUB-1 that may be involved in CDK-1 regulation of the recruitment. The authors propose that BUB-1 recruitment of PP2A to the central spindle is important for chromosome segregation during anaphase in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocyte meiosis I.</p><p>While the authors provide an extensive analysis of the requirements for PP2A during <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocyte meiosis, with results that will be of substantial interest to investigators studyng oocyte meiotic cell division, the advances are in my opinion to incremental, and also lacking in conclusiveness as to the actual mechanism involved. Therefore as written the manuscript is not suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, as summarized in the major comments below.</p><p>1) The authors provide clear evidence that PP2A is required for spindle assembly, congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate, and chromosome segregation (with some caveats as to chromosome segregation noted below). While the authors favor and propose that the chromosome segregation defects are due to central spindle defects (with PP2A localizing to the central spindle), they in fact provide no evidence to support this conclusion. It is entirely possible that earlier spindle assembly defects are responsible for the subsequent defects in both congression and segregation. The authors fail to address this possibility and provide no evidence to rule it out. Without some idea as to which targets PP2A acts through, the advance is incremental relative to what is known in other systems, only showing a variation on how LxxIxE motifs can recruit PP2A to spindle structures through BUB-1 instead of other factors. The authors discuss the AuroraB kinase AIR-2 as a possible target but provide no analysis of such a role. Without more mechanistic insight, the manuscript is of substantial interest but seems more appropriate for a more specialized journal such as Molecular Biology of the Cell.</p><p>2) In figures throughout the manuscript, the authors use polar body extrusion as a proxy for chromosome segregation defects. However, it is known from work on other <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants that chromosomes segregation and polar extrusion are not tightly correlated. The authors should establish a more direct approach to quantifying the defects in chromosome segregation; as written only representative examples are shown.</p><p>3) The authors show that there are severe spindle assembly defects after knockdown of PP2A but only show microtubules and chromosomes to document the defects. Given that the spindle assembly defects might be primarily responsible for subsequent defects in chromosome alignment and segregation, the authors should better characterize the spindle assembly defects using pole marker(s). Do mutant oocytes even establish a bipolar spindle? From the images, it seems likely they do not.</p><p>4) The authors generate point mutations in both the LxxIxE motif and the kinase domain of BUB-1 to nicely document requirements for recruiting PP2A. However, the authors do not include any mention of whether these mutations are essential for oocyte meiotic cell division, or if the mutations are associated with any embryonic lethality (they only show some relatively rare defects in chromosome alignment). In fact, from the supplemental tables it appears that both mutant strains are homozygous viable, although this is never mentioned in the text. If these motifs are indeed responsible for recruiting PP2A and its essential functions to the spindle, then the mutants should result in defects identical to the PP2A knockdowns. Thus to verify the importance of these mutations, the authors would need to construct a balanced strain in which both motifs are mutated and document defects much like those observed in the PP2A knockdowns. More generally, the authors should provide a genetic analysis of the viability of the single mutants (are there reductions in embryonic lethality or brood sizes?).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript explores female meiosis and the role of Bub1 in targeting PP2A-B56 to chromosomes and central spindle for proper meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Although the shugoshin proteins have been shown to be important regulators of cohesin during meiosis by recruiting PP2A-B56 in other systems the authors show this is not the case in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Instead they show that the Bub1 protein recruits PP2A-B56 through a LxxIxE motif that resembles the one found in human BubR1. Mutation of this motif prevents the recruitment of the PPTR1 (one of the B56 isoforms) to the midbivalent and the central spindle and reduces the recruitment of the PPTR2 to the central spindle. The Bub1 variant with a mutated LxxIxE motif displays misalignments suggesting an imbalance in phosphorylations. The phenotype of the Bub1 mutant is not as severe as Bub1 RNAi but this could be because the kinase domain of Bub1 helps in recruiting PPTR2.</p><p>Overall the paper is easy to read and the data are consistent. However, the paper is fairly descriptive and lacks to some degree mechanistic insight. I think that some additional experiments would make the work more interesting for the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Characterization of the double Bub1 mutant with a mutated LxxIxE motif and mutations in the kinase domain. This would clarify if there is some redundancy in recruitment mechanisms</p><p>2) Direct evidence that the LxxIxE motif of Bub1 facilitates binding to PPTR1/2 – IP or purified components</p><p>3) Characterization of the LAPI mutation of the LxxIxE motif to determine if Cdk1 phosphorylation of this site is important. Reading the manuscript as it is now this is purely speculative despite they go through the effort of showing phosphorylation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study by Bel Borja and colleagues studies to which extent the PP2A phosphatase contributes to chromosome segregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> anaphase. It finds that PP2A plays a crucial role in chromosome alignment and segregation. This role depends on the B56 regulatory subunits. Moreover, the author show that the recruitment of the B56 subunits to the spindle apparatus and kinetochores in anaphase depends on the Bub-1 kinase.</p><p>The study explores a novel role of PP2A in <italic>C. elegans</italic> anaphase, and is generally of good technical quality (see below), yet at the same time feels a bit thin in terms of results. In particular several major claims of the discussion are not supported by the data. Moreover, it is not clear to which extent the reported experiments are reproducible.</p><p>1) The authors do not indicate the number of independent experiments or the number of embryos on which the conclusions are based on. This information is essential to evaluate the reproducibility of the results. The authors use good statistical tests, but the reader must know whether the experiments are based on 5, 10 or 20 embryos.</p><p>2) The authors claim the Bub-1 acts on <italic>C. elegans</italic> anaphase by RECRUITING PP2A:B56 to the spindle apparatus. The presented experiments only show that the localization of the B56 depends on Bub-1, which is not the same thing. The authors could test by IP and in vitro pull-down that the claimed interaction is direct (in vitro), or that the proteins are part of the same complex (in vivo). This should be feasible since the authors already have performed IP experiments.</p><p>3) The authors claim that PP2A:B56 counteracts Aurora-B during anaphase, but have no evidence for this claim. Does a Aurora-B hypomorph mutant attenuate the B56 loss phenotype? While a negative result would not mean that the model is wrong, a positive result would certainly help to bolster that claim.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65307.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Our biggest mistake was to base the alignment analysis on subjective observations its classification as either “aligned” or “misaligned”.</p><p>Firstly, we performed a new analysis related to the chromosome alignment phenotype. This is now detailed in the Materials and methods section and it provides more rigorous and less subjective quantifications which lead us to a better characterisation of this phenotype. This had a tremendous impact on the manuscript, because it is precisely this process of chromosome alignment where BUB-1 targeted PP2A:B56 plays a role. To avoid any potential amplification of the phenotypes due to partial loss of function in PP2A subunits, we decided to measure the phenotypes on the GFP::tubulin expressing strain and not on the strains with tagged PP2A subunits.</p><p>PP2A is essential for the assembly of a bipolar spindle (New Figure 1F,G) and chromosome alignment and segregation. While we agree with the reviewer that in this case it is difficult to tease out whether the alignment and segregation are only a direct consequence of this, depletion of the B56 subunits PPTR-1 and PPTR-2 does not affect spindle assembly but perturbs chromosome alignment/congression (New Figure 2E,F). Since this phenotype is measurable and independent from any noticeable spindle defect, we focused on this “clean” phenotype and sought to understand the molecular mechanisms driving it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Without some idea as to which targets PP2A acts through, the advance is incremental relative to what is known in other systems, only showing a variation on how LxxIxE motifs can recruit PP2A to spindle structures through BUB-1 instead of other factors.

On the other hand, while BUB-1 is known to be important during female meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it was not clear what role(s) BUB-1 play. Therefore, we think we are providing a significant advance on the mechanisms in place to regulate meiosis I. While we are actively working on identifying PP2A substrates and its potential role in antagonising Aurora B, we think this will require an in depth analysis that will be the focus of another paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In figures throughout the manuscript, the authors use polar body extrusion as a proxy for chromosome segregation defects. However, it is known from work on other <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants that chromosomes segregation and polar extrusion are not tightly correlated. The authors should establish a more direct approach to quantifying the defects in chromosome segregation; as written only representative examples are shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the misunderstanding. We did not intend to use PB extrusion as a proxy for chromosome segregation defects, but rather analysed it as an independent process. We are now making this clear in the manuscript. We analyse chromosome alignment defects (see below), lagging chromosomes, and polar body extrusion. For these three phenomena, we provide the quantitative assessment for each condition and show a representative image (or sets of images).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show that there are severe spindle assembly defects after knockdown of PP2A but only show microtubules and chromosomes to document the defects. Given that the spindle assembly defects might be primarily responsible for subsequent defects in chromosome alignment and segregation, the authors should better characterize the spindle assembly defects using pole marker(s). Do mutant oocytes even establish a bipolar spindle? From the images, it seems likely they do not.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have performed new experiments using GFP-ASPM-1 as a pole marker. As expected, LET-92-depleted oocytes fail to assemble a bipolar spindle (New Figure 1F,G). As mentioned above, in order to differentiate subsequent phenotypes from the spindle defect, we focused on the alignment/congression defects which are observed even in the presence of a seemingly normal bipolar spindle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors generate point mutations in both the LxxIxE motif and the kinase domain of BUB-1 to nicely document requirements for recruiting PP2A. However, the authors do not include any mention of whether these mutations are essential for oocyte meiotic cell division, or if the mutations are associated with any embryonic lethality (they only show some relatively rare defects in chromosome alignment). In fact, from the supplemental tables it appears that both mutant strains are homozygous viable, although this is never mentioned in the text. If these motifs are indeed responsible for recruiting PP2A and its essential functions to the spindle, then the mutants should result in defects identical to the PP2A knockdowns. Thus to verify the importance of these mutations, the authors would need to construct a balanced strain in which both motifs are mutated and document defects much like those observed in the PP2A knockdowns. More generally, the authors should provide a genetic analysis of the viability of the single mutants (are there reductions in embryonic lethality or brood sizes?).</p></disp-quote><p>Full analysis of embryo viability and brood size analysis is now presented for all the mutants used in the study (Figure 7-figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript explores female meiosis and the role of Bub1 in targeting PP2A-B56 to chromosomes and central spindle for proper meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Although the shugoshin proteins have been shown to be important regulators of cohesin during meiosis by recruiting PP2A-B56 in other systems the authors show this is not the case in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Instead they show that the Bub1 protein recruits PP2A-B56 through a LxxIxE motif that resembles the one found in human BubR1. Mutation of this motif prevents the recruitment of the PPTR1 (one of the B56 isoforms) to the midbivalent and the central spindle and reduces the recruitment of the PPTR2 to the central spindle. The Bub1 variant with a mutated LxxIxE motif displays misalignments suggesting an imbalance in phosphorylations. The phenotype of the Bub1 mutant is not as severe as Bub1 RNAi but this could be because the kinase domain of Bub1 helps in recruiting PPTR2.</p><p>Overall the paper is easy to read and the data are consistent. However, the paper is fairly descriptive and lacks to some degree mechanistic insight. I think that some additional experiments would make the work more interesting for the readers of eLife.</p><p>1) Characterization of the double Bub1 mutant with a mutated LxxIxE motif and mutations in the kinase domain. This would clarify if there is some redundancy in recruitment mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the suggested experiment. The results indicate that LxxIxE motif-mediated recruitment of B56 subunits operates mostly in the midbivalent and central spindle, whereas the kinase domain mediates mostly chromosome chromosomal recruitment of the B56 subunits (New Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Direct evidence that the LxxIxE motif of Bub1 facilitates binding to PPTR1/2 – IP or purified components.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed in vitro binding experiments and present evidence for the direct interaction between the LxxIxE motif of BUB-1 and B56. We expressed recombinant, full-length PPTR-2 in bacteria and performed fluorescence polarisation experiments using fluorescently labelled LxxIxE motif peptides. We could observe that PPTR-2 bound the wild - type sequence and that L282A,V285A mutations abolished binding (New Figure 4D). On the contrary, binding was enhanced when the peptide was phosphorylated at Serine 283 (New Figure 5F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Characterization of the LAPI mutation of the LxxIxE motif to determine if Cdk1 phosphorylation of this site is important. Reading the manuscript as it is now this is purely speculative despite they go through the effort of showing phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded on the LxxIxE motif phosphorylation and its role in vivo.</p><p>1) in vitro assays demonstrate that Cdk1 phosphorylates Serine 283 in vitro. This is now part of the New Figure 5C-E.</p><p>2) To analyse the role of Serine 283 phosphorylation in vivo, we mutated it to alanine in endogenous BUB-1. PPTR-1 and PPTR-2 localisation to the midbivalent and central spindle was significantly affected in BUB-1<sup>S283A</sup>, achieving a similar effect to that of BUB-1<sup>L282A,V285A</sup>. Previous data showed that substituting I for V in the LxxIxE motif decreases affinity and we believe in this case this renders the motif more dependent on phosphorylation. These results are included in the New Figure 6.</p><p>3) In addition to the previously reported mass spec data, we now show the localisation of the L(pS)PVSE motif by immunofluorescence with a newly generated phospho-specific antibody (New Figure 5G,H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The study by Bel Borja and colleagues studies to which extent the PP2A phosphatase contributes to chromosome segregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> anaphase. It finds that PP2A plays a crucial role in chromosome alignment and segregation. This role depends on the B56 regulatory subunits. Moreover, the author show that the recruitment of the B56 subunits to the spindle apparatus and kinetochores in anaphase depends on the Bub-1 kinase.</p><p>The study explores a novel role of PP2A in <italic>C. elegans</italic> anaphase, and is generally of good technical quality (see below), yet at the same time feels a bit thin in terms of results. In particular several major claims of the discussion are not supported by the data. Moreover, it is not clear to which extent the reported experiments are reproducible.</p><p>1) The authors do not indicate the number of independent experiments or the number of embryos on which the conclusions are based on. This information is essential to evaluate the reproducibility of the results. The authors use good statistical tests, but the reader must know whether the experiments are based on 5, 10 or 20 embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included all the information in the graphs. For intensity measurements, “N” is the number of experiments, and “n” is the number of oocytes. For the congression and alignment analysis, “N” is the number of spindles (=number of oocytes) and “n” is the number of bivalents analysed. In the latter analysis, information on the number of experiments used to obtain the data is stated in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim the Bub-1 acts on <italic>C. elegans</italic> anaphase by RECRUITING PP2A:B56 to the spindle apparatus. The presented experiments only show that the localization of the B56 depends on Bub-1, which is not the same thing. The authors could test by IP and in vitro pull-down that the claimed interaction is direct (in vitro), or that the proteins are part of the same complex (in vivo). This should be feasible since the authors already have performed IP experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern and we have now changed the wording when referring to this. We have performed in vitro binding experiments and present evidence for the direct interaction between the LxxIxE motif of BUB-1 and PPTR-2 (New Figures 4D and 5F). We expressed recombinant, full-length PPTR-2 in bacteria and performed fluorescence polarisation experiments using fluorescently labelled LxxIxE motif peptides. PPTR-2 bound the wild type sequence and that binding was abolished by the L282A,V285A mutations and enhanced when the peptide was phosphorylated at Serine 283.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that PP2A:B56 counteracts Aurora-B during anaphase, but have no evidence for this claim. Does a Aurora-B hypomorph mutant attenuate the B56 loss phenotype? While a negative result would not mean that the model is wrong, a positive result would certainly help to bolster that claim.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we think we are providing a significant advance on the mechanisms in place to regulate meiosis I by specific recruitment of PP2A/B56. While we are actively working on identifying PP2A substrates and its potential role in antagonising Aurora B, we believe this will require an in-depth analysis that will be the focus of another paper. We have now focused our discussion on our actual data and left this as an interesting, yet unsupported, hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
