The presumed biogenesis of these RNAs involves a non-canonical ‘backsplicing’ event. Recent studies in mammalian cell culture posit that backsplicing is facilitated by inverted repeats flanking the circularized exon(s). Although such sequence elements are common in mammals, they are rare in lower eukaryotes, making current models insufficient to describe circularization. Through systematic splice site mutagenesis and the identification of splicing intermediates, we show that circular RNA in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is generated through an exon-containing lariat precursor. Furthermore, we have performed high-throughput and comprehensive mutagenesis of a circle-forming exon, which enabled us to discover a systematic effect of exon length on RNA circularization. Our results uncover a mechanism for circular RNA biogenesis that may account for circularization in genes that lack noticeable flanking intronic secondary structure.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07540.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07540.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07540.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA contains the instructions to make proteins. These instructions are first copied into a molecule of RNA, which often has sections that code for protein (called exons) interrupted by non-coding sections (called introns). A process called splicing removes the introns and joins the exons to form a mature RNA molecule that is then translated to make proteins.</p><p>The standard splicing process joins the first exon to the second, and the second to the third, and so on to produce a liner RNA molecule. Occasionally, one or more of the exons can be skipped in a process known as ‘alternative splicing’. In recent years, scientists have discovered that another type of alternative splicing, which creates circular RNA molecules, is common in animal cells. It was suggested that circular RNAs might form when the splicing machinery joins the two ends of the same exon via a process referred to as ‘backsplicing’.</p><p>Standard splicing first converts an intron into a looped structure called a ‘lariat’ (which resembles a lasso); the lariat is then removed by the splicing machinery and destroyed. When exons are skipped during alternative splicing, a large lariat containing the skipped exon is produced. Now, Barrett et al. have used yeast cells to investigate how circular RNAs are formed. Yeast is a good model to study this process because it can be manipulated easily in the laboratory and expresses circular RNAs. The experiments show that lariat structures containing exons (as would be expected from exon-skipping) are a common intermediate step before the production of a circular RNA. However, some exon-containing lariats do not go on to form circular RNAs, suggesting that additional factors are important for the production of circular RNAs.</p><p>Barrett et al. next investigated the reasons why certain exons formed circular RNAs while others did not and revealed that longer exons formed circular RNAs more readily than shorter exons. Further work is now required to understand the molecular basis of this result and identify other factors that contribute to the formation of circular RNAs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07540.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07540.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>circular RNA</kwd><kwd>lariat</kwd><kwd>debranching</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00, CA168987-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salzman</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007491</institution-id><institution>Donald E. and Delia B.

This exon is flanked by long (∼15 kb) inverted sequence whose complementarity is required for circularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubin et al., 1995</xref>). Early in vitro studies also demonstrated that complementary sequences flanking an exon can promote circularization, though they did not appear necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pasman et al., 1996</xref>). Modeled after work on SRY, recent studies in mammalian cell culture have found similar results in human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang and Wilusz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>), and additional genome-wide computational sequence analysis suggests this complementary sequence-mediated mechanism may be widespread and associated with Alu elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ivanov et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although widespread in mammalian genomes, repeat sequences are far less common in the genomes of simple eukaryotes, indicating that an alternative mechanism may be at play in these organisms and in human genes that lack inverted repeats. In addition, a recently published study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> fails to find a remarkable relationship between secondary structure and circular RNA biogenesis, noting that there are no noticeable sequence motifs in the introns flanking circularized exons besides canonical splice site sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Westholm et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>An alternative mechanism that has long been proposed in the literature involves an exon-containing lariat, which can serve as a precursor to the circularized exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, right) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zaphiropoulos, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Surono et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burd et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jeck and Sharpless, 2014</xref>). An early study noted a correlation between exon-skipping events and circular RNA isoforms in the human cytochrome P450 2C18 gene, describing four alternative circularization events and their corresponding exon-skipped transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zaphiropoulos, 1996</xref>); a similar correspondence was noted in the dystrophin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Surono et al., 1999</xref>). Recently, a study in human cell culture posits a correlation between exon skipping and circular RNA biogenesis in a model gene, but treats the exon-skipping event as a byproduct rather than a precursor of the backsplicing event, regarding inverted sequences as the determinant of circularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>). Indeed, the only current evidence for this model is based on correlation between exon skipping and circular RNA production in a handful of genes. No biochemical evidence of the activity of this pathway has been provided, and no global relationship exists between exon skipping and circular RNA biogenesis.</p><p>Due to the large size of human genes, cell culture studies have been unable to ectopically express entire circle-forming genes on a plasmid and therefore have not been able to completely recapitulate splicing from the endogenous locus. Instead, expressed minigenes containing circle-forming exons and immediately flanking sequence have been used as surrogates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang and Wilusz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Starke et al., 2015</xref>). These expression vectors may produce results that are due to characteristics of transcription in the minigene and, in some cases, generate large amounts of off-target splice products. The ability to recapitulate the splicing of an endogenous locus is a powerful tool for studying the mechanism of circular RNA production. For this reason, we turned to <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> as our model system for studying this process. With a simple and small gene structure and relatively high expression of some circular RNAs, <italic>S. pombe</italic> is an ideal system for studying circular RNA biogenesis. Because the second exon of <italic>mrps16</italic> is the most highly expressed circular RNA in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), we have adopted <italic>mrps16</italic> as our model RNA for studying circular RNA production in the present work.</p><p>Utilizing the lariat debranching mutant (<italic>dbr1∆</italic>), we provide direct evidence of an exon-containing lariat precursor and the double lariat resulting from lariat re-splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, right). Furthermore, by expressing <italic>mrps16</italic> on a plasmid, we completely recapitulate the quantitative relationship between circular and linear RNA expression in this gene, and through systematic splice site deletions of this plasmid, we demonstrate the necessity of a lariat precursor for circular RNA biogenesis. However, lariat production is not sufficient for circularization, as demonstrated by the existence of several exon-containing lariats that do not give rise to circular RNAs, indicating an additional parameter regulating their production. Overall, circularized exons are generally much larger than these skipped, uncircularized exons. To test if the length of circularized exons directly affects their circularization efficiency (CE), we utilized high-throughput and comprehensive mutagenesis of the <italic>mrps16</italic> exon, which revealed that exon size is a significant determinant of RNA circularization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Direct biochemical detection of backsplicing intermediates supports the existence of an exon-containing lariat precursor</title><p>We considered two models for the production of circular RNA in <italic>mrps16</italic>: that circular RNA is generated by ‘direct backsplicing,’ perhaps facilitated by complementary sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, left), or through a lariat precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, right). Each model predicts a distinct set of biochemical intermediates and byproducts: a Y-shaped intermediate in the case of direct backsplicing; and a lariat precursor and double lariat in the case of the lariat model. These structurally distinct species discriminate the models, and we reasoned that determining which of these products exists could provide initial evidence for one or both of these models. Before performing biochemical identification of these intermediates, we computationally predicted the structure of the <italic>mrps16</italic> pre-mRNA to determine if there were any base-pairing interactions across the circularized exon. We found that <italic>mrps16</italic> lacks any apparent base pairing between the regions flanking the circularized exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>); thus, we hypothesized that the biogenesis of this circular RNA might proceed through a lariat precursor generated by exon skipping.</p><p>As canonical lariats are of low abundance and difficult to detect in wild-type fission yeast, we used a strain of yeast (<italic>dbr1∆</italic>) lacking the debranching enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the branch point 2′–5′ linkage, the first step of lariat decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ruskin and Green, 1985</xref>). In this mutant, branched species can reach a much higher steady state concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nam et al., 1997</xref>). We attempted to detect each of the products described above by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), Sanger sequencing all major products to determine their identities.</p><p>Using outward-facing primers, we detected the canonical lariat byproducts from linear splicing, formed by the introns of <italic>mrps16</italic> in <italic>dbr1∆</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Lanes 3–6) along with the circularized form of exon 2 in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Lanes 7–8). Although <italic>mrps16</italic> is not known to have exon skipping, we easily detected the exon-containing lariat resulting from exon skipping (i.e., the lariat precursor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Lane 10) and verified the product's sequence through Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top). Using inward-facing primers that would amplify a linear exon 1–3 splice, we did not detect an exon-skipped transcript in either strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Lanes 1–2). This result is in agreement with recent evidence from deep-sequencing experiments, which revealed that while exon skipping is quite pervasive in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, most exon-skipped transcripts are subject to nuclear decay and are thus detectable only in mutants deficient in decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitton et al., 2015</xref>).

To deplete these species prior to PCR amplification, we used the restriction enzyme <italic>Dra</italic>I, which cuts uniquely within exon 2 of <italic>mrps16</italic> (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

However, after the combined treatment, we discovered a new product at the expected size (518 bp) for the branched byproduct diagnostic of backsplicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Lane 12); this product is also faintly visible in singly-treated lanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Lanes 10 and 11).

As predicted by both models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), qPCR confirmed that the branch point upstream of the circularized exon and the 5′ ss in intron 2 are both necessary for circularization to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Some of our mutagenesis experiments were confounded by activation of cryptic splice sites in <italic>mrps16</italic>. For example, deletion of the 3′ ss upstream of the circularized exon has almost no impact on circular RNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This is due to cryptic splicing at a nearby 3′ ss located 5 nt downstream of the original splice site (determined by Sanger sequencing, data not shown).</p><p>Both the 5′ ss of intron 1 and branch point of intron 2 are uniquely necessary for circular RNA biogenesis under the lariat model, which predicts that deleting either of these sites should disrupt circularization. On the other hand, neither of these sites play necessary roles in the direct-backsplice model; if anything, their deletion might be expected to increase circularization by decreasing competition from linear splicing. As predicted by the lariat model, deletion of the downstream branch point abolishes circular RNA biogenesis from the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and indeed this is the only mutant in which no lariat precursor is produced above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, deletion of the 5′ ss of intron 1 results in cryptic splicing of a larger lariat species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), containing 74 nt of the upstream exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, Lane 11; product validated by sequencing) and also results in circular RNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Using steady state, first-order kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) to model circular RNA production in each of the mutants, we tested whether our qPCR data were consistent with the kinetic predictions of the lariat model. This model predicts that the fold change in rate of the second round of splicing corresponding to a given splice site deletion (k<sub>2mut</sub>/k<sub>2wt</sub>) is equal to the relative circle:lariat ratio (plotted for each mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Under this model, deletions which do not perturb the kinetics of the second round of splicing will have an unchanged circle:lariat ratio. Neglecting cryptic splicing, deletion of the 5′ ss of intron 1 and the branch point and 3′ ss of intron 2 should have a constant circle:lariat ratio, and generally this association holds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, green bars). Another prediction of the lariat model is that deletions that disrupt the second round of splicing should have a dramatically lower circle:lariat ratio. As predicted, deletions of the branch point in intron 1 and flanking splice sites drastically reduce the rate of circular RNA biogenesis from the lariat precursor, which accumulates relative to the circular RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, red bars).</p><p>We observed that both mutants impacting the first round of splicing in the lariat model produce slightly more circular RNA than would be predicted under this simple kinetic model. Notably, the 5′ ss deletion in intron 1 fails to behave as a naive model would predict due to cryptic splicing that generates a variant exon 2-containing lariat. To determine if the lariat precursor remains the major pathway for circular RNA biogenesis in this mutant, we created an <italic>mrps16</italic> mutant containing both deletion of the upstream 5′ ss and downstream branch point (to halt production of the lariat precursor), and, indeed, circular RNA production is strongly abated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Still, for this double mutant and the single downstream branch point mutation (both of which are unable to produce a lariat precursor), circular RNA production is slightly higher than predicted under a model relying <italic>exclusively</italic> on a lariat. Thus, we cannot rule out that there may be a small population of circular RNA generated via a direct backsplice mechanism, as previously reported in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pasman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schindewolf et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the lariat model is unique to <italic>mrps16</italic>, we mutagenized another circle-forming gene, <italic>pub1</italic>. <italic>pub1</italic> contains four exons and produces two alternative circular isoforms: one composed only of exon 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) and another, much less abundant isoform, consisting of exon 2 and exon 3 along with the intervening intron. From <italic>dbr1∆ S. pombe</italic>, we detected the corresponding lariat precursors to each circular RNA isoform by RT-PCR and sequenced the products to confirm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To test whether the lariat precursor is necessary for circularization in this gene, we created a plasmid containing the <italic>pub1</italic> gene, with and without a deletion in the downstream branch point. Because <italic>pub1</italic> is non-essential, we performed these experiments in a <italic>pub1∆</italic> strain to eliminate linear and circular RNA production from the genomic locus. RT-PCR and qPCR analysis revealed a large decrease in circular RNA expression after branch point deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>), but circular RNA and fully spliced mRNA could still be detected, as a weak cryptic branch point was activated in the intron as evidenced by expression of the fully spliced linear isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>, Lane 4).</p><p>Together, the existence of exon-containing lariats and their necessity for efficient circle production suggest that the dominant pathway for circular RNA biogenesis in <italic>S. pombe</italic> is through a lariat precursor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Exon skipping is not sufficient to generate circular RNA</title><p>Our findings raise the question: is production of an exon-containing lariat sufficient to produce circular RNA in <italic>S. pombe</italic>?

Due to the unique sequence of the deletion, we designed primers to specifically amplify the ∆90 nt <italic>mrps16</italic> circular species using a primer that spans the junction of the deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this primer, we quantified the levels of the ∆90 nt circle and showed the expression of this isoform was ∼eightfold below endogenous circular RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given the high-copy number of the plasmid (&gt;10 per genome), this represents a &gt;80 fold reduction in circular RNA produced by this deletion.</p><p>We reasoned that this large effect could be due to a bias against retaining small RNA in our RNA extraction procedure. To address this concern, we subjected the purified RNA to a second round of extraction and purification. If this procedure is biased against small RNAs, a second round of extraction would decrease the apparent ratio of ∆90 nt (ectopic) circle to full-length (endogenous) circle. However, there was no relative depletion of small species after the second purification, supporting the conclusion that this deletion has a biological underpinning rather than being a technical artifact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether this effect was simply caused by an increase in competitive splicing of linear mRNA in this mutant, we quantified the expression of both mRNA splice junctions but did not find a significant difference in their expression compared to <italic>wt mrps16</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Another potential model is that this 90 nt deletion causes a decrease in the production of the lariat precursor, leading to a decrease in observed circular RNA. In order to test this, we quantified both the abundance of the circular RNA and the lariat precursor in <italic>dbr1∆ S. pombe</italic>. Contrary to this model, we observe an increase in the abundance of the lariat precursor relative to the circular RNA, consistent with this mutation causing a decrease in the rate of the second round of splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Two non-mutually exclusive models could explain the decreased abundance of circular RNA from the 90 nt deletion: (1) small circles in <italic>mrps16</italic> do not efficiently circularize due to their size (e.g., physical constraints); (2) our deletion has removed a binding site for a <italic>trans-</italic>acting factor responsible for circularization. To achieve a rapid and high-throughput test of these models, we used a quantitative RNA-seq (‘qRNA-seq’) protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We generated a pooled library of varying length deletions within exon 2 of <italic>mrps16</italic> by combinatorial inverse PCR and blunt ligation, using the <italic>wt mrps16</italic> plasmid as a template, and transformed this pool of mutants into wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p><p>Next, we extracted RNA and plasmid DNA from the population. The RNA was enriched for circular isoforms by DNase and RNase R treatment and then reverse transcribed. The cDNA and plasmid DNA were PCR amplified using the same pair of inward-facing primers and cycle numbers to control for any potential sequence-specific PCR biases; barcoded-sequencing adapters were further added by PCR. Separate sequencing libraries were created at different cycle numbers to allow analysis of biases introduced by PCR.</p><p>To ensure that circular RNA species generated the vast majority of RNA-seq reads, we performed qPCR and demonstrated that: (a) the linear RNA was represented ∼40 fold below the expression of the circular RNA due to RNase R treatment and (b) the lariat precursor was represented at ∼300,000 fold below circular RNA, as expected since this experiment was performed using wild-type yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We also showed that inward- and outward-facing primer pairs gave very similar qPCR values when used on RNase R-treated RNA, indicating both quantitate mainly circular isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>). As an additional control, we created RNA-seq libraries with outward-facing primers, which are unable to amplify linear species.</p><p>In our library, each plasmid with a deletion contains a unique sequence within exon 2 corresponding to the deletion junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), allowing the abundance of each circular RNA isoform to be quantified (from the RNA-seq libraries) and normalized by the representation of each plasmid in the population (from the DNA-seq libraries). By quantifying the wild-type levels of circularization, we represented our quantitative results as relative circularization efficiency (CE) for each mutant (where the value 1 represents wild-type levels of circularization from the plasmid). We tested for an effect of deletion length on CE and found a strong systematic relationship between exon length and circularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This trend was maintained across sequencing libraries, which vary in cycles of library amplification and primer pairs (data not shown). Note, this plot does not include the 90 nt deletion discussed above, which we analyzed separately by clonal analysis.</p><p>While exon length is significant in our model, it is not completely predictive of CE, indicating the existence of other factors that could potentially affect circularization. This library can contain multiple representatives for any given deletion size and for any given deletion of a primary sequence motif. This allows us to rapidly test first order predictions that efficient circle production relies on the presence of a trans-acting factor binding site. However, our data revealed no relationship between the location of a deletion (i.e., its inclusion of any primary sequence motif), and its representation in the library. Thus, we were unable identify a primary sequence required for circularization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of outliers in our <italic>mrps16</italic> mutagenesis data revealed that essentially all data points with higher-than-expected rates of circularization represented deletions in a region at the 3′ end of the exon that is predicted to be rich in secondary structure. A hairpin, spanning from 135 to 159, is predicted to form with high probability, and deletions that remove half of this hairpin are responsible for the most significant outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). These outliers suggest a model in which secondary structures may limit the flexibility of the exon: removing pieces of these secondary structures can destabilize them, increasing the effective length of the circularized exon.</p><p>We predicted the minimum free energy (MFE) structures of exon 2 for several of these deletions and found that these deletions maintained the apparent, end-to-end length of the exon and in some cases actually increased the apparent length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). We also found that deleting the entire hairpin (89,171) negated the enhancement in circularization (not shown), and in agreement, the predicted structure for this deletion contains far fewer free nucleotides in this case (17 vs 37 for wt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). This indicates that outliers marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> do not simply remove a repressor's-binding site.</p><p>Despite this suggestive data that exonic structure is important for circular RNA production in <italic>mrps16</italic>, we were unable to predict CE by computational structure prediction alone (not shown). This may reflect an inability of structure prediction methods to accurately predict in vivo RNA secondary structure or, instead, may reflect additional yet-to-be discovered regulatory features.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Circular RNA is a pervasive aspect of eukaryotic gene expression, and recent work has begun to shed light on the regulation and biogenesis of these still largely mysterious RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang and Wilusz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conn et al., 2015</xref>). Current models for the production of circular RNAs posit that RNA secondary structures formed by inverted sequences in flanking introns are necessary elements for circularization, but this model lacks completeness, as circular RNAs can be found in genes that lack extensive complementary sequences. This is abundantly clear in lower eukaryotes whose genomes are almost devoid of repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Richard et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Using <italic>S. pombe</italic> as a model system, we provide thorough mechanistic evidence that circular RNA can be generated through an exon-containing lariat precursor, a longstanding, yet unsubstantiated model in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zaphiropoulos, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Surono et al., 1999</xref>). Based on splice site mutagenesis experiments, we find that lariat production is important for detectable production of <italic>mrps16</italic> circular RNA. However, a lariat precursor may not be strictly necessary, as suggested by our data and in vitro work in mammalian and yeast splicing extracts that have shown it is possible to directly backsplice a circular RNA in the absence of competing splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pasman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schindewolf et al., 1996</xref>). Rather, it is more likely that the lariat production contributes to backsplicing catalysis by positioning splice sites. In addition to this catalytic function, lariat production may also serve to prevent competing splice sites from operating. In other words, within the context of an exon-containing lariat, the only available splice sites are those bordering the circularized exon, and the upstream branch point, now ‘orphaned’ by lariat formation, must attack the downstream splice donor. In this way, the exon-containing lariat may provide a microenvironment for the splicing of circular RNA.</p><p>A hypothesis generated by a model in which circular RNA is spliced from an exon-containing lariat precursor is that inhibiting lariat degradation should lead to increases in circular RNA expression. Recently, Bähler and colleagues published a broad RNA-seq study of several whole transcriptome profiles of wild-type and <italic>dbr1∆ S. pombe</italic>, and the authors note a ∼3–4 fold global increase in circular RNA in <italic>dbr1∆ S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitton et al., 2015</xref>). However, upon analyzing <italic>mrps16</italic> specifically, we observed significant variation in the <italic>mrps16</italic> circular:total splice isoform ratios within the wild-type RNA-Seq biological replicates due to the very low number of reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitton et al., 2015</xref>, Supp. Table S11). Thus, while there appears to be a modest increase in the <italic>global</italic> levels of circular RNA in the debranching mutant, the effects on particular genes fail to reach statistical significance.</p><p>We have also found that production of an exon-containing lariat is not sufficient for circularization, just as inverted repeats are not sufficient for circular RNA production in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>), suggesting other regulatory mechanisms responsible for its production. Supporting the idea that factors beyond the presence of an exon-containing lariat are required for circular RNA production, we have found that, in general, uncircularized skipped exons are much smaller than the circular exons, hinting that exon size may have a direct effect on the efficiency with which an exon circularizes. Using <italic>mrps16</italic> as a model gene, we tested this directly with a library of exonic deletions and found a systematic decrease in circularization with a decrease in exon size. Although there is a strong effect of exon size, circularization is presumably influenced by additional factors such as topological effects due to intronic sequence and combinatorial effects of RNA-binding proteins. Indeed, we have found that intronic deletions can have a pronounced effect on RNA circularization. None of these deletions (which range from 133 to 329 bp long) affect circularization as dramatically as deleting the branch point in either intron (SB + JS, unpublished data).</p><p>We have previously identified circular RNAs in genes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) that are known to generate exon-skipped linear isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hossain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egecioglu et al., 2012</xref>), lending support to the possibility that this mechanism extends beyond <italic>S. pombe</italic> to other eukaryotes. As an example, the three exon gene <italic>SUS1</italic> has an exon-skipped linear transcript that is rapidly decayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egecioglu et al., 2012</xref>). Substitution of the <italic>SUS1</italic> gene with a linear cDNA copy results in temperature sensitivity and histone H2B deubiquitination defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hossain et al., 2011</xref>). This was suggested to be due to a functional role of an alternatively spliced linear isoform, but could be due to a circularized isoform derived from the seemingly non-functional and rapidly-decayed exon-skipping event. Indeed, it may be a general theme that short-lived exon-skipping events may give rise to long-lived circularized exons, which may play a productive role in cells.</p><p>As intron size increases, it may be that exon-containing lariats no longer have a strong topological effect. This may limit the utility of this mechanism in higher eukaryotes, which may have adopted inverted sequences in an effort to produce local topological changes. However, as alluded to earlier, lariat production may serve an additional function by isolating exons for circularization, implying that these mechanisms may work in tandem. The existence of the lariat precursor model in lower eukaryotes suggests a possible mechanism in which circular RNA arose as a byproduct of exon skipping and that, as intronic architecture changed, so did mechanisms for maintaining expression of these molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>The following <italic>S. pombe</italic> strains were obtained from Bioneer Inc.

We converted these read counts to circularization efficiency (CE) using the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where n<sub>c</sub> is the number of reads derived from a given circular RNA isoform, n<sub>wt</sub> is the number of reads derived from wild-type circular RNA (from background genomic expression), and s is a scaling factor that corrects for the increased average copy number of the plasmid, which we assume is not altered by the exonic deletion. This value is determined from qPCR data from cells transformed with a <italic>wt mrps16</italic> plasmid (s = 19 in wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic>). This value is then normalized by the representation of the given vector isoform in the plasmid library (n<sub>v</sub>/n<sub>vtot</sub>), where n<sub>v</sub> is the number of reads derived from a given plasmid isoform, and n<sub>vtot</sub> is the total number of reads in the plasmid-derived library (after removing reads that align to the wild-type sequence).</p><p>Error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> were generated using the relationship that n<sub>wt</sub> and n<sub>c</sub> are independent Poisson random variables and therefore, X: = n<sub>c</sub>|(n<sub>wt</sub> + n<sub>c</sub>) is bionomial with parameters probability of success B:= n<sub>c</sub>/(n<sub>c</sub>+n<sub>w</sub>) and total trials n<sub>c</sub>+n<sub>w</sub>. Standard binomial confidence intervals were assigned to this quantity, and the 95% CI was propagated to A: = n<sub>v</sub>/n<sub>vtot</sub> (expression A) using the transformation f(A) = 1/A. Expression B can be converted to n<sub>c</sub>/(s * n<sub>wt</sub>) using the transformation g(B) = B/(1 − B)/s.</p><p>Note that, CE = f(A) * g(B).</p><p>The total variance of ln(CE) is obtained by combining a normal approximation for B (corresponding to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi

Your article has been overall favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Douglas Black, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Based on these reviews, summarized below, we will be happy to consider a revised submission addressing the points raised.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Salzman and colleagues examines the biogenesis of circular exon RNAs. This area is very topical. Although back-splicing to generate exon circles has long been described, recent studies have shown that these circles are common and often abundant gene products of largely unknown function. The authors here examine structural features that give rise to a back-spliced exon circle in <italic>S. pombe</italic> derived from exon 2 of the <italic>mrps16</italic> transcript. Previous results with metazoan exons indicated that RNA base-pairing interactions between sequences flanking an exon can enhance circle formation. However, many exons including <italic>mrps16</italic> exon 2 do not appear to have such an intron pairing interaction. Instead, splicing of exon 1 to exon 3 leads to a lariat intron containing exon 2 and the authors show that this serves as the precursor for circle formation. This pathway predicts that back-splicing of exon 2 within the lariat will yield a doubly branched RNA product containing the two flanking introns. Using a series of RT/PCR reactions with primers diagnostic of different RNA structures, as well as assaying the sensitivity of the products to various nucleases, they define many of the expected RNA products of the <italic>mrps16</italic> gene. RT/PCR around the lariat loop in a debranching deficient strain indicates that the exon-skipped lariat is produced. The Exon 1-Exon 3 spliced product is not detected, presumably due to nuclear or cytoplasmic decay (although it would be nice to show this). A final pair of primers produces a product with both branchpoint-5' splice site junctions, indicating that the doubly branched RNA lacking exon 2 is indeed produced. Mutation of the branchpoint upstream from exon 3 greatly reduces formation of the exon 2 circle indicating that formation of a lariat this site is a prerequisite of circle formation. Mutation of some of the other sites is complicated by cryptic splice site activation. Experiments with another circle derived from the <italic>pub1</italic> gene indicate that it is also formed from a lariat intermediate. Analysis of a debranchase deficient strain indicates increased circle formation genomewide in the absence of the debranching enzyme, including from the <italic>mrps16</italic> locus. However, the authors show for several other cases in <italic>S. pombe</italic> that exon skipping does not always lead to circle formation. They find that the skipped exons that do not produce circles are shorter than circle generating exons. A 90 nucleotide deletion within exon 2 greatly reduced circle formation. To further test the effect of exon length, they make a library of deletions within exon 2 and measure circularization relative to deletion size, finding a very rough increase in circle formation with longer exons. From these data, they conclude that both the formation of an exon-containing lariat by exon skipping, and the exon length contribute to frequency of back-splicing to form an exon circle.</p><p>All the reviewers found these data very interesting and that the authors were judicious in their interpretation of them. The identification of a doubly branched product from exon circularization is a striking and new finding that will influence the interpretation of other studies of exon circles. These data serve as a nice counterpoint to a recent paper in Cell, reporting that base pairing interactions between flanking introns can contribute to exon circle formation. As the authors point out, the exon-containing lariat may be a relevant feature when the introns are short, and secondary structure may contribute in some cases where the introns are long. However, it is not ruled out that the base-pairing in introns leads to exon skipping and hence to a similar pathway to that described here. Neither a base pairing interaction nor an exon-containing lariat seem to be a universal requirement; There still seem to be many circles that don't have either one. The exon length data was much less convincing, with few solid conclusions. The demonstration of the exon containing lariat as the precursor to the exon circle and the identification of the double branch product after circularization are results of significant interest for RNA biology. There are a number of aspects of this study that the reviewers felt should be improved.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One concern is the use of quantitative terminology that is inappropriate in the absence of standard curves. For example, in the subsection headed “Direct biochemical detection of backsplicing intermediates supports the existence of a lariat intermediate”, the statement “remarkably high levels” appears to be solely based on a robust band observed after 35 cycles of PCR. As all other products on this gel are derived from different primer combinations, we cannot tell whether the level is “remarkably high” as we have no relevant comparison. While quantitative assessment may not be essential to support all of the conclusions, efforts should be made to report on the actual amounts of some of the products they describe. It would strengthen our understanding of these processes to know the relative amount of RNA produced by exon-skipping and circularization compared to the exon-inclusion pathway.

Because there are two catalytic steps, there are also intermediates called the free 5' exon and the “lariat intermediate”, which is the lariat intron still joined to exon 2. The use of the term “lariat intermediate” throughout this paper is confusing on two counts. First, the term has a different meaning from standard usage in the field. Second, the authors work quite hard to establish this exon-skipped lariat product as the precursor molecule for exon circularization.

The identification of a doubly branched product from exon circularization is a striking and new finding that will influence the interpretation of other studies of exon circles. These data serve as a nice counterpoint to a recent paper in Cell, reporting that base pairing interactions between flanking introns can contribute to exon circle formation. As the authors point out, the exon-containing lariat may be a relevant feature when the introns are short, and secondary structure may contribute in some cases where the introns are long. However, it is not ruled out that the base-pairing in introns leads to exon skipping and hence to a similar pathway to that described here. Neither a base pairing interaction nor an exon-containing lariat seem to be a universal requirement; There still seem to be many circles that don't have either one. The exon length data was much less convincing, with few solid conclusions. The demonstration of the exon containing lariat as the precursor to the exon circle and the identification of the double branch product after circularization are results of significant interest for RNA biology. There are a number of aspects of this study that the reviewers felt should be improved</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the expert and insightful interpretation of our paper. We have attempted to clarify a very interesting point raised above: because of both nuclear and cytoplasmic surveillance mechanisms, exon-skipped products, from yeast to humans, can be highly unstable. Hence, the presence of an exon-skipped linear RNA is not a prerequisite for the existence of exon-containing lariat. We have revised the draft to include a discussion of this, because as you point out, it may be important for broader inference on mechanisms responsible for circular RNA biogenesis. Finally, as detailed below, we have clarified our interpretation of our mutation analyses leading us to find an effect of exon length on circular RNA abundance.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions</italic>:</p><p><italic>One concern is the use of quantitative terminology that is inappropriate in the absence of standard curves. For example, in the subsection headed “Direct biochemical detection of backsplicing intermediates supports the existence of a lariat intermediate”, the statement</italic> “<italic>remarkably high levels</italic>” <italic>appears to be solely based on a robust band observed after 35 cycles of PCR. As all other products on this gel are derived from different primer combinations, we cannot tell whether the level is</italic> “<italic>remarkably high</italic>” <italic>as we have no relevant comparison. While quantitative assessment may not be essential to support all of the conclusions, efforts should be made to report on the actual amounts of some of the products they describe. It would strengthen our understanding of these processes to know the relative amount of RNA produced by exon-skipping and circularization compared to the exon-inclusion pathway. Where measurement is not possible, quantitative language should be avoided</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have revised our language and added quantitation when possible, which includes qPCR quantification of the relative abundance of various <italic>mrps16</italic> splice isoforms (linear mRNA, circular RNA, and lariat precursor) in wild type and <italic>dbr1∆</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Your request and a recent study by Bahler and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitton et al.<italic>,</italic> 2015</xref>) that was published while our work was in review motivated us to examine the concordance between our RNA-Seq analysis and our qPCR studies of WT and debranching mutants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitton et al., 2015</xref> includes a broad RNA-Seq study of several whole transcriptome RNA-seq profiles of WT <italic>S. pombe,</italic> as well as several splicing mutants. Like our analysis of the Bahler groups’ 2014 data which we discussed in our manuscript, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitton et al. (2015)</xref> find a global increase in expression of circular RNA in the same dataset of lariat debranching on circular RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bitton et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We sought to confirm this result and our qPCR shows a slight (∼50%), but statistically non-significant increase in abundance of circular RNA compared to the linear isoform in the debranching mutant. In addition, by examining the recent analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitton et al., 2015</xref>, we observed significant variation in the <italic>mrps16</italic> circle: total splice isoform ratio within the WT RNA-Seq biological replicates. For example, in one case, the <italic>mrps16</italic> circle:total splice ratio is actually higher in WT than in either of the debranching mutant replicates which varies from 0.13 to 0.18 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitton et al., 2015</xref>, Supplementary Table S11, line 8).</p><p>These findings are in contrast to our initial RNA-seq analysis which found a statistically significant 6-fold difference in this ratio between the two strains. We have repeated our qPCR to assess whether input RNA mass RNA into the RT step, different RT priming strategies, different reverse transcriptases, or different qPCR mixes are responsible for this effect. In none of these cases do we see a 6-fold effect.</p><p>Our RNA-seq analysis also found a <italic>global</italic> 6-fold increase in the circle:linear ratio in <italic>dbr</italic>∆ vs. wild type <italic>S. pombe</italic>. This result and its apparent discrepancy with our <italic>mrps16</italic> qPCR data could be explained by a) a real biological effect in which the splicing of <italic>mrps16</italic> circular RNA does not respond to increases in lariat abundance through inhibiting lariat debranching (e.g., the spliceosome is deposited co-transcriptionally, making a subset of lariats competent to splice; thus, preventing lariat degradation will not lead to increases in this pool) or b) technical differences between qPCR and RNA-Seq. In light of these findings, we believe that on average, there may be an increase in the <italic>mrps16</italic> circle:linear ratio in the debraching mutant; however, the experimental noise of both the RNA-seq and qPCR preclude us from making conclusions that belong in the Results section. Instead, we now comment on the results presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitton et al<italic>.,</italic> 2015</xref> in our Discussion.</p><p><italic>Given the nature of the PCR assay it is important that the identity of each product is confirmed by sequencing.

Because RT across a 2’-5’ linkage introduces single nucleotide deletions and mutations, sequencing these products would require extensive cloning efforts. We have clarified our manuscript to make clear that our identification of the products in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were based on size rather than sequence.</p><p>As you point out we observe a number of ‘shadow’ bands or ‘doublets,’ especially on our gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. In order to understand what these bands could be, we cloned the products in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Lane 12 (the double lariat). We chose this product for two main reasons: 1. As you suggest, it may contain other products relevant to the mechanism. 2. The doublets are approximately equal intensity in this product, so it should be straightforward to see the distinct products by cloning (i.e., they should appear in approximately a 1:1 ratio).</p><p>We randomly selected 16 clones and performed a colony PCR and sequenced these clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>). 10/16 clones were of the appropriate size to arise from this doublet. However, sequencing reveals that these products only differ by at most 2 nt’s in size, and that the products do not appear to represent distinct splice isoforms (see ClustalW2 alignment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>). We hypothesize that the reason for the doublet could be that, after many cycles of PCR, if the primer concentrations are uneven and limiting, a single-stranded product may form along with the double-stranded product; this single-stranded product may have a slight anomalous migration on the gel, leading to the doublet appearance we observe.</p><p>We did a literature search to determine if this problem has been addressed in the literature. While others have clearly encountered this problem, we could not find a scholarly discussion (rather, it is addressed on internet forums, for example: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.researchgate.net/post/Can_anyone_explain_the_secondary_DNA_bands_in_agarose_gel_besides_a-specific_amplification_in_PCR">http://www.researchgate.net/post/Can_anyone_explain_the_secondary_DNA_bands_in_agarose_gel_besides_a-specific_amplification_in_PCR</ext-link>).</p><p><italic>The correlation of circle formation with deletion size within exon 2 seems very rough at best (Figure 6).

We agree that circularization efficiency should not vary continuously with length (we have removed our fitted curve so as not to imply this), but our data supports a general monotonic trend that larger deletions in <italic>mrps16</italic> exon 2 are less efficiently circularized. Both our analysis of endogenous circular RNA expression in other organisms (such as human, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Salzman et al<italic>.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and mutations in <italic>mrps16</italic> support the idea that exons smaller than 100nt can circularize. For example, the ∆90 nt (total exon length=91 nt) <italic>mrps16</italic> exon 2 isoform we analyzed by clonal analysis does form a circle, although at a much lower efficiency. Also, to address your last point, for this clone, we have analyzed the abundance of the lariat precursor production as well as splicing of the linear products exon1–exon 2 and exon 2–exon 3 by qPCR, which we now discuss in the manuscript.</p><p>Finally, for our <italic>mrps16</italic> mutants, you note that we did not control for other effects these deletions might have, such as removing a specific sequence required for backsplicing. We have clarified this point in the manuscript: we have indeed considered the possibility that a simple sequence motif has a significant impact on circular RNA abundance. This model would suggest that all deletions which contain deletions of a particular sequence motif (the one facilitating backsplicing) would result in attenuation of circular RNA abundance. We have specifically tested this model, and found it failed to fit the data. We included a figure that demonstrates this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5–figure supplement 5</xref>). We have also considered impacts of sequence deletions on structural properties of the <italic>mrps16</italic> circular RNA, discussed in the last section of the paper.
