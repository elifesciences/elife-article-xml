Techniques such as multi-photon microscopy and holographic stimulation offer tremendous opportunities to understand the neural underpinnings of these memories. However, these techniques generally require animals to be head-fixed. Few paradigms examine contextual fear in head-fixed mice, and none use freezing—the most common measure of fear in freely moving animals—as the behavioral readout. To address this gap, we developed a CFC paradigm for head-fixed mice using virtual reality (VR). We designed an apparatus to deliver tail shocks while mice navigated a VR environment. We tested three versions of this paradigm and, in all of them, observed increased freezing, particularly on the first trial, in the shock-paired VR compared to a neutral one. These results demonstrate that head-fixed mice can be fear-conditioned in VR and exhibit context-specific freezing behavior. Additionally, using two-photon calcium imaging, we tracked large populations of hippocampal CA1 neurons before, during, and following CFC. As in freely moving mice, CA1 place cells remapped and developed narrower fields following fear conditioning. Thus, our approach enables new opportunities to study the neural mechanisms underlying the formation, recall, and extinction of contextual fear memories.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fear conditioning</kwd><kwd>virtual reality</kwd><kwd><sc>t</sc>wo-photon imaging</kwd><kwd>place cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DA043469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krishnan</surname><given-names>Seetha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01DA060994</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krishnan</surname><given-names>Seetha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100023835</institution-id><institution>BRAIN Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1RF1NS127123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheffield</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2NS111657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheffield</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheffield</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014185</institution-id><institution>Searle Scholars Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheffield</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

These techniques facilitate the study of neural circuit dynamics, synaptic and plasticity mechanisms, and enable the real-time manipulation of neural activity, all of which are crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying memory formation and recall in the brain. However, head-fixation of animals, which is generally required to utilize these techniques, imposes constraints on the range of testable behaviors compared to freely moving conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Juczewski et al., 2020</xref>). This limitation is particularly evident in the Pavlovian CFC task, a laboratory method for testing associative learning, fear memory formation, and recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fanselow, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fanselow, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Fanselow, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Maren et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the traditional CFC paradigm for freely moving animals, an animal is placed in an environment (conditioned stimulus, CS) that is paired with an aversive stimulus, such as a mild foot shock (unconditioned stimulus, US). Animals are then removed from the environment. When reintroduced to the environment, animals exhibit a species-specific conditioned response, such as fearful freezing behavior in rodents, if they successfully associate the shock-paired environment with the aversive stimulus. The CFC paradigm is one of the most basic conditioning procedures for freely moving animals— it’s simple and robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fanselow, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fanselow, 1990</xref>). Despite its longstanding use in studies involving freely behaving animals to explore questions on learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anagnostaras et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouton and King, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouton and Bolles, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Debiec et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fanselow and Bolles, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fendt and Fanselow, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gewirtz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Holland and Bouton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim and Jung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Maren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maren and Holt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pezze and Feldon, 2004</xref>), it has been noticeably absent in studies involving head-fixed animals, with some exceptions.</p><p>Two prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lovett-Barron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>) reported a version of CFC in head-fixed mice with aversive air puffs as the US. These studies reported the conditioned response animals displayed as lick suppression, not freezing. Although lick suppression after fear conditioning has also been observed in freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leaf and Leaf, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leaf and Muller, 1965</xref>), it has been shown to result from increased freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouton and Bolles, 1980</xref>). Therefore, relying solely on lick suppression in the head-fixed preparation makes it more challenging to compare with the extensive previous work in freely moving animals, where freezing is measured as the predominant conditioned fear response. Furthermore, the aforementioned head-fixed CFC studies also had the limitation of simultaneously having both a water reward and an aversive stimulus within the context, potentially confounding the results and complicating the interpretation. Hence, we aimed to develop a paradigm where freezing is the conditioned response and without the presence of a reward within the conditioned context, making it directly comparable to freely moving animals.</p><p>Here, we describe three different versions of a contextual fear-conditioning paradigm for head-fixed mice that resulted in freezing as the conditioned response. The context or CS was a virtual reality (VR)-based environment, which head-fixed mice explored by running on a cylindrical treadmill. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ratigan et al., 2023</xref>), we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by combining it with imaging of thalamic axons innervating the hippocampus using a two-photon microscope. The present manuscript provides a comprehensive description and fundamentals of the behavioral framework, to enable the research community to reproduce and adapt our behavior paradigm. Our main aim is to show that VR-based CFC can elicit freezing responses similar to those seen in freely moving animals, while also examining how key parameters affect this response. Though we explored some important variables, this paper does not attempt to comprehensively investigate all parameters necessary for successful VR-based CFC. Additionally, we performed two-photon imaging of a large population of hippocampal CA1 cells during fear conditioning and tracked the same cells during memory recall across days. We analyzed the impact of our paradigm on place cells in the hippocampus and compared these findings to results from CFC in freely moving animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A paradigm for contextual fear conditioning in head-fixed mice exploring virtual reality environments</title><p>To establish the contextual fear conditioning protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), head-fixed mice were water-restricted and trained to run on a treadmill and navigate VR environments for water rewards, as we have demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krishnan and Sheffield, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ratigan et al., 2023</xref>). Forward movement on the treadmill translates to forward movement in VR, allowing mice to navigate the VR environment. The environments used were 2m-long linear tracks rich in visual cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Reaching the track’s end triggered a water reward and defined a completed trial/lap. Mice were then virtually teleported back to the track’s start for the next lap. Unlike freely moving mice that tend to explore new environments, head-fixed mice placed on a treadmill do not automatically start exploring VR environments. However, they can be trained through reinforcement learning using water restriction and water rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dombeck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ratigan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A contextual fear conditioning paradigm for head-fixed mice navigating virtual reality environments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup created with<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://BioRender.com/sr8vpch">BioRender.com</ext-link>. Mice were head-restrained with their feet resting on a cylindrical treadmill. Five large monitors surrounded the mice that displayed virtual reality (VR) environments. Movement on the treadmill advanced the VR display, allowing for context exploration. (<bold>B</bold>) Mice were water-restricted and trained to run laps in the VR for water rewards. VR environments were 2m-long linear tracks. Mice were trained to achieve &gt;3 laps per minute, which took ~10–14 d (Stage 1). Once well-trained, a ‘tail-coat’ was added to their tails (Stage 2), followed by the removal of the water reward the next day (Stage 3). (<bold>C</bold>) For Paradigm 1, mice underwent the fear conditioning protocol the following day after the water reward was removed. On the first experiment day (Day 0), mice spent 10 min in the training VR (Familiar VR) and then another 10 min in a new VR (contextual fear conditioning, CFC VR). After the initial exploration, mice received mild electric shocks on the tail (4–12 shocks, 0.5–1.2mA in amplitude, 1 s long). The next day (Day 1), mice were tested for memory recall by placing them in the Familiar VR and the CFC VR for 5 min each in a counterbalanced manner.

We set a criterion of &gt;3 laps per minute (i.e. a lap velocity of 0.1–0.2 m/s) for mice to move on to the next stage (Stage 2). Once the mice reached this stage (Stage 2), the following day, we added a coat to their tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We developed a lightweight, wearable conductive apparatus for the mouse’s tail to ensure minimal discomfort for the mouse. We named this apparatus the ‘tail-coat’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This tail-coat enabled us to administer mild electric shocks to the mouse’s tail (see Methods).</p><p>When the tail-coat was added, some mice reduced their running speed or refused to move. Some recovered the next day, but if their running speed did not reach at least three laps per minute (~20% of mice failed to meet this criterion), they were not advanced to the next stage. Mice that maintained this running speed advanced to Stage 3. Data from mice that advanced with minimal changes to their lap running behavior after adding the tail-coat are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p>The following day (Stage 3), mice were placed in the same VR environment with the tail-coat, but the water reward was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mice that continued to run at least three laps per minute with the tail-coat and without water reward advanced to the experiment stage (Stage 4). Around 40% of the mice dropped out at this stage. High levels of lap running during training were crucial to ensure mice were undeterred by both the tail-coat and the reward removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krishnan and Sheffield, 2023</xref>). Our criteria for consistent running behavior with minimal pauses throughout these three stages of training ensured that any baseline freezing behavior was minimal, similar to freely moving animals, and allowed us to attribute freezing after CFC to fear conditioning.</p><p>In summary, our criteria for selecting mice for the experimental stage of contextual fear conditioning required them to run consistently (&gt;3 laps per minute) with (1) rewards, then (2) with a tail-coat, and then (3) without rewards plus the tail-coat. This threshold resulted in about 40% of the mice proceeding to the experimental stage. Once mice qualified for the experimental stage, they were no longer excluded from analysis due to their behavior.</p><p>We tested three versions of the head-fixed CFC paradigm. In Paradigm 1, the neutral environment was the training VR environment, and a new VR environment was paired with shocks. In Paradigms 2 and 3, both the neutral and shock-paired environments were new and distinct from the training environment to better control for environmental familiarity. In Paradigms 1 and 2, the tail-coat was removed on the days following CFC, whereas in Paradigm 3, it remained on the mouse on all post-CFC days. With these paradigms, we varied some parameters that may influence fear memory recall, contextual discrimination, fear extinction, and their associated behaviors in head-fixed VR-based CFC paradigms. We detail these variations in the following sections, starting with Paradigm 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>When tested for contextual fear memory recall, mice displayed increased freezing behavior in the shocked-paired VR environment</title><p>On Day 0 of the experimental stage in Paradigm 1 (CFC day), mice (n=27, 25 males and 2 females) were exposed to the same VR environment we used for training, referred to as the Familiar VR from here onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), for 10 min. We then switched them to a new VR environment (CFC VR). Following baseline exploration of the CFC VR for 10 min, we repeatedly applied mild-electric shocks (4–12 shocks, 0.5-1 mA in amplitude, 1 s long) to the mouse’s tail. We call the period when shocks were delivered ‘during CFC.’ Shocks were pseudo-randomly administered with respect to the animal’s position in the CFC VR, with an inter-shock interval (ISI) of 1 min. To ensure that the shocks were associated with the context and not a specific position in the environment, no visual cues were explicitly paired with the shock. We quantified the animal’s response to the shocks and observed an immediate increase in running speed following each shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This was consistent across all mice and shocks and was a reliable indicator that the apparatus was working correctly. Sixty seconds after the last shock was administered, the VR screens were switched off, the tail-coat was removed, and mice were returned to their home cages. The next day (Fear memory recall, Day 1), we tested for recall of the learned association between the VR environment and the fearful stimulus. Mice were exposed to both VRs (familiar VR and CFC VR) for 5 min each in a counterbalanced manner. Water reward remained absent on recall days; however, in this paradigm, the tail-coat was no longer present.</p><p>Before fear conditioning, mice exhibited similar behavior in both the Familiar and CFC VRs. We evaluated the time taken to complete a lap and the freezing behavior (defined as time points when the animal’s instantaneous velocity was 0 cm/s). Neither metric revealed a significant difference between the two VRs before shock administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). However, after CFC, when the animals were reintroduced to the VRs on recall Day 1, we observed a significant increase in freezing and time taken to complete a lap in the CFC VR compared to the Familiar VR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). As soon as mice transitioned to the CFC VR (either from dark or after the Familiar VR) on the recall day, we observed behaviors such as slowing down, freezing, moving backward, and hesitation to move forward (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). This response was markedly different from their behavior in the Familiar VR. This difference in behavior can be observed clearly in most mice on the very first lap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Since we removed the reward, we didn’t find licking behavior to be indicative of recall behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, some mice displayed licking behavior in the Familiar VR on Day 0 before fear conditioning, which was absent on Day 1. This is likely because mice had previously received a water reward in the Familiar VR. We will address this caveat in Paradigms 2 and 3.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Paradigm 1: Head-fixed mice show increased freezing behavior following contextual fear conditioning in the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) virtual reality (VR).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A single example mouse’s lap running behavior on experiment days, Day 0 and Day 1.

Though our parameter exploration was not exhaustive, we assessed shock amplitude more extensively than the number of shocks. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Overall, most shock amplitudes and numbers of shocks increased freezing behavior in the CFC VR on recall day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).

Freezing on the first lap in the CFC VR was also most pronounced on Recall Day 1.

While we observed a small increase in average freezing on Recall Day 3, it remained lower than Recall Day 1 levels and returned to baseline by Recall Day 4. This pattern suggests that the pronounced first lap freezing observed on Recall Day 1 extinguishes quickly, while average freezing, though more variable, also extinguishes by Recall Day 4.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Linear mixed effect (LME) summary (estimate ± standard error, p-value) for first lap freezing in Paradigm 1 with fixed effects (recall days, baseline: before CFC, Day 0) and random effect (mouse).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">VR</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 1</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 2</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 3</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Familiar VR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.97±1.95, p=0.62</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–5.75±2.51, p=0.02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–4.13±3.03, p=0.18</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.08±3.18, p=0.73</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CFC VR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">12.96±2.02, p&lt;0.001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.42±2.55, p=0.18</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.73±3.07, p=0.57</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.26±3.23, p=0.70</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Linear mixed effect (LME) summary (estimate ± standard error, p-value) for average freezing in Paradigm 1 with fixed effects (recall days, baseline: before CFC, Day 0) and random effect (mouse).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">VR</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 1</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 2</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 3</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Familiar VR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.00±1.13, p=0.37</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.43±1.48, p=0.77</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.76±1.80, p=0.67</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4.87±1.88, p=0.013</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CFC VR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7.55±1.58, p&lt;0.001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.89±2.04, p=0.16</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.03±2.47, p=0.018</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.78±2.58, p=0.15</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In the Familiar VR, freezing behavior—both first lap and average—did not differ significantly from baseline on most days. However, we observed an unexpected increase in average freezing compared to baseline on Recall Day 4. This increase could reflect either fear generalization or a decrease in motivation - a response to the prolonged absence of reward in a previously rewarded environment. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined freezing behavior in control mice that underwent the same paradigm without shocks (no-shock controls, n=7, black lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H–I</xref>). Average freezing in the Familiar VR exceeded that of no-shock controls on both Recall Days 1 and 4. Since no-shock controls explored the environments under no-reward conditions, this suggests that the increase in freezing in the Familiar VR stems from fear conditioning and may indicate generalization rather than motivational changes. This aligns with findings from freely moving animals, where specific fear memories have been shown to generalize over time with repeated exposures to both neutral and conditioned contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biedenkapp and Rudy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wiltgen and Silva, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these results demonstrate that head-fixed mice can acquire fear associations in VR environments. Most mice displayed freezing as a conditioned response specifically to the shock-paired VR and showed robust fear discrimination—behavior that mirrors that of freely moving animals after fear conditioning. By the fourth recall day, freezing had largely extinguished. Notably, beyond freezing, other avoidance-like defensive behaviors were prominent in the shock-paired VR, demonstrating the range of behavioral responses our paradigm can capture.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A second paradigm where head-fixed mice discriminate between two novel VRs</title><p>As previously mentioned, the incomplete extinction of licking behavior in the familiar VR before fear conditioning or the gradual increases in freezing behavior in the familiar VR during recall tests may indicate that mice still associate the VR with water rewards, which could be a caveat. Furthermore, in traditional CFC paradigms with freely moving mice, fear behavior has been assessed mainly by comparing two novel contexts, one associated with shocks and the other acting as a control. To address this, we tested another paradigm (Paradigm 2), using a novel VR instead of the familiar VR to act as the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). One novel VR was assigned as the Control VR, and a second novel VR was assigned as the CFC VR, which would later become paired with the shocks. In this paradigm, we also added an extra habituation day to increase the animal’s pre-exposure time to the novel VRs prior to conditioning (Day–1). Pre-exposure to the context before fear conditioning can enhance contextual fear, as seen in freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biedenkapp and Rudy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fanselow, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fanselow, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Maren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rudy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wiltgen and Silva, 2007</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Using a novel virtual reality (VR) as the neutral environment instead of a familiar VR in a second paradigm results in modest increases in freezing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The training paradigm for Paradigm 2 is similar to Paradigm 1.

We hypothesized that the tail-coat might act as a contextual cue and that its presence during recall might enhance freezing behavior. To further test these effects, we used a lower shock intensity of 0.6 mA—which we previously showed as producing only modest fear responses in Paradigm 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>)—to determine whether a shorter ISI and the retention of the tail-coat during recall could enhance conditioned fear responses produced by the lower shock intensity.</p><p>In Paradigm 3, mice followed the same experimental protocol as Paradigm 2, with two novel VRs: one assigned as the Control VR and the other as the CFC VR.

While freezing levels showed a consistent downward trend across days, these results suggest that fear had not completely extinguished by Recall Day 3. As in Paradigm 1, the most pronounced increases in first lap freezing in the CFC VR occurred in early recall days, while elevated average freezing persisted longer. These findings suggest that the shorter ISI and presence of the tail-coat during memory recall may enhance conditioned fear and delay fear extinction in head-fixed mice discriminating between two novel VRs, though the individual effects of these parameters require further investigation.</p><table-wrap id="table5" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><title>Linear mixed effect (LME) summary (estimate ±standard error, p-value) for first lap freezing in Paradigm 3 with fixed effects (recall days, baseline: before CFC, Day 0) and random effect (mouse).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">VR</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 1</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 2</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Control VR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.84±1.92, p=0.34</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.01±1.92, p=0.12</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–2.09±1.92, p=0.28</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CFC VR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">9.67±2.61, p=0.0005</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.84±2.61, p=0.01</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.33±2.61, p=0.21</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table6" position="float"><label>Table 6.</label><caption><title>Linear mixed effect (LME) summary (estimate ±standard error, p-value) for average freezing in Paradigm 3 with fixed effects (recall days, baseline: before CFC, Day 0) and random effect (mouse).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">VR</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 1</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 2</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recall Day 3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Control VR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.65±0.97, p=0.008</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.99±0.97, p=0.0001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.28±0.97, p=0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CFC VR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10.30±1.41, p&lt;0.001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8.81±1.41, p&lt;0.001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4.28±1.41, p=0.004</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The tail-coat’s presence during recall days likely contributed to some transfer of fear to the Control VR, evidenced by elevated freezing in the Control VR compared to baseline.

This longer interval may have contributed to more pronounced remapping compared to the shorter interval used by Moita et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bollmann et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maboudi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Next, we looked at the place cells in each session. Interestingly, we found an increase in the number of place cells in the CFC VR during memory recall, a finding not previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). We also found that place cells had narrower fields in the CFC VR during memory recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schuette et al., 2020</xref>). We did not find a significant difference in other place cell parameters we examined, such as lap-by-lap reliability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) and out-of-field firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Thus, our observations of remapping and narrower place field widths replicate findings from freely moving animals, validating our paradigm’s use to explore further questions using the head-fixed preparation to study the neural underpinnings of contextual fear memories. We add to this field by showing an increase in the proportion of place cells following CFC, a possible neural substrate of fear memory recall.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The widths of place fields in CA1 narrow during memory recall.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Place fields were defined and sorted by track length in each session, pooled from all mice (n = 8 mice).

Our key findings are: (1) Head-fixed mice exhibited freezing behavior in response to an aversive stimulus in VR, consistent with conditioned responses seen in freely moving animals. Freezing was especially pronounced during the first lap in the fear-conditioned environment compared to the neutral environment across all paradigms tested. (2) With mice on a cylindrical treadmill, additional conditioned responses such as hesitation and backward movement were detected. (3) The choice of neutral environment influenced fear discrimination: mice froze more in the fear-conditioned VR when the neutral environment was familiar rather than novel. Freezing in the fear-conditioned VR could be enhanced by shorter ISIs and the presence of the tail-coat during recall when the neutral environment was novel. (4) Following fear conditioning, place cells in the hippocampal CA1 region showed remapping, increased numbers, and narrower fields, paralleling findings in freely moving animals and offering new insights.</p><p>Here, we experimented with three paradigms for fear conditioning in mice, with the main difference being the neutral environment where the mice didn't receive any shock. In Paradigm 1, the neutral VR was familiar, where the mice had previously received rewards, and the CFC VR was novel. In Paradigms 2 and 3, both the neutral and CFC VRs were similarly novel. In Paradigm 3, we decreased the ISI and kept the tail-coat on the animal when testing for memory recall. Thus, we have tested three different variations for performing CFC in head-fixed mice. On average, mice showed more freezing behavior in the CFC VR compared to the neutral VR. A common feature across all paradigms was pronounced freezing during the very first lap in the CFC VR. While mice in Paradigm 2 extinguished fear rapidly after the first lap, freezing behavior persisted up to 3–4 recall days in Paradigms 1 and 3, to varying degrees. We also observed variability in conditioned responses across mice. Some displayed an opposite pattern, freezing more in the neutral VR or equally in both VRs. This variability in behavior, similar to that observed in freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dos Santos Corrêa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Navarro-Sánchez et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Poulos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Russo and Parsons, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Totty et al., 2021</xref>), can be insightful when combined with investigations of neural activity, helping to understand the neural dynamics that contribute to an animal’s ability to learn the association between a context and fearful stimuli. This can reveal the mechanisms by which such memories may generalize or become maladaptive, as seen in post-traumatic stress disorders.</p><p>We have shown here an example of using Paradigm 1 to study place cells in the hippocampus and their role in fear memory formation and recall. We longitudinally recorded from a large group of the same hippocampal CA1 cells and demonstrated that place cells remap and narrow their place field widths with fear conditioning. This occurs in head-fixed mice navigating VR environments, similar to freely moving animals. Narrow place fields may suggest sharper spatial tuning to incorporate a salient emotional memory and may aid in context discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schuette et al., 2020</xref>). However, how place cells narrow their widths in response to fear conditioning remains an open question. One possible way to answer this is by imaging CA1 place cell dendrites to understand how they integrate inputs before and after fear conditioning. We can explore what dendritic firing and plasticity mechanisms lead to narrow place field widths. We can then perturb these firing patterns to attribute causality to the narrowing of place field widths in fear discrimination. Our head-fixed paradigm enables the recording of dendrites and the study of plasticity mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sheffield et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015</xref>), thus facilitating these investigations.</p><p>We recently used Paradigm 3 to understand the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens-hippocampal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ratigan et al., 2023</xref>). Using a two-photon microscope, we identified neural activity in this pathway by imaging axons from the nucleus reuniens that project to the CA1 with single-axon resolution. We found this pathway necessary for suppressing fear memory retrieval, context discrimination, and fear extinction. The robust freezing response in Paradigm 3 in the fear-conditioned VR, compared to a neutral novel VR, allowed us to align our findings with the existing literature on the role of the nucleus reuniens-hippocampal circuit in fear memory in freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ramanathan and Maren, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Totty et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Troyner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vetere et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the subcellular resolution achieved through two-photon calcium imaging using the head-fixed preparation allowed us to longitudinally observe and understand the inputs that axons from the reuniens send to the hippocampus during fear memory formation and retrieval, a level of detail that is difficult to achieve with current techniques in freely moving preparations.</p><p>In another unpublished study, we used Paradigm 2 and identified co-active neurons between CA1 and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus during fear memory recall. The difference between the first and subsequent laps has helped us understand the progression of neural activity in the hippocampus as mice go from retrieving the fear memory to extinction within one session. Moreover, the variability in response across mice has allowed us to regress the neural activity to the behavior, identifying neural differences between those mice that accurately recall the fear memory and those that do not. These studies showcase the broad applicability of our different CFC paradigms.</p><p>In the laboratory, CFC provokes freezing behavior in freely moving rodents, as demonstrated by several studies that span decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fanselow, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fanselow, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fendt and Fanselow, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Maren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Phillips and LeDoux, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, we found that a mild electric shock applied to the tail could also trigger freezing behavior as the conditioned response in head-fixed mice, making our paradigm more comparable to the freely moving paradigms than previously attempted methods using air-puff stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lovett-Barron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>). There are numerous opportunities for future work to systematically test how different parameters—such as shock amplitude, number and spacing of shocks, duration of fear conditioning, context pre-exposure time, the configuration of Control versus CFC VR environments, and the inclusion of additional sensory cues—may influence both behavioral outcomes during recall and extinction, as well as the underlying neural representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fanselow, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huckleberry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ji and Maren, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maren and Holmes, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Poulos et al., 2016</xref>). Our current study provides only an initial exploration of this parameter space.</p><p>In this manuscript, we focused on freezing as the primary conditioned response to align with studies of freely moving animals. However, we also see other defensive responses unique to our treadmill-based task, as well as fear-related hesitation and backward movements during memory recall—defensive behaviors that have also been observed in freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Furuyama et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Totty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Trott et al., 2022</xref>). Our technique enables us to conduct a more detailed analysis of the animal’s behavior. The head-fixed setup allows us to easily measure physiological responses including pupil diameter, respiration, vocalization, heart rate, and body temperature. These parameters are known to change with fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dupin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Godsil et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Korn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shionoya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stiedl and Spiess, 1997</xref>). Such physiological measurements can also help differentiate between the various conditioned responses we observe. There are also opportunities to use machine-learning-empowered algorithms to parse out new behavior markers for contextual fear memory, such as gestures or facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Datta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mathis and Mathis, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Syeda et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wiltschko et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we can understand the animal’s behavior in a well-controlled environment, which when combined with neural activity recording, can lead to new insights into the neural circuits mediating different defensive responses and emotional states.</p><p>Significant insights into memory mechanisms through the CFC task have also come from recent discoveries of memory engrams in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Josselyn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Josselyn and Tonegawa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tonegawa et al., 2018</xref>). Engram cells, identified in various brain regions with the help of genetic tagging and optogenetics, play a crucial role in encoding, consolidating, and retrieving specific memories. Typically, these cells are identified based on the expression of the immediate early gene <italic>Fos</italic> during fear conditioning. Their artificial activation with optogenetics can trigger memory recall, evidenced by increased freezing behavior. Understanding which neurons form these engram cells, how <italic>Fos</italic> expression is driven during memory formation, how memory information is stored in these cells, how they evolve with learning, and how their activation results in memory recall is an active area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frankland et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mocle et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Monasterio et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pettit et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Suthard et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Uytiepo et al., 2024</xref>). Incorporating our paradigm with simultaneous measurements of cellular and subcellular activity can help answer some of these questions. For instance, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Monasterio et al., 2024</xref>) tagged engram cells during fear conditioning while animals were freely moving and then imaged the spontaneous dynamics of these cells using two-photon imaging before and after fear conditioning. The study revealed that cells forming engrams were inherently more active. A limitation of this study was the separate contexts for imaging versus tagging, which can be addressed with our paradigm. Our CFC paradigm allows for direct neural recording of these cells before, during, and after tagging in the same context to examine how activity during memory formation relates to engram cell emergence, population dynamics, and memory recall. Furthermore, holographic stimulation techniques can reactivate specific cell ensembles of interest to help understand the causal relationships between engram cells and memory. Moreover, the hippocampus contains both place cells and engram cells, both of which appear to be involved in contextual memory. However, their relationship is not yet fully understood. Our CFC paradigm offers an opportunity to study both place cells, as we have shown here, and engram cells simultaneously. This can be achieved by incorporating techniques that allow for in vivo labeling of <italic>Fos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pettit et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, our head-fixed version of the CFC paradigm opens new avenues for research into the neural underpinnings of fear learning and memory.</p><p>Another advantage of our method is that it allows for studying changes in neuronal dynamics in response to an aversive stimulus, such as a shock. Our fields of view during the shock and subsequent flight-like response periods remained stable, and we could correct image movements during these periods with Suite2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>). This is a significant improvement over one-photon and electrophysiological techniques, where abrupt movements such as those induced by an electric shock can change fields of view and reduce the likelihood of recording from the same groups of cells, thereby hindering longitudinal assessments of neural dynamics. In Paradigm 1, where we imaged hippocampal cells during shock, we did not find cells responding to the shock itself, as others have reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mocle et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Suthard et al., 2024</xref>). We suspect this could be due to the number or duration of shocks administered and our shocks not being associated with a specific cue or location. In future studies, we plan to optimize these parameters to understand better how neural dynamics change in response to an aversive cue.</p><p>Finally, we recognize that our head-fixed CFC paradigm has some limitations. Compared to the freely moving CFC, our setup is less naturalistic. We defined different contexts as two visually distinct VR environments while odor, sound, and tactile cues remained constant. This could have made it harder for mice to differentiate between the two contexts, particularly in Paradigm 2. Unlike freely moving animals in CFC studies, our mice were water-restricted throughout the experimental process. Because the animals need to get used to wearing a tailcoat and running in the VRs without a reward, we tend to ‘over-train’ the mice. This criterion excludes mice that are less adept at running, limiting the number that go through the process and requiring larger cohorts of mice. This also presents scalability challenges compared to freely moving paradigms, as successful implementation of the head-fixed CFC approach requires weeks of reward-based training, larger sample sizes, and a technically demanding VR setup that integrates multiple hardware and software components to precisely monitor behavior. Additionally, while rewards were removed during experimental sessions, water rewards were still used to motivate running during training. This reward-associated training could subtly influence later behavior. For instance, the increased freezing in the Familiar VR on later recall days and remapping of place cells in that context could reflect the lingering effects of reward-associated training. While Paradigms 2 and 3 address many of these concerns, our approach still differs from freely moving paradigms due to this initial reward-based training. The impact of using rewards during training on recall behavior needs further investigation. Furthermore, despite our best efforts to include equal numbers of male and female mice, only some female mice reached the experimental stage. This could be due to the tail-coat weight and the reduced weight of females after water restriction compared to males. Female mice of the same age (10–12 wk) weighed significantly less than males (20–23 g vs 25–30 g) and lost further weight following water restriction. Although we observed no behavioral differences between the four tested females and the male mice, we cannot guarantee similar results in other female animals without further testing. Studies indicate that different sexes may display varying conditioned responses, as seen in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maren et al., 1994</xref>). In the future, we aim to address these limitations.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a head-fixed version of the classic CFC paradigm. Our findings demonstrate that mice exhibit freezing behavior when fear-conditioned in a VR environment. Moreover, we observed that hippocampal place cells remap and narrow their fields in response to fear conditioning, mirroring observations in freely moving animals. This innovative paradigm bridges the behavioral task gap for techniques requiring head-fixation, paving the way for new investigations into neural circuits and deepening our understanding of the neural foundations of emotional memory.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All experimental and surgical procedures adhered to the University of Chicago Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines under protocol number: 72508.

Behavioral training began 7 d following the water restriction. Briefly, VR environments were created using the Virtual Reality MATLAB Engine, or VIRMEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronov and Tank, 2014</xref>), and projected to five screens covering the mouse’s field of view. Mice were head restrained with their limbs resting on a freely rotating Styrofoam wheel, which acted as a treadmill. VR environments were 2 m linear tracks. Mice received a water reward (4 μl) through a waterspout upon completing each traversal of the linear track, considered a lap. This reward was followed by a 1.5 s pause in the VR to allow the mouse to consume the water. The mice were then virtually teleported to the start of the track to begin a new lap. Training sessions lasted 30 min per day. Mice were considered well-trained when they could run at &gt;3 laps per minute. We found that this level of training was necessary to ensure that mice would continue to run even without rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krishnan and Sheffield, 2023</xref>).

A pictorial representation of the tail-coat can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. The tail-coat, handmade from wearable conductive fabrics, featured a lightweight design to ensure the mouse could continue running during baseline VR exploration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7">Table 7</xref>). First, the mouse’s tail was measured while anesthetized for head-plate surgeries. A small denim patch cloth (Michael’s) was cut into a rectangle to fit snugly on the mouse’s tail. Marks were made where snap buttons (Michael’s) would be sewn, ensuring they clipped just above the tail. Given that the mouse’s tail narrows away from the body, the buttons closer to the body were placed slightly further apart than those closer to the tip. Typically, the buttons were set 2 cm apart on the narrow end and 2.5 cm apart on the broader end. Care was taken to adjust the placement of the buttons so they weren't too tight or loose for the mouse. We found that these measurements were generally similar across sexes and for the age group that we tested. After measurements were taken and the cloth cut, small strips of 8 mm wide conductive fabric tape (Adafruit) were attached to either side of the cloth, with some tape hanging off the edge. A metal strip (McMaster Carr) of the same width was affixed to this portion of the tape to provide a secure grip for alligator clips used in fear conditioning. Finally, snap buttons were sewn with conductive thread at the marked spots. Clear nail polish was applied to secure the threads in place. The tail-coat creation process should take less than half an hour. Dimensions of the cloth for a typical male mouse, 12 wk of age and weighing ~30 g, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.

The following day, a tail-coat was attached to the mouse’s tail. Mice that maintained consistent running in the VR, with minimal pauses, while wearing the tail-coat advanced to the next stage. For mice startled by the tail-coat, we typically attempted another day with the tail-coat, rewarding them and observing if their running behavior improved to running at least three laps per minute. If not, these mice were not advanced to the next stage. In mice that do advance, on the subsequent day, the tail-coat was kept on, and the water reward was removed. All else remained the same, including the 1.5 s pause at the end, to allow animals to distinguish the start and end of a lap. If the mice continued to run as before, they moved on to the experiment stage. From that day forward, the mice no longer received water reinforcement when running in the VR environments. Typically, about 40% of mice made it to the experiment stage. Tail-coats were only added during VR exploration and removed before returning the animals to their home cage. Once the mice advanced to the experiment stage, they were taken through the entire process and not excluded from analysis, even if they showed signs of inconsistent running behavior, which happened with some mice (for instance, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).</p><p>We implemented three distinct paradigms to assess contextual fear discrimination. In the first paradigm, we conducted experiments over 2 d (Paradigm 1). On Day 0, mice engaged with the same VR in which they were trained, now referred to as the Familiar VR. After 10 min, we transitioned them to a new VR for another 10 min; this new VR would later be associated with shocks (CFC VR). During this phase, the mice explored both VRs without any rewards while wearing the tail-coat. After the initial exploration in the CFC VR, they received six mild electric shocks, each lasting 1 s with 1 min intervals in between. The shocks were administered using a shock generator (Colbourn Precision animal shocker, Harvard Bioscience). A TTL pulse was generated using custom-written codes in MATLAB to turn on the shock generator via an Arduino. The shock times were recorded by the PicoScope Oscilloscope (PICO4824, Pico Technology, v6.13.2). We tested different shock intensities ranging from 0.5 to 1.2 mA. After the last shock, mice were removed from the VR and returned to their home cage. The following day (Day 1), we placed the mice in the Familiar VR or CFC VR for 10 min to test their memory recall. No rewards were delivered during this phase; however, the tail-coat was not added during memory recall. Some mice underwent additional recall tests over subsequent days to assess the time required for fear memory extinction. As a control, some mice underwent the same paradigm but without any shocks.</p><p>In the second paradigm (Paradigm 2), the experiment spanned over 3 d. On Day - 1, mice explored two novel VRs for 10 min each, establishing a baseline for context exploration. One of these VRs served as a control, while the other, the CFC VR, was where the mice would later receive electric shocks. On Day 0, the mice again spent 10 min each in the Control and CFC VRs. After this, they received six mild electric shocks, each lasting 1 s, with a strength of 1 mA and an inter-trial interval of 1 min. The mice wore the tail-coat on both Days –1 and 0. On Day 1, the mice were placed in either the Control VR or CFC VR for 10 min each, in a counterbalanced manner, to test for memory recall. No rewards were given on all the experimental days; however, the tail-coat was not added to the tails on the recall day (Day 1). The third paradigm (Paradigm 3) was similar to Paradigm 2 and used two novel VRs, except that a tail-coat was also added to the mice’s tails during recall tests.</p><p>Additionally, a subset of mice in Paradigms 1 and 2 and all mice in Paradigm 3 went through multiple days of recall tests. The subset of mice was randomly chosen, not based on their recall behavior from the previous day. Mice were presented with either the CFC VR or the Control VR in a counterbalanced manner.</p><p>All VRs were randomly assigned as either Control or CFC VR to prevent biasing any inherent preferences in mice. However, the Familiar VR was always kept the same. We also used both sexes in our experiments. However, we found female mice less receptive to the ‘tail-coat’ than their male counterparts. We believe this is due to the low average weight of female mice (~16 g) following water restriction. Female mice of the same age (10–12 wk) weighed significantly less than males (20–23 g vs 25–30 g) and lost further weight following water restriction. As a result, only four female mice could proceed through and complete all the behavioral tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavior measurement</title><p>Freezing periods were periods during which the animal’s instantaneous velocity was 0 cm/s. Freezing epochs were defined as continuous, uninterrupted freezing periods longer than 1 s. The time taken to complete a lap was calculated as the total time (in seconds) the animal took to run from 0 to 200 cm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Surgery and two-photon imaging</title><p>Stereotaxic surgeries and cannula window implantation above the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus were performed in the same way as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, a genetically-encoded calcium indicator, AAV1-CamKII-GCaMP6f (pENN.AAV.CamKII.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 was a gift from James M. Wilson – Addgene viral prep #100834-AAV1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/100834/">https://www.addgene.org/100834/</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_100834">Addgene_100834</ext-link>) was injected (~50 nL at a depth of 1.25 mm below the surface of the dura) using a beveled glass micropipette leading to GCaMP6f expression in a large population of CA1 pyramidal cells. Mice underwent water restriction (1.0 ml/day) following viral injection and, 7 d later, were implanted with a hippocampal window and head plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dombeck et al., 2010</xref>). Mice were allowed to rest from the surgeries for 3–4 d, after which behavioral training began. Imaging was done using a laser scanning two-photon microscope (Neurolabware). The setup is the same as the one previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>). Time-series images were collected through Scanbox (v4.1, Neurolabware), and the PicoScope Oscilloscope (PICO4824, Pico Technology, v6.13.2) was used to synchronize frame acquisition timing with behavior. At the end of the imaging session on Day –1 or Day 0, a 1 min time-series movie was collected at a higher magnification and then averaged to aid as a reference frame in finding the same imaging plane on subsequent days. Across-day images collected were motion-corrected using Suite2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>) and aligned using ImageJ (v1.53, NIH). Region of interests were extracted using Suite2p.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Place cell extraction and place field parameters</title><p>Place fields were identified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, the 2 m track was divided into 40 position bins (each 5 cm wide). The running behavior of the animal was filtered to exclude periods where the animal was immobile (speed &lt;1 cm/s). Filtering ensured that place cells were defined only during active exploration and not during freezing bouts. We have previously found that filtering versus not filtering yields similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>). Extracted place fields satisfied the following criteria, which were used for all conditions and all mice: 1. The average ΔF/F was greater than 10% above the baseline. 2. The cell displayed significant calcium transients on &gt;30% of laps in the field. 3. The rising phase of the mean transient was located on the track. 4. Their p-value from bootstrapping was &lt;0.05. Multiple place fields within the same cell were treated independently. Parameters of place fields were calculated as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>); this includes the center of mass (COM), place field reliability, out/in-field firing ratio, and place field widths.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>At the time of study design, sample sizes were based on prior studies using head-fixed mice in virtual reality environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015</xref>). However, the final sample size was constrained by the low attrition rate of mice progressing to the experimental stage. Mice were randomly assigned to one of three experimental setups and independently to a shock paradigm. Behavioral analyses, including the identification of freezing epochs, were conducted blind to the assigned paradigm until all data were compiled for group-level comparisons. The experiment has been independently replicated multiple times in the laboratory across different cohorts of mice and by different experimenters.</p><p>For related samples, we performed a paired t-test. Multiple comparisons of related samples were corrected with Bonferroni post-hoc. To quantify freezing across days, we employed a linear mixed-effects model with days of recall as the fixed effect and behavior prior to fear conditioning on Day 0 as baseline. The model also included a random effect for mice to account for the nesting of observations within individual subjects. Separate models were used for each VR. Boxplots are plotted to display the entire distribution of the data. The box in the boxplot ranges from the first quartile (25<sup>th</sup> percentile) to the third quartile (75<sup>th</sup> percentile), and the box shows the interquartile range (IQR). The line across the box represents the median (50<sup>th</sup> percentile). The whiskers extend to 1.5*IQR on either side of the box, and anything above this range is defined as an outlier. A two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test was used to compare distributions. When not using boxplots, mean and confidence intervals are displayed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental and surgical procedures were approved by the University of Chicago Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol number: 72508 and carried out in strict accordance with their guidelines.

The fundamental design is strong, with head-fixed mice required to run down a linear virtual track to obtain a water reward. Once trained, the water reward is no longer necessary and mice will navigate virtual reality environments. There are rigorous performance criteria to ensure that mice that make it to the experimental stage show very low levels of inactivity prior to fear conditioning.

Version 1 is the most promising, showing the greatest increase in conditioned freezing (~40%) and good discrimination between contexts (delta ~15-20%). Version 2 showed no clear evidence of learning - average freezing at recall day 1 was not different than pre-shock freezing. First lap freezing showed a difference, but this single lap effect is not useful for many of the neural circuit questions for which this paradigm is meant to facilitate. Version 3 produces greater freezing and slower extinction than version 2. While the magnitude of the context discrimination is less than that in version 1, further optimization of the VR CFC is likely to produce robust learning and extinction.

The results support this aim and largely replicate previous findings in freely moving subjects. One difference from previous work of note is that VR CFC led to remapping of the control environment, not just the conditioning context.

While this experiment examined place cell remapping after fear conditioning, it did not attempt to link neural activity to the learned association or freezing behavior.</p><p>In summary, this is an important methodological innovation and this study sets the initial parameters and neuronal validation needed to further optimize a head-fixed CFC paradigm that produces freezing.

Based on the comments, we have made several critical changes to the revised manuscript.</p><p>(1) We have changed our threshold for detecting freezing epochs from 1 cm/s to 0 cm/s in this revised manuscript. This change allows us to capture periods when animals are completely still on the treadmill, better matching the &quot;true freezing&quot; behavior seen in freely moving set-ups. We have added a new supplementary video (Supplementary Video 2) that better demonstrates the freezing response we observe. All results and figures in the revised manuscript reflect this updated threshold (Figure 2-6, Supplementary Figures 16, Tables 1-6). Our main findings remain robust, demonstrating that freezing serves as a reliable conditioned response in our paradigms, comparable to freely moving animals. Specifically, freezing behavior increased reliably in the fear-conditioned environment following CFC across all paradigms. We have also added data from a no-shock control group (Supplementary Figure 2) which, when compared to the conditioned group, shows that freezing responses in the conditioned group result from fear conditioning rather than immobility. We do observe other avoidance behaviors unique to our treadmill-based task— such as hesitation, backward movement, and slow crawls. These conditioned behaviors are captured through a separate metric: the time taken to complete a lap.</p><p>(2) As suggested by the reviewers, we have separately analyzed fear discrimination and extinction dynamics across recall days (Supplementary Figures 2, 5 and 6, Table 1-6). To assess fear discrimination, we use within-group comparisons to evaluate how well animals differentiate between the two VRs across days. For extinction, we use within-VR comparisons to examine freezing dynamics over time. Freezing across recall days is compared to baseline freezing (pre-conditioning) using a Linear Mixed Effects model (Tables 1-6), with recall days as fixed effects and mouse as a random effect, using baseline freezing as the reference.</p><p>(3) We have expanded the behavioral dataset in Paradigm 1 to investigate the effect of shock amplitude on the conditioned fear response (Supplementary Figure 2 C-E). Consistent with findings in freely moving animals, our data show that increasing shock intensity from 0.6 mA to 1.0 mA leads to stronger freezing. For the revised manuscript, we specifically increased the sample size in the 0.6 mA group (n = 8) in Paradigm 1, as this intensity is used in Paradigm 3. These additional data demonstrate that combining a lower shock amplitude with shorter inter-shock intervals and retaining the tail-coat during recall can enhance freezing, suggesting that these parameters help compensate for lower shock intensity.</p><p>(4) We have added more sample sizes to the imaging dataset (now n = 8, Figures 7-8).</p><p>Finally, we acknowledge that many aspects of this paradigm still require optimization. The headfixed CFC paradigm is in its early stages compared to the decades of research dedicated to understanding fear learning parameters in freely moving CFC paradigms. While there are numerous parameters that could be tested—both those identified through our own discussions and those raised by the reviewers—it is not feasible for a single lab to conduct a full evaluation of all the possible factors that could influence CFC in the head-fixed prep. A key limitation is that our approach requires robust navigation behavior in the VR without rewards, which requires weeks of training per mouse. It also necessitates larger sample sizes at the outset as not all animals will make it through our behavioral criteria required for CFC. Another important consideration is scalability. Unlike freely moving CFC paradigms, which allow parallel testing of many animals with minimal pre-training, the VR-CFC setup requires several weeks of behavior training and involves a more complex integration of hardware and software to accurately track behavior in virtual space. The number of VR rigs that can be operated simultaneously in a single lab is often limited, making high-throughput testing more challenging. These factors mean that the testing of a single parameter in a group of animals requires approximately 3–4 months to complete. Despite these constraints, we are committed to continue refining this paradigm over time. With this manuscript, our main aim was to provide a detailed framework, initial parameters, and evidence for conditioned behavior in the head-fixed preparation. By doing so, we hope to facilitate the adoption of this paradigm by researchers interested in studying the neural correlates of learning and memory using multiphoton imaging and stimulation techniques. This approach enables investigations that are not possible in freely moving animals, while the presence of freezing as a conditioned response allows for direct comparisons to the extensive body of work done in freely moving paradigms. Moving forward, we anticipate that optimizing this paradigm and identifying the key parameters that drive learning will be a collaborative, community-led effort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The authors set out to develop a contextual fear learning (CFC) paradigm in head-fixed mice that would produce freezing as the conditioned response.

Paradigm version 1 is the most promising, showing the greatest increase in conditioned freezing (~40%) and good discrimination between contexts (delta ~15-20%). Paradigm version 2 showed no clear evidence of learning - average freezing at recall day 1 was not different than pre-shock freezing. First-lap freezing showed a difference, but this single-lap effect is not useful for many of the neural circuit questions for which this paradigm is meant to facilitate. Also, the claim that mice extinguished first-lap freezing after 1 day is weak. Extinction is determined here by the loss of context discrimination, but this was not strong to begin with. First-lap freezing does not appear to be different between Recall Day 1 and 2, but this analysis was not done.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. Following reviewer suggestions, we have replotted our figures for all paradigms to show within-VR freezing (see Supplementary Figures 2, 5 and 6) as the appropriate method for quantifying fear extinction across days. Using an LME model (Tables 16), we quantify freezing during recall days against baseline freezing levels measured before fear conditioning within each VR. In Paradigm 2, while some fear discrimination persists across days, extinction does occur rapidly. After the first lap in the CFC VR, we observed no significant differences in freezing compared to the baseline. These results are shown in the revised Supplementary Figure 5, and the revised text is in lines 393-399.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Paradigm version 3 has some promise, but the magnitude of the context discrimination is modest (~10% difference in freezing). Thus, further optimization of the VR CFC will be needed to achieve robust learning and extinction. This could include factors not thoroughly tested in this study, including context pre-exposure timing and duration and shock intensity and frequency.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that many aspects of this paradigm still need optimization, as virtual reality CFC is in its early stages, and we have not explored all of the parameter space. We describe above the reasoning for this. However, for this revised version of the paper we have added new behavioral data (Supplementary Figure 2 C-E) showing that increasing shock intensities from 0.6 mA to 1 mA enhances freezing, both in the first lap and on average. There are of course many other parameters that are likely important, like the ones pointed out here by the reviewer, but exploring the entire parameter space will take many years and will likely require many labs. The purpose of this paper is to show that VR-CFC fundamentally works and is a starting point from which the field can build on. We have now pointed out in the introduction (lines 54-58) and discussion (lines 730-737, 810-814) that there remains significant scope for improving this paradigm and optimizing parameters in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second part of the study is a validation of the head-fixed CFC VR protocol through the demonstration that fear conditioning leads to the remapping of dorsal CA1 place fields, similar to that observed in freely moving subjects. The results support this aim and largely replicate previous findings in freely moving subjects. One difference from previous work of note is that VR CFC led to the remapping of the control environment, not just the conditioning context. The authors present several possible explanations for this lack of specificity to the shock context, further underscoring the need for further refinement of the CFC protocol before it can be widely applied. While this experiment examined place cell remapping after fear conditioning, it did not attempt to link neural activity to the learned association or freezing behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting observation. We think that the remapping observed in the control context likely occurred due to the absence of reward in a previously rewarded environment. Our prior work has demonstrated that removal of reward causes increased remapping (Krishnan et al., 2022, Krishnan and Sheffield, 2023). In other words, the continued presence of reward within an environment stabilizes CA1 place fields. The Moita et al. (2004) paper, which showed remapping only in the fear conditioned context and not in the control context, provided rats with food pellets throughout the experimental session in both the control and conditioned context— likely to increase exploration necessary for identifying place cells. The presence of reward in the Moita et al experiment could explain the minimal remapping observed in their control context compared to our control context which lacked reward. Another possibility could lie in the differences in the intervals between place cell activity recordings in our study and that of Moita et al. While Moita et al. separated their recordings by just one hour, our recordings were separated by a full day, with a sleep period in between. The absence of sleep and the shorter time interval between conditioning and retrieval sessions in their study could explain the minimal remapping observed by Moita et al. compared to our findings. We have now addressed this discrepancy explicitly in lines 596-606.</p><p>Although we agree with the reviewer that it would be informative to perform analysis of how neural activity correlates with freezing responses, we think this warrants its own stand-alone manuscript as the neural dynamics and methods to appropriately analyze them are complicated. We are in the midst of analyzing this data further and will present these findings in a separate publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, this is an important study that sets the initial parameters and neuronal validation needed to establish a head-fixed CFC paradigm that produces freezing behaviors. In the discussion, the authors note the limitations of this study, suggest the next steps in refinement, and point to several future directions using this protocol to significantly advance our understanding of the neural circuits of threat-related learning and behavior.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Krishnan et al devised three paradigms to perform contextual fear conditioning in head-fixed mice. Each of the paradigms relied on head-fixed mice running on a treadmill through virtual reality arenas. The authors tested the validity of three versions of the paradigms by using various parameters. As described below, I think there are several issues with the way the paradigms are designed and how the data are interpreted. Moreover, as Paradigm 3 was published previously in a study by the same group, it is unclear to me what this manuscript offers beyond the validations of parameters used for the previous publication. Below, I list my concerns point-by-point, which I believe need to be addressed to strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>(1) In the analysis using the LME model (Tables 1 and 2), I am left wondering why the mice had increased freezing across recall days as well as increased generalization (increased freezing to the familiar context, where shock was never delivered). Would the authors expect freezing to decrease across recall days, since repeated exposure to the shock context should drive some extinction? This is complicated by the analysis showing that freeing was increased only on retrieval day 1 when analyzing data from the first lap only. Since reward (e.g., motivation to run) is removed during the conditioning and retrieval tests, I wonder if what the authors are observing is related to decreased motivation to perform the task (mice will just sit, immobile, not necessarily freezing per se). I think that these aspects need to be teased out.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and we agree teasing out a lack of motivation versus fearful freezing would be useful. To address the possibility that reduced motivation to run without reward could contribute to the observed freezing behavior, we have now included a no-shock control group in the revised manuscript (n = 7; Supplementary Figure 2A-B, H–I). These control mice experienced the same protocol, including the wearing of a tail coat, but did not receive any shocks. We observed no increases in freezing across days in these controls, confirming that the increased freezing in the Familiar context of our experimental group stems from fear conditioning rather than the removal of reward from a previously rewarded context. If reduced motivation from reward removal were the primary driver, similar freezing patterns would have emerged in the no-shock controls. We have added lines 248-261 in the revised manuscript, discussing this point, and we thank the reviewer for motivating us to do this experiment and analysis.</p><p>That said, the precise mechanisms underlying the fear generalization observed in the nonconditioned context—particularly its emergence during later recall days—remain unclear. Studies in freely moving animals have shown that fear memories initially specific to the conditioned context can become generalized with repeated exposures, which may be occurring here (Biedenkapp &amp; Rudy, 2007; Wiltgen &amp; Silva, 2007). Alternatively, it is possible that the combination of fear conditioning and the removal of expected reward contributes to a delayed generalization effect. This may reflect a limitation of our approach, which relies on reward to motivate initial training. As noted by another reviewer, we have now addressed this potential drawback of reward-based training in the discussion (see lines 809-817). Clearly, unique factors specific to the head-fixed VR paradigm may contribute to this phenomenon. Understanding the mechanisms underlying fear generalization in the head-fixed VR CFC paradigm will be a valuable direction for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Related to point 1, the authors actually point out that these changes could be due to the loss of the water reward. So, in line 304, is it appropriate to call this freezing? I think it will be very important for the authors to exactly define and delineate what they consider as freezing in this task, versus mice just simply sitting around, immobile, and taking a break from performing the task when they realize there is no reward at the end.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in point 1 above, we have added a no-shock control group (n = 7; Supplementary Figure 2A-B, H–I) to determine whether the observed freezing was driven by fear conditioning or by reduced motivation to run in the absence of reward. The absence of increased freezing in these controls supports the interpretation that the behavior in the conditioned group is fearrelated. In future studies, incorporating additional physiological measures—such as heart rate monitoring—could further help distinguish fear-related freezing from other forms of immobility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the second paradigm, mice are exposed to both novel and (at the time before conditioning) neutral environments just before fear conditioning. There is a big chance that the mice are 'linking' the memories (Cai et al 2016) of the two contexts such that there is no difference in freezing in the shock context compared to the neutral context, which is what the authors observe (Lines 333-335). The experiment should be repeated such that exposure to the contexts does not occur on the conditioning day.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting idea. However, if memory linking were driving the observed freezing patterns, we would expect to see similarly reduced fear discrimination across all three paradigms, as mice experience both contexts sequentially in each case. However, this effect appears to be specific to Paradigm 2, suggesting this may be due to other factors. We agree it would be informative to eliminate pre-conditioning exposure to both environments—to assess whether this improves fear discrimination and helps clarify the potential contribution of memory linking. This is something we plan to do in future studies that are beyond the scope of this initial paper on VR-CFC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) On lines 360-361, the authors conclude that extinction happens rapidly, within the first lap of the VR trial. To my understanding, that would mean that extinction would happen within the first 5-10 seconds of the test (according to Figure S1E). That seems far too fast for extinction to occur, as this never occurs in freely behaving mice this quickly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that extinction in Paradigm 2 appears to occur relatively rapidly.</p><p>However, the average time to complete the first lap in the fear-conditioned context in Paradigm 2 is 25.68 ± 5.55 seconds (as stated in line 384), indicating that extinction occurs within approximately the first 30 seconds of context exposure—not within 5–10 seconds. This is specific to Paradigm 2 and does not happen in either of the other paradigms, as shown in Supplementary Figure 4. For clarification, Figure S1E pertains to baseline running in Paradigm 1 and does not apply to Paradigm 2.</p><p>As the reviewer points out, even at 30 seconds, extinction seems to be happening more quickly in Paradigm 2 than seen in freely moving setups. This may be due to a key structural difference in our setup. The VR-CFC task is organized into discrete trials, with mice being teleported back to the start after reaching the end of the virtual track. Completing a full lap without receiving a shock could serve as a clear signal that the threat is no longer present within the environment as the completion of a lap means that the animals have surveyed all locations within the environment. This structure could accelerate extinction compared to freely moving setups, where animals take longer to explore their complete environment due to the lack of discrete trials. Although this is true for all our paradigms, the accelerated extinction seen in paradigm 2 versus 1 and 3 may be driven by other factors. As noted by the reviewers, other task parameters—such as context pre-exposure timing, shock intensity, and conditioning duration— are likely to play a role in shaping extinction dynamics. These factors warrant further investigation, and we plan to explore them in future studies to better understand the conditions influencing extinction in the VR-CFC paradigm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Throughout the different paradigms, the authors are using different shock intensities. This can lead to differences in fear memory encoding as well as in levels of fear memory generalization. I don't think that comparisons can be made across the different paradigms as too many variables (including shock intensity - 0.5/0.6mA can be very different from 1.0 mA) are different. How can the authors pinpoint which works best? Indeed, they find Paradigm 3 'works' better than Paradigm 2 because mice discriminate better between the neutral and shock contexts. This can definitely be driven by decreased generalization from using a 0.6mA shock in Paradigm 3 compared to 1.0 mA shock in Paradigm 2.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up important points here. We have now added new data evaluating 0.6 mA shocks in Paradigm 1 (Supplementary Figure 2A–E, n=8). These data show that 1.0 mA shocks produced stronger conditioned responses and greater fear discrimination compared to 0.6 mA. Our goal in Paradigm 3 was to begin with a lower shock intensity and assess whether additional modifications—specifically the shorter ISI and retention of the tail-coat during recall—could enhance fear conditioning. Surprisingly, despite the weaker shock intensity, Paradigm 3 resulted in improved discrimination and freezing behavior relative to Paradigm 2. We have now clarified this point in the manuscript (lines 466-470), and we interpret this outcome as evidence that the shorter ISIs and contextual cue continuity (tail-coat) likely play a more significant role in enhancing learning and recall. However, as noted in the text (lines 511-514), further testing is needed to determine the individual contributions of each parameter to successful VR-CFC. Fully optimizing the parameter settings will take additional time and resources, and we aim to continually refine the parameter space in the future, as has been done over the years for freely moving animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) There are some differences in the calcium imaging dataset compared to other studies, and the authors should perform additional testing to determine why. This will be integral to validating their head-fixed paradigm(s) and showing they are useful for modeling circuit dynamics/behaviors observed in freely behaving mice. Moreover, the sample size (number of mice) seems low.</p></disp-quote><p>The one notable difference between our imaging study and that done in freely moving animals is that we observed remapping of place cells in the control context. In contrast, Moita et al. (2004) reported more stable place fields in the control context. A key distinction is that their study included rewards in the control context, which may have contributed to the spatial stability. We now discuss this difference in the manuscript (lines 599-605).</p><p>It should be noted that there are many key distinctions among paradigms that study neural activity during fear conditioning in freely moving animals. These include varying exposure times to environments (1–6 days), the time interval between neural activity recordings, and the use of food rewards during the experiment stages in freely moving animals to encourage exploration for place cell identification. Although freely moving paradigms that investigate fear conditioning and place cells are heterogeneous, we were encouraged by the replication of several key findings. This validates VR-based CFC as a viable tool for neural circuit investigations. While future work will include more thorough analyses, our current findings demonstrate the paradigm's effectiveness for modeling circuit dynamics and behavior. We have now expanded our dataset, which includes four additional mice, further corroborating these original findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) It appears that the authors have already published a paper using Paradigm 3 (Ratigan et al 2023). If they already found a paradigm that is published and works, it is unclear to me what the current manuscript offers beyond that initial manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we have published a paper using Paradigm 3. However, this manuscript goes beyond that one and provides a much more comprehensive description and fundamental analysis of the behavior and experimental parameters regarding VR-CFC, allowing the research community to adapt our paradigm reproducibly. While Ratigan et al. (2023) offered only a minimal description of behavior and included just Paradigm 3, we present two additional paradigms along with neuronal validation using hippocampal place cells. We have now explicitly stated this in the introduction (lines 50-55).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) As written, the manuscript is really difficult to follow with the averages and standard error reported throughout the text. This reporting in the text occurred heterogeneously throughout the text, as sometimes it was reported and other times it was not. Cleaning this reporting up throughout the paper would greatly improve the flow of the text and qualitative description of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with this point and have now cleaned up the text, leaving details only in a few places we felt were important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Krishnan et al. present a novel contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm using a virtual reality (VR) apparatus to evaluate whether conditioned context-induced freezing can be elicited in head-fixed mice. By combining this approach with two-photon imaging, the authors aim to provide high-resolution insights into the neural mechanisms underlying learning, memory, and fear. Their experiments demonstrate that head-fixed mice can discriminate between threat and non-threat contexts, exhibit fear-related behavior in VR, and show context-dependent variability during extinction.

Supplementary videos suggest the observed behaviors may include avoidance-like actions (e.g., backing away or stopping locomotion) rather than true freezing. Additional physiological measurements, such as EMG or heart rate, are necessary to substantiate the claim that freezing is elicited in the paradigm.</p></disp-quote><p>To strengthen our claim that freezing is a conditioned response in this task, we have taken three key steps:</p><p>(1) We adjusted our freezing detection threshold from 1 cm/s to near 0 cm/s to capture only periods where the animal is virtually motionless on the treadmill. We validated this approach in Figure 2, particularly in the zoomed-in track position trace in Figure 2A, which clearly shows that the identified freezing epochs correspond to no change in track position. All analyses and figures have been updated to reflect this more stringent threshold.</p><p>(2) We have added a no-shock control group in the revised manuscript (n = 7; Supplementary Figure 2A-B, H–I) where mice experienced the same protocol, including wearing a tail-coat, but received no shocks. These mice showed no increases in freezing behavior, which further demonstrates that the increased freezing we observe is a result of fear conditioning.</p><p>(3) We have added a new supplementary video (Supplementary Video 2) that better illustrates the freezing behavior in our task.</p><p>That said, we fully agree with the reviewer that freezing is not the only defensive response observed. Other behaviors—such as hesitation, backward movement, and slowing down—also emerge that are unique to our treadmill-based paradigm. We chose to focus on freezing in this manuscript to align with convention in freely moving fear conditioning studies and to facilitate direct comparisons. We agree that additional physiological measurements (e.g., EMG or heart rate) would provide further validation and could help distinguish between different forms of defensive responses. We view this as an important future direction and plan to incorporate such measures in upcoming studies. We highlight this in the results section (lines 175-179, 262-268) and in the discussion (lines 739-750).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Analysis of Extinction: Extinction dynamics are only analyzed through between-group comparisons within each Recall day, without addressing within-group changes in behavior across days.

We agree that the current study is not powered to definitively identify optimal parameter settings. We have been careful not to interpret it in that way in the text.

To provide context for others interested in pursuing this work, we have presented a range of conditioned responses from different parameter combinations to illustrate potential variability. In most cases, these data are intended for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to support firm conclusions. We agree that a systematic and fully powered investigation of each parameter would be highly valuable, and we plan to pursue this in future work (and hope other labs contribute to this goal, too), much like the iterative optimizations performed in freely moving paradigms over time.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for catching the sample size discrepancy and have now corrected it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The number of animals for the no-shock condition should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.
