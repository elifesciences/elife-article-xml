malformations that, on clinical grounds, were historically postulated to arise from defects in neural crest formation during embryogenesis. To better delineate neural crest defects in CHARGE syndrome, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two patients with typical syndrome manifestations, and characterized neural crest cells differentiated in vitro from these iPSCs (iPSC-NCCs). We found that expression of genes associated with cell migration was altered in CHARGE iPSC-NCCs compared to control iPSC-NCCs. Consistently, CHARGE iPSC-NCCs showed defective delamination, migration and motility in vitro, and their transplantation <italic>in ovo</italic> revealed overall defective migratory activity in the chick embryo. These results support the historical inference that CHARGE syndrome patients exhibit defects in neural crest migration, and provide the first successful application of patient-derived iPSCs in modeling craniofacial disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21114.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>CHARGE syndrome is a disease in which organs including the heart, eyes and ears may not develop properly.

This syndrome is relatively common, occurring approximately one in 10,000 births. Since the first report that de novo mutations in <italic>CHD7</italic> (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7) might be the cause of CHARGE syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vissers et al., 2004</xref>), several groups have sought to identify genotype-phenotype correlations and to determine how various phenotypic features of CHARGE are contributed to by <italic>CHD7</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aramaki et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanlaville et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zentner et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>CHD7 is expressed in various cell types, including pluripotent stem cells and cells of the neural tube and placodal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aramaki et al., 2007</xref>). CHD7 modulates chromatin formation by binding to genomic DNA and regulating the expression of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin, 2010</xref>). For instance, several transcriptional factors, such as SOX2, SOX9, and SOX10, have been reported to cooperate with CHD7 in regulating early development in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajpai et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Micucci et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schnetz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The hypothesis that clinical features observed in CHARGE syndrome patients are caused by abnormalities in neural crest development has been proposed for more than 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebert et al., 1985</xref>). The cells of the neural crest contribute to many different tissue lineages, including those of the craniofacial skeleton, cranial nerves (VII, VIII, IX and X), ears, eyes, and heart. Since many of the defects observed in CHARGE syndrome appear to be related to abnormalities of cranial neural crest cells, this syndrome is considered as a âneurocristopathyâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aramaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanlaville et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebert et al., 1985</xref>). A recent study supports this view by showing that the knockdown of CHD7 in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) results in migratory neural crest formation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajpai et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the knockdown of <italic>Chd7</italic> in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> or zebrafish embryos led to abnormalities in neural crest specification and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asad et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajpai et al., 2010</xref>). The hypothesis that the neural crest pathophysiology observed in CHARGE syndrome is attributable to NCC defects has not been examined using patient-derived cells due to technical challenges. In addition, the phenotypic aspects of CHARGE patient-derived NCCs with respect to different migratory behaviors have not been examined in detail.</p><p>Thus, there is great potential value in the establishment of in vitro models of this syndrome using patient-derived cells for use in the study of CHARGE pathophysiology. In the present study, we generated NCCs from CHARGE syndrome patient-derived iPSCs, established in vitro models of CHARGE syndrome, and observed defective migration in CHARGE NCCs via in vitro and in vivo experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clinical features of enrolled CHARGE patients and generation of patient-derived iPSCs</title><p>To gain mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome, we enrolled two CHARGE patients, designated patient 1 (CH1) and patient 2 (CH2), in the present study in an effort to generate patient-derived iPSCs.

We selected four lines from CH1 (CH1#7, CH1#11, CH1#20, CH1#25) and three lines from CH2 (CH2#1, CH2#16, CH2#19) for further analyses.

A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of this set showed enrichment for genes involved in vasculature development (p=2.08E-11), blood vessel development (p=1.24E-11), and blood vessel morphogenesis (p=1.23E-09). Interestingly, GO terms associated with âcell migrationâ and âcell motionâ were also significantly enriched in these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Given that NCC dysfunction is thought to be linked to the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome, we sought to examine the expression of genes associated with NCC behavior, specifically those related to cell migration and cell adhesion. We selected a set of genes listed under each GO term and compared their expression levels in control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D, E</xref> 56 genes under the GO terms âmigrationâ or âadhesionâ were differentially expressed.

These genes are also listed as CHD7 targets in the dataset. We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR for CHD7 using promoter primers for the genes to reveal direct CHD7 binding to these genes, and we found the direct binding of CHD7 to the distal promoter region in <italic>EDN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The results of these transcriptome analyses support the notion that NCCs exhibit migratory and/or cell adhesion defects during embryonic development in CHARGE patients.</p><p>In the early stages of cranial neural crest cell migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to occur immediately prior to the delamination of NCCs from the neural crest. Migratory NCCs then begin their directed migration along the dorsolateral pathway, reaching their target and initiating their differentiation toward mature cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kulesa et al., 2010</xref>). Since CHARGE iPSC-NCCs showed only minimal defects in the initiation of NCC differentiation and subsequent differentiation into NCC derivatives, we hypothesized that sequential developmental processes, including delamination and migration, might be disrupted in CHARGE syndrome, as suggested by the results of our transcriptome analysis. We therefore next focused on the dysregulation of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs in cellular adhesion, migration, and cellular motion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Defective scattering of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs</title><p>The first step of the developmental journey of NCCs consists in their delamination from the region between the dorsal neural tube and the overlying ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kulesa et al., 2010</xref>). We first examined how control iPSC-NCCs migrated outward from spheres using iPSC-NCCs differentiated by Method A to model this particular event. As shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref>, the cells began to spread out as a continuous monolayer (Phase 1) once the sphere became attached to the culture dish. The control iPSC-NCCs residing at the outermost periphery then began to scatter apart (Phase 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aâa</xref>). In contrast, CHARGE iPSC-NCCs exhibited a distinct behavior in Phase 2, remaining closely associated with their neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aâb</xref>). To clarify this difference, we performed a time-lapse analysis of the initial phase of cell dispersion from the sphere. We used a method to calculate cell dispersion by a Delaunay triangulation algorithm (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The distribution of the formed triangular area by the algorithm at 8 hr after the sphere attached to the plate was significantly increased relative to that at tÂ =Â 0 for both control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Next, we analyzed differences in the increased cell dispersion (from tÂ =Â 0 to tÂ =Â 8 hr) between control and CHARGE cells by calculating the median size of the triangular area. We revealed a delayed dispersion of cells from CHARGE spheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, to determine whether CHARGE iPSC-NCCs have defects in premigratory-to-migratory transition, we analyzed the intercellular contacts of both control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs at Phase 2. We visualized the cell associations by F-actin and nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the number of intercellular contacts among the outermost migrating cells revealed significantly persistent intercellular contacts in CHARGE iPSC-NCCs in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). CHARGE NCCs were reluctant to disperse as single cells, in contrast with control NCCs. This suggests that NCC delamination from the neural tube may be affected in CHARGE syndrome.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21114.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Defective Scattering of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs obtained by Method A.

To assess the migratory ability of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs, we assessed the trans-well migration of dissociated iPSC-NCCs using the xCELLigence system (Roche). Using this system, cells migrating from the upper to lower well through fibronectin-coated microelectrode sensors were monitored automatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the migration index of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs became lower than that of control cells after approximately 8 hr of monitoring.

To exclude the possibility that the reduction in the number of migrating CHARGE iPSC-NCCs was due to reduced proliferation, we treated control iPSC-NCCs with an antimitotic, aphidicolin.

Additionally, to exclude the possibility that lower CHARGE iPSC-NCC adherence to fibronectin caused the reduction in the number of migrating CHARGE iPSC-NCCs in this assay, we performed a cell adhesion assay to fibronectin; we found no differential adherence to fibronectin between control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

Therefore, we performed a time-lapse analysis to examine the single-cell spontaneous motility of control (201B7) and CHARGE (CH1#25) iPSC-NCCs. To exclude cell-density effects, we analyzed the motility of mixed iPSC-NCCs, i.e., controlÂ +Â CHARGE, within the same well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

To compare the migration ability of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs and control cells under identical conditions, we transplanted a mixture of control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs into the same embryo. To distinguish these cells, the iPSC-NCCs were stained with different lipophilic dyes (Vybrant DiI or DiO) before transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). First, to examine the serial migration of the transplanted cells, we transferred the transplanted embryo to a glass-bottomed plate (IWAKI) 6 hr after transplantation and then acquired time-lapse images every 20 min (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7âvideo 1</xref>). We tracked 4â14 cells migrating well for both control and CHARGE cells in an embryo (the average # of counted cells per experiment: control, 8.9; CHARGE, 9.0), and we calculated their velocity at each time interval using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In 6 of 9 transplanted embryos, the velocity of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs was significantly less than that of control cells. In the other 3 embryos, there were no differences between control and CHARGE cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1âsource data 1</xref> -tab1) Collectively, CHARGE iPSC-NCCs exhibited a lower velocity compared with that of the co-transplanted control iPSC-NCCs (p=0.03; Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Second, we examined the iPSC-NCCs that had migrated throughout the embryo <italic>in ovo</italic> thirty-six hours after transplantation. Interestingly, the iPSC-NCCs migrated from the site of transplantation (dorsal area) to the ventral area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, lower panels). Both control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs migrated in the expected direction, consistent with the normal developmental routes of NCCs. Notably, CHARGE iPSC-NCCs did not follow abnormal routes to ectopic sites in this model. To compare the migration of control and CHARGE iPSC- NCCs in vivo, we scored the maximum distance that the transplanted cells migrated in 17 surviving chick embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7âsource data 1</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, CHARGE iPSC-NCCs exhibited similar or lower migration scores compared with those of the co-transplanted control iPSC-NCCs. Adversely, the migration exhibited a large degree of variability among the embryos.

In this assay, iPSCs were induced into neuroectodermal spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), and the cells migrated out from the spheres. This migration of iPSC-NCCs out from neuroectodermal spheres resembles the premigratory-to-migratory transition, after which the migrating cells scattered as single cells in a manner similar to delamination in vivo. Our finding of defective CHARGE iPSC-NCCs scattering is compatible with a previous report that CHD7 controls the transcriptional reprogramming of EMT. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <italic>FOXD1</italic> expression was upregulated in CHARGE iPSC-NCCs. Since <italic>FOXD1</italic> is known to be expressed in premigratory NCCs and extinguished once migration occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">GÃ³mez-Skarmeta et al., 1999</xref>), altered <italic>FOXD1</italic> expression may lead to a defective premigratory-to-migratory transition occurring in CHARGE iPSC-NCCs. While delamination in vivo is not so simple as this in vitro model, as it is subject to complex orchestration by various signals, this delamination model may be a very valuable tool, since it is impractical for ethical and technical reasons to observe human NCC delamination in early embryos directly.</p><p>Second, our transwell migration assay using dissociated iPSC-NCCs, which occurred after delamination in vivo, showed defective CHARGE cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DâE</xref>, many genes referred to under the GO terms âmigrationâ and âadhesionâ were differentially expressed in CHARGE iPSC-NCCs, and the defective migratory phenotype of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs in the transwell assay is compatible with the results of this transcriptional analysis. This assay models cell migration toward chemoattractants. All cranial NCCs are suggested to have similar migratory potential, unlike trunk NCCs, which are known to be a heterozygous population consisting of cells such as leader cells and follower cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, this transwell migration assay is adequate for assessing the migration of cranial NCCs such as our iPSC-NCCs that robustly express OTX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Of course, during the long journey from the dorsal neural tube to the ventral area, many signals influence NCC migration in a complex manner, and NCCs change their character during their migration. In our model, the in vivo migration provided additional evidence supporting the defective migration of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs.</p><p>Third, a spontaneous motility assay allowed us to assess whether defective motility is a partial cause of the defective migration of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this assay with a mixed population of control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs (co-culture system), autocrine or paracrine factors would likely diffuse within the wells and affect neighboring cells. The observed spontaneous defective motility of the CHARGE cells suggests that such soluble factors are not involved in the defective migration of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs.</p><p>Our transcriptome analysis revealed that genes associated with âmigrationâ and âadhesionâ were altered in CHARGE iPSC-NCCs. CHD7 is an important chromatin remodeler and may thus play roles in various gene regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajpai et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Micucci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schnetz et al., 2010</xref>).

Importantly, CHD7 is considered to function cooperatively with SOX2 as a molecular partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelen et al., 2011</xref>), and PAX6 has also been reported to be a functional partner of SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thakurela et al., 2016</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, the expression levels of <italic>POU3F2</italic> (<italic>BRN2</italic>) and <italic>OLFM3</italic> (Optimedin) were significantly downregulated in CHARGE compared with control iPSC-NCCs, and these two genes have been reported to be targets of PAX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grinchuk et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ninkovic et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raviv et al., 2014</xref>). POU3F2 is involved in controlling the migration of melanocytes, which are neural crest derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berlin et al., 2012</xref>). OLFM3 is considered to be involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grinchuk et al., 2005</xref>). Several downstream targets of Pax6 have been identified as cell adhesion molecules and structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cvekl and Callaerts, 2017</xref>). Altered <italic>CHD7</italic> expression resulted in the upregulation of <italic>PAX6</italic> and the downregulation of PAX6 downstream genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that CHD7 regulates multipotent NCC migration by cooperating with PAX6.</p><p>Next, <italic>CTGF</italic> and <italic>EDN1</italic>, known to be downstream factors in the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, are highly expressed in CHARGE iPSC-NCCs compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway is known to be regulated via cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>), and this pathway has recently been reported to inhibit migration and suggested to play important roles on the early stage of NCC specification and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, CTGF and EDN1 play important roles in craniofacial development, and the timing and regulation of their expression are crucial for their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maj et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mercurio et al., 2004</xref>). Altered <italic>CHD7</italic> expression in iPSC-NCCs resulted in the upregulation of <italic>CTGF</italic> and <italic>EDN1</italic>. Therefore, it is conceivable that CHD7 regulates the craniofacial phenotype of CHARGE syndrome through the Hippo-YAP pathway. To clarify this mechanistic insight into how NCCs are dysregulated in CHARGE syndrome patients, it is noteworthy that 202 of the 338 differentially expressed genes between the CHARGE and control iPSC-NCCs were listed as target genes of CHD7 in the ChIP-seq datasets from the ENCODE Transcriptional Factor Target dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rouillard et al., 2016</xref>). Although these target sites vary depending on cell type, we found the target site of <italic>CHD7</italic> in the EDN1 distal promoter region by ChIP-qPCR for CHD7 using our cells. This result suggests that CHD7 regulates not only the expression of some specific key genes but also the robust gene expression in early NCCs.</p><p>The current study represents the first model of a developmental morphogenetic disorder using patient-derived iPSCs. To date, the neural crest pathophysiology observed in CHARGE syndrome has not been examined directly using patient-derived cells due to technical challenges and ethical concerns surrounding the collection of NCCs from human embryos. Moreover, since the developmental regulation of NCCs is known to be unique to individual species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acloque et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barriga et al., 2015</xref>), NCCs derived from CHARGE patient-derived iPSCs are an appropriate source for modeling the cellular features of this disease in vitro.</p><p>We suggest that such cells may be used as a powerful assay system for evaluating NCC dysfunction in other morphogenetic disorders that could be considered neurocristopathies, such as craniofacial syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Minoux and Rijli, 2010</xref>) and infants of vitamin A exposure(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kraft et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rosa, 1983</xref>). NCCs play important roles in the formation of sensory organs, such as ears, eyes, and olfactory organs, and some congenital neurocristopathies are caused by reproductive toxicity. These deformities of experimental animals have been used for the toxicity testing of newly developed drugs. The iPSC-NCC system presented herein could be used as an animal-free NCC system for reproductive toxicity testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Clinical description of the enrolled patients with CHARGE syndrome</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>, patient1 (CH1), a Japanese male, was born at 39 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 3.3 kg and a length of 50.5 cm.

Data were analyzed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test after one-way ANOVA and Sidakâs multiple comparisons test after two-way repeated measure ANOVA using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0a (GraphPad Software).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>BrdU incorporation in vitro</title><p>Passaged day10 iPSC-NCCs were seeded into wells of an 8-well glass-bottomed plate coated with poly-L-ornithine (0.1 mg/ml) and fibronectin (10 Î¼g/ml) at a low density in NC medium supplemented with 10 Î¼M BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich). After 24 hr, the cells were fixed with PBS containing 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature and immunostained with sheep polyclonal anti-BrdU antibody (1:500; Fitzgerald Industries International, Acton, MA). Images were randomly captured with an Apotome microscope, and the cells were manually counted. Data were analyzed by unpaired t test using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0a (GraphPad Software).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Cell adhesion assay</title><p>Control iPSC-NCCs and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs obtained by Method B were used for this assay. Each iPSC-NCCs type was cultured to semi-confluence in NC medium, detached by 5 min of treatment with Accutase, and were washed with NC medium twice. We resuspended the cells at a density of 1 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells per ml in NC medium, and added 100 Î¼l of cell suspension to each well of a fibronectin-coated 96-well plate. After 60 min incubation at 37Â°C, we changed the medium and added 10 Î¼l of WTS-1/ECS (MerckMillipore, Billerica, USA) per well except for 12 wells per 96-well plate. After 90 min of incubation at 37Â°C, the plate was shaken thoroughly for 1 min on a shaker, and then the absorbance at 450 nm of the treated and untreated samples was measured using a microplate reader. The average of absorbance values of the 12 wells without WTS-1/ECS was considered a baseline, and the data were normalized to that of 201B7 iPSC-NCCs in each experiment. Data were analyzed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test after one-way repeated measures ANOVA using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0a (GraphPad Software).

At day 10â12, after the beginning of differentiation by Method B, the remaining spheres were removed by direct aspiration with a fine Pasteur pipette. The adherent NCCs were washed 2â3 times gently with PBS, and then stained for 3 hr at 37Â°C with either Vybrant DiI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Vybrant DiO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1/300 in NC medium. Notably, permutations of the staining dyes confirmed that the nature of the dye had no effect on the migratory behavior of the cells. After 4â5 washes with PBS, the stained NCCs were then dissociated using Accutase, counted using Trypan Blue (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), and then co-seeded in equal amounts at a density of 5 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well (total of 10 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> cells per well) onto 8-well, plastic-bottomed chambers that were previously coated with fibronectin at 10 Î¼g/ml. Three hours after seeding, once the cells had attached, the chambers were transferred to an LSM 5, PASCAL Exciter confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) that was equipped with a heat- (37Â°C) and gas-controlled incubation chamber (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) (Tokai Hit, Shizuoka, Japan) that was coupled to a heated motorized stage. The objective lens (EC-Plan Neofluar, 10 X, Numerical Aperture 0.3) was maintained at 37Â°C and was used to acquire a Z-stack time-lapse series (7 Z-stacks spanning 30 Î¼m, every 15 min) of multiple locations. Z-projections were produced using Image Browser Zeiss software at the end of the analysis. The time-lapse recordings began at 4 hr after seeding and continued for at least 16 hr. Individual cells were manually tracked using the Manual Tracking plugin of the Fiji software (1.48). Cells exhibiting abnormal morphologies (e.g., neurite-like, or with signs of apoptosis) were excluded from the analysis. Calculations of individual velocities and directionalities were performed using the chemotaxis and migration tool from Ibidi (Martinsried, Germany). Data were analyzed Sidakâs multiple comparisons tests after two-way repeated measures ANOVA using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0a (GraphPad Software).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>In ovo experiments</title><p>Control and CHARGE floating spheres at day seven were stained with Vybrant DiI and Vybrant DiO respectively for 6 hr each and were seeded into the same 100 mm Petri dish to make mixture of dual colored NCCs sheet. On day 10 dual-colored NCCs were dissected with a needle as a cluster and transplanted into the dorsal side (top) of the developing neural tube at the hindbrain level of HH stage 8â10 chick embryos. The embryos were incubated for 36 hr, and imaged with an SVZ16 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) stereo microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Time-lapse imaging of transplanted cells during in ovo experiments</title><p>We transplanted control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs into chick embryos, as described above. At 6 hr after transplantation, we started to perform time-lapse imaging as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tabata and Nakajima, 2003</xref>). Briefly, transplanted chick embryos were placed on a Millicell-CM membrane (pore size, 0.4 Î¼m; Millipore) and cultured in saline, which is described below. The dishes were then mounted onto a confocal microscope (FV1000, Olympus Optical). Approximately, 20 optical Z-section images were acquired at an interval of 5 Î¼m every 15 min, and all focal planes (100 Î¼m) were merged. Individual cells were manually tracked using the Manual Tracking plugin of the Fiji software (1.48).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have decided to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-conducted and relevant study modeling the CHARGE syndrome with induced pluripotent stem cells. The results suggest for the first time an exciting functional phenotype of neural crest cells from CHARGE patients. They observed a migratory deficit consistent with the patient phenotype making this study a very promising line of work. The reviewers agree that this study is potentially interesting and appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the paper needs additional analyses to study cell migration as well as better controls and numbers to guarantee significance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The characterization of the migratory/dispersion phenotype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is not convincing. The image quality in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is inadequate. The authors only show a movie of control cells, but none of CHARGE cells which would be needed to evaluate the CHARGE phenotype.</p><p>2) Analysis of dispersion needs to be improved. The ratio of cell number with non-attached neighboring cells is not appropriate for quantification as it depends on the number of cells analyzed, the perimeter of the cell cluster, etc. Distance to the closer neighbor expressed as a ratio between t0 and tn, using Delaunay triangulation would be a better measure. They should also analyze other parameters like cell speed, persistence, cell area, time of contact etc.</p><p>3) The trans-well assay employed to study cell motility is not ideal, as it is prone to several artifacts (e.g. differential adhesion, differential proliferation, etc.). Time-lapse imaging of individually migrating cells is the most direct assay for cell motility. This analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. But why is there a continuous increase in cell velocity? This is an important observation that needs to be investigated further. Cell velocity is a cell property that can be affected by external stimulus of by cellular activities; therefore if the external and internal conditions of a cell are stable, the velocity should be constant. If the conditions are changing, it won't be possible to compare two cell populations (control and CHARGE cells).</p><p>4) The transplantation experiments to study cell migrating in vivo are interesting, but the analysis is not adequately performed. Time lapse movies and analysis of cell motility in vivo should be performed.</p><p>5) The authors show one control and two CHARGE syndrome iPSC lines but these are not isogenic. Can they rule out possible allelic variations? To address this, the authors should either increase the numbers of control and CHARGE lines to a minimum of 3 lines each to be statistically conclusive or prepare an isogenic control.</p><p>6) The global gene expression studies are convincing and provide some discussion on possible involvement of altered genes and pathways. However no further verification/ confirmation has been made. This would greatly enhance this paper.</p><p>7) To corroborate the migratory phenotype, they should include further analysis of intracellular filaments/focal adhesion/integrin machinery to suggest molecular culprits of the migratory phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21114.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The characterization of the migratory/dispersion phenotype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is not convincing.

The statistical analysis of increased triangle area between t=0 and t=8h in the control and CHARGE cells revealed a delayed dispersion of cells in CHARGE-spheres. We have added the results of the assay to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B, 4C</xref>, and 4D. We have added the following sentences to the Results section of the revised manuscript to explain the additional dispersion assay using a Delaunay triangulation:</p><p>ââ¦neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-b</xref>). To clarify this difference, we performed a time-lapse analysis of the initial phase of cell dispersion from the sphere. [â¦] Moreover, to determine whether CHARGE iPSC-NCCs have defects in premigratory-to-migratory transition, we analyzed the intercellular contacts of both control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs at Phase 2.

Without the video, it is difficult to understand how CHARGE cells migrate out from a sphere. As shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">2</xref>, at first, cells began to spread out as a continuous monolayer (Phase 1); then, cells at the outermost periphery began to disperse (Phase 2). During Phase 1, cell speed seemed to be dependent on the spreading speed of each sphere, which was especially clear for CHARGE cells. The spreading speed was quite different from sphere to sphere. As such, it was difficult to analyze the spreading speed in this assay. Instead, in the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> of the time-lapse imaging of individually migrating cells, control and CHARGE cells were observed under the same condition, and by measuring the velocity of each cell type, we found defective motility in CHARGE iPSC-NCCs in the present revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding cell persistence, or directionality, cells just moved to the outside of a sphere along with sphere spreading during Phase 1, so directionality was also along the direction of sphere spreading. During Phase 2, as cells at the outermost periphery began to migrate apart, it was a good phase for measuring directionality. However, when CHARGE cells started to migrate away from the spheres, the migrating cells began to leave the observation field. In the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> of the time-lapse imaging of individually migrating control and CHARGE cells under the same condition (in co-culture), we measured the directionality of the cells and found no difference between the control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs.</p><p>Regarding the time of contact, in the beginning of this assay, cells contacted</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>each other because they were all from a sphere. In this assay, we focused on observing how cells spread out from a sphere and began to disperse. When they started to migrate apart from each other (Phase 2), especially for CHARGE cells, many cells left the observation field. Along with the analysis of the scattering assay, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E and 4F</xref>, we could reveal significant persistent intercellular contacts among CHARGE iPSC-NCCs compared with control iPSC-NCCs.</p><p>3) The trans-well assay employed to study cell motility is not ideal, as it is prone to several artifacts (e.g. differential adhesion, differential proliferation, etc.). Time-lapse imaging of individually migrating cells is the most direct assay for cell motility. This analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. But why is there a continuous increase in cell velocity? This is an important observation that needs to be investigated further.

If the conditions are changing, it won't be possible to compare two cell populations (control and CHARGE cells).</p></disp-quote><p>1) The artifacts of differential adhesion and differential proliferation in the transwell assay.</p><p>Per the suggestion of the reviewer comment, we performed adhesion and proliferation assays to determine whether there was a difference between control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs grown onto fibronectin (the extracellular matrix protein we used in the transwell assay).</p><p>Regarding the effect of differential adhesion, we performed a cell adhesion assay to fibronectin and then found no significant difference between the control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Regarding the effect of differential proliferation, we first noted that use of the anti-mitotic drug aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA replication, did not significantly affect the migration rate of NCCs in transwell assay, indicating that proliferation is not significantly contributing to the increased impedance over time, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>. We also performed a BrdU incorporation assay with control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs, and no significant difference was observed, also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>. By these assays, we could conclude that the reduction in the number of migrating CHARGE iPSC-NCCs observed in the transwell assay was not due to reduced proliferation and lower CHARGE iPSC-NCC adherence to fibronectin.</p><p>We consider that the transwell assay with the xCELLigence system is a good tool for monitoring the continuous kinetic record of cell migration and quantifying the defective migration in CHARGE iPSC-NCCs objectively. These results are also supported by the defective cell motility of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs revealed by the single-cell motility analysis, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. We have added the following sentences to the Results section of the present revised manuscript:</p><p>ââ¦cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the reduction in the number of migrating CHARGE iPSC-NCCs was due to reduced proliferation, we treated control iPSC-NCCs with an antimitotic, aphidicolin. [â¦] Taken together, these results suggest that CHARGE iPSC-NCCs exhibit aberrant migration, in contrast with their preserved capacity for proliferation and adherence to fibronectin.â</p><p>2) A continuous increase in cell velocity in the time-lapse imaging of individually migrating cells.</p><p>As mentioned by the reviewer comment, we have observed a continuous increase in cell velocity in both control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs. We are not sure what causes the continuous increase in cell velocity, but the phenomenon has been observed in multiple independent experiments. This effect (progressive increase of velocity over time) has not been reported in the literature regarding neural crest cells. Recently it was reported that a continuous increase in cell velocity of metastatic human sarcoma and carcinoma cells was observed in vitro as the cell density increases (Jayatilaka et al., 2017). Even though we didn't observe such cell density increase during the assay, there is some possibility that autocrine/paracrine signaling may cause a continuous increase in cell velocity. Although the reason is unknown, it should be emphasized that the control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs were recorded while in co-culture so that they encountered the same condition. We explicitly stated that the velocity increased over time, and have added the following sentences to the Results and Discussion sections of the present revised manuscript:</p><p>ââ¦iPSC-NCCs. To exclude cell-density effects, we analyzed the motility of mixed iPSC-NCCs, i.e., control + CHARGE, within the same well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6.A</xref>). The tracking of individual iPSC-NCCs revealed that the average velocities progressively increased over the course of the recording period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Notably,..â</p><p>âThird, a spontaneous motility assay allowed us to assess whether defective motility is a partial cause of the defective migration of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). [â¦] The observed spontaneous defective motility of the CHARGE cells suggests that such soluble factors are not involved in the defective migration of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs.â</p><p>* Jayatilaka, H., Tyle, P., Chen, J.

Besides, due to the movements of the developing chick embryos, capturing and tracking the implanted cells over a significant period of time after the initial phase were revealed to be extremely difficult. Therefore, we limited the observation time-window to the first 6 hours after transplanted cells started to migrate. We provided a representative time-lapse movie as an illustration of the defective migration of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs transplanted in ovo compared with control cells. We manually tracked individual migratory control and CHARGE cells in an embryo over time using ImageJ, and revealed significant reduced cell velocity in CHARGE in ovo using total nine embryos by two-way ANOVA (time, and cell type). Along with the analysis of cell motility in vivo with time-lapse movies, we think that our scoring system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> reflects faithfully the biological events: while the control NCCs exhibited superior behavior compared with the CHARGE NCCs in some embryos, there were also some embryos where both cell types behaved similarly. Whether this variability is a reflection of the extent of a malformation observed in CHARGE patients is unknown.</p><p>We have added a representative time-lapse video to <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7âvideo 1</xref>, the following images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>, and the following sentences to the Results section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>ââ¦transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).First, to examine the serial migration of the transplanted cells, we transferred the transplanted embryo to a glass-bottomed plate (IWAKI) 6 h after transplantation and then acquired time-lapse images every 20 min (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7âvideo 1</xref>).

Can they rule out possible allelic variations? To address this, the authors should either increase the numbers of control and CHARGE lines to a minimum of 3 lines each to be statistically conclusive or prepare an isogenic control.</p></disp-quote><p>Per the suggestion of the comment, we added several lines to the control and CHARGE groups to meet the minimum of 3 lines per group for obtaining statistically conclusive evidence of the defective migration of CHARGE iPSC-NCCs.

Sometimes we failed to induce a sufficient number of iPSC-NCCs to analyze, so we always maintained several iPSC lines and differentiated NCCs from them. As such, the line # combinations are not the same for each migration analysis. However, we obtained similar results from each cell line combination, and we think that these results accurately reflect the biological events.

The defective motility of the CHARGE iPSC-NCCS observed in this assay is compatible with the results from the transwell migration assay, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. The transwell migration assay was performed with 4 control lines and 5 CHARGE lines.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>âsource data 1 (in vivo migration assay): We used 3 control lines (WD39, 201B7, 1201C1) and 3 CHARGE lines (CH1#25, CH2#1, CH2#16).

The genomic regions were determined by the NCC-specific enhancer regions identified using the same NCC differentiation method we used in this paper (Method B), as previously described (Rada-Iglesias et al., 2012).

However, we couldnât see any difference between control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs regarding either the intensity of immunoreactivities, or the patterns of staining (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). It thus seems necessary to perform specific assays to reveal subtle differences between control and CHARGE-NCCs regarding the mechanism involved in the defective migration of CHARGE-NCCs.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21114.030</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21114-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>In line with this idea, we have thereafter examined the cell surface expression of integrins alpha4 and beta1, which are especially relevant to interactions with fibronectin. FACS analysis has revealed a tendency to a reduction in surface intensities of both integrins alpha4 and beta1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Strachan et al. have shown that these proteins are particularly important for the migration of cranial NCCs onto fibronectin (Strachan and Condic, 2003). However, consistent data from the literature suggests that the possibly reduced expression of these integrins would positively affect the velocities of NCCs migration at the relatively high concentrations of fibronectin (10 Âµg/ml) used in our migration assays (transwell and spontaneous single cell motility). On the contrary, CHARGE iPSC-NCCs exhibited reduced migration capabilities compared to control iPSC-NCCs in these conditions, indicating that the modulation of surface integrin expression is not likely to be involved in the defective migration of CHARGE NCCs.</p><p>According to such a situation, we did not include these results in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21114.031</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The results of flow cytometric analysis of control and CHARGE iPSC-NCCs from method-B (control; red line, CHARGE; blue line).</title><p>Isotype controls were used as negative controls (black line).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21114-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>While the differences of immunolocalization of these molecules are not obvious, we could detect that the expression levels of various genes involved in cell adhesion and migration are changed in CHARGE cells by transcriptome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>).
