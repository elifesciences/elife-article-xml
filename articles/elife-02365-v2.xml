Upon plant tissue disruption, these glucosides are hydrolyzed to a reactive hydroxynitrile that releases toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Yet many mite and lepidopteran species can thrive on plants defended by cyanogenic glucosides. The nature of the enzyme known to detoxify HCN to β-cyanoalanine in arthropods has remained enigmatic. Here we identify this enzyme by transcriptome analysis and functional expression. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the gene is a member of the cysteine synthase family horizontally transferred from bacteria to phytophagous mites and Lepidoptera. The recombinant mite enzyme had both β-cyanoalanine synthase and cysteine synthase activity but enzyme kinetics showed that cyanide detoxification activity was strongly favored. Our results therefore suggest that an ancient horizontal transfer of a gene originally involved in sulfur amino acid biosynthesis in bacteria was co-opted by herbivorous arthropods to detoxify plant produced cyanide.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02365.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02365.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02365.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hydrogen cyanide is a poison that is deadly for most forms of life.

Cyanogenesis is one of the most ancient and widespread of these defenses, and more than 2500 plant species are known to synthesize cyanogenic glucosides and cyanolipids as phytoanticipins (constitutive defense compounds present in the plant prior to herbivore attack). Upon tissue disruption by herbivore feeding, cyanogenic glucosides are degraded by the plant β-glucosidases and α-hydroxynitrile lyases, which results in the release of toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and other toxic products such as their aglycones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gleadow and Woodrow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poulton, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spencer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zagrobelny et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The released cyanide is a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and has a disruptive effect on various metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Solomonson, 1981</xref>), thus providing a broad defense against generalist herbivores.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02365.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the cysteine biosynthesis pathway in Metazoa (purple) and Plants/Bacteria (blue), the release of HCN during plant cyanogenesis (green) and the main HCN detoxification pathway in arthropods (red).</title><p>The two reactions catalyzed by the gene product of the <italic>Tu-CAS</italic> gene are marked by an orange background and are indicated by CYS and CAS.

A well-documented case of co-evolution is found in insect lepidopteran specialists that sequester the ingested cyanogenic glucosides in their own defense against predators. Remarkably, cyanogenic compounds have become so crucial for some species such as burnet moths (Zygaenidae) that they not only sequester, but also synthesize these compounds de novo by convergent evolution of the biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jensen et al., 2011</xref>). Next to sequestration, other mechanisms have evolved to cope with the toxic effects of HCN, such as avoiding the ingestion of cyanogenic compounds or detoxifying HCN upon plant release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Despres et al., 2007</xref>). In animals, HCN is thought to be detoxified by two main pathways. The enzyme rhodanese converts cyanide into thiocyanate, but this biochemical reaction is not very common and thought to be inefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beesley et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Nahrstedt, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Long and Brattsten, 1982</xref>). Alternatively, the conversion of HCN and cysteine into β-cyanoalanine and sulfide has been suggested as the main detoxification pathway in arthropods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This is supported by several biochemical surveys showing a correlation between β-cyanoalanine synthesis and HCN exposure in lepidopteran species tolerant to HCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyers and Ahmad, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stauber et al., 2012</xref>). However, the enzyme that catalyzes this crucial reaction in arthropods has not been identified to date. The conversion of HCN into β-cyanoalanine by an enzyme called β-cyanoalanine synthase (CAS) has been best studied in bacteria and plants that need to protect themselves from HCN during the synthesis of cyanogenic glucosides or ethylene. The enzymes responsible for CAS activity also have cysteine synthase activity (CYS) and are referred to as CYS or CAS depending on their substrate specificity. CYS catalyzes the conversion of <italic>O</italic>-acetylserine into cysteine, an essential final step in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway unique for plants and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonner et al., 2005</xref>). Animals synthesize cysteine by a different pathway and use related enzymes such as cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CGL), which form together with CAS and CYS a group of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate dependent enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Finkelstein et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Here we identify the enzyme responsible for detoxification of cyanide to β-cyanoalanine in a spider mite and show that this enzyme is horizontally acquired from bacteria and is also widely distributed in Lepidoptera.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptional response of the spider mite <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic> to a cyanogenic host plant</title><p>In order to gain a better insight into arthropod defenses against plant cyanogenesis, we used the two-spotted spider mite <italic>T. urticae</italic> as a generalist herbivore model in a host plant adaptation experiment. This species is one of the most polyphagous arthropod pests known to date, and feeds on more than 1100 plant species from more than 140 plant families, including many cyanogenic plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grbic et al., 2011</xref>). We transferred a spider mite strain reared on acyanogenic bean plants (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>) to a cultivar of <italic>Phaseolus lunatus</italic> containing high levels of well characterized cyanogenic glucosides such as linamarin and lotaustralin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballhorn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wybouw et al., 2012</xref>) and allowed the strain to adapt to this host plant for more than 30 generations.

Within this small set of genes, 18 had an increased expression in the adapted line, while 10 exhibited a lower expression. The most differentially expressed genes after transfer to cyanogenic lima bean encode closely related, small cytoplasmic proteins of unknown function. They were also seen in the transcriptional response after transfer to tomato suggesting that these genes could be part of a broad general stress response of <italic>T. urticae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dermauw et al., 2013</xref>).

The lysine residue (Lys95, <italic>Glycine max</italic> CAS numbering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yi et al., 2012</xref>) that forms a Schiff base linkage to the cofactor pyridoxal-5′-phosphate was also conserved in arthropods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the <bold><italic>Tu-CAS</italic></bold> sequence was derived from contaminating bacterial DNA, we examined its position in the <italic>T. urticae</italic> genome into more detail. <italic>Tu-CAS</italic> is located on a 3 Mb large scaffold (scaffold 10) and is flanked by typical eukaryotic genes, <italic>tetur10g01550</italic> and <italic>tetur10g01580</italic>. Both genes contain introns with splice sites confirmed by EST or RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grbic et al., 2011</xref>, GenBank: LIBEST_025606, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). <italic>Tetur10g01580</italic> encodes a nudix hydrolase (CDD: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cddsrv.cgi?uid=cl00447">cl00447</ext-link>) highly similar to other arthropod nudix hydrolases (BLASTp hits with E-value &lt;1e<sup>−45</sup>). To rule out that the linkage of <italic>Tu-CAS</italic> to these spliced genes is a genome assembly artefact, we took several independent genomic approaches. First, we remapped the <italic>T. urticae</italic> Sanger reads used for the genome assembly of the London strain of <italic>T. urticae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grbic et al., 2011</xref>) and examined the Illumina read coverage of the <italic>Tu-CAS</italic> region in two re-sequenced strains (EtoxR and Montpellier) that are geographically distinct from the London strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grbic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van Leeuwen et al., 2012</xref>). Neither Sanger nor Illumina-reads revealed any inconsistencies in the <italic>Tu-CAS</italic> region in any of these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Second, using a PCR approach, we amplified a 6 kb genomic region bracketing <italic>Tu-CAS</italic> with the surrounding spliced genes (<italic>tetur10g01550</italic> and <italic>tetur10g01580</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using a similar strategy we also amplified a 6 kb region in the closely related spider mite <italic>T. evansi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and a nucleotide dot plot between the amplified region of these two species showed clear synteny and the absence of discontinuity around the <italic>CAS</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This would not be expected by bacterial contamination of either genome. Last, gene compositions of <italic>T. urticae</italic> and bacteria were analyzed by determining both the GC-content at the synonymous third codon position (GC3) and the overall GC-content (GC) of the genes to look if amelioration occurred. Amelioration is the process by which the DNA composition of the newly acquired gene becomes homogenized to match the composition of the recipient genome (all genes in the recipient genome are subject to the same mutational processes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lawrence and Ochman, 1997</xref>). Indeed, the GC/GC3 content of <italic>Tu-CAS</italic> was most similar to the GC/GC3 content of genes from the <italic>T. urticae</italic> genome, and quite distinct from the GC/GC3 content of genes (including the <italic>CYS/CAS</italic> genes) from the three annotated bacterial genomes in the closest sister clade to the apparent monophyletic arthropod clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

We have shown here that the two-spotted spider mite increases transcript levels of a horizontally transferred β-cyanoalanine synthase upon adaptation on cyanogenic bean. Phylogenetic evidence alone does not constitute strong evidence for horizontal gene transfer (HGT), because in the absence of introns in the sequence, a contamination of the mite genome sequence with a sequence from a bacterial symbiont or commensal cannot be excluded. However, the results of mite genomic analysis, codon amelioration, synteny and genomic PCR, combined with the phylogenetic evidence, unambiguously prove that <italic>T. urticae CAS</italic> has a bacterial origin and was laterally transferred and incorporated into the mite genome prior to the divergence in the Tetranychidae. A homologous lateral gene transfer has also occurred in Lepidoptera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) raising the question of the time and number of HGT events needed to explain the phylogenetic pattern of distribution of the <italic>CYS/CAS</italic> genes. Several hypotheses can be discussed. (a) A single HGT to a common ancestor of mites and insects, followed by selective losses resulting in the present phylogenetic distribution. The broad sampling of arthropod species that revealed the absence of any <italic>CYS/CAS</italic>-like sequence (even as a distant recognizable trace) argues against the origin of the gene in the common ancestor of tetranychid mites and Lepidoptera, followed by multiple independent losses. These losses would have to be numerous: seven in the hexapods (Trichoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera/Strepsiptera, Hemiptera/Heteroptera/Thysanoptera/Phthiraptera, Orthoptera, Odonata/Ephemeroptera) and six further in other arthropods (Copepoda/Branchiopoda, Myriapoda, Aranea, Scorpiones, Metastigmata and Mesostigmata). This figure of 13 losses is an absolute minimum that implies that the loss occurred each time at the origin of the lineage, that is before any speciation beyond the point of coalescence. A loss later in the history of each lineage would rapidly increase the total number of losses. We strongly believe that this hypothesis is not parsimonious, and therefore that there was no <italic>CYS/CAS</italic> gene in the common ancestor of mites and Lepidoptera. (b) Alternatively, two HGT events might have occurred (one to a mite ancestor, one to a lepidopteran ancestor) or (c) a single HGT from a donor bacterial species, followed by a transfer between a mite and a lepidopteran. These two hypotheses are impossible to distinguish based on the topology of the tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The sampling of bacterial species phylogenetically close to the presumed donor species is too shallow at present. The apparent monophyly of the arthropod <italic>CAS</italic> gene may be due to the fact that both the mite and the insect gene came from very closely related bacteria, but these bacteria are not represented in the tree. A future survey of Proteobacteria likely to be associated with arthropods (directly or through a plant host) may resolve this question by finding several potential bacterial donor species that would invalidate the apparent monophyly (i.e., split the tree at the point of arthropod coalescence). The transfer from a lepidopteran to mite is improbable, because the mite sequence would branch with the closest relative to the lepidopteran donor, rather than being basal. Conversely, we cannot exclude the transfer from a mite to a lepidopteran, as sampling within the Prostigmata is extremely limited. We therefore favor hypothesis (b), with a very old transfer to an ancestral lepidopteran, and a second transfer to an ancestral mite. Current sampling of mite species is insufficient to give a good estimate of time, but we note the absence of a CAS enzyme in Mesostigmata (typically parasitic and predatory mites) and Metastigmata (ticks), and transfer is likely to have occurred after the split of Prostigmata in the Lower Devonian about 400 MYA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dabert et al., 2010</xref>). The hypothesis of multiple transfers is also compatible with the presence of a <italic>CYS</italic>-like sequence in the mealybug <italic>Planococcus citri</italic>, apparently derived from its endosymbiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Husnik et al., 2013</xref>). In that case, the phylogenetic tree clearly distinguishes the HGT event from that under study here.</p><p>In Lepidoptera, the <italic>CAS</italic> gene was subsequently duplicated in <italic>H. melpomene</italic> and <italic>D. plexippus</italic> that have 3 and 2 copies of the gene, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41a">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). The importance of the laterally acquired gene for HCN detoxification in those species was not previously apparent. These species of Papilionoidea, like burnet moths, not only thrive on cyanogenic plants, but have themselves evolved the ability to synthesize cyanogenic compounds de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jensen et al., 2011</xref>) that now have crucial functions in their life history. Cyanogenesis serves in predator defense by releasing HCN, but also stores reduced nitrogen that can be mobilized for chitin synthesis, and plays a role in mate choice by determining the attractiveness of nuptial gifts from male to female partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zagrobelny et al., 2007</xref>). Our results support the early idea that CAS activity is needed for the exploitation of cyanogenic glucosides in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyers and Ahmad, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witthohn and Naumann, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zagrobelny et al., 2008</xref>) whether they are sequestered from the plant, or synthesized de novo. Higher β-cyanoalanine synthase activity in <italic>Spodoptera eridania</italic> than in <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> is related to higher cyanide tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyers and Ahmad, 1991</xref>), and this enzyme activity is widespread in Lepidoptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witthohn and Naumann, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, it was recently shown that specialist pierid butterflies that feed on Brassicales, release equimolar concentrations of HCN upon metabolism of benzylglucosinolates, turning the ‘mustard oil bomb’ into a ‘cyanide bomb’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stauber et al., 2012</xref>). When <italic>Pieris rapae</italic> feeds on a cyanogenic (dhurrin-containing) plant that this species does not normally consume, an increased production of β-cyanoalanine and thiocyanate is observed, thus implicating both a CAS and a rhodanese activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stauber et al., 2012</xref>). It was therefore proposed that the ability of <italic>P. rapae</italic> to metabolize HCN allowed the primary host transfer from Fabales to Brassicales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stauber et al., 2012</xref>). The gene for either CAS or rhodanese has not been identified in arthropods before, and their respective role in detoxification of HCN is not formally demonstrated. There is no close homologue of the known rhodanese (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase) gene in <italic>T. urticae</italic> or in Lepidoptera. However, we identified <italic>Tu-CAS</italic> and functionally demonstrated that the enzyme it encodes converts HCN to β-cyanoalanine in vitro. Such evidence is difficult to obtain in vivo with mites, as it would be difficult to exclude the possibility that a plant or a bacterial enzyme rather than the mite enzyme catalyzes the reaction in vivo. We argue that the presence of the same gene in lepidopteran species that display this activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyers and Ahmad, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stauber et al., 2012</xref>) is strong evidence for the function of the laterally transferred <italic>CAS</italic> gene. It will be of great interest to confirm that the homologous <italic>CAS</italic> genes of Lepidoptera that we identified indeed encode a β-cyanoalanine synthase, and to provide evidence of its protective role against HCN poisoning.</p><p>Next to the detoxification function, the CYS activity acquired after horizontal gene transfer may also have enhanced the sulfur amino acid economy of mites and lepidopterans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To date, nematodes were the only animal species thought to synthesize cysteine independently from methionine by CYS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budde and Roth, 2011</xref>). However, nematode CYS sequences grouped with plants and oomycetes, clearly outside the arthropod-bacterial clade, suggestive of a different origin of CYS between metazoan subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Duplications of <italic>cys</italic> genes were observed in nematodes, and indeed genetic evidence suggests that in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> cyanide resistance is conferred by the <italic>cysl-2</italic> gene, probably encoding an enzyme with CAS activity while <italic>cysl-1</italic> is a classical cysteine synthase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budde and Roth, 2011</xref>). The acquisition of an alternative cysteine biosynthesis route fits into previously documented horizontal gene transfers in <italic>T. urticae</italic> that include a cobalamin-independent methionine synthase gene, genes for carotenoid biosynthesis, as well as laterally acquired genes that likewise respond to host plant change such as intradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases and a cyanase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grbic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wybouw et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dermauw et al., 2013</xref>). The latter encodes an enzyme that decomposes cyanate (CNO<sup>−</sup>), a bacterial or photochemical decomposition product of cyanide, to carbon dioxide and ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wybouw et al., 2012</xref>). This enzyme may serve as a second line of spider mite defense against cyanogenic plants, or alternatively may have a regulatory function in the amino acid and pyrimidine metabolism as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wybouw et al., 2012</xref>). For a polyphagous herbivore, horizontal gene transfer might play an important role in gaining independence from the varying plant nutrients and defense compounds. It remains unclear which reaction (CAS/CYS) of Tu-CAS provides the strongest adaptive advantage, but the CYS activity might be one of the reasons why these horizontally transferred genes have been retained in organisms that are at present not living on cyanogenic plants.</p><p>In conclusion, a horizontal gene transfer from a bacterial ancestor underlies the exploitation of cyanogenic host plants in some arthropod lineages and made the subsequent evolution of a convergent pathway for synthesis of cyanogenic glucosides possible, as shown in burnet moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jensen et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mite strains and host plants</title><p>The London strain of <italic>T. urticae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grbic et al., 2011</xref>) was maintained on acyanogenic <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> L. cv ‘Prelude’.

Reagents were added to the reaction volumes using gastight syringes (Hamilton, series 1700, Gastight, 1750RN, VWR Belgium). Prior to measuring enzyme activity, recombinant Tu-CAS was incubated at 30°C for 10 min in the appropriate reaction buffer containing 500 µM pyridoxal-5′-phosphate.

Each reaction was started by adding 3.75 µg of recombinant protein and was terminated by snap freezing at different time points. No-substrate and no-enzyme controls were included in the analysis.

Five µg of β-cyanoalanine and cysteine were spotted as standards. After drying, the TLC plate was treated with a ninhydrin solution (20 g ninhydrin in 600 ml ethanol) for amino-acid visualization. In this validated TLC set-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshikawa et al., 2000</xref>), cysteine and β-cyanoalanine can be identified both by color and relative mobility (Rf-value). β-cyanoalanine consistently displayed a blue-green color with a Rf value of around 0.8.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, Søren Bak, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission:</p><p>Your paper describes new evidence that supports a scenario of horizontal transfer of a gene encoding CAS/CYS activity from bacteria to <italic>T. urticae</italic>. The horizontally transferred gene has a proposed role in <italic>T. uritcae's</italic> detoxification of cyanide exposure from host plants. In general the external reviewers and the Reviewing editor found much that they liked about this work and recognized its novelty and relevance for a broad scientific audience. The paper appears to be important for our general understanding of the evolution of certain arthropods to colonize host plants that contain cyanogenic glucosides, and might lead to new genomics-enabled discoveries in other systems of plant-arthropod interactions. The paper is well written and easy to follow. The reviewers and the Reviewing editor found the paper convincing in its documentation of a CAS/CYS gene of likely bacterial origin integrated into the <italic>T. urticae</italic> genome. The biochemical characterization of the encoded <italic>T. urticae</italic> CAS/CYS enzyme also appears to be solid, although some additional data are requested to substantiate conclusions of product formation and enzyme kinetic properties (please see below). The reviewers and the Reviewing editor commented on a lack of discussion (or lack of data) to explain the phylogenetic pattern of a limited appearance of the CYS/CAS gene in <italic>T. urticae</italic> and only a relatively small number of Lepidoptera as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. At the least, the Discussion of the paper needs to be substantially revised with a plausible explanation for this observation (please see below). However, if this important question regarding the phylogeny cannot be resolved with a new Discussion, additional data mining or generation of additional supporting data would be required to fill this critical gap in an otherwise interesting story.</p><p>Major issues to address:</p><p>1) To allow the reader to assess enzyme kinetic properties, the K<sub>M</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> values must be shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. V<sub>max</sub> values shown in one of the figures are not very informative.</p><p>2) The text says that products of CAS activity, beta-cyanoalanine, were identified by TLC and LC-MS. The authors refer to Figure 9 for these results. However, Figure 9 only shows TLC data, which may not be sufficiently informative. To support statements of product identification, the LC-MS results must be shown for enzyme products and the authentic standard.</p><p>3) While the results appear to be generally sound, the reviewers and the Reviewing editor did not find a convincing explanation of the phylogenetic distribution of the described horizontally transferred <italic>CAS/CYS</italic> gene in <italic>T. urticae</italic> and only a few Lepidoptera. This point requires a better discussion and potentially additional data to support or explain the phylogenic pattern of distribution of the <italic>CAS/CYS</italic> gene.</p><p>The phylogenies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> suggest that the horizontally transferred gene in the mite and the insects identified share a common ancestor. This is not discussed sufficiently in the text. The fact that this gene is apparently only found in 18 arthropods (of all of those with substantial sequences in public databases) would suggest either a loss of such a gene in most arthropods lineages or more than one independent horizontal gene transfer event in <italic>T. urticae</italic> and the Lepidoptera.</p><p>Although the authors indicate they looked at several insect species for this gene, they do not describe the extent of their search. Did they examine the genomic data available outside of Lepidoptera (e.g., in Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera)? Between insects and arachnids, a common ancestor to this gene might suggest that it was introduced prior to the divergence of insects and arachnids, and therefore may be present (or vestiges thereof) in other insect species. Are there any? If not, does this suggest two separate horizontal gene transfer events? This in silico analysis, and an analysis of the predicted transfer event date based on divergence of the orthologous sequences, would add additional insight into this manuscript.</p><p>After addressing the above questions, the authors should discuss the alternative scenarios of a single vs. multiple horizontal gene transfer event(s) to explain the phylogeny described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and make a well-supported conclusion to this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02365.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) To allow the reader to assess enzyme kinetic properties, the K</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> <italic>and K</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> <italic>values must be shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>. V</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> <italic>values shown in one of the figures are not very informative</italic>.</p><p>The main objective of the enzyme kinetic data was to determine which of the two reactions (cysteine synthesis – CYS and β-cyanoalanine synthesis – CAS) was favored by the Tu-CAS enzyme. For this, a comparison of the specificity constants (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) (a.k.a. second order rate constant) for each reaction was needed. The ratio of specificity constants (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> of CAS activity over k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> of CYS activity) strongly favored CAS activity over CYS activity. As k<sub>cat</sub> is directly proportional to V<sub>max</sub> (k<sub>cat</sub> = V<sub>max</sub>/[E]), the ratio is the same whether V<sub>max</sub> or k<sub>cat</sub> is used. The values given for the ratio of specificity constants are therefore identical and correct whether they are calculated from V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> or k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M.</sub> As the enzyme purity is not known precisely and this would introduce a systematic error, we calculated the V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> ratio for the mite enzyme, as it cancels out the enzyme concentration in the equation. We have updated <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, so it now also includes the K<sub>M</sub> and activity values.</p><p>The paragraph describing the kinetic data has now been amended in the Results section “Biochemical characterization of Tu-CAS”.</p><p><italic>2) The text says that products of CAS activity, beta-cyanoalanine, were identified by TLC and LC-MS. The authors refer to Figure 9 for these results. However, Figure 9 only shows TLC data, which may not be sufficiently informative. To support statements of product identification, the LC-MS results must be shown for enzyme products and the authentic standard</italic>.</p><p>We have measured CAS activity using robust and well validated methods previously used for the bacterial and plant enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendrickson and Conn 1969</xref>; Warrilow and Hawkesford 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamaguchi et al. 2000</xref>; Hatzfeld et al. 2000). These indirect methods are based on the colorimetric determination of sulfide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Siegel 1965</xref>). More directly, we have also shown the enzyme- and time-dependent formation of β-cyanoalanine after separation of reaction mixtures on TLC. This is especially powerful, as it allows the identification of β-cyanoalanine both by Rf value, and by a specific and strong color shift after treatment with a ninhydrin solution. The cyano group of β-cyanoalanine is responsible for a unique deep blue color (as also clear from the standard, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, panel A, BCA standard). Finally, we scrapped the enzymatically produced β-cyanoalanine after separation of reaction mixtures from silica plates, and analyzed it by LC-MS. We showed that the elution time on LC and the characteristic ion of m/z = 113 which is [M-H]<sup>-</sup> of the β-cyanoalanine standard are also found in the enzymatic product. We have added figure panels to illustrate the LC-MS data as requested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> panel B1 and B2).</p><p><italic>3) While the results appear to be generally sound, the reviewers and the Reviewing editor did not find a convincing explanation of the phylogenetic distribution of the described horizontally transferred CAS/CYS gene in T. urticae and only a few Lepidoptera. This point requires a better discussion and potentially additional data to support or explain the phylogenic pattern of distribution of the CAS/CYS gene</italic>.</p><p><italic>The phylogenies in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>suggest that the horizontally transferred gene in the mite and the insects identified share a common ancestor. This is not discussed sufficiently in the text. The fact that this gene is apparently only found in 18 arthropods (of all of those with substantial sequences in public databases) would suggest either a loss of such a gene in most arthropods lineages or more than one independent horizontal gene transfer event in T. urticae and the Lepidoptera</italic>.</p><p><italic>Although the authors indicate they looked at several insect species for this gene, they do not describe the extent of their search. Did they examine the genomic data available outside of Lepidoptera (e.g., in Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera)? Between insects and arachnids, a common ancestor to this gene might suggest that it was introduced prior to the divergence of insects and arachnids, and therefore may be present (or vestiges thereof) in other insect species. Are there any? If not, does this suggest two separate horizontal gene transfer events? This in silico analysis, and an analysis of the predicted transfer event date based on divergence of the orthologous sequences, would add additional insight into this manuscript</italic>.</p><p><italic>After addressing the above questions, the authors should discuss the alternative scenarios of a single vs. multiple horizontal gene transfer event(s) to explain the phylogeny described in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and make a well-supported conclusion to this point</italic>.</p><p>By a first series of BLAST-searches in NCBI databases (nr/nt), Tu-CAS homologues could not be found outside Lepidoptera even though the genomic data of many other arthropods are present in NCBI.
