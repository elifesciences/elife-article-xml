Embryonic development in metazoans is controlled by maternal factors deposited in the egg during oogenesis. Here, we explore maternal role(s) of Caspar (Casp), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of human Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1) originally implicated in host-defense as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling. Maternal loss of either Casp or it’s protein partner, transitional endoplasmic reticulum 94 (TER94) leads to partial embryonic lethality correlated with aberrant centrosome behavior, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and defective gastrulation. Although ubiquitously distributed, both proteins are enriched in the primordial germ cells (PGCs), and in keeping with the centrosome problems, mutant embryos display a significant reduction in the PGC count. Moreover, the total number of pole buds is directly proportional to the level of Casp. Consistently, it’s ‘loss’ and ‘gain’ results in respective reduction and increase in the Oskar protein levels, the master determinant of PGC fate. To elucidate this regulatory loop, we analyzed several known components of mid-blastula transition and identify the translational repressor Smaug, a zygotic regulator of germ cell specification, as a potential critical target. We present a detailed structure-function analysis of Casp aimed at understanding its novel involvement during PGC development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>MZT</kwd><kwd>maternal-to-zygotic transition</kwd><kwd>pindle</kwd><kwd>degradation</kwd><kwd>pole cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG/2018/001218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ratnaparkhi</surname><given-names>Girish S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pratiksha Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMSTAR/2023/SL03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ratnaparkhi</surname><given-names>Girish S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019550</institution-id><institution>Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPARC-1587</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deshpande</surname><given-names>Girish</given-names></name><name><surname>Ratnaparkhi</surname><given-names>Girish S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During <italic>Drosophila</italic> primordial germ cells (PGCs) specification, the centrosome and germplasm are subject to regulation, during the maternal zygotic transition, by Caspar/TER94-dependent degradative pathways that influence PGC determinants.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As a model organism, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, has been instrumental in establishing and advancing several developmental paradigms underlying embryonic development. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has also emerged as a relatively simple yet tremendously useful model, to analyze the underpinnings of the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Medzhitov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). Critically, despite the small size and modest cellular complexity, the insect immune system shares many fundamental traits with the higher vertebrates, including the humoral and innate arms and the dialogue between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hultmark, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, several factors that contribute to the proper functioning of the insect immune system are highly conserved and perform analogous functions across evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoffmann and Reichhart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, almost all the protein components of the insect immune system are highly pleiotropic and involve diverse activities during developmental progression. For example, the Toll class of proteins belonging to a larger family of pattern recognition receptors are essential while mounting robust immune response against the microorganismal invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brennan and Anderson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang and Ligoxygakis, 2006</xref>). The same proteins are also deployed earlier during embryonic patterning and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Govind, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoffmann and Reichhart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Valanne et al., 2011</xref>). Evidently, in several instances, different pathway components or modules used during early development are repurposed to mediate immunity both in the insect and the mammalian context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belvin and Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Govind, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roth, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of early embryonic morphogen, Dorsal, during humoral response in flies is a canonical example of the context-specific and diverse functions of immune system components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Govind, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roth, 2023</xref>). Maternal loss of function of genes involved in Toll/Dorsal signaling affect Dorso-ventral patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belvin and Anderson, 1996</xref>). A nuclear-cytoplasmic gradient of Dorsal, set up by asymmetric Toll signalling establishes cell fate across the Dorsal-ventral axis in the syncytial embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nüsslein-Volhard, 2022</xref>). Pathogenic invasion of insects induces both the humoral and cellular immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belvin and Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams, 2007</xref>). The humoral response consists of the production of antimicrobial peptides by the fat bodies, which serve as a first line of defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belvin and Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Imler and Hoffmann, 2000</xref>). Two Rel family member proteins, Dorsal and Dif, homologous to the mammalian NF-kappa B, induce the expression of defense peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belvin and Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Govind, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchon et al., 2014</xref>). NF-kappa B is essential for differentiating lymphocytes, which engineer the acute-phase response. Altogether, undertaking functional analysis of proteins, in a temporally distinct developmental context, has proven to be highly informative and insightful. Notably, however, thus far, such analysis has focused on only activator proteins. Here, we have investigated the embryonic function of Caspar (Casp), a protein involved in inhibiting the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Casp is an intracellular negative regulator discovered in a genetic screen to identify suppressors of antibacterial immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Flies mutant for <italic>casp</italic> were identified due to their high rates of melanization, an innate immune response that leads to encapsulation of pathogens in the gut and fat body. Interestingly, <italic>casp</italic> mutants isolated in this study were resistant to Gram-negative bacterial infections due to elevated expression of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) diptericin; consequently, infected flies survived longer than their wild-type counterparts. Strikingly, <italic>casp</italic> overexpression inhibited nuclear localization of Rel in response to infection in the fat body. Excess levels of Casp result in the cytoplasmic retention of Rel in its uncleaved, inactive form, presumably due to inhibition of the protease, Dredd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, sequence analysis of Casp indicated a high degree of similarity to the mammalian Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tendulkar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). FAF1 is evolutionarily conserved and was initially discovered as an interactor of Fas, a pro-apoptotic member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chu et al., 1995</xref>). FAF1 also interacts with the components of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) such as the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and Caspase-8 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ryu et al., 2003</xref>). These interactions are mediated by the death effector domains (DED) in FADD and Caspase-8 and the DED-interacting domain (DEDID) in FAF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ryu et al., 2003</xref>). Both ‘loss’ and ‘gain’ of function experiments indicated that FAF1 is crucial in promoting cell death via transduction of the apoptotic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ryu and Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Zio et al., 2008</xref>). FAF1, like its <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog, is a negative regulator of NFκB signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Min-Young et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Park et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>casp</italic> is a maternal effect gene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison between human FAF1 and Casp shows conserved protein domains, which are described in the text.

Consistently, FAF1 harbors a Ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, a UAS domain and a Ubiquitin-like regulatory X (UBX) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the N-terminal UBA domain recruits polyubiquitinated proteins, leading to their accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Song et al., 2009</xref>). The C-terminal UBX domain, on the other hand, interacts with the molecular chaperone, valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) bound to the Npl4-Ufd1 heterodimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schuberth and Buchberger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kloppsteck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ewens et al., 2014</xref>). FAF1 complexed with VCP-Npl4-Ufd1 and polyubiquitinated proteins is known to assist endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). The UAS domain, a domain of unknown function, is involved in interaction with long-chain fatty acids, which is thought to promote the polymerization of FAF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While Casp has a well-established role in the immune response, modENCODE RNAseq and proteomics data suggest that <italic>casp</italic> is also highly expressed in the 0–3 hr old embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casas-Vila et al., 2017</xref>). Consistently, a snapshot of <italic>casp</italic> staining in a high-throughput RNA in situ experiment indicates ubiquitous expression of maternally deposited <italic>casp</italic> in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weiszmann et al., 2009</xref>). We thus wondered if Casp expression in early embryos is functionally relevant for proper developmental progression. To explore the possible developmental function of Casp, we first assessed if Casp function is needed for viability. Analysis of a hypomorphic allele of <italic>casp</italic> demonstrated that Casp is indeed required maternally for embryonic development. Consequently, roughly half of the embryos maternally compromised in <italic>casp</italic>, fail to undergo gastrulation. Furthermore, such embryos display developmental defects including aberrant cytoskeletal network starting from early blastoderm stages. Interestingly, Casp is expressed strongly in primordial germ cells (PGCs). Consistent with the enrichment, maternal reduction of <italic>casp</italic> significantly affects the total number of pole cells. Here, we present an analysis of <italic>casp</italic> function during early embryonic development and its role in the formation and/or specification of PGCs.

Their specification is essential for the development of the germline, which in turn passes genetic information to the next generation. During early embryonic development, PGCs are specified and segregated from somatic cells. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the PGCs are formed in the posterior end of the embryo. As the early embryonic syncytial nuclear division cycles progress, a few nuclei and centrosomes associated with them invade posteriorly localized and anchored pole plasm ahead of the rest of the somatic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raff and Glover, 1989</xref>). The precocious entry of the centrosomes results in the release and microtubule-dependent transport of pole plasm, which is sequestered in newly cellularized PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raff and Glover, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lerit et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the PGCs or the germline stem cell precursors are set aside during early embryogenesis. Moreover, centrosome behavior and dynamics are crucial for proper cellularization and mitotic cell divisions of early germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lerit and Gavis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lerit et al., 2017</xref>).

Evidently, a germ plasm component, Germ-cell-less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cinalli and Lehmann, 2013</xref>) was shown to be necessary for proper separation of daughter centrosomes in the dividing pole buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lerit et al., 2017</xref>).

As can be seen by the comparison shown in the bar graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), in terms of the rescue of PGC numbers, deletion of the UBA domain does not affect the rescuing activity of the Casp protein, the UBX domain deletion can rescue, but is weaker than the UBA domain deletion, whereas deletion of the UAS domain is the least effective with regards to the rescue.</p><p>To extend these observations, we overexpressed individual Casp deletion mutants in an otherwise wild-type background and counted the total number of PGCs. Neither the maternal overexpression of <italic>pUASp-casp<sup>wt</sup></italic> nor any of the <italic>pUASp-casp<sup>Δ</sup></italic> increased lethality in terms of decrease in hatching of embryos, in all cases the hatching was in the range 90–95%. Again, as seen before, overexpression of <italic>casp<sup>wt</sup></italic> under these conditions led to a significant increase in the total number of PGCs in blastoderm embryos, with average PGC’s at 40. The ability to enhance the PGC division is retained in the absence of the UBA domain as, in this particular background, the mean count of the total number of germ cells was similar to embryos that expressed full-length protein. By contrast, deletion of the UAS domain is unable to support the (increased) germ cell division, and the total PGC count dropped to the same level as <italic>nos Gal4</italic> embryos. Interestingly, deletion of UBX domain, yet again, displayed intermediate activity, with the <italic>ΔUBX-ΔUBA</italic> domain deletion also being unable to drive the increase in PGCs.</p><p>Proteomic analysis of the embryonic extracts suggested that in addition to TER94 protein, Casp is also associated with VAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tendulkar et al., 2022</xref>). We thus sought to test if physical interaction between Casp and VAP is relevant for pole cell formation. To assess this possibility, we used a deletion variant of Casp, Casp<sup>∆FFAT</sup>, which cannot interact with VAPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tendulkar et al., 2022</xref>). Expression of <italic>casp<sup>∆FFAT</sup></italic> under the control of maternal driver, in a <italic>casp<sup>lof</sup></italic>/Df mother showed hatching (~60%) frequencies at par with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>), with expression levels equal to other <italic>casp</italic> constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, <italic>nos-Gal4-</italic>dependent maternal overexpression <italic>of UAS-casp<sup>∆FFAT</sup></italic> led to an increase in the total number of PGCs in syncytial blastoderm embryos, comparable to full-length <italic>UAS-casp<sup>wt</sup></italic> (average PGC ~23). Lastly, expression of <italic>casp<sup>∆FFAT</sup></italic> could rescue the PGC loss upon maternal loss of <italic>casp</italic> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> F1-3 to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). These data suggested that interaction between Casp and VAP is either not essential or partially redundant for Casp function in the context of determining PGC. Altogether, the functional analysis of different protein domains within Casp underscores the importance of UAS and UBX domains, especially in embryonic contexts, including PGC development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Proper development of biological systems in an organismal context involves complex interactions between various individual pathways. The qualitative nature of the interaction(s) between pathway components ultimately determines how different pathways intersect in a context-specific manner. Curiously however, there are only a defined number of signaling pathways/circuits that have been elucidated thus far. Consistently, the entire molecular cassettes that constitute a given pathway or a select number of pathway components, are reiteratively used in a variety of biological contexts even within a lifecycle of the same organism. Moreover, while such repurposing is relatively frequent, the corresponding biological outcomes are diverse in nature and insightful in ways more than one. Our data detailing the functional involvement of Casp and TER94 in the PGCs is a case in point. Casp function was initially characterized in the context of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). However, the original study did not investigate the developmental roles of Casp and its interactors. Here, we report novel activities of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> immune components Casp and TER94 during early embryonic development with a specific focus on germline.</p><p>Early embryonic patterning is a dynamic process in metazoans which is primarily regulated by the deposition of maternal gene products including RNAs and proteins. Such maternal determinants are localized in a spatially restricted manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schier, 2007</xref>). On many instances, the unique pattern of localization of specific factors underlies their activities during embryo patterning. To execute their functions properly, patterning determinants heavily rely upon the members of the housekeeping machinery that carefully calibrate the synthesis, stability, transport, and degradation of diverse regulatory components. Here, we have explored novel embryonic functions for the FAF1 ortholog, Casp in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Initially, we uncovered that maternal loss of <italic>casp</italic> activity results in partially penetrant embryonic lethality. The <italic>casp</italic> allele was determined to be a strong loss of function, but not a null. The partial penetrance could also be due to redundancy. Consistent with either possibility, quantitation of the individual phenotypes yielded significant but variable penetrance.</p><p>Our data demonstrate Casp’s involvement during cellular movements that lead to gastrulation, a likely cause underlying the lethality. Surprisingly, Casp protein is enriched in the PGCs, which are specified at the posterior pole under the control of the master germ cell determinant, Oskar. PGC formation and specification in a young <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo depends on the posteriorly anchored specialized cytoplasm (or pole plasm) enriched in RNA and protein components essential to determine germ cell identity and behavior. Two important traits distinguishing early pole cells from the surrounding somatic nuclei include precocious budding and limited mitotic self-renewal. Consistent with its functional involvement in both these processes, maternal loss of either Casp or its protein partner TER94 resulted in a reduced number of buds and subsequent loss of PGCs. While qualitatively similar, the severity of phenotypic consequence due to loss of Casp and TER94 regarding PGC loss, is not identical. Interestingly, however, both proteins appear to influence centrosome behavior and dynamics that are of paramount significance in forming pole cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos.</p><p>Thus far, Germ cell-less (Gcl) is the only protein shown to control PGC formation in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jongens et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cinalli and Lehmann, 2013</xref>). Importantly Gcl activity depends on its ability to influence proper separation of centrosomes and elaboration of astral microtubules in dividing pole buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lerit et al., 2017</xref>). Aberrant centrosome behavior in <italic>gcl</italic> mutant embryos adversely affects PGC budding and equitable distribution of germ plasm among daughter cells. Intriguingly, these phenotypic traits can be recapitulated by simply engineering defective centrosome separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lerit et al., 2017</xref>). It is thus noteworthy that maternal loss of Casp and TER94 leads to similar defects and future experiments will reveal mechanistic details underlying roles of these two proteins in regulating centrosome dynamics in PGCs and their possible interaction with Gcl and its protein partners. Of note, a germplasm interactome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thomson et al., 2008</xref>) included TER94 along with other important germ plasm proteins including Vasa, Tudor, and others.</p><p>TER94, an ER protein, is a major Casp interactor. Our data also indicate that in addition to PGC formation, TER94 and Casp regulate early nuclear division cycles in syncytial blastoderm embryos and subsequent cell divisions in the somatic compartment cell cycle processes in the gastrulating embryos. (Casp and TER94 are distinct compared to Gcl in this regard which has a strictly germ-cell-specific function). Taken together, these observations suggest that Casp and TER94 contribute to critical early developmental functions leading to mid-blastula transition which precedes gastrulation and germband extension. In the mammalian context, the FAF1-VCP interaction is mediated by the UBX domain. Thus, it is unsurprising that deletion of the protein domain crucial for association between Casp and TER94 resulted in a somewhat diminished function as compared to a full-length version. Curiously however, deleting UAS fragment, a protein domain of unknown function, implicated in self-association, resulted in substantially compromised activity as compared to native protein. Future experiments will focus on the specific molecular interactions this (and other) individual domain(s) are involved in. It will be also important to determine how protein degradation especially engineered via ubiquitin modification contributes to Casp stability and function.</p><p>Intriguingly, our data also argue that regulation mediated by <italic>casp</italic> is likely critical for maintenance of PGC fate via maintenance of Oskar levels. Importantly, several independent observations suggest that this influence is likely zygotic. First, barely detectable amount of Casp protein is deposited in the egg and bulk of the Casp protein is generated by translation post-fertilization. Second, Casp protein controls overall levels of Smaug at the post-transcriptional level including in the early embryonic PGCs. It was recently reported that Smaug protein accumulates in the germ granules where it controls Oskar (and Bruno) translation negatively by binding to Smaug response elements present in the untranslated regions within the respective RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Siddiqui et al., 2023</xref>). Consistently loss of function mutations in <italic>Smaug</italic> result in a modestly elevated PGC count in stage 4–5 embryos whereas a reciprocal phenotype is observed in <italic>casp<sup>lof</sup></italic> embryos. Taken together with the increase in Smaug levels in <italic>casp<sup>lof</sup></italic> embryos, it would be reasonable to propose that PGC-specific phenotypes observed upon loss of <italic>casp</italic> are, in part, mediated by excess accumulation of Smaug. Moreover, these authors also suggest that Smaug dependent regulation of <italic>oskar</italic> RNA likely has a significant zygotic i.e. embryonic component which aligns well with our data. Future experiments will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism underlying regulation of Smaug levels by Casp. It will also be interesting to examine if Smaug and Casp regulate centrosome behavior reciprocally to control the final PGC count.</p><p>Degradation of maternally deposited RNAs and proteins constitutes an important transition during embryonic development. Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) and turning over of maternal determinants (both RNAs and proteins) happen almost simultaneously. Together these two events constitute MZT which is delayed in the germ cell compartment as opposed to soma. Nonetheless, recent data have suggested that the two events possibly occur in a coordinated manner possibly via shared components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colonnetta et al., 2023</xref>). Many of the embryonic phenotypes that <italic>casp<sup>lof</sup></italic> embryos display (aberrant nuclear migration, cellularization defects, defective gastrulation etc.), are shared by mutations in gene products either directly or indirectly involved in one of these processes. It will be important to elucidate new interactors of Casp as its function likely impacts protein degradation and/or stability of the target proteins. Recent reports have indicated potential involvement of ZGA regulators such as Zelda and CLAMP in germline/soma distinction. Critically this function of the components of ZGA depends on proper anchoring, release and transmission of posteriorly anchored pole plasm that involves centrosome function. Maternally compromising ZGA components resulted in inappropriate release and transmission of pole plasm RNAs, a phenotype that is partially recapitulated in <italic>casp<sup>lof</sup></italic> and <italic>TER94i</italic> embryos.</p><p>While our data have clearly established the involvement of Casp and TER94 during PGC formation and specification, further studies will be necessary to elucidate their precise molecular function(s) underlying this activity. Several observations are noteworthy in this regard and will guide the course of future investigation. The first set of results points to the possible participation of both Casp and TER94 during ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.</p><p>A regulatory network incorporating Bru1, Cup, Oskar, and Smaug are key to PGC specification. The Skp Cullin and F-box (SCF) containing complex marks proteins such as Smaug for degradation by functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).

In the <italic>mammalian</italic> context, the Casp/TER94 orthologs FAF1/VCP (in <italic>green</italic> font; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) have been found to interact with the SCF complex.

Oskar also regulates posterior cell fate by regulating <italic>nos</italic> translation which is modulated by Smaug (<italic>ref 8–10;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dahanukar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zaessinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeske et al., 2011</xref>). The SCF complex is a multi-protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and Smaug is one of its prominent targets (<italic>ref 11–12;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2022</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) Casp/TER94 interact with an overlapping set of proteins. TER94 has earlier been demonstrated to be associated with Oskar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ruden et al., 2000</xref>). Our data points to an association between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Casp and TER94 (this study and <italic>ref 17;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tendulkar et al., 2022</xref>) that participates in protein degradation. In a proteomic analysis of germ cell components, TER94 was identified (this study and <italic>ref 18</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thomson et al., 2008</xref>), along with other bona-fide germ cell constituents including Cup, Tral, Bel, eIF4A, Tud and Vasa (<italic>ref 18</italic> and <italic>19</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thomson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeHaan et al., 2017</xref>). Both, Casp and TER94 are thus enriched in the pole cells and interact with proteins that specify PGC fate. (<bold>C</bold>). The SCF Complex, Gcl and Centrosome integrity. The SCF complex is localized to the centrosome. Gcl interacts with Cullin 3 to degrade Torso receptor to promote PGC fate (<italic>ref 20</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pae et al., 2017</xref>). The SCF complex regulates the cell cycle (<italic>ref 21–22</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Margottin-Goguet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rogers et al., 2009</xref>) and is a known regulator of centrosomal integrity (<italic>ref 23–26</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wojcik et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murphy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Phuong Thao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cunha-Ferreira et al., 2009</xref>), thereby influencing PGC specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lerit et al., 2017</xref>). (<bold>D</bold>) Casp and TER94 assist in the degradation of Smaug.

Independent proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thomson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeHaan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tendulkar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) suggest multiple overlaps between Casp/TER94 and germ-cell-specific protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), again suggesting functional relationships between Casp/TER94 and germ cell determinants. In addition, the SCF complex contributes to cell cycle progression and integrity of centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wojcik et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murphy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Phuong Thao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Total PGC count in early embryos depends on centrosome function and efficient mitotic divisions. So SCF complex based degradation may have multiple targets that participate during germ cell formation and specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).</p><p>Casp likely functions as an adapter protein that works in conjunction with the SCF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>) and TER94 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). The binary complex between TER94 and Casp subsequently targets ubiquitinated proteins such as Smaug which are present in a complexed form with other proteins. Homeostatic maintenance of Smaug levels via Casp-mediated proteolytic degradation could explain many of our observations. Consistently, increased Smaug levels, due to diminished Casp function leads to loss of PGCs, whereas <italic>smaug</italic> mutant embryos show the opposite phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Siddiqui et al., 2023</xref>). Intriguingly, even though Smaug and Oskar are members of a complex, the reduction in Casp activity results in the stabilization of Smaug. By contrast, Oskar levels are diminished resulting in loss of PGCs. The mechanism underlying the substrate-dependent divergent activities is not known at this point.</p><p>The similarity between the phenotypic consequences due to loss of ZGA components and Casp/TER94 also needs a special mention. The only study implicating TER94 during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zeng et al., 2014</xref>) suggested that TER94 can potentiate BMP signaling. Interestingly, <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>), a BMP ligand which is one of the important targets of ZGA regulators including <italic>Zelda</italic>, can also influence the specification of embryonic PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colonnetta et al., 2023</xref>). PGCs need BMP signals (Dpp) to maintain their identity. Furthermore, the exposure to BMP signals needs careful calibration as excess BMP signaling in the surrounding soma leads to PGC loss. Importantly, components of protein degradation machinery including those involved in ubiquitination (Smurf, a Ubiquitin ligase) and sumoylation (Ubc9) appear to be involved in fine-tuning the signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deshpande et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it will be of interest to determine if the aberrant germ cell specification observed due to loss of <italic>casp</italic> and the components of BMP signaling pathway is mechanistically connected. This seems especially relevant in the light of their respective dependence on the components of the protein degradation machinery. It will be of considerable interest to investigate whether and how, zygotic activity of Smaug, one of important canonical MBT regulators, fits into this picture. In sum, while the specific details await detailed examination, it is apparent that possible recapitulation of maternal regulation in the zygotic context may be a recurrent theme rather than an isolated anomaly.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry and stocks</title><p>Flies were raised on standard cornmeal agar at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. <italic>Casp<sup>lof</sup></italic> (11373), <italic>Casp Df</italic> (23691), <italic>nos Gal4</italic> (4937), <italic>Mat α4-tubulinGal4:VP16</italic> (7063) and <italic>TER94 RNAi</italic> (32869) lines were procured from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Centre, with numbers in brackets indicated Stock numbers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cloning of <italic>casp</italic> deletion constructs and generation of transgenics</title><p>UASp-casp<sup>Δ</sup> constructs (<italic>pUASp casp<sup>ΔUBA</sup>, pUASp casp<sup>ΔUAS</sup>, pUASp casp<sup>ΔUBX</sup>, pUASp casp<sup>ΔUASΔUBX</sup></italic>) were generated, starting from a <italic>pUASp-attB-Casp</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tendulkar et al., 2022</xref>), with the design including an N-terminal HA tag.

After crosslinking 10 μg Casp antibody, Co-IP was performed as described above. In-gel trypsin digestion was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, Coomassie-stained bands on the gel were excised and cut into 1 mm cubes. Gel pieces were transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube and destained with buffer containing 50% acetonitrile in 50 mM Ammonium bicarbonate. Reduction and alkylation were carried out on the destained gel pieces by incubating with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) followed by incubating with 20 mM iodoacetamide. Gel pieces were saturated with sequencing grade Trypsin (Promega) at a concentration of 10 ng/μl and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted by sequential addition of 100 μl of 0.4% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 10% ACN, 100 μl of 0.4% TFA in 60% ACN and 100 μl of ACN. The pooled extract was dried in a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted with 50 μl of 0.1% TFA. The peptides in TFA were purified using the StageTip protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rappsilber et al., 2007</xref>). LC–MS/MS analysis was performed on the Sciex TripleTOF6600 mass spectrometer interfaced with an Eksigent nano-LC 425. Tryptic peptides (1 μg) were loaded onto an Eksigent C18 trap (5 μg capacity) and subsequently eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient on an Eksigent C18 analytical column (15 cm ×75 μm internal diameter). A typical LC run lasted 2 hr post loading onto the trap at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min with solvent A consisting of water + 0.1% formic acid and solvent B consisting of acetonitrile. The gradient schedule for the LC run was 5% (vol/vol) B for 10 min, a linear gradient of B from 0% to 80% (vol/vol) over 80 min, 80% (vol/vol) B for 15 min and equilibration with 5% (vol/vol) B for 15 min. Data was acquired in an information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode over a mass range of 300–2000 m/z. Each full MS survey scan was followed by MS/MS of the 15 most intense peptides. Dynamic exclusion was enabled for all experiments (repeat count 1; exclusion duration 6 s). Peptides were identified and quantified using the SCIEX ProteinPilot software at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. A RefSeq <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein database (release 6) was used for peptide identification. Proteins that were identified in two or more replicates were tabulated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fixation, immunostaining, and imaging of embryos</title><p>0–3 hr embryos were collected in a sieve and dechorionated in 4% sodium hypochlorite for 90 s. After thorough washes with distilled water, embryos were fixed in a 1:1 heptane:4% PFA solution for 20 min. The PFA layer was removed, and embryos in heptane were re-constituted with an equal volume of methanol. Embryos were devitellinized by vigorous shaking in the 1:1 heptane:methanol mixture. The heptane layer and the interphase containing non-devitellinized embryos were carefully removed. Devitellinized embryos in the bottom methanol phase were washed twice with methanol and stored at –20 °C till they were ready to be imunostained. For phalloidin and Smaug staining, embryos fixed in heptane: 4% PFA were hand de-vitellinized, after which the standard immunostaining procedure was followed. For immunostaining, embryos were rehydrated by washing thrice with 0.3% PBS-TritonX 100 (PBS-T) for 15 min each. Embryos were blocked in 2% BSA in 0.3% PBS-T for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). Embryos were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies diluted in 2% BSA in 0.3% PBS-T at the appropriate dilutions. Following three 15-min washes with 0.3% PBS-T, embryos were incubated in the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 hr at RT.

ROIs were made for a single pole cell through the z-stacks, thereby only analysing one pole cell at a time. For each embryo five such pole cells were measured. To quantify intensity, mean intensity was measured for each ROI per stack and added to get the final intensity. Each data point on the graph represents an average of all five cell intensities per embryo. For Smaug punctae measurement, a combined ROI for each cell was taken and duplicated. Each of the stack was then analysed using 3D objects counter, where thresholding for all images was kept within the range of 80–90 with a minimum size filter kept at zero. The number of objects counted was taken as the total number of Smaug punctae per cell. Five such pole cells were analysed per embryo and the average was plotted as a single data point on the graph. For quantification of poleplasm volume in the embryos, embryos were stained with Oskar. An ROI (kept same for all images) encompassing the posterior part of the embryo was drawn. Gaussian blur 3D (X sigma = 2, Y sigma = 2 and Z sigma = 2) was applied to each image. The volume of pole plasm was analysed by using 3D objects counter after appropriate thresholding.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98584-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included (1) in the manuscript and supplements, including source data for western blots and (2) additional raw data for images, mass spectrometry, and DNA sequencing files are uploaded to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.zs7h44jkf">Dryad</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Hegde</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagh</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Sudhakaran</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><name><surname>Deshpande</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Ratnaparkhi</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Caspar specifies primordial germ cell count and identity in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Supplementary Data)</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.zs7h44jkf</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Stocks obtained from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (NIH P40OD018537) were used in this study; Elmar Wahle and Christiane Rammelt for the kind gift of anti-Tral, anti-Me31B, and anti-Smaug antibodies; Snehal Patil and Yashwant Pawar for fly media and stock maintenance; IISER Microscopy facility, Dr Santosh Podder, and Vijay Vittal, for training and maintenance.

They demonstrate that PGC number, and the distribution of the germ cell determinant Oskar, change as a result of changes in caspar expression; reduction of caspar reduces PGC number and the domain of Oskar protein expression, while overexpression of caspar does the reverse. They also observe defects in syncytial nuclear divisions in embryos produced from caspar mutant mothers. Previous work from the same group demonstrated that Caspar protein interacts with two partners, TER94 and Vap33. In this paper, they show that maternal knockdown of TER94 results in embryonic lethality and some overlap of phenotypes with reduction of caspar, supporting the idea may work together in their developmental roles. The authors propose models for how Caspar might carry out its developmental functions. The most specific of these is that Caspar and its partners might regulate oskar mRNA stability by recruiting ubiquitin to the translational regulator Smaug.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work identifies a new factor that is involved in PGC specification and points toward an additional pathway that may be involved in establishing and maintaining an appropriate distribution of Oskar at the posterior pole of the embryo. It also ties together earlier observations about the presence of TER94 in the pole plasm that have not heretofore been linked to a function.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) A PiggyBac insertion allele casp[c04227] is used throughout the paper and referred to as a loss-of-function allele (casp[lof]). While the authors avoid the terms 'null' or 'amorph' and on one occasion refer to the allele as a 'strong hypomorph', nevertheless terming it a 'loss-of-function' allele is misleading. This is because the phenotype of the allele when homozygous is different from the phenotype produced when heterozygous over a deficiency.</p><p>(2) The peptide counts in the mass spectrometry experiment aimed at finding protein partners for Casp are extremely low, except for Casp itself and TER94. Peptide counts of 1-2 seem to me to be of questionable significance.</p><p>(3) The pole bud phenotypes from TER94 knockdown and casp mutant shown in Fig 5 appear to be quite different. These differences are unexplained and seem inconsistent with the model proposed that the two proteins work in a common pathway. Whole embryos should also be shown, as the TER94 KD phenotype could result from a more general dysmorphism.</p><p>(4) Fig 6 is not quantitative, lacking even a second control staining to check for intensity variation artifacts. Therefore it shows that the distribution of Oskar protein changes in the various genotypes, but not convincingly that the level of Oskar changes as the paper claims.</p><p>(5) The error bars are huge in the graphs in Fig 7H, I, and J, and in fact these changes are not statistically significant. Therefore the conclusion that 'Reduction in Casp activity specifically affects Smaug degradation during the MZT' is not supported by the data in this figure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98584.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigated the role of the Caspar (Casp) gene, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of human Fas-associated factor-1. It revealed that maternal loss of Casp led to centrosomal and cytoskeletal abnormalities during nuclear cycles in Drosophila early embryogenesis, resulting in defective gastrulation. Moreover, Casp regulates PGC numbers, likely by regulating the levels of Smaug and then Oskar. They demonstrate that Casp protein levels are linearly correlated to the PGC number. The partner protein TER94, an ER protein, shows similar but slightly distinct phenotypes. Based on the deletion mutant analysis, TER94 seems functionally relevant for the observed Casp phenotype. Additionally, it is likely involved in regulating protein degradation during PGC specification.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper uncovers a new function of the Casper (Casp) gene, previously known for its role in immune response regulation and NF-kB signaling inhibition. This new function includes nuclear division and PGC formation in early fly embryos. The findings provide crucial insights into how this pathway contributes to the proper establishment of both somatic cells and the germline, particularly in the context of early embryogenesis. This research is therefore of significant interest to cell and developmental biologists.</p><p>Future Research:</p><p>While this study has made significant strides in understanding the role of the Casp gene in early embryogenesis, the functional relationships among molecules shown here (Casp, TER94, Osk) and other genes previously known to regulate these processes remain unclear. This underscores the need for future studies to delve deeper into these relationships and their implications.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98584.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Das et al. discovered a maternal role for Caspar (Casp), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of human Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1), in embryonic development and germ cell formation.

Also, Figures 1B and 1C show that the phenotypes of casp[lof] homozygotes and casp[lof]/Df are not the same; surprisingly, the homozygous phenotypes are more severe.

The <italic>caspc04227</italic> was procured from BDSC, and based on the decrease in lethality of the <italic>casplof/casp(Df)</italic> compared to <italic>casplof</italic>, we assume that second site hits in the <italic>casplof</italic> line are the reason for the enhanced lethality. For this very reason, we have used <italic>casplof/ casp(Df)</italic> for all subsequent experiments. We also conducted rescue experiments wherever possible to confirm the specificity with <italic>caspWT</italic> and various deletion variants of <italic>casp</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) TER94 knockdown phenotypes have been previously published (Zhang et al 2018 PMID 30012668), and their effects on embryonic viability and syncytial mitotic divisions were described there. This paper is inappropriately not cited, and the data in Figure 4 should be presented in the context of what has been published before.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the oversight. Indeed, Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (2018) highlighted TER94 as one of the loci uncovered in their screen and some of the relevant phenotypes are described there. We have referred to their findings at the appropriate junctures as suggested (pg 11, pg13, pg 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The peptide counts in the mass spectrometry experiment aimed at finding protein partners for Casp are extremely low, except for Casp itself and TER94. Peptide counts of 1-2 seem to me to be of questionable significance.</p></disp-quote><p>Peptide counts are indeed low, but the fact that they are enriched at all, in comparison to controls, considering that we are using whole embryo lysates rather than isolated PGC lysates, suggests interaction with Casp could be biologically/ functionally meaningful. The data is restricted to the supplementary material and is not analyzed in isolation; we have combined data from multiple mass spectrometry experiments by other researchers to link Casp to pole plasm components.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The pole bud phenotypes from TER94 knockdown and casp mutant shown in Fig 5 appear to be quite different. These differences are unexplained and seem inconsistent with the model proposed that the two proteins work in a common pathway. Whole embryos should also be shown, as the TER94 KD phenotype could result from a more general dysmorphism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that TER94 KD is a stronger phenotype, with TER94 having essential cell division and patterning roles. In fact, the <italic>TER94</italic> RNAi embryos, unlike <italic>casplof</italic>, stall in terms of their developmental program before Stage 4. This has been noted in the earlier study (Zhang et al., 2018). As a result, we focused on pole bud stage embryos that were rare - but present in the collections. We report that PGC from very early <italic>TER94 RNAi</italic> embryos have fewer pole buds.</p><p>The rationale behind the presumption that these two proteins may work in a common pathway is clear-cut. We have validated the physical interaction using protein lysates from two developmental time points. Satisfyingly, an affinity purification using antibodies against TER94 or Casp invariably enriches the other protein as the primary interacting partner. Our model integrates data from mammalian and fly systems to support the idea that there must be an overlap between TER94/Casp function, with these two proteins working together to engineer the degradation of ubiquitinated Smaug. Future experiments are necessary to confirm and extend this claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 6 is not quantitative, lacking even a second control staining to check for intensity variation artifacts. Therefore, it shows that the distribution of Oskar protein changes in the various genotypes, but not convincingly that the level of Oskar changes as the paper claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that <italic>oskar</italic> RNA localization is also somewhat altered due to change in <italic>casp</italic> levels. We have acknowledged the variability in the various phenotypes, and as such, it is unsurprising that it has also reflected in the Oskar levels. However, it is evident that a statistically significant number of mutant embryos show a decrease in Oskar levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The error bars are huge in the graphs in Figure 7H, I, and J, leading me to question whether these changes are statistically significant. Calculations of statistical significance are missing from these graphs and need to be added.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in the Western blots represents the whole embryo, as the lysates used are from embryos 0-1, 1-2, 2-3 hrs. We have averaged and plotted data from 5 Western blots. The changes are not statistically significant. Even without the statistical significance, the data for Fig. 7I led us to examine Smaug in the pole cells, rather than in the whole embryo. The pole cell data (Fig8-D3) is striking and led to the conclusion – that Smaug protein perdures in the pole cells during the stages of syncytial/cellular blastoderm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) There are many instances of fuzzy and confusing language when describing casp phenotypes. For example, on lines 211-212, it is stated that 'casp[lof] adults are only partially homozygous viable as ~70% embryos laid by the homozygous mutant females failed to hatch into larvae'. Isn't this more accurately described as 'casp[c04227] is a maternal-effect lethal allele with incomplete penetrance'? Another example is on line 1165, what exactly is a 'semi-vital function'?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for reading the manuscript in detail.

It revealed that maternal loss of Casp led to centrosomal and cytoskeletal abnormalities during nuclear cycles in Drosophila early embryogenesis, resulting in defective gastrulation. Moreover, Casp regulates PGC numbers, likely by regulating the levels of Smaug and then Oskar. They demonstrate that Casp protein levels are linearly correlated to the PGC number. The partner protein TER94, an ER protein, shows similar but slightly distinct phenotypes. Based on the deletion mutant analysis, TER94 seems functionally relevant for the observed Casp phenotype. Additionally, it is likely involved in regulating protein degradation during PGC specification.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper reveals an unexpected function of the maternally produced Casp gene, previously implicated in immune response regulation and NF-kB signaling inhibition, in nuclear division and PGC formation in early fly embryos. Experiments are properly conducted and strongly support the conclusion. The rescue experiment using deletion mutant form is particularly informative as it suggests the requirement of each domain function.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Functional relationships among molecules shown here (and other genes known to regulate these processes) are still unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with this assessment. In our view this is an interesting albeit initial report. We also appreciate that understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of these results will be critical. We have ensured that our present claims are backed up by data, however, are fully sensitive to the fact that newer observations will refine or even alter these claims. We are continuing to work on the problem and will hopefully make further inroads in mechanism in the coming years.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Das et al. discovered a maternal role for Caspar (Casp), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of human Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1), in embryonic development and germ cell formation. They find that Casp interacts with Transitional endoplasmic reticulum 94 (TER94). Loss of Casp or TER94 leads to partial embryonic lethality, correlated with aberrant centrosome behavior and cytoskeletal abnormalities. This suggests that Casp, along with TER94, promotes embryonic development through a still unidentified mechanism. They also find that Casp regulates germ cell number by controlling a key determinant of germ cell formation, Oskar, through its negative regulator, Smaug.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the experiments are well-conducted, and the conclusions of this paper are mostly well-supported by data.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Some additional controls could be included, and the language could be clarified for accuracy.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The paper is inconsistent in using standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> nomenclature. Often the name of the mammalian counterpart is used instead. This needs to be cleaned up as it is very confusing to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>The names of the mammalian counterpart are explicitly used, when we intended, to underscore the parallels between mammalian vs <italic>Drosophila</italic> function, specifically in the context of the major players in this study, TER94 vs VCP; Caspar vs FAF1. Since we do not have direct biochemical data indicating that TER94/Casp degrades Smaug, we use published mammalian literature to draw parallels. At no point have we swapped terminology casually.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The Discussion is far too long and in my view extends too far beyond the experimental data in the paper. As a start for editing, its first two paragraphs (lines 1138-1164) include mostly general statements and could be greatly reduced or eliminated.</p></disp-quote><p>Our aim was to emphasize the repurposing of factors between early development and later/adult stages for different functional contexts. Our laboratory (Ratnaparkhi) works on Casp in terms of its roles in NF-kappa B signalling. We serendipitously stumbled on the embryonic lethality while characterizing the <italic>casplof</italic> allele, which, later, led us to examine the function of Casp during embryonic germ cell development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The Introduction is weak in its description of the developmental function of Toll and Dorsal.

Hypomorphic knockdown of TER94 using RNAi is sufficient to induce early embryonic lethality. In fact, Zhang <italic>et. al.</italic>, 2018 et al., using stronger/earlier maternal drivers highlighted the lethality and somatic cell division defects caused due to the severe loss of TER94. The UBX domain is present in multiple proteins, in addition to Casp. TER94 possible plays a vital role in protein degradation of critical cell cycle proteins, such as cyclins that need to be degraded for efficient genomic duplications in the 10’ nuclear division cycles that predominate the first few hours of embryogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>N = 3 (Fig1 legend) and N = 15 (Fig2).

Since TER94 has been implicated in Osk mRNA localization (Ruden et al., 2000), this would be a good control to include.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned earlier, in the response to editors, data presented in our manuscript indicates that Caspar is unique in its ability to regulate both Oskar levels and centrosome dynamics. As the reviewer pointed out, we are in the process of analysing the possible localization defects in <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA in the embryos. Since the preliminary data are promising, we are pursuing this carefully to better understand the involvement of Caspar. We are focusing on the ability of Caspar to regulate early nuclear divisions prior to pole cell formation. It is possible that in <italic>casp</italic> mutant embryos the nuclei/centrosomes that enter the pole plasm are already defective and thus can influence release of the pole plasm components. This needs to be examined carefully, and we are conducting these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Western Blot for Osk Protein: It would also be beneficial to perform a western blot for Osk protein to demonstrate that it is indeed increased upon Casp overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. However, Oskar antibodies are not readily available, and we have a very limited supply which have been used for embryo staining experiments. We considered these more useful as in addition to the absolute levels, staining experiment can reveal localization pattern. It was thus possible to correlate Oskar function with the pole cell counts in respective genetic backgrounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Title Clarification: The title states, &quot;Caspar determines primordial germ cell identity in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.&quot; The current experiments do not show that Casp determines germ cell identity.
