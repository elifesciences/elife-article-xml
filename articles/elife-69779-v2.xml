Despite the importance of this faculty of the mind, the neural mechanisms of value assignments, and how choices are directed by them, remain obscure. To investigate this problem, we used a classic measure of utility maximization, the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference, to quantify internal consistency of food preferences in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a nematode worm with a nervous system of only 302 neurons. Using a novel combination of microfluidics and electrophysiology, we found that <italic>C. elegans</italic> food choices fulfill the necessary and sufficient conditions for utility maximization, indicating that nematodes behave as if they maintain, and attempt to maximize, an underlying representation of subjective value. Food choices are well-fit by a utility function widely used to model human consumers. Moreover, as in many other animals, subjective values in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are learned, a process we find requires intact dopamine signaling. Differential responses of identified chemosensory neurons to foods with distinct growth potentials are amplified by prior consumption of these foods, suggesting that these neurons may be part of a value-assignment system. The demonstration of utility maximization in an organism with a very small nervous system sets a new lower bound on the computational requirements for utility maximization and offers the prospect of an essentially complete explanation of value-based decision making at single neuron resolution in this organism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>neuroeconomics</kwd><kwd>subjective value</kwd><kwd>chemosensation</kwd><kwd>foraging behavior</kwd><kwd>transitivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH051383</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lockery</surname><given-names>Shawn R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM129576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lockery</surname><given-names>Shawn R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A worm with a nervous system of only 302 neurons satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for value-based decision making.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the primary functions of the brain is to make decisions that maximize a person’s <italic>welfare</italic>. Welfare, meaning satisfaction of needs and desires, is subjective, based on values the individual assigns idiosyncratically to goods and outcomes. Can welfare maximization nevertheless be investigated in objective terms? One solution to this problem is revealed preference theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Samuelson, 1938</xref>) which identifies the patterns of behavior, observable as such, that are necessary and sufficient evidence that subjects are choosing in ways consistent with welfare maximization or, in economic terminology, <italic>utility maximization</italic>. These patterns have been defined mathematically by the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Houthakker, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afriat, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Varian, 1982</xref>). Previous studies have utilized GARP to quantify utility maximization in children and adults under a variety of economic and physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harbaugh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreoni and Miller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burghart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lazzaro et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>GARP is significant for decision neuroscience because it provides a definitive behavioral test for utility maximization, or its absence. This test can be applied to almost any organism that makes choices between desirable goods that incur costs. The basic concept underlying this axiom is that a maximizing agent’s choices must be internally consistent. If a person is observed to prefer X over Y when both are available then, other things being equal, this person should not also prefer Y over X, a pattern that is obviously inconsistent. Furthermore, internal consistency must extend to preferences revealed indirectly, through transitivity. For example, a persons observed to choose X over Y and Y over Z, have indirectly revealed that they would choose X over Z. If instead Z is chosen over X, then their decision making cannot be an instance of goal-directed maximization in any significant sense of the term. The number and severity of GARP violations (assuming the chooser is motivated to maintain or improve his or her welfare), has been taken as a measure of cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Camille et al., 2011</xref>). In humans and non-human primates, it can also be correlated with physical variables such as neuroanatomy and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pastor-Bernier et al., 2019</xref>). These studies reveal the range of insights that can be gained by combining revealed preference theory and neuroscience.</p><p>To our knowledge, however, tests for utility maximization using GARP have yet to be applied to organisms more amenable to mechanistic studies such as mice, zebrafish, fruit flies, and nematodes. A major goal of this study was to determine whether food choices of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a microscopic round worm with a nervous system of only 302 neurons, are consistent with GARP and thus exhibit a form of utility maximization. A positive result would establish a simple experimental system in which neuronal activity correlated with utility could be manipulated both physiologically and genetically to establish behavioral causality. Such a finding would also be interesting from a comparative perspective, extending the domain of utility-based decision making far beyond the boundaries of organisms that are generally considered to have cognition.</p><p>A worm might seem a surprising choice for investigating utility maximization. However, <italic>C. elegans</italic> possesses a sophisticated behavioral repertoire that can be organized into three broad functional categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faumont et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yapici et al., 2014</xref>): (1) maintenance behaviors, such as feeding, defecation, mating, and egg laying; (2) escape reflexes, for avoiding life threatening conditions such as noxious heat, ultraviolet light, high oxygen or CO<sub>2</sub>, toxins, desiccation, and predation by fungi, mites, and other nematodes; and (3) habitat and resource-localization behaviors, including a variety of spatial orientation strategies that enable <italic>C. elegans</italic> to obtain goods such as hospitable living conditions and resources (e.g. food and mating partners), and to avoid inhospitable conditions and the lack of resources.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a considerable range of decision making behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faumont et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yapici et al., 2014</xref>): (1) action versus inaction, such as probabilistic withdrawal responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Culotti and Russell, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shinkai et al., 2011</xref>; (2) approach versus avoidance, such as when an initially attractive odor or taste is made aversive by pairing it with the absence of food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Colbert and Bargmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Saeki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Torayama et al., 2007</xref>; (3) appetitive responses, such as when worms are presented with a choice between benign or pathogenic food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; and (4) choice under risk, such as when worms must decide whether to risk crossing a potentially lethal chemical barrier to obtain food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shinkai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>). Other examples include the choice to remain in a food patch rather than to leave to find a mate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrios et al., 2008</xref>) or the choice to remain in a dwindling patch of food rather than leave for a possibly better patch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bendesky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Milward et al., 2011</xref>; the latter has strong parallels with optimal foraging theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busch and Olofsson, 2012</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> has also been shown to exhibit bounded rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Simon, 1957</xref>), a property it shares with humans and most other animals. Its pairwise preferences for attractive odors generally obey transitivity but with a considerable number of exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Iwanir et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, its pairwise preferences are not generally influenced by introduction of a third option in the choice set, another classical mark of rationality, but again with a considerable number of exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cohen et al., 2019</xref>). However, none of these preference tests provide necessary and sufficient evidence for utility maximization.</p><p>We selected food choice for our investigation of utility maximization. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is an omnivorous bacterivore that mainly inhabits rotting plant material such as decaying fruits and fleshy stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frézal and Félix, 2015</xref>). Its natural habitat contains thousands of different species of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Samuel et al., 2016</xref>), including both beneficial and pathogenic varieties. Each beneficial species has a characteristic nutritional quality defined in terms of the growth rate of individual worms cultured on that species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Avery and Shtonda, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Samuel et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, pathogenic species can be lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tan et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, food choice has immediate fitness consequences for the worm, and it is reasonable to expect that <italic>C. elegans</italic> food-choice mechanisms have been shaped by evolution to be efficient and therefore internally consistent.</p><p>There is considerable evidence that, with the exception of some species of pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), food preference in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is not innate. Over the time course of a standard chemotaxis assay (1 hr), previously unfed L1 larvae accumulate equally in high (H) and medium (M) quality food patches located on the same test plate. Similar results were obtained for eight of nine other pairs of beneficial bacteria that differed in quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>). This observation suggests that innate preferences based on chemotaxis to odors are mostly absent. Differential accumulation in larvae develops gradually, reaching a maximum at 24 hr. During this period which worms leave and re-enter the patches many times, providing the basis for a comparative mechanism. Mutants with compromised feeding ability (<italic>eat-2</italic>, <italic>eat-5</italic>), accumulate more strongly than wild type worms in the better of two strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> that differ in quality but are unlikely to differ in smell. The most plausible explanation for this observation is that food consumption provides feedback that drives food choice. Preferences acquired in one food environment (a bacteria laden agar plate) are retained when worms are transferred to a second environment containing different foods. For example, worms pre-exposed to high-quality food on the first plate become fussy eaters, exhibiting a bias against medium-quality food when transferred to a second plate containing novel high- and medium-quality foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>). Worms also exhibit a preference for previously encountered food relative to novel food. Food preferences can be reversed by pairing the less preferred food with methamphetamine or cocaine, drugs of abuse that are associated with reward in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Musselman et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these observations show that worms behave as if they form memories of previously encountered food in a process can be described as <italic>food quality learning</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we utilized GARP to test for utility maximization and investigated its behavioral and neuronal mechanisms. This was accomplished by means of a microfluidic device that enabled us to offer single, semi-restrained worms high- and medium-quality bacteria at a range of different relative abundances while monitoring consumption electrophysiologically. We found food choices of naïve and trained animals are consistent with utility maximization. Worms behave as if they employ an underlying representation of utility that they were acting to maximize. Preference data were well fit by a utility function widely used to model the behavior of human consumers. At the behavioral level, utility maximization relies on a chemotaxis strategy known as <italic>klinotaxis</italic>. In this strategy, head bends during sinusoidal locomotion are biased by chemosensory input such that bends are deeper on the side where attractant concentration is increasing. At the neuronal level, we found that chemosensory neurons known to modulate head position are able to discriminate between high- and medium-quality food, and that food quality training increases this ability. These findings establish a new model system in which to investigate the neuronal and genetic basis of subjective value and its behavioral expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Revealed preference theory</title><p>In a typical experiment testing utility maximization with human participants (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harbaugh et al., 2001</xref>), each person is given a series of <italic>choice sets</italic>. A choice set comprises a list of consumption options, called <italic>bundles</italic>, from which participants are asked to pick the bundle they most prefer. Choice sets are constructed so that the available bundles are made from varying quantities of goods (e.g. apples and oranges; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Some experiments use more than two goods, but for exposition will we focus the simple case of two goods. Each choice set is defined by a unique combination of a budget and prices, and the cost of each bundle equals the budget. Budget and prices can be in units of money or of time. As a result of the budget constraint, a bundle with more of one good necessarily has less of the other, yielding an inherent <italic>trade-off</italic> between goods.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of a GARP experiment and tests for utility maximization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Direct violation of utility maximization.

The lines in the figure, called <italic>budget lines</italic>, depict the pricing constraints and trade-offs particular to each choice set. In <italic>A</italic>, for example, oranges are twice the price of apples so the chooser must forgo two units of apples for each additional unit of oranges. Choosing is construed as selecting the most preferred option from those available in the choice set. While in theory a person might choose a bundle inside the budget line and leave money on the table, in practice we assume more is preferred to less, and so these choices are typically not offered.</p><p>The constellation of choices a person makes across the many different choice sets in the ensemble is analyzed for the presence of combinations that violate the Generalized Axiom of Reveled Preference (GARP) which has been shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for observed choices to be consistent with utility maximization. Here, we provide a non-technical explanation of the underlying theory; technical treatments are available elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Varian, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harbaugh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burghart et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Revealed preference violations can be direct or indirect. Both types of violations depend on the assumption that more of a good is better than less of it (<italic>strong monotonicity</italic> of utility). The filled circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> are one possible pair of choices, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, selected to exemplify a <italic>direct</italic> violation. In choice set <italic>A</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was selected over <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, which was also in the choice set but was not chosen. We infer from this choice that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is at least as good as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, which we write as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>≽</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. (We cannot conclude that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is better than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> because the person could have been indifferent between them, with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> being chosen randomly.) Noting that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> has the same number of oranges but more apples than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, we infer (by strong monotonicity) that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is <italic>strictly</italic> preferred to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, written as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>≻</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Combining the inferences <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>≽</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>≻</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, we conclude that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> should be strictly preferred to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, that is, it should also be true that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>≻</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. This preference is said to be revealed <italic>directly</italic>, because when people choose <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, they do so over another option on the same budget line, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, that has more of at least one of the goods than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.

These two preferences constitute a violation because they are inconsistent; there is no underlying maximization process of any kind that could allow for this combination of choices.</p><p>A person <italic>indirectly</italic> reveals a preference for one bundle over another when there is a <italic>sequence</italic> of directly revealed preferences that link the two by transitivity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> illustrates an indirect violation. In addition to the original choices <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, the person picked <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> in choice set <italic>C</italic>.

And, as before, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf40"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>≻</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, from which we conclude by transitivity that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is preferred to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf42"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.

However, at the same time the person reveals <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>≽</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> while <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>≻</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, from which we conclude <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>≻</mml:mo><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> These two preferences constitute a violation because they are inconsistent; again, no maximization process could allow for this combination of preferences. Further, it can be shown that when only two goods are available, the presence of direct violations is a necessary condition for indirect violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rose, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heufer, 2009</xref>). This fact is the foundation for the neuronal mechanism of utility maximization proposed in the Discussion.</p><p>Adherence to GARP demonstrates rationality in the technical economic sense (henceforth <italic>technical rationality</italic>). As discussed above, this form of rationality is based on choice consistency. Technical rationality stands in contrast to other forms of rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kacelnik, 2006</xref>). These include <italic>psychological rationality</italic> which emphasizes the process by which decisions are made, namely logically consistent reasoning, rather than decision outcomes. There is also <italic>biological rationality</italic> which refers to decisions that are consistent with inclusive fitness. None of these forms of rationality are necessary prerequisites for any other. Of particular importance to our study is that demonstration of technical rationality neither presupposes nor establishes psychological rationality. A technically rational agent may or may not use reasoning to make choices.</p><p>Finally, tests of adherence to GARP have been utilized to quantify technical rationality. Although strict adherence to GARP is binary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afriat, 1972</xref> proposed a measure, called Afriat’s efficiency index (AEI), to quantify the severity of GARP violations. This measure has been utilized to quantify the extent of deficits in technical rationality in patients with damage to their ventromedial frontal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Camille et al., 2011</xref>). It was also utilized to correlate mathematical ability with the degree of technical rationality in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harbaugh et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GARP for worms</title><p>The foregoing examples illustrate that testing adherence to GARP entails the following prerequisites:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Two different goods to choose between, with more preferred to less for each good.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Measurement of the consumption choices.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Consumption trade-offs, such that consuming more of one good always means consuming less of the other.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Observation of decision outcomes on budget lines that intersect.</p></list-item></list><p>The first step in this study was to develop and validate the means to fulfill these prerequisites in ecologically realistic ways for <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Prerequisite (i): Two different goods</title><p>As goods, we used bacteria species having high (H, <italic>Comamonas</italic>) and medium (M, <italic>Bacillus simplex</italic>) quality as a food source, defined in terms of the growth rate of individual worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Avery and Shtonda, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shtonda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>). Chemical analysis of volatile organic compounds released by these bacteria revealed that each species emits a different blend of compounds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These include three compounds that are unique to M food (<italic>a</italic>, <italic>c</italic>, <italic>d</italic>). One (<italic>a</italic>) is a chemoattractant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hsueh et al., 2017</xref>; two are uncharacterized in <italic>C. elegans</italic> chemotaxis assays (<italic>c</italic>, <italic>d</italic>). The two remaining compounds (<italic>b</italic>, <italic>e</italic>) are common to both species.

Compound <italic>c</italic> is nematicidal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Our chemical analysis establishes the olfactory substrate for qualitative differences in the worm’s perception of H and M bacteria, analogous to the qualitative differences by which human choosers distinguish between goods (e.g. colors and flavors of fruits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We cannot, of course, conclude on this basis that the worm’s nervous system actually distinguishes H from M; formally, the neurosensory representations of H and M could be similar. Further evidence on this point is presented below. It is notable that M food releases greater amounts of chemoattractants than H food does, yet is less attractive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, azide+). A possible explanation is that the nematicidal compound released by M food is a repellant that mitigates its potential to attract.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Volatile organic compounds released by H and M food.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">CAS#</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Compound</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">H food (DA1877)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">M food (DA1885)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>a</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1534-08-3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Methylthioacetate<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2">*</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>b</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">624-92-0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dimethyl disulfide<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2">*</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">19.4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">38.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>c</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2432-51-1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S-Methyl butanethioate<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3">†</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>d</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">23747-45-7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S-Methyl 3-methylbutanethioate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>e</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3658-80-8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dimethyltrisulfide<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2">*</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of headspace of H and M food and confirmed with known standards.

We were initially uncertain whether older worms could learn new food preferences, so we began by investigating the magnitude, neuronal dependence, and mechanisms of food quality learning in the developmental period spanning late L3 to young adulthood. Synchronized, late L3 worms (N2) were transferred to a training plate which contained an equal number of similar sized patches of H and M foods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Trained). Preference for H versus M food was assessed the following day at the young adult stage on a test plate having a single pair of H and M food patches (henceforth, the <italic>open-field accumulation assay</italic>). Control worms were transferred to a mock training plate and tested in parallel with trained worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Untrained). Preference index <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was quantified on a scale such that +1 and –1 represent absolute preference for H and M food, respectively; 0 represents indifference. Note that accumulation assays are not the same as the revealed preference assays used later in this study to investigate utility maximization. In particular, accumulation assays do not allow worms to consume mixtures of the goods (bundles) in the same feeding bout, nor do they challenge worms with different relative food densities (prices).</p><p>Trained N2 worms preferred H food to M food more strongly than untrained worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and N2</xref>, Trained vs. Untrained, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>1</sup>;) indicating a significant effect of food quality training. We conclude that worms in the developmental period under study can learn new food preferences; we refer to these as <italic>trained preferences</italic>. However, untrained N2 worms also preferred H to M food even though they were encountering these foods for the first time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and N2</xref> Untrained, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>2</sup>). The preference for H food in untrained worms is interesting because hatchlings, which are eating food for the first time, show equal preference for these two foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>). One possibility is that preferences in untrained worms are the result of learning over the 60 min experiment. Another possibility is that these preferences arise from events that occurred between hatching and testing; we refer to such preferences as <italic>latent preferences</italic>. To distinguish between these possibilities, we ran accumulation assays with and without the paralytic agent sodium azide in each food patch. The presence of sodium azide captures the preference of worms upon first approach to food. We found that trained and untrained worms preferred H food even when sodium azide was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>8,9</sup>), albeit to a lesser degree than in the absence of sodium azide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>11,12</sup>), and that the effect of training was evident in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>7,10</sup>). We draw three main conclusions from this experiment: (i) worms do not need to sample both patches before expressing a preference, (ii) training increases preference upon first approach, indicative of a change in olfactory sensitivity, and (iii) latent preferences exist and may contribute to overall preference.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table

As a first step in identifying the locus of food quality learning, we measured food preferences in worms with a loss of function mutation in the Otx homeobox gene <italic>ceh-36</italic>. This gene is expressed specifically in two food-sensitive chemosensory neuron pairs, AWC and ASE, where it is required for normal expression levels of functionally essential genes, including chemoreceptors and ion channel subunits required for chemotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lanjuin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Koga and Ohshima, 2004</xref>). We found that <italic>ceh-36</italic> worms were nevertheless able to distinguish H from M food, as even untrained worms exhibited a marked preference for H food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>ceh-36</italic>, Untrained vs. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf52"><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>3</sup>). Moreover, this level of preference was indistinguishable from that exhibited by untrained N2 worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Trained or Untrained <italic>ceh-36</italic> vs. Untrained N2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>4,5</sup>). In contrast, we were unable to detect an effect of training on food preference in <italic>ceh-36</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>ceh-36</italic>, Trained vs. Untrained, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>6</sup>). The effect size associated with food quality training was reduced relative to wild type (Cohen’s d: N2, 0.21; <italic>ceh-36</italic>=0.10). This drop was attributable to a reduction in the difference between means (N2, 1.25; <italic>ceh-36</italic>, 0.45) and an increase in the pooled standard deviation (N2, 0.17; <italic>ceh-36</italic>, 0.22). We conclude that training effects in <italic>ceh-36</italic>, if present, are probably weaker than in N2. Taken together, these results show that undiminished <italic>ceh-36</italic> function is likely required for food preference acquired through food quality training, implicating AWC and/or ASE in this process; however, full <italic>ceh-36</italic> function is dispensable for latent food preferences, suggesting the other neurons may subserve this behavior. Below we present functional imaging data consistent with a role for AWC neurons in mediating the behavior effects of food quality training.</p><p>We next considered the mechanism of accumulation in food patches and how it may be altered by food quality training. The number of worms in a food patch depends on between patch entry and exit rates. In a simple experiment to study the effects of entry rate on preference index, we added a fast-acting metabolic poison (sodium azide) to each food patch to prevent worms from leaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Choi et al., 2016</xref>). To increase the resolution of our preference measurements, we used a T-maze baited with H and M foods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); the maze prevents worms from wandering out of range of food spots.</p><p>Trained N2 worms tested in the absence of sodium azide preferred H food to M food more strongly than untrained worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Azide –, Trained vs. Untrained, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>7</sup>) indicating a significant effect of food quality training. Preference in both groups continued to rise after the 40-min sample point. This rise could be refinement of preferences as worms go back and forth between patches, additional food-quality learning, or both. In the presence of sodium azide, trained and untrained worms still accumulated more strongly in H food than in M food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: Azide+, Trained and Untrained vs. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf53"><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>8,9</sup>). This finding shows that preferences can be established on the basis of entry rate alone. Furthermore, it shows that worms do not have to sample both patches before expressing a preference. This means at least some of the H-food preference seen in untrained worms is independent of sampling experience during the assay.</p><p>We also observed a significant effect of training on food preference in the azide condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Azide+, Trained vs. Untrained, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>10</sup>), indicating that food quality training increases entry rate. Finally, preference levels were substantially reduced by sodium azide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Trained, Azide +vs. Azide–; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>11</sup> and Untrained, Azide +vs. Azide–; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>12</sup>). This result shows that additional mechanisms contribute to differential accumulation in H and M food, mostly likely differences in exit rate, shown previously to contribute to accumulation in open-field accumulation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Learning to avoid the odors of pathogenic bacteria is reinforced by serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), but less is known about how preferences for nonpathogenic foods are reinforced. We found that food preferences in general were reduced in <italic>cat-2</italic> mutants, which have substantially reduced levels of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lints and Emmons, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Calvo et al., 2011</xref>).

Worms move more slowly when in contact with food particles, an effect caused by mechanical activation of dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tanimoto et al., 2016</xref>).

During the training procedure, this reduction could cause <italic>cat-2</italic> mutants to exit food patches sooner than wild type worms. It is possible, therefore, that food quality learning in <italic>cat-2</italic> mutants is impaired simply because they spend less time in the food, hence have less experience of it. However, we found no differences between wild type and <italic>cat-2</italic> mutants in the proportion of time on food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This finding points to a requirement for dopamine signaling in the acquisition or expression of food memory, in accordance with substantial evidence showing a requirement for dopamine in several forms of associative learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hukema et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Voglis and Tavernarakis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Musselman et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>GARP prerequisite (ii): Measurement of the consumption choices</title><p>Bacteria are ingested via the worm’s pharynx, a rhythmically active, muscular pump comprising the animal’s throat. Each pharyngeal contraction is called a ‘pump’. To measure the relationship between price and consumption, we developed a system for presenting single worms with a pair of bacteria suspensions while recording the number of pumps the worm ‘spends’ on each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The system is based on a microfluidic chip (called the ‘Y-chip’) originally designed to investigate the neural mechanism of klinotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McCormick et al., 2011</xref>), a common form of chemotaxis. <italic>C. elegans</italic> klinotaxis takes the form of accentuating or attenuating, respectively, locomotory head bends toward or away from attractive tastes and odors, including food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</xref>).

Restraint is achieved by means of a vacuum clamp that leaves the worm’s head, upper body, and tail free to move.

Despite movements of the worm’s body, normal looking EPGs were obtained, with readily identifiable muscle excitation spikes (E) and relaxation spikes (R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We quantified consumption of H and M food in terms of the number of pumps that occurred in each food during a 12-min exposure to particular food offerings. This time limit was chosen as compromise between the need acquire reliable preference measures without allowing the worm to feed so long as to allow preferences to changes, for example, by onset of satiety.</p><p>We measured the consumption of each food in terms of the fraction of pumps that occurred while the worm’s head was in that food’s stream.

Following this logic, price <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf55"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> can be defined as the cost incurred by swallowing the amount of bacteria ingested in a single pump. We assume that at equal density, approximately the same number of H and M bacteria cells are ingested per pump. This assumption is based on: (i) the observation that H and M bacteria are similar in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Avery and Shtonda, 2003</xref>), and (ii) the likelihood that pump volume <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf56"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is approximately constant. We presume pump volume depends mainly on the maximum extent of contraction of pharyngeal muscles, which opens the pharyngeal lumen.

Participants in the experiment make instantaneous choices from a set of menu items. This type of experiment abstracts away from the classical revealed preference theory on which these experiments are based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Samuelson, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Houthakker, 1950</xref>). In the classical theory, and essentially all economy-wide measurements that rest on it, consumption is defined in terms of the rate at which units of goods are acquired or consumed over time. In our study, we employ this more classical approach. Here, consumption is the product of the number of pumps and food density (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>). The number of pumps is, in effect, the time integral of pumping rate. In other words, it is the integral of consumption rate.

It was necessary, therefore, to assess the degree to which feeding behavior in the chip is normal. We did this by comparing the worm’s choices of what to eat and how avidly to eat it on agar plates and in the Y-chip.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Food familiarity effect</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is reluctant to eat unfamiliar food. It pumps slower in unfamiliar food than in familiar food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Song et al., 2013</xref>). This effect is the result of feeding suppression triggered by the taste or smell of unfamiliar bacteria. To test for this effect in the Y-chip, we grew worms on H food or M food until young adulthood and measured pumping rates either in the same (familiar) or the converse (unfamiliar) food. In this experiment, both streams in the chip carried the same food. We found that mean pumping rate for a given type of food was lower when that food was unfamiliar, indicating that the food familiarity effect is intact in the Y-chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, Familiar food vs. Unfamiliar food, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>16</sup>). Furthermore, we noted that pumping rate on familiar food was the same in the two cases. This allowed us to compare directly the extent to which unfamiliar H and M food suppressed pumping rate. We found that suppression was greater when the unfamiliar food was lower in quality than the familiar food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, Unfamiliar food, grown on H vs. grown on M, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>17</sup>).

By the alternative model, this means H and M emit the same amount of the characteristic compounds. In light of this result, the alternative model obviously fails to predict the familiarity effect for, as H and M are indistinguishable, neither of them can be unfamiliar to the worm under the conditions of our experiment. From the fact that worms pump at different rates on H and M food when they are familiar versus unfamiliar, we can conclude that the foods are qualitatively distinct.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Food quality training</title><p>We tested groups of trained and untrained worms with H and M food at equal concentrations (OD 1.0) in their respective streams in the Y-chip.

During testing, both channels in the Y-chip carried the food on which the animals were trained (H or M) at an OD of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0. Pumping rate in H food was stable whereas pumping rate in M appeared to decline later in the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>); therefore, we quantified pumping in terms of its peak rate for both food types. Peak pumping rate was comparable to the rate recorded in similar densities of <italic>E. coli</italic> strain OP50 under mild restraint in microfluidic devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scholz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Weeks et al., 2018</xref>), and exhibited the expected increase with food density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; effect of OD, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>21</sup>). We conclude that the density dependence of pumping rate is intact in the Y-chip. This experiment also revealed previously unreported aspects of pumping kinetics. Regardless of food type, pumping rate rose slowly, on the time scale of 100 s of seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), Additionally, we observed an inverse relationship between the latency to half-maximum pumping rate and concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; effect of OD, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>22</sup>).

That is, a higher relative concentration of M food was now required to make the two options equally preferred. In other words, training increased the relative preference for H food. Importantly, we also found that worms could be induced to spend the majority of pumps on non-preferred food M if the preferred food H was made sufficiently dilute, i.e., expensive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, point <italic>a</italic>, Trained and Untrained, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf90"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> &lt; 0.5, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>25,26</sup>).

Under this mapping, the lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> correspond to choice sets like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

We found it impractical to standardize the number of pumps to impose a fixed budget on each worm because of individual differences in latency to feed and mean pumping rate during the recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). We therefore plotted proportional consumption, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf93"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf94"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref>).</p><p>Utility maximization was assessed according to the procedure outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Varian, 1996</xref>. This assessment yields a single number that captures the total degree of consistency of preferences. Using choices averaged over all trials, we found no violations of GARP in either the trained or untrained data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, worms were choosing as if they were maximizing utility on the seven budget lines in our study.</p><p>To assess the robustness of our finding of utility maximization, we first considered whether it could be attributed to sampling error. Error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> show the confidence intervals for mean consumption of H food on each budget line. Given this degree of variability, it is conceivable that one or more violations was missed because of sampling error. We therefore constructed 10<sup>8</sup> simulated data sets by sampling from the gaussian distributions implied by the means and standard errors of each point. Sampling from gaussian distributions was justified by the form of the distributions of preference values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finding no violations of utility maximization in either the trained or untrained group, we estimated the probability of at least one violation to be less than 10<sup>–8</sup>. It is therefore unlikely that the absence of violations was an accident of sampling error.</p><p>However, it is conceivable that violations might have been observed if we had used a larger ensemble of budget lines. To address this concern, we predicted the choices worms would make on a widely used ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harbaugh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Camille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chung et al., 2017</xref>), which contains 11 budget lines and covers the choice space more uniformly than our 7-budget ensemble. We first assessed the stringency of the 11-budget ensemble as a test for the utility maximization. This was done by assuming a conservative null hypothesis: that worms choose completely randomly, such that the fraction of pumps in H food, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf95"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, could be modeled by drawing from a flat distribution between 0 and 1 (fraction of pumps in M food was <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf96"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). Based on 10<sup>6</sup> random data sets constructed in this way, we estimated the probability of a false positive finding of utility maximization (no violations) in the 11-budget ensemble to be 0.06. The 7-budget ensemble, by comparison, has a false positive probability of 0.87. We conclude that the 11-budget ensemble is considerably more stringent.</p><p>To compute how <italic>C. elegans</italic> would be expected to perform when choosing on the stringent 11-budget ensemble, we used <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 9</xref> to predict the expected behavior on the budget lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. There were no violations of GARP. There were also no violations when, instead of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 9</xref>, we used piecewise linear representations of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> data. Finally, to take into account the variance about the means in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, we created 10<sup>6</sup> random data sets by sampling from gaussian distributions centered on the means. The standard deviation of the gaussians was set to the highest value of the standard error of the mean in either the trained or untrained data set in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. By this procedure, we estimated the probability that worms would exhibit utility maximization in the 11-budget ensemble to be ≥ 0.98, regardless of training state or type of fit (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 9</xref> or piecewise linear). We conclude that the worm’s price-ratio curve likely constitutes a robust utility maximization strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Higher order features of utility maximization</title><p>Evidence that <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a utility maximizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), allowed us to investigate several higher order features of utility maximization considered to be properties of human decisions. Ultimately, we succeeded in establishing a utility model describing what may be the underlying valuation process guiding the worm’s choices.</p><p>Economic theory distinguishes between two main classes of goods – <italic>substitutes</italic> versus <italic>complements</italic> – according to how changes in the price or quantity of one good that a consumer possesses affects consumption of a second good. In the case of substitutes, which are relatively interchangeable from the consumer’s perspective, an increase in the price of one good causes a decrease in the consumption of that good and a compensatory increase in consumption of the substitute. This occurs as consumers trade some of the good whose price increased for more of the alternative good. Pairs of goods that are traded-off at a constant exchange rate, regardless of the amounts of goods on offer, are called <italic>perfect substitutes</italic>; black and blue pens are an example of perfect substitutes. In the case of complements, which are defined as goods that are more desirable when consumed together rather than separately, an increase in the price of one good causes a decrease in consumption of both goods. Left and right are an example of perfect complements. Wearing only one shoe has essentially zero utility, so increases in the price of left shoes leads to decreased shoe consumption overall. Although worms consistently ate some of both foods in our experiments, we predicted that H and M food should act, to some degree, as substitutes for each other, as each provides nutrition.</p><p>To test this prediction, we took advantage of the design of the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. The seven choice sets can be arranged in groups in which the price of one food was held constant while the other food was offered at three different prices. There were two groups in which the price of M food was constant while the price H food changed (points <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>d</italic>, and points <italic>c</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, <italic>f</italic>), and there was one group in which the price of H food as constant while the price of M food changed (points <italic>d</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, <italic>g</italic>); see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. We analyzed these groups by plotting consumption of the food whose price was constant against the price of the other food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

As a first step, we focused on one of these, AWC, because its role in directing chemotaxis to food is particularly well established. Additionally, it is one of the few chemosensory neurons known from optogenetic manipulation to be capable of producing precisely the type of head-angle bias that underlies the expression of utility maximization in <italic>C. elegans</italic> seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kocabas et al., 2012</xref>).

AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWC<sup>OFF</sup> generate similar calcium transients to odorants that they both detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>); for consistency, we recorded from AWC<sup>ON</sup> (henceforth, ‘AWC’). Calcium imaging shows that AWC is inhibited by bacteria conditioned medium or odorants, such as isoamyl alcohol, that are released by attractive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Worthy et al., 2018a</xref>) but then responds with a robust, positive-going transient when the stimulus is removed; AWC is therefore considered to be a food-off neuron. However, in one case, AWC is known to generate an off-transient when the stimulus is switched from the odor of a preferred food to the odor of a less preferred food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lin et al., 2023</xref>).

The imaging trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> illustrates a typical fluorescence waveform in the experiment. AWC responded at two distinct time scales. On the longer time scale, it exhibited a positive transient that decayed over tens of seconds, reminiscent of the time course of responses to sustained changes from H to M food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). On the shorter time scale, AWC responded with positive-going transients at each H→M transition, and negative-going transients at each M→H transition. In control experiments, when each fluid channel contained bacteria-free buffer, AWC did not respond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), making it unlikely that pressure artifacts associated with valve activation contributed to fluorescence transients.

We conclude that AWC represents neither the value of food nor utility.</p><p>A potential clue to the function of AWC in food choice stems from the observation that the peak of its response function lies at or near the point on the price-ratio axis where the two foods are presented at the same density. This is the point where foraging decisions are the most difficult, as food density is no longer available as cue to identify the better option. Moreover, food quality training greatly increased the height of the function’s peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, effect of training, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref><sup>54</sup>), improving AWC’s ability to make such distinctions.

These include valuations inherent in cost-benefit decisions, transitivity of binary preferences, and independence of irrelevant alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrios et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bendesky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shinkai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cohen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Iwanir et al., 2019</xref>). The present work establishes a new reference point in the study of valuation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in four key respects. (i) <italic>C. elegans</italic> food choices obey the classic law of supply and demand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This law has been shown to apply not just to humans but to a variety of model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kagel et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kagel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bickel et al., 1995</xref>), but none as simple as <italic>C. elegans</italic>. (i) <italic>C. elegans</italic> behaves as if maximizing utility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). When challenged with multiple trade-offs between food quality and price, its choices satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for utility maximization. An organism that maximizes utility also maximizes subjective value, for it is reasonable to maximize only what is valued. We believe this may be the first demonstration of value-based decision making according to GARP in an invertebrate. (iii) <italic>C. elegans</italic> food-consumption decisions are well fit by the CES utility function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This function is widely used to model human consumers, but the extent to which it applies to other species remains an open question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fréchette, 2016</xref>). Here, we show that the CES function accurately models consumption decisions in an organism that diverged from the line leading to humans 600 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Raible and Arendt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>), which provides new evidence of the function’s universality. (iv) In addition to demonstrating utility maximization in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we have outlined a plausible mechanism for it. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> price-ratio curve is monotonic-increasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Below we offer a proof that monotonicity of the price-ratio curve guarantees adherence to GARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Importantly, such a price-ratio curve seems simple to implement at the neuronal level, requiring only that chemosensory neurons are able to regulate the amplitude of locomotory head-bends as they occur, and to do so monotonically in response to differences in food value on either side of the body.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Price ratio curves and utility maximization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A pair of intersecting budget lines wherein choices <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are governed by a price-ratio curve (not shown) that is monotonic-increasing.

This meant finding a method of offering worms qualitatively distinct goods whose prices could be varied systemically under the constraint of an explicit trade-off between them. It also meant finding a way to measure consumption of each good. We chose species of high- and medium-quality bacteria as goods. We showed that these species have different olfactory fingerprints, making it conceivable that they are qualitatively distinct (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that worms feed differently on these species in a way that can only be explained by a model in which the foods are indeed qualitatively distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Price differences were modeled as differences in bacteria density under the assumption that doubling food density reduces by half the number of pharyngeal pumps required to ingest a given mass of food. In human experiments, trade-offs are established by means of a budget constraint ensuring that choosing more of one good means getting less of the other. That is the only purpose of the budget constraint, and participants need not and are not made aware of it. In the case of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it was not necessary to impose a budget constraint because trade-offs could be established simply by the geometry of the microfluidic device, which ensured that more a pump spent in one food is a pump not spent in the other food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, to measure relative consumption of the two bacteria, we computed the fraction of pumps emitted in each food stream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Overall, this methodology results in decision-making paradigm that is formally analogous to GARP experiments in humans.</p><p>There are several possible objections to this methodology. (i) There is the concern that revealed preference theory, created to model human consumers, is unnecessarily complex for modeling worm behavior. However, our study uses this framework not as a model but as litmus test for utility maximization. (ii) We have not shown that qualitative distinctions between bacteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) are mirrored by distinct representations in the worm’s nervous system, as is presumably the case in the human nervous system. However, revealed preference theory makes no such stipulation as to how utility maximization physically occurs, including neural representations of goods. In worms, cells other neurons, such as gut cells, could be part of the representation without violating theoretical assumptions. (iii) Finally, there is the concern that that conscious awareness of the budget constraint is a necessary condition for application of the theory. However, revealed preference theory merely requires the ability to choose between different bundles of goods. There is no requirement that that these choices be made consciously after considering prices and income and calculating the range of possible choices. The budget constraint can instead be imposed physically, as in this experiment.</p><p>Our study has several experimental limitations. (i) There was a high probability of a false-positive finding of utility maximization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. A contributing factor to this problem is the comparatively small number of budget lines in our budget ensemble. Another factor is the somewhat uneven coverage of choice space, with two budget lines close to the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf171"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> axis (<italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>). We included these budget lines to make a stronger case for complex decision making in the worm by demonstrating preference reversals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, point <italic>a</italic>); this required presenting H food at very low density. We were able to address this limitation by showing that the price-ratio curve of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> predicted the absence of transitivity violations in a larger budget ensemble that covered choice space completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, we show below that the absence of violations in the larger ensemble is essentially guaranteed by the monotonic form of the worm’s price-ratio curve. (ii) In the calcium imaging experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–E</xref>, dwell times in the two foods were equal (2 s). This stimulus pattern is somewhat unrealistic because in the behavioral experiments to measure food preference in the Y-chip, dwell times were rarely equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We nevertheless used equal dwell times because we were primarily interested in the question of whether AWC is capable of reporting food utility via its inherent sensitivity to the food quality, that is, without the complicating factor of dwell time, which is behaviorally determined and can increase or decrease peak calcium responses. (iii) Our demonstration of utility maximization is currently limited to the klinotaxis component of <italic>C. elegans</italic> foraging behavior.

This means non-violation of transitivity relationships inherent in directly revealed preferences, as well as those revealed indirectly through sequences of directly revealed preferences. The scientific literature on transitive choice in animals is extensive, encompassing a wide range of vertebrates: primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addessi et al., 2008</xref>), birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mazur and Coe, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sumpter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schuck-Paim and Kacelnik, 2002</xref>), and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dechaume-Moncharmont et al., 2013</xref>). Many invertebrates also exhibit transitivity: bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shafir, 1994</xref>), fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arbuthnott et al., 2017</xref>), nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cohen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Iwanir et al., 2019</xref>), and even slime molds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Latty and Beekman, 2011</xref>). However, these studies have focused almost entirely on binary transitivity, meaning either-or decisions between pairs of items. Transitivity in this sense can be impressive, even in simple organisms. Choices of male fruit flies presented with pairs of genetically distinct females drawn from 10 divergent inbred strains form a transitive hierarchy of order 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arbuthnott et al., 2017</xref>). Such examples notwithstanding, binary transitivity is not a sufficient condition for utility maximization. That is because in binary choices there is no notion of amount. It is therefore impossible to assess whether choices between different goods are consistent with the rule ‘more is better’ which, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, is a necessary condition for utility maximization. Here, we have demonstrated a form of transitivity in which not only the quality of goods but also their offered amount (hence price) is taken into account by the organism. The full set of transitivity relationships exhibited by worms in our study is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What is being maximized?</title><p>Utility maximization raises the ineluctable question of what is being maximized. Revealed preference theory, including GARP, cannot answer this question. At present, it is easier to identify what is <italic>not</italic> being maximized. Three ethologically plausible maximization targets can be ruled out by simple inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. (i) It is unlikely that the worm is maximizing the amount of high quality food consumed, as that would have resulted in corner solutions. (ii) It is also unlikely that the worm is maximizing the overall amount of food consumed. That would have resulted in feeding exclusively in whichever of the two streams carried denser food, again yielding corner solutions (except at point <italic>e</italic>, where densities are equal and so the worm would be indifferent, which is was not). (iii) Finally, and perhaps surprisingly, the worm is probably not maximizing its potential for growth, at least in terms of a simple model in which this potential is the product the characteristic growth rates of worm in H or M food, 0.50 and 0.43 days<sup>–10</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shtonda, 2004</xref>), and the densities of those foods. The growth-potential model fails to explain our data because H and M growth rates are not sufficiently different to make the less dense food preferred under any of the price ratios tested. It predicts an outcome similar to maximizing amount of food consumed (except at point <italic>e</italic>, where instead of indifference, it predicts that H food would be preferred). Together, considerations (i)-(iii) imply that the worm is not maximizing fitness, at least in terms of food consumption. It is conceivable that the worm is maximizing some combination of fitness-related quantities which, in addition to food consumption, might include knowledge about the local food environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Calhoun et al., 2014</xref>), food safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Song et al., 2013</xref>), and the foraging benefits of continuous locomotion while feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>), but we have no evidence of these as yet.</p><p>The worm’s preference for non-corner solutions, called ‘interior solutions’, is consistent with at least two hypotheses concerning what is being maximized. The worm might be maximizing something having to do with mixtures of the two foods, reminiscent of ‘a taste for variety’ in economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Senior, 1836</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jevons, 1871</xref>). This would be an appropriate strategy if, for example, the two foods had unique essential nutrients, but we currently have no evidence for or against this. A second hypothesis is that interior solutions arise because the worm is balancing the benefit of consuming the better food option against the cost of forgoing the possibility of the sudden appearance of an even better option on the other side; this hypothesis mirrors an exploitation-exploration trade-off. Alternatively, neuromechanical constraints such as chemosensory transduction delays coupled with behavioral momentum (inability to reverse the current head bend).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Establishment of subjective value assignments</title><p>It is well established that learning alters food preferences in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ardiel and Rankin, 2010</xref>). We extended these findings by showing that worms are capable of food quality learning for palatable foods at least as late as larval stage L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and that this process requires intact dopamine signaling. A requirement for dopamine signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has also been demonstrated in the formation of enhanced preferences for salt ions that were paired with cocaine or methamphetamine, drugs that increase the amount of dopamine in the synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Musselman et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, pairing these drugs with a particular food increases preference for it. These findings are consistent with model in which trained preferences arise by a form of classical conditioning that is driven by the rewarding properties of food. However, our data do not exclude possible non-associative effects during training, such as sensitization and habituation to H and M food, respectively. Studying untrained worms, we found evidence for acquisition of latent food preferences that occurred in the absence of direct experience of the newly preferred foods. The fact that acquisition of latent preferences also requires intact dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is consistent with this process being reward-driven, but developmental effects cannot be ruled out on the basis of the available data.</p><p>Training and the latent effects of food experience may be dissociable at the circuit level in that training effects, but not latent effects, exhibit a requirement for <italic>ceh-36</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In one simple model, at least one of two chemosensory neurons, AWC or ASE, is a locus of food memories implanted by sampling both foods repeatedly over time, whereas some or all of the other chemosensory neurons mediate latent preferences. In partial support of this model, AWC’s response to removal of H food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) and to H→M transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and E</xref>), is strongly enhanced by training. It will now be important to determine whether food responses in ASE neurons are also modified by training, and whether the responses of other chemosensory neurons are exhibit latent effects.</p><p>The fact that in <italic>cat-2</italic> mutants training has no effect on food preferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) implicates dopamine signaling in the acquisition or expression of food quality memories. One hypothesis is that during training, dopamine neuron activity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> signals reward, as it does in many other organisms. In support of this model, <italic>cat-2</italic> is required for learned associations between salt cues and drugs of abuse that co-opt the reward systems, such as cocaine and methamphetamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Musselman et al., 2012</xref>) as well acquisition of alcohol preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene <italic>asic-1</italic>, a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family that is mainly expressed at presynaptic terminals of dopaminergic neurons, is required for learned associations between tastes or odors and the presence of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Voglis and Tavernarakis, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Monotonic-increasing price-ratio curves guarantee adherence to GARP</title><p>The preference values <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf172"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, plotted against price ratio <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf173"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), were well fit by smooth curves that are monotonic-increasing (strictly, <italic>non-decreasing</italic>; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 9</xref>).

Therefore, we can conclude that monotonic price-ratio curves guarantee adherence to GARP. This conclusion explains our finding that when modeling <italic>C. elegans</italic> food choice by the worm’s price-ratio curve, the probability of finding utility maximization in the 11-budget ensemble was ≥0.98 (the exceptions being due to sampling noise). Although monotonic-increasing price-ratio curves guarantee utility maximization, they are not necessary for it. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref> shows data from a human subject who exhibited no utility violations, yet whose price-ratio curve was clearly non-monotonic. Thus, in relying upon monotonic price-ratio curves, the worm’s choice strategy may be an adaptation for utility maximization under the constraint of limited computational capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A neuronal mechanism of utility maximization</title><p>The following simple model illustrates how a monotonic price-ratio curve, and thus utility maximization, could be achieved by the <italic>C. elegans</italic> klinotaxis circuit. The food-sensitive chemosensory off-cells (AWC, ASER, AWB, ASH, ASK) and on-cells (ASEL, AFD, AWA, ASJ, BAG, ASI, ADF) activate, respectively, when the cell’s preferred stimulus is removed or delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zaslaver et al., 2015</xref>). The off-cells AWC and ASER are known to truncate head bends when exogenously activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kocabas et al., 2012</xref>). The model assumes that other off-cells do likewise, whereas on-cells extend head bends. Provided that summed activations of all off-cells and on-cells are, respectively, monotonic functions of price ratio, the amplitude of head-bend truncations and extensions will also be monotonic with respect to price ratio. Given the sinusoidal kinematics of <italic>C. elegans</italic> locomotion, this relationship necessarily extends to relative dwell time on the side of the preferred food option, thereby increasing the fraction of pumps on that side. The non-monotonic activation function of AWC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>) could be compensated by activations of other chemosensory neurons at price ratios greater than unity. This model can now be tested by recording and stimulating neurons in the klinotaxis circuit during choices of the type studied here.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>All animals forage to obtain sufficient food at minimal cost.

Bacteria suspensions, and bacteria-free buffer, were held in 20 mL reservoirs (syringes with plungers removed) fitted with stopcocks. Reservoirs were suspended 50 cm above the chip and connected to it via polyethylene tubing (PE-9) fitted with 1.5 mm diameter × 12.5 mm stainless steel nipples (17 Ga, × 0.500”, New England Small Tube, Litchfield, New Hampshire). To minimize settling of bacteria, a miniature magnetic stir bar in each reservoir was agitated periodically during experiments by moving a small hand-held magnet. The layout of the Y-chip was similar in all main respects to a previous design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McCormick et al., 2011</xref>); feature height was 55 μm.

Electropharyngeograms were recorded by means of electrodes (stainless steel nipples, see above) inserted into the worm port and fluid outlet. In this configuration they were used to measure the voltage differences that occur between the worm’s head and tail during pharyngeal muscle action potentials. The vacuum clamp accentuates these voltage differences by increasing the electrical resistance between head and tail. Voltage differences between electrodes were amplified by a differential amplifier (model 1700, AM Systems, Sequim, Washington) and digitized (2 kHz) for later analysis (USB-9215A, National Instruments, Austin, Texas). Digitized recordings were bandpass filtered between 5 and 200 Hz. E and R spikes were detected offline by a manually adjusted threshold in custom data analysis software.

Late L4 or early adult worms were immobilized in a newly designed microﬂuidic imaging chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>; Supplemental CAD file 2) based on a previous device in which the worm’s nose protrudes into a switchable stimulus stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chronis et al., 2007</xref>). Chip feature-height was 30 μm. The chip was adapted for rapid switching. The switching time constant in a microfluidic chip that is driven by a constant current source (e.g. a syringe pump) is equal to the product of the system’s compliance (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf204"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and fluidic resistance of the chip (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf205"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>). To reduce compliance we used rigid inlet tubing and to reduce resistance we greatly enlarged the food-carrying channels. An additional advantage of reduced resistance is a reduction in mechanical switching artifacts. Although edible bacteria were perfused through the chip, worms did not feed while being imaged, presumably as a result of being tightly constrained in the chip.</p><p>To improve stimulus stability, fluid flow was driven by a syringe pump rather than gravity or pressure. Two of the four syringes in the pump were filled with H food and two with M food, prepared in the same was as for single-worm food choice assays. Syringes were connected to the chip such that if all four channels were flowing into the chip, the cross-sectional flow at the point of confluence near the worm would be H<sub>2</sub> H<sub>1</sub> M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub>. Stimulus presentation was automated utilizing a microprocessor to control a pair of two-way solenoid valves (LFAA1201610H, The Lee Company, Westbrook, Connecticut) in series with the syringes H<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>1</sub>; the outer channels H<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> flowed continuously. To present H food, the stimulus pattern was H<sub>2</sub> H<sub>1</sub> M<sub>1</sub>; to present M food the pattern was H<sub>1</sub> M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub>. As all channels flowed at the same rate, each occupied 1/3 of the cross-sectional flow at the worm’s position with the result that small fluctuations in the position of fluidic interfaces were kept far from the worm’s nose.</p><p>A Hamamatsu CCD camera (model C11254) controlled by HCImage was used to capture stacks of TIFF images at 10 frames/sec. Images were analyzed by manually drawing a region of interest (ROI) comprising a tightly cropped segment of the neurite connecting the cilium and soma. Mean background fluorescence was estimated from a 2-pixel thick margin situated 2 pixels outside the ROI in each frame. Absolute neuronal fluorescence was quantified as the mean of the 200 brightest pixels in the ROI, minus mean background. Finally, fluorescence values were expressed as fractional change relative to pre-stimulus baseline absolute fluorescence.

We used <italic>t</italic>-tests to determine whether the mean differed from a specific value, and to compare means from two samples or experimental groups (strains, treatments, optical densities, and price ratios). When the number of experimental groups exceeded two we used a two-factor analysis of variance. When the number of experimental groups exceeded two and individuals within groups were measured successively over time, we used a two-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures. For all comparisons, the center of distributions were their arithmetic mean. For dispersion measures, we used 95% confidence intervals, except in the case of time-series data where we used standard errors of the mean. None of the experimental designs required correction for multiple comparisons. Statistical details for each test (statistical test, effect or comparison tested, definition of units of replication, number of replicates, statistic value, degrees of freedom, p-value, and effect size) are compiled in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. These details are cited by the notation “<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, where <italic>n</italic> is the row number in the table. Because all assays were novel, sample sizes were determined empirically, by noting how variance changed as a function of number of replicates. All replicates were biological replicates. In the case of ‘assay plates’, a replicate is unique cohort of worms on an assay plate. In the case of ‘worms’, a replicate is a unique animal tested once. No outliers were excluded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of InVivo Biosystems, Inc, which manufactures instrumentation for recording electropharyngeograms</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Software, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Analysis of volatile organic compounds</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Analysis of volatile organic compounds</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Design of the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</title><p>Boxes are groups of choice sets in which the price of one food was constant (<italic>shading</italic>) while the other was variable.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Doug Portman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>All reviewers are excited about the manuscript, however, reviewer #2 raises a major technical concern and the main comments by reviewers #1 and #3 are at a conceptual level. They have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors developed a clever experimental design that allows to precisely monitor the food consumption of worms presented with two streams of different bacterial strains of different nutritious value, H(igh) vs M(medium), and at varying concentrations. Previous work showed that worms prefer H bacteria. Animals are clamped into a microfluidic device where they are free to choose between the two streams by positioning their heads in either one of them; they can also modulate the rate of food ingestion by varying the rate of pharyngeal pumping. Under the assumption that the two types of bacteria are equally bite-sized, the &quot;price&quot; of food is directly related to the dilution of the bacterial suspension. I.e., the more diluted the food is the more pumps need to be invested to intake the same amount. A central finding of the study is presented in Figure 5B, showing that the intake of H monotonically increases with the price ratio of the H and M streams. The authors claim that this finding precludes violations of GARP and therefore strongly supports utility maximization within this GARP framework. However, I wonder how comparable the experimental design is to the GARP experiment shown in Figure 1. Here, subjects are presented with choosing between two option bundles of qualitatively different goods (apples and oranges); humans are consciously aware of their limited budget and the trade-off between the two goods. I don't think that worms are faced with the same task in the present experimental design. (1) there is no evidence that <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms qualitatively distinguish H and M bacteria, i.e. we do not know whether in their brains H and M are represented as qualitatively different objects, like humans perceive apples and oranges. Most likely H produces more of an attractive odorant X; therefore, worms likely are sensitive to the concentration difference of X between the two streams. The AWC imaging experiments are supporting this; they were shown previously to be sensitive to food-borne odorant concentrations in a gradual manner. Thus, AWC neuronal activity does not represent H and M as qualitatively different objects (see Figure 8). Therefore, unlike in Figure 1, worms do not make a trade-off between H and M, they more likely detect high and low concentrations of X. This simple mechanism is sufficient to explain the data in Figure 5B. This would lead also to consistent choices that maximize utility, i.e. foraging in areas that contain more of X which is likely to increase welfare in form of more nutritious food intake. The experiment in Figure 5B could be done using just H bacteria with different dilution. (2) In the experiments, worms are not faced with a binary choice among two bundles of goods that they can take home. They rather continuously forage the two streams by varying pumping rate and waving their heads. This means they are free to choose of how much they can intake from the H and M streams. Worms are also not aware of the duration of the experiment. This means there is no fixed budget, and their choices are not on a fixed budget line. I am therefore not convinced that the statement in lines 531-532: &quot; Under this mapping, the lines in Figure 5C correspond to choice sets like those in Figure 1.&quot; is correct.</p><p>These (1-2) major differences to the GARP experimental design in Figure 1 largely confuse me and I wonder how useful for understanding neuronal mechanisms is it to rigidly analyse the data with the mathematical tools of this framework. Vice versa, a reader from the field of economic decision making might find the explanations in (1) too trivial and must be similarly concerned of how much the experimental design fits into the GARP framework. The authors spend a good amount of effort justifying the various GARP requisites. I think they should also discuss these obvious differences and provide clear justification why their experimental design is a good worm equivalent to what is shown in Figure 1.</p><p>2) The animals show a baseline preference for H bacteria, which is interpreted by the authors as &quot;latent learning&quot;. There is no evidence that this preference is due to a latent learning mechanism, it could be just an innate preference. This is also not important for the major conclusions of the paper, so I recommend to avoid this terminology and leave it only to the final discussion.</p><p>3) The authors use the term &quot;explicit&quot; learning for the enhanced H preference after training. Explicit learning and explicit memory are differently understood in the field, like abilities or events that humans consciously acquire or remember. I strongly suggest to avoid this term as this could cause some confusion.</p><p>Note -&gt; (2-3) was also raised by reviewers #2-3</p><p>4) The behavioural defect of cat-2 is interesting but on its own it does not help much to better understand the mechanism that establishes food preference. Since the paper is quite complex already, I would recommend the authors keep these results for future mechanistic studies. – just a recommendation.</p><p>5) line 434: you cannot conclude that food quality learning is intact in the Y-chip, since the animals never learned in the chip; acquired food preference upon learning can robustly be measured under Y-chip conditions.</p><p>6) Line 461: text abruptly terminates and some important explanatory text to understand the law of demand is missing.</p><p>7) Figure 4C-D: what is t=0? Switching from buffer to food streams? What is the time course of pump frequency when no food (OD 0.0) is supplied?</p><p>8) Figure 4: I suggest to add legend for colour code in C-F, green = H food, yellow = M food.</p><p>9) Line 536: you mean Figure 4?</p><p>10) Ca++ imaging experiments lack negative controls. Since switches in microfluidic devices unavoidably come with pressure profiles, proper control experiments should be included.</p><p>11) do worms pump/feed in Ca++ imaging assays? Please discuss.</p><p>12) Line 964: since worm locomotion needs to perform dorsal to ventral bending patterns under unconstrained conditions, they have a strong internal drive to keep undulating their heads. They just can't keep still. Here, they cannot leave and crawl out of the position in the device. I think the constraints in the device thus could be a major explanation why you don't see corner solutions (see also reviewer #2).</p><p>13) line 167: aren't oranges in A double the price of apples?</p><p>14) Figure 2 panel B does not show what is described in main text and Figure caption</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Bacterial concentration: precision and accuracy in the measurement of bacterial concentration is critical to essentially all analyses carried out here. One of the most fundamental variables in the model, price, is a simple function of this. Exactly how bacterial suspensions of different concentrations/densities are prepared is not clear, but the authors repeatedly use OD600 as a measurement of bacterial concentration (this is explicitly stated in lines 341-2). This has the potential to be a significant concern, as OD600 has a linear relationship with bacterial density only in very narrow range of relatively low density -- above this (certainly ODs of 1 or 3, which are used regularly here) there can be vast deviations from linearity. As noted by one of the references this paper cites (Stevenson et al. 2016), OD600 can even have a parabolic relationship to concentration in some density regimes because of the complexities of light scattering by bacteria. It's hard to tell whether this has been accounted for here – it seems that the authors are assuming, for example, that a suspension of OD 3 has 30x as much food as one of OD 0.1, which almost certainly not case. Further, when considering how this applies to H vs. M food, the authors calculate the difference in mass/OD ratio between H and M food at OD = 1, but this ratio seems very unlikely to hold at different ODs. If bacterial concentration has been mis-estimated because of these problems, it's possible that errors in price would propagate through all of the subsequent analyses. If the authors have indeed accounted for these complications, that's great – in this case, they'd need provide additional details about how this was done. If not, however, additional work will have to be done to figure this out.</p><p>2. In Figure 9, the authors provide evidence that AWC physiology does not encode a simple economic quantity like value. I have a few comments/concerns about this analysis. First, if bacterial concentrations are being mis-estimated as described above, it may be the case that the conclusions here will change, possibly dramatically. Second, it looks to me like the red line in 9D indicates a clear relationship between preference and ∆F in trained animals. The statistics might not bear this out because of the limited power of the analysis, but I'm surprised that the authors don't find this at least suggestive of what's going on. Third, authors make an argument for calculating ∆F from its steady state responses, but it would seem that the initial responses might be informative too – this is when relative values are first being assessed. Also, the presentation of the two stimuli with equal times for each doesn't really mimic the steady-state situation when an animal has a strong preference for one of them (in this case, the nose would be exposed to the preferred stimulus for most of the time). Maybe it would be useful to examine AWC responses with different stimulus patterns? Fourth, in rationalizing 9E, authors say that they asked whether AWC might encode &quot;some other economic quantity&quot;. How many such quantities were examined? Is this a case where correction for multiple comparisons would be appropriate?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Introduction: GARP applies to consumer's choices, and importantly, assumes rational agents. The leap to nematodes is huge. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>Line 102: Citation that can potentially be added: Ghosh et al., 2016, Neuron, PMID: 27866800 (for risk assessment).</p><p>Line 120: &quot;it is reasonable to expect that <italic>C. elegans</italic> food choices maximize fitness&quot;◊ The notion that an organism's food choices maximize fitness is directly related to the Optimal Foraging Theory. Among the major criticisms this notion has received, is that it relies on the assumption that natural selection and evolution have somehow resulted in a decision-making process that maximizes fitness. However, natural selection has not necessarily led to such a result when it comes to the feeding strategy or food choices of an organism, because it is a process of selection and not a mechanism that produces optimal results, e.g., behaviors. Therefore, it is debatable whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> food choices maximize fitness.</p><p>Reviewer #1 and #3 discussed and reviewer #3 recommends to rephrase, e.g. &quot;promote fitness&quot; instead of &quot;maximize&quot;.</p><p>Line 145: redundant word: during</p><p>Line 146: bends, should be plural</p><p>Line 150: a period is missing at the end of the sentence.</p><p>Line 154: &quot;GARP for worms&quot;: although this is the title of this Results section, the section itself is about explaining in detail how utility maximization and its violations can be manifested in graphic representation of bundle choices in experiments with human subjects. This section is not about <italic>C. elegans</italic> and GARP. I suggest revising the title. It is also unclear why this section is part of the Results, since there is practically no result presented.</p><p>Line 167: it seems to me that the opposite is inferred from the text (and from Figure 1 legend): apples are half the price of oranges. Is this a typo? - see also reviewer #1</p><p>What is the budget of a <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematode? In line 535 and onward authors state that &quot;We found it impractical to standardize the number of pumps to impose a fixed energy budget on each worm because […]&quot;, and then they explain that they have been plotting the fractional consumption and equation 5. Does this mean that the budget changes depending on the food source? Can the authors elaborate on this? Are worms' budget units consistent with the goods' prices units? -&gt; see also reviewer #1</p><p>Why do the authors consider the abundance of a bacterial strain equivalent to price? In human experiments, the ratio of, e.g., oranges vs apples is one of the variables (amount of fruit per weight), and the dollars per unit is another.</p><p>Line 236: Worms were cultured on <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 before the H/M training took place. What is the nutritional value of this food source compared to H and to M?</p><p>Line 253: &quot;If H food smells to the worm more like <italic>E. coli</italic> than M food does, this preference might be explained by the so-called food familiarity effect (Song et al., 2013), in which worms eat familiar food more readily than novel food.&quot; In this case, worms do not prefer H food based on its &quot;quality&quot; but based on its similarity to the food source they have been used to. In this case, maybe the sequence of preference choices does not constitute a violation of the utility maximization. In this case, worms do not choose driven by an urge to maximize their fitness, but rather by a tendency to maintain a familiar environment. How does this fit with the authors claims and assumption?</p><p>Figure 2B: The caption reads &quot;Mean preference versus time for trained and untrained ceh-36 mutants and N2 controls in open-field accumulation assays&quot;, however, I am not sure that this is what the figure shows, given also that the y axis is labeled as &quot;fraction of pumps&quot;. Please explain. -&gt; see also reviewer #1</p><p>Given the issue with Figure 2B, it is hard to tell, at this point, which plot represents the open field assay and which the maze choice assay, therefore it is hard to compare the two or evaluate the findings in a combined way.</p><p>Line 298: &quot;The decision to accumulate in a particular food can be made, at least in part, before the animal enters the patch.&quot; ◊ I think that, for the sake of accuracy, the decision in question is not about deciding to accumulate; a worm does not decide to accumulate, but rather to approach or reach or forage on food H or M. How do the authors comment on this?</p><p>Have the Authors performed the open-field accumulation assay in the presence of sodium azide?</p><p>The authors speak about latent learning (=a type of learning which is not apparent in the learner's behavior at the time of learning, but which manifests later when a suitable motivation and circumstances appear) in case of the non-trained animals, and about explicit learning (=a more conscious process where the individual makes and tests hypotheses in a deliberate search for answers) in case of the trained animals. This implies a dipole scheme of latent vs explicit. However, the authors do not justify the use of these two terms, nor do they provide evidence that in non-trained animals the learning is latent; in addition, there is no justification for the use of the term explicit in the second case. The worms have been simply conditioned or not conditioned, respectively. Even in lines 307-309 when they cite two papers by Worthy et al., stating that &quot;Explicit food quality learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is formally equivalent to a type of classical conditioning in which an association is formed between the mélange of odors characteristic of particular bacteria species (Worthy, Haynes, et al., 2018; Worthy, Rojas, et al., 2018)&quot;, this is perplexing, because I am not sure that these papers claim or demonstrate that explicit learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is equivalent to classical conditioning. Despite that, the authors state that they are trying to find the locus of explicit food quality learning (line 259). I think the use of the two terms, explicit and latent, should be better justified or other terms should be used instead. -&gt; see also reviewers #1/2</p><p>In relation to that, in lines 323-333, it is implied that food learning occurs while the animals forage on the food patches. What is it exactly that worms learn? Is this some form of non-associative learning? In addition, the effect on their preference developed as they forage on a specific food patch is something that should be present in both trained and non-trained animals. The authors state that &quot;It is possible, therefore, that food quality learning in cat-2 mutants is impaired simply because they spend less time in the food, hence have less experience of it&quot;, line 321. Does this mean the authors believe that food quality learning occurs during the worms' stay on the food patch during the open field or maze assay and not during training?</p><p>Have the authors tested only two types of food, i.e., two bacterial strains characterized as medium and high quality? If so, then the reported results could be due to other properties of the bacteria and not their nutritional value (case-specific results). Note that the nutritional value (energy, joules) is what the authors take into account in equation 1. Wouldn't their findings be stronger if the observed preferences were repeated for other pairs of food choices, i.e., by testing other/more bacterial strains?</p><p>Figure 4C and 4D: what is the difference between the two?

Our imaging data suggest that AWC-mediated retention would be stronger for H than M food, promoting greater preference for H food, as seen in Figure 2B-D.&quot; The authors rely on their finding that AWC was more strongly excited by H than M food, to jump to the conclusion that &quot;AWC-mediated retention would be stronger for H than M food, promoting greater preference for H food&quot;. In my view, this last claim could constitute a well-defined hypothesis to be tested, and not a conclusion based on their findings, even in combination to Gordus et al. In fact, it is Gordus and colleagues who highlight in their 2015 paper that although the activation pattern of AWC is deterministic (&quot;highly reliable&quot;), the resulting reversing behavior is, by contrast, probabilistic: &quot;The AWC calcium response, which is likely correlated with depolarization, is highly reliable from trial to trial, even after dozens of odor presentations (Larsch et al., 2013). By contrast, the reversal response is probabilistic. Even under well-controlled conditions, animals may or may not reverse on individual trials, regardless of the strength of the AWC calcium response (Larsch et al., 2013)&quot; and that &quot;Thus, the variability in the behavioral response results from variable transmission of information from the AWC sensory neuron to AVA command neurons.&quot; Based on the above, I do not understand the authors' claim. Maybe they can run an experiment to show that the claim is valid? The results presented in Figure 2, although they show increased retention, they do not allow the conclusion that the animals with stronger AWC activation are the ones that present increased retention. That individuality in the response is, in my view, what Gordus et al. indicate in their work.</p><p>Similarly, in the following paragraph, based only on the strength of AWC activation, they conclude that &quot;retention in H food patches would be stronger in trained than untrained animals, promoting greater preference for H food after training&quot;. However, stronger activation of AWC does not mean stronger retention (behavioral outcome), based on Gordus et al.</p><p>Line 1114: The mask was baited or the maze-shaped NGM area?

Did the authors alternate the position of H/M food in the two maze arms to eliminate any side preference effect?</p><p>Line 914: what do the authors mean by &quot;infra-human species&quot;?

I feel that it might be more appropriate if the language used is firm and confident, as the authors see fit, but milder.</p><p>Lines 914-922, and elsewhere in the text: The authors are trying to convince the reader that <italic>C. elegans</italic> makes consumption decisions in the same way that a human consumer does. What's more, they claim that such a human-conforming behavior can be captured in nematodes by just mapping the neuronal circuit that steers head bending. This is in the core of the paper, and in my view, it is problematic in many ways. The axioms of the revealed preference theory are justified by the assumption that humans are rational agents. This means that they make rational decisions. Do the authors claim the same for <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematodes? In parallel, the fact that <italic>C. elegans</italic> feed on two different food sources and they choose one over the other in a way that the goods qualify as substitutes, is a finding presented as of extreme importance. This is indeed an interesting conclusion, well supported by the data. It becomes more interesting because of the untangling of the neuronal circuit involved. At the same time, this is really not an unexpected result, although providing evidence for it is definitely useful. Any animal that feeds on multiple food sources would alternate between two of them, based on their availability, the effort required, the nutrition provided. Indeed, the authors themselves do not claim that this is unexpected. However, they claim that they &quot;break grounds&quot; because worms' behavior appears to conform with utility maximization principles and can be described with human-centered terms of substitute goods. This is misleading, first, because of the agent rationality assumed, which we have no basis for, and second, because identifying two goods as a substitutes pair is not ground-breaking on its own. Behavioral economics labels pairs of goods as such in order to move on with more complicated claims, theorems and analyses. The authors are interpreting <italic>C. elegans</italic> feeding behavior using behavioral economics terms that sound extravagant when speaking of nematodes, but in reality, their findings are not extravagant and certainly do not need to be dressed as such in order to be significant. In this reviewer's view, the findings presented in the manuscript are interesting and they constitute a significant contribution. Attempting to attribute to them a dimension disproportionate to their real depth, dampens the initial enthusiasm in an unnecessary way.</p><p>Line 979: What are the worms maximizing? This is a question that the authors admit comes up inevitably, but interestingly (and honestly, of course) at the same time they state that they do not have a plausible answer to it. Therefore, even the notion of utility (which is supposed to be maximized) remains obscure. In my understanding, this confirms the fundamental problem with the way this study is presented. The authors are not working toward testing a stated hypothesis (e.g., nematodes' behavior is such that maximizes x), but they rather quantify a nematode behavior in a way that fits the equations used in behavioral economics. What they don't take into account is that, sometimes, even if phenomenon A can be phenomenologically described by a set of equations that has been developed to describe (part of) phenomenon B, this does not mean that A is explained by the same physical or biological principles that steer phenomenon B. This is even more prominent if the organism involved in A is so very different regarding its brain faculties and societal construct than organism B. And even more so if the researchers fail to provide a satisfactory answer for the biological (in lack of maybe a psychological, societal or other) explanation for this behavior.</p><p>Finally, a few thoughts, which the authors are not requested to address, neither in the revised manuscript, nor in their rebuttal letter: Any scientific paper creates, upon its publication, new premises. Hence, even if the authors do not continue this work, there will be others who will, one way or another. I wonder what the premises of the present manuscript are/will be. What is the precedent created here? That <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a valid system to test behavioral economics hypotheses and apply axioms? That <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be used as a model system to understand, and maybe predict, human economic decisions? To establish <italic>C. elegans</italic> as an experimental system for behavioral economics? To what extend and to what end? The authors state in the introduction, &quot;A positive result [of this study] would establish a simple experimental system in which neuronal activity correlated with utility could be manipulated both physiologically and genetically to establish behavioral causality. Such a finding would also be interesting from a comparative perspective, extending the domain of utility-based decision making far beyond the boundaries of organisms that are generally considered to have cognition.&quot; Do they envision their work as the precursor for manipulating or directing human decision making? I truly appreciate that the authors made me reflect on all these (and many more) issues, and I trust that this work, when published, will instigate a lot of interesting discussions. The way we do research and the questions we choose to pose and answer can have a lot of impact, that goes beyond the citations a paper might receive. To conclude, I would like to share with the authors a note by Claude Shannon, the founder of Information Theory, written back in 1956: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1056774. He comments on the attempt to apply information theory to more distant fields, like biology, psychology, physics, etc. The term information theory can potentially be substituted with other terms with interdisciplinary appeal, such as game theory, behavioral economics, microeconomics, etc.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> chooses between bacterial foods as if maximizing economic utility&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They show that H and M bacteria release different volatile odorant profiles, indicating that worms potentially sense them as distinct olfactory objects, also supported by the pharyngeal pumping experiments using the food familiarity paradigm. Moreover, they improved the discussion to address some of my conceptual concerns when comparing their assay design with the human apple-orange experiment. However, the data are just indicative and to fully address my concern they would need to show, both with neuronal activity measurements, (I) that worms perceive H &amp; M as distinct odorant objects in the Y-chip and (II) that worms calculate utility based on the relative abundance of H and M. I did not mean to say in my previous comment that (I) and (II) have to be conscious processes (like in humans), but they should have explicit neuronal representations. I think the alternative and simpler model of detecting concentration differences between odorant X in the Y-chip is still a possibility. I understand that addressing this would be out of the scope of the current manuscript and could be interesting for future experiments. At the current stage, I find the here reported approach applied to <italic>C. elegans</italic> creative, novel, and thought-provoking and since I cannot detect (within my expertise) any technical problems in how the framework is implemented, I would enthusiastically support publication in eLife.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have nicely addressed my previous concerns, which were primarily technical.

The revised manuscript also includes updated figures and captions, new supplementary figures, etc. The manuscript is in much better shape, and much more information is provided, information that is critical to evaluate the results, their interpretation, and the final conclusions. The addition of new authors and expertise, as well as the change in the title are very welcome, too. Many of my concerns were addressed, and I appreciate the detailed explanations provided in some of the authors' responses. My understanding of their work is now much better. Nevertheless, the work continues to present fundamental problems. These are reflected mainly in comments #1, #5, and #11, which can be considered my major concerns. The rest of the comments can be considered minor or easier to answer.</p><p>1. Comment 1 of first revision and response 3.1:</p><p>The authors write in their rebuttal letter that they adopt the stance that if the agents' behavior adheres to the GARP, then they are rational (and not that rationality is a prerequisite). In their response, the authors list 3 papers to support the stance they claim to adopt, and all three of them have to do with humans, and the work reported has to do with reduced or altered observed rationality because of trauma, aging, etc. Displaying reduced rationality is fundamentally different than potentially lacking the very ability to be rational. I still feel that the issue of rationality needs to be addressed clearly in the manuscript. I explain:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, apart from two references to published work on <italic>C. elegans</italic> observed occasional rationality with many exceptions (lines 106-110), the only important part that addresses rationality is the new text in lines 228-234. Here, the authors mention (line 228) that &quot;tests of adherence to GARP have been utilized to assess the degree to which decision-making agents are rational in the economic sense&quot;, and later in the paper, they claim that nematodes adhere to GARP. The authors need to make clear whether they claim rationality for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, based on their findings, and if so, how is this rationality defined. And in addition, they need to make clear that whatever rationality is claimed for worms, it is not to be confused with what is broadly understood as rationality but is rather a term to describe a mathematically defined concept, the criteria for which are met by nematodes. If this is not absolutely clear, then the reader can be easily misled.</p><p>5. Line 301 (related also to response 3.18): &quot; [The preference of naïve worms] could be the result of prior experience or developmental maturation&quot;: I do not understand this. What kind of prior experience? If I understand correctly, the worms have been grown in the lab for their entire life, and for a number of prior generations. Have they been fed anything else than <italic>E. coli</italic> during some part of their life? Have they been exposed to H or M food before? Have their ancestors been exposed to H or M food? If not, then the &quot;prior experience&quot; argument cannot possibly apply. If yes, then this should be mentioned, as it would dramatically change the perspective. As for developmental maturation: If the authors believe this is true, then assessing worms ranging from L3 to Day 1 is obscuring, and distinct age cohorts should be assayed separately (L3, L4, Day 1). Moreover, if this were true, it would mean that older or younger animals prefer, for example, H. Therefore, the ratio of younger/older animals in the tested population could skew the results this way or the other. How do the authors comment on that? As for the trained worms, acquiring a preference because of sampling the two foods during the 60 min training assay seems the most reasonable thing to assume. However, the authors claim that this scenario does not apply, because of the findings of the familiarity experiments in the Y chip, but it is not clear to me why this is the case. Besides, the conclusion in line 522 that the foods are qualitatively distinct, would explain the development of a preference during the 60 min of the assay.</p><p>11. The new information provided in the revised manuscript on the budget constraint and the price of goods H and M, and how the budget constraint is imposed because of the Y-chip design, allowed me to get a new perspective of the Y-chip experiments. In consequence, several concerns arise. The process is as follows, roughly: A worm is placed in the chip, and two streams, one of H and one of M food, are provided. The preference is revealed by the worm bending its head toward the M or the H stream, and by performing pumps. The combination of pumps of H or M food is the preferred bundle. The whole process lasts for 12 mins. Therefore, it takes 12 min for the worms to behave in a way that reveals their preference. During these 12 mins, the preference is revealed through a sequential decision-making process, in which the worms sample the goods.</p><p>i) The sequential nature of this process is fundamentally different than the one-time decision made by human subjects in analogous experiments. In those, humans select the bundle of preference in a single decision. Nematodes, however, make many decisions, sequentially, that define the preferred bundle. How do the authors believe that this affects the interpretation of the results, with respect to adhering to the GARP prerequisites? I posit that this difference can have many implications as someone is trying to determine whether nematodes meet the same prerequisites that humans meet but while under very different experimental conditions. Some additional methodological concerns are listed below.</p><p>ii) During the sequential sampling, the worm needs to bend its body toward this or the other side, in order to perform a pump. Consequently, switching between sides, therefore foods, has a cost for the worm (note that bending just the head does not allow for switching between the two flows, as evident in Video 1). How do we know that this cost does not affect its decision-making with respect to switching between foods? In addition, even though the authors say that the body bending while in the chip resembles the body bending during the sinusoidal locomotion on a GNM plate, in Video 1 we can clearly see the worm bending multiple times toward one side before switching to the other side. This is not what happens during regular locomotion. This can be related to the worm preferring to feed on one food, but also to the cost of the effort required in order to bend to the other side. Given the constraint along the mid-body, this effort seems not to be negligible.</p><p>iii) How do we know that the worm is not biased by the content of the first few pumps? Is there a correlation between the first few pumps and the final preferred bundle?</p><p>iv) The initial body orientation of the worm is not controlled, as I would guess. How do we know that it does introduce a bias with respect to the initial conditions of the system?</p><p>The fact that the worm develops a preference over the course of 12 min, as it is tasting (sampling) the two foods, cannot be overlooked. According to the literature, this can be enough time, for worm standards, to develop behavioral plasticity. How could this affect the &quot;revealed preference&quot; and the adherence of the worm to the GARP prerequisites? Especially since human subjects, who participate in carefully controlled experiments, do not undergo a similar (sequential) process.</p><p>v) The (iv) relates to the development of a preference during training in a plate with patches, for the accumulation assay, see comment #5. The authors are reluctant to admit that worms can develop a preference because of sampling the two foods during the 60min training assay. They attempt to justify this reluctance based on the results of the familiarity experiments on the Y-chip. As mentioned in comment #5, I am not sure how the familiarity experiments lead to the conclusion that worms do not develop a preference during training. Does this have to do with the authors not acknowledging that worms might be developing a preference during the Y-chip experiments?</p><p>All the above (i-iv) leave the key claim &quot;Overall, this methodology results in decision-making paradigm that is formally analogous to GARP experiments in humans&quot;, line 1054, unsupported.</p><p>To conclude: the revised manuscript is in much better shape than the original draft, and I recognize the authors' efforts to respond to the reviewers' many comments. The amount of work performed is impressive. However, this paper still presents fundamental problems. These are reflected mainly in comments #1, #5, and #11. Worm's adherence to GARP prerequisites is proposed to be the case, but the methodologies through which this conclusion is drawn and the interpretation of some of the findings are problematic. Trying to adjust human GARP behavioral experiments so that they can be run with nematodes does not seem to work, in this reviewer's opinion. Many of the parameters that experimenters are trying to control when studying humans, in order for them to be able to reliably claim adherence to GARP, are not controlled in the nematode experiments presented here (comment #11), something that can dramatically affect the interpretation of the results. Furthermore, important clarifications need to be made so that the reader is not misled (comment #1), and some explanations the authors provide for some of the observed behaviors are inadequately substantiated (comment #5).</p><p>In light of the above, even if the authors addressed everything else satisfactorily, with concern #11 unresolved, I do not see how the main claim can be sufficiently supported and how this paper can be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. The claims that the authors are making are such that their substantiation should be above any ambiguity.</p><p>Sequential decision-making in the Y-chip is a fundamental concern. Here is why: The main claim the authors are making is that <italic>C. elegans</italic>' behavior abides by the GARP requirements. They claim so, based on their interpretation of experimental findings. By implementing a certain experimental design, they experimentally pose a question to the system, and the system (nematode consumers) responds by demonstrating a certain behavior, and this behavior is interpreted as GARP behavior because presumably, it is similar to the behavior displayed by the human counterparts. As a reference, when behavioral economists run experiments with human subjects, they apply a certain experimental design, they experimentally pose a question to the system (human consumers), and the system responds by demonstrating a certain behavior, and this behavior is defined as GARP behavior. Note that the experimental design followed by behavioral economists is very strictly controlled, to make sure that no undesired variables interfere with the results. However, the Y-chip experiments pose a different question to nematodes, than the question posed to human consumers: the Y-chip asks what the outcome is of a sequential decision-making process, whereas the GARP-defining human experiments ask what is the outcome of a one-time decision-making process. In other words, the problem is that Katzen et al. introduce a variable that is not present in the experimental design used in behavioral economics to decide whether the subject behaves as GARP: the variable of time. The worms display sequential decision-making, but GARP is supposed to explain a one-time decision-making behavior, not a sequential one. This discrepancy, ignoring the extra variable in the Katzen et al. experiment, is problematic and potentially very misleading.</p><p>I am particularly concerned because of the potential impact of the claim that authors make: nematodes make economic decisions that can be described by the same set of principles that describe human economic decisions. For such a huge claim to stand, it has to be supported in a concrete way, without gaps in the thought process.</p><p>Bottom line: I understand that the experimental design is what it is and that there is no way the Y-chip experiments are performed differently so that the worms could make a one-time decision. Therefore, I see two options: (A) In the current version of the manuscript, because of this discrepancy, the claim is weak and is not adequately supported, in my view. Therefore, I cannot suggest the manuscript be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. (B) The authors update the manuscript to admit the discrepancy, and they make it absolutely clear to the reader that the nematode system makes its decision according to a process very different than the one that human systems make their decision, in corresponding reference experiments that decide the subjects' GARP behavior. If the authors do that, then everything will be transparent, and the readers can decide for themselves whether the claim stands or not. In such a case, I am fine with publishing the work in <italic>eLife</italic>, if such is the suggestion made by everyone else.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69779.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors developed a clever experimental design that allows to precisely monitor the food consumption of worms presented with two streams of different bacterial strains of different nutritious value, H(igh) vs M(medium), and at varying concentrations. Previous work showed that worms prefer H bacteria. Animals are clamped into a microfluidic device where they are free to choose between the two streams by positioning their heads in either one of them; they can also modulate the rate of food ingestion by varying the rate of pharyngeal pumping. Under the assumption that the two types of bacteria are equally bite-sized, the &quot;price&quot; of food is directly related to the dilution of the bacterial suspension. I.e., the more diluted the food is the more pumps need to be invested to intake the same amount. A central finding of the study is presented in Figure 5B, showing that the intake of H monotonically increases with the price ratio of the H and M streams. The authors claim that this finding precludes violations of GARP and therefore strongly supports utility maximization within this GARP framework. However, I wonder how comparable the experimental design is to the GARP experiment shown in Figure 1. Here, subjects are presented with choosing between two option bundles of qualitatively different goods (apples and oranges); (a) humans are consciously aware of their limited budget and the trade-off between the two goods. I don't think that worms are faced with the same task in the present experimental design. (b) (1) there is no evidence that <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms qualitatively distinguish H and M bacteria, i.e. (c) we do not know whether in their brains H and M are represented as qualitatively different objects, like humans perceive apples and oranges. (d) Most likely H produces more of an attractive odorant X; therefore, worms likely are sensitive to the concentration difference of X between the two streams. (e) The AWC imaging experiments are supporting this; they were shown previously to be sensitive to food-borne odorant concentrations in a gradual manner. Thus, AWC neuronal activity does not represent H and M as qualitatively different objects (see Figure 8).</p></disp-quote><p>1.1.a. Economists do not regard conscious awareness of the budget as a prerequisite for testing adherence to GARP. In fact, human participants are not informed of the budget constraint in GARP tests (Harbaugh, Krause and Berry, 2001; Camille <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011). That is because the purpose of this constraint is solely to ensure that every option in a choice set cost the same amount, thereby establishing trade-offs between goods. This point is now explicitly made in the text, “Participants need not be made aware of the budget constraint; it can remain implicit in the set of available choices presented.”</p><p>1.1.b. The experiment of Figure 4A provides evidence for a model in which worms <italic>do</italic> qualitatively distinguish H from M bacteria. According to the alternative model (see d), the foods are qualitatively similar but one food generates a more intense perception than the other, perhaps by emitting more of the main compound (<italic>X</italic>) by which H and M are detected. Worms familiar with H or M food pump at the same rate in them (Figure 4A, left bars), indicating H and M are not perceptually distinct, which means they emit the same amount of X. In light of this result, the alternative model obviously fails to predict the familiarity effect for, as H and M are indistinguishable, neither of them can be unfamiliar to the worm. From the fact that worms pump at different rates on H and M when cross-cultured on the other food, we can conclude they are qualitatively distinct. The text has been edited to make this point, “The food familiarity effect supports a model in which H and M foods are qualitatively distinct to the worm. According to the alternative model, the foods are qualitatively similar…”.</p><p>1.1.c. The nature of the physical representations underlying the distinct perceptions is at present unknown, although neuronal representations are the obvious candidate. Nevertheless, this question is irrelevant to conclusions drawn from adherence to GARP as GARP makes no assumptions about choice mechanisms.</p><p>1.1.d. The manuscript now includes new data showing a chemical analysis of the volatile organic compounds emitted by the H and M bacteria used in our study (Table 1). Each of these bacteria emit many such compounds. This finding provides the olfactory substrate for qualitative differences in the worm’s perception of H and M bacteria, similar to the qualitative differences by which people distinguish between goods (e.g., colors and flavors of fruits in Figure 1). Three of the five main released compounds have been identified as chemoattracts in <italic>C. elegans</italic>; the others have yet to be tested. Surprisingly, M releases more of each attractant than H. Therefore, if worms choose based solely on odors, M should be more attractive than H.</p><p>1.1.e. We did not mean to imply that the neuronal representation of H and M food is restricted to a single chemosensory neuron class. In particular, we stated, “<italic>C. elegans</italic> has 12 pairs of anterior chemosensory neurons that respond to bacteria conditioned medium (Zaslaver <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015).” This complexity provides the substrate for population-code representations of H and M, which could make <italic>C. elegans</italic> an effective modal for investigating population codes in decision making. We now state, “In perhaps the most likely scenario, the worm’s internal representation of H and M food is distributed across some or all of the 12 pairs of foods sensitive chemosensory neurons in this organism. As a first step, we focused on one of these, AWC…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, unlike in Figure 1, (f) worms do not make a trade-off between H and M, they more likely detect high and low concentrations of X. This simple mechanism is sufficient to explain the data in Figure 5B. (g) This would lead also to consistent choices that maximize utility, i.e. foraging in areas that contain more of X which is likely to increase welfare in form of more nutritious food intake. (h) The experiment in Figure 5B could be done using just H bacteria with different dilution. (2) (i) In the experiments, worms are not faced with a binary choice among two bundles of goods that they can take home. They rather continuously forage the two streams by varying pumping rate and waving their heads. This means they are free to choose of how much they can intake from the H and M streams. (j) Worms are also not aware of the duration of the experiment. (k) This means there is no fixed budget, and their choices are not on a fixed budget line. I am therefore not convinced that the statement in lines 531-532: &quot; Under this mapping, the lines in Figure 5C correspond to choice sets like those in Figure 1.&quot; is correct.</p></disp-quote><p>1.1.f. Please see response 1.1.b.</p><p>1.1.g. We have argued above that the single-odor model is inconsistent with the familiar food effect (Figure 4A) and is not supported by our chemical analysis of released compounds. Furthermore, whereas efficient foraging generally increases food intake, it does not necessarily maximize utility. In economics, utility maximization has a specific technical meaning: that the individual’s choices over distinct commodities are consistent and transitive across a range of price-budget structures, i.e., choice sets. The proposed foraging example does not allow for this type of decision making because it entails neither price nor budget.</p><p>1.1.h. Doing the experiment of Figure 5B with a single species of bacteria would be interesting, but that would be very different paper, one that might fit with the probability matching literature (the matching law), whereas the present paper is concerned with rational choice between different goods.</p><p>1.1.i. We agree worms were free to eat as much as desired. This would be a potential concern relative to establishing a fixed budget only if a fixed budget were required in order to ensure that trade-offs occur. But in our study, trade-offs were introduced by the geometry of the Y-chip. A conventional budget constraint was not required.</p><p>1.1.j. We agree that worms are not aware of the duration of the experiment. Not only is time awareness an inappropriate assumption for nematodes, awareness of time is not necessary in order to establish the required trade-off between H and M food. That is because the trade-off is established by the geometry of the Y-chip.</p><p>1.1.k. The purpose of the budget constraint in human experiments is to ensure that there are trade-offs between goods in each choice set. In our experiments, however, trade-offs are ensured by the geometry of the Y-chip. As the two fluid streams are in contact and completely fill the food channel, the worm is always feeding in one stream or the other. Therefore, for every second spent pumping in H food, the worm forgoes a second pumping in M food, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Therefore, there are trade-offs in the experiment and, because of these, all possible choices lie one of the budget lines. In human experiments the trade-off between consuming more of one good at the expense of less of another is enforced by the budget constraint. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiments, however, imposing a budget constraint is not necessary, as trade-offs are enforced by the Y-chip. The chip contains only two streams, one for H and one for M food, such that for every pump spent on H food, the worm necessarily forgoes a pump spent on M food, and <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These (1-2) major differences to the GARP experimental design in Figure 1 largely confuse me and I wonder how useful for understanding neuronal mechanisms is it to rigidly analyse the data with the mathematical tools of this framework.

Bacterial concentration: precision and accuracy in the measurement of bacterial concentration is critical to essentially all analyses carried out here. One of the most fundamental variables in the model, price, is a simple function of this. Exactly how bacterial suspensions of different concentrations/densities are prepared is not clear, but the authors repeatedly use OD600 as a measurement of bacterial concentration (this is explicitly stated in lines 341-2). This has the potential to be a significant concern, as OD600 has a linear relationship with bacterial density only in very narrow range of relatively low density -- above this (certainly ODs of 1 or 3, which are used regularly here) there can be vast deviations from linearity. As noted by one of the references this paper cites (Stevenson et al. 2016), OD600 can even have a parabolic relationship to concentration in some density regimes because of the complexities of light scattering by bacteria. It's hard to tell whether this has been accounted for here – it seems that the authors are assuming, for example, that a suspension of OD 3 has 30x as much food as one of OD 0.1, which almost certainly not case. Further, when considering how this applies to H vs. M food, the authors calculate the difference in mass/OD ratio between H and M food at OD = 1, but this ratio seems very unlikely to hold at different ODs. If bacterial concentration has been mis-estimated because of these problems, it's possible that errors in price would propagate through all of the subsequent analyses. If the authors have indeed accounted for these complications, that's great – in this case, they'd need provide additional details about how this was done. If not, however, additional work will have to be done to figure this out.</p></disp-quote><p>2.1.

The initial transients died out in 1 min or less, well before most animals had begun to feed. As feeding is almost certainly required to assess value, at least in the case of untrained animals, we believe these transients are likely irrelevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Also, the presentation of the two stimuli with equal times for each doesn't really mimic the steady-state situation when an animal has a strong preference for one of them (in this case, the nose would be exposed to the preferred stimulus for most of the time).

We agree that it would be interesting to image under conditions of asymmetric dwell times, as these occur in Y-chip experiments. However, in considering whether to implement asymmetric or equal dwell times in the imaging experiments, we chose the latter because we were primarily interested in the question of whether AWC is capable of reporting food utility via its inherent sensitivity to each food, that is, before the rest of the worm acts on this information; in other words, without the confound of the feedback loop between stimulus and behavior. We now explain this reasoning more in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Fourth, in rationalizing 9E, authors say that they asked whether AWC might encode &quot;some other economic quantity&quot;.

The reviewer appears to adopt the first stance, “If an agent is rational, then his/her preferences will be consistent and transitive, they will satisfy GARP.” The second stance derives from the fact that having preferences that satisfy GARP is the necessary and sufficient condition for rationality. The force of necessity and sufficiency here is that GARP, can be used as a test for rationality, “If an agent’s preferences satisfy GARP, then he/her is rational.” Our study takes this second stance. We use GARP as, literally, a <italic>litmus test</italic> for utility maximization, one among many forms of rationality (Kacelnik, 2006). We use it solely for this limited purpose, following precedents set by other experimentalists (Camille <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011; Chung, Tymula and Glimcher, 2017; Pastor-Bernier, Stasiak and Schultz, 2019)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 102: Citation that can potentially be added: Ghosh et al., 2016, Neuron, PMID: 27866800 (for risk assessment).</p></disp-quote><p>3.2.

Among the major criticisms this notion has received, is that it relies on the assumption that natural selection and evolution have somehow resulted in a decision-making process that maximizes fitness. However, natural selection has not necessarily led to such a result when it comes to the feeding strategy or food choices of an organism, because it is a process of selection and not a mechanism that produces optimal results, e.g., behaviors. Therefore, it is debatable whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> food choices maximize fitness.</p><p>Reviewer #1 and #3 discussed and reviewer #3 recommends to rephrase, e.g. &quot;promote fitness&quot; instead of &quot;maximize&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>3.3. Satisfaction of GARP indicates that there exists at least one utility function that renders the observed behavior perfectly maximizing. One of the limits of this approach is that we don’t get an exact specification of the utility function. This is true in two different respects. First, in mathematical terms, there can be a variety of different utility functions that fit the choice data equally well. Second, in mechanistic terms (psychological, biological), the units of the z-axis of the utility function remain obscure. One of the exciting aspects of the neuroeconomics approach, here and in general, is that by identifying the neural correlates of utility representations we can gain insights into the physical units of utility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 145: redundant word: during</p><p>Line 146: bends, should be plural</p><p>Line 150: a period is missing at the end of the sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>3.4-3.7.

In the original (and only) study of comparative food quality (Avery and Shtonda, 2003; Shtonda, 2004), quality was defined in terms of growth rate, computed as the inverse of the number of days to reach adulthood. Growth rates ranged from 0.28 day<sup>-1</sup> to 0.50 day<sup>-1</sup> (Shtonda, 2004). The H and M foods in our study, DA1877 and DA1885, have growth rates of 0.50 and 0.43, respectively. OP50 was not included in that study, but a derivative of OP50, DA837, has a growth rate of 0.45.

In this case, maybe the sequence of preference choices does not constitute a violation of the utility maximization. In this case, worms do not choose driven by an urge to maximize their fitness, but rather by a tendency to maintain a familiar environment. How does this fit with the authors claims and assumption?</p></disp-quote><p>3.13. We do not claim that worms maximize fitness, at lease in the simple sense of optimizing food consumption.

Subjective preferences can be aligned with fitness, but they can also diverge from that norm. In humans, for example, drugs of abuse cause divergent preferences. In worms, the preference for familiar food even when it is lower in quality than other foods can be seen as a divergent preference. Adherence to GARP means only that preferences are internally consistent, regardless of whether they are aligned with or divergent from fitness. Therefore, we see no contradiction in our claims.

This implies a dipole scheme of latent vs explicit. However, the authors do not justify the use of these two terms, nor do they provide evidence that in non-trained animals the learning is latent; in addition, there is no justification for the use of the term explicit in the second case. The worms have been simply conditioned or not conditioned, respectively. Even in lines 307-309 when they cite two papers by Worthy et al., stating that &quot;Explicit food quality learning in C. elegans is formally equivalent to a type of classical conditioning in which an association is formed between the mélange of odors characteristic of particular bacteria species (Worthy, Haynes, et al., 2018; Worthy, Rojas, et al., 2018)&quot;, this is perplexing, because I am not sure that these papers claim or demonstrate that explicit learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is equivalent to classical conditioning.

In a simple non-associative model, increased bias for H could be the result of sensitization to H food, habituation/adaptation to M food, or both. In an associative model (e.g., classical conditioning), odors specifically emitted by H and M food would serve as conditioned stimuli, CS1 and CS2. The unconditioned stimulus is the presumptive reinforcing effects of consuming H or M food. At present, we cannot definitively distinguish between these two possibilities. The section “Establishment of subjective value assignments” in the Discussion now includes these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the effect on their preference developed as they forage on a specific food patch is something that should be present in both trained and non-trained animals.

In my view, this last claim could constitute a well-defined hypothesis to be tested, and not a conclusion based on their findings, even in combination to Gordus et al. In fact, it is Gordus and colleagues who highlight in their 2015 paper that although the activation pattern of AWC is deterministic (&quot;highly reliable&quot;), the resulting reversing behavior is, by contrast, probabilistic: &quot;The AWC calcium response, which is likely correlated with depolarization, is highly reliable from trial to trial, even after dozens of odor presentations (Larsch et al., 2013). By contrast, the reversal response is probabilistic. Even under well-controlled conditions, animals may or may not reverse on individual trials, regardless of the strength of the AWC calcium response (Larsch et al., 2013)&quot; and that &quot;Thus, the variability in the behavioral response results from variable transmission of information from the AWC sensory neuron to AVA command neurons.&quot; Based on the above, I do not understand the authors' claim. Maybe they can run an experiment to show that the claim is valid?

The authors are trying to convince the reader that <italic>C. elegans</italic> makes consumption decisions in the same way that a human consumer does. What's more, they claim that such a human-conforming behavior can be captured in nematodes by just mapping the neuronal circuit that steers head bending. This is in the core of the paper, and in my view, it is problematic in many ways. The axioms of the revealed preference theory are justified by the assumption that humans are rational agents. This means that they make rational decisions. Do the authors claim the same for <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematodes?</p></disp-quote><p>3.37.a. This concern seems similar to point 3.1.

In parallel, the fact that <italic>C. elegans</italic> feed on two different food sources and they choose one over the other in a way that the goods qualify as substitutes, is a finding presented as of extreme importance. This is indeed an interesting conclusion, well supported by the data. It becomes more interesting because of the untangling of the neuronal circuit involved. At the same time, this is really not an unexpected result, although providing evidence for it is definitely useful. Any animal that feeds on multiple food sources would alternate between two of them, based on their availability, the effort required, the nutrition provided. Indeed, the authors themselves do not claim that this is unexpected. However, they claim that they &quot;break grounds&quot; because worms' behavior appears to conform with utility maximization principles and can be described with human-centered terms of substitute goods. This is misleading, first, because of the agent rationality assumed, which we have no basis for, and second, because identifying two goods as a substitutes pair is not ground-breaking on its own. Behavioral economics labels pairs of goods as such in order to move on with more complicated claims, theorems and analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>3.37.b. We wish to emphasize, as noted in 3.37.a and also in 3.1 that our approach does not assume rationality; rather, it tests whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> choice behavior is consistent with a particular model of rational choice, namely utility maximization. As stated in the Discussion, from our perspective the most prominent aspects of our study are (1) <italic>C. elegans</italic> food choices obey the classic law of supply and demand; (2) <italic>C. elegans</italic> behaves as if maximizing utility; (3) <italic>C. elegans</italic> food-consumption decisions are well fit by the CES utility function; (4) A plausible mechanism for utility maximization has been identified.

The authors are interpreting <italic>C. elegans</italic> feeding behavior using behavioral economics terms that sound extravagant when speaking of nematodes, but in reality, their findings are not extravagant and certainly do not need to be dressed as such in order to be significant.

Attempting to attribute to them a dimension disproportionate to their real depth, dampens the initial enthusiasm in an unnecessary way.</p></disp-quote><p>3.37c. We wish to disagree, respectfully, with the concern that we are applying revealed preference theory inappropriately (“extravagantly”). On the contrary, we have taken revealed preference theory at its word, and applied it to a remarkably simple organism that nevertheless passes the test for utility maximization. This finding is significant not only for what reveals about the sophistication of <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior, but also for our understanding of revealed preference theory itself. Economists will almost certainly be prompted to reexamine the perceived view that revealed preference decisions require awareness and cognition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 979: What are the worms maximizing? This is a question that the authors admit comes up inevitably, but interestingly (and honestly, of course) at the same time they state that they do not have a plausible answer to it. Therefore, even the notion of utility (which is supposed to be maximized) remains obscure. In my understanding, this confirms the fundamental problem with the way this study is presented. The authors are not working toward testing a stated hypothesis (e.g., nematodes' behavior is such that maximizes x), but they rather quantify a nematode behavior in a way that fits the equations used in behavioral economics. What they don't take into account is that, sometimes, even if phenomenon A can be phenomenologically described by a set of equations that has been developed to describe (part of) phenomenon B, this does not mean that A is explained by the same physical or biological principles that steer phenomenon B. This is even more prominent if the organism involved in A is so very different regarding its brain faculties and societal construct than organism B. And even more so if the researchers fail to provide a satisfactory answer for the biological (in lack of maybe a psychological, societal or other) explanation for this behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>3.38. We wish to disagree, respectfully, with the reviewer in couple of respects. (i) “The authors are not working toward testing a stated hypothesis.” On the contrary, we have tested the hypothesis that <italic>C. elegans</italic> decision behavior satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for utility maximization. In other words, we tested the hypothesis that <italic>C. elegans</italic> choices maximize something. (ii) Although we have established that <italic>C. elegans</italic> choices satisfy the behavioral conditions for utility maximization we do not, on this basis, conclude anything about the biological mechanisms of this phenomenon. To do otherwise would be to misunderstand the limitations of revealed preference theory, which by design is not concerned with mechanism. Nevertheless, our finding of utility maximization in one of the most experimentally tractable organisms in contemporary neuroscience has potentially significant implications. It sets the stage for discovering how at least one nervous system implements this extraordinarily important behavior.</p><p>References</p><p>Avery, L. and Shtonda, B. B.

The revised manuscript also includes updated figures and captions, new supplementary figures, etc. The manuscript is in much better shape, and much more information is provided, information that is critical to evaluate the results, their interpretation, and the final conclusions. The addition of new authors and expertise, as well as the change in the title are very welcome, too. Many of my concerns were addressed, and I appreciate the detailed explanations provided in some of the authors' responses. My understanding of their work is now much better. Nevertheless, the work continues to present fundamental problems. These are reflected mainly in comments #1, #5, and #11, which can be considered my major concerns. The rest of the comments can be considered minor or easier to answer.</p><p>1. Comment 1 of first revision and response 3.1:</p><p>The authors write in their rebuttal letter that they adopt the stance that if the agents' behavior adheres to the GARP, then they are rational (and not that rationality is a prerequisite). In their response, the authors list 3 papers to support the stance they claim to adopt, and all three of them have to do with humans, and the work reported has to do with reduced or altered observed rationality because of trauma, aging, etc. Displaying reduced rationality is fundamentally different than potentially lacking the very ability to be rational. I still feel that the issue of rationality needs to be addressed clearly in the manuscript. I explain:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, apart from two references to published work on <italic>C. elegans</italic> observed occasional rationality with many exceptions (lines 106-110), the only important part that addresses rationality is the new text in lines 228-234. Here, the authors mention (line 228) that &quot;tests of adherence to GARP have been utilized to assess the degree to which decision-making agents are rational in the economic sense&quot;, and later in the paper, they claim that nematodes adhere to GARP. The authors need to make clear whether they claim rationality for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, based on their findings, and if so, how is this rationality defined. And in addition, they need to make clear that whatever rationality is claimed for worms, it is not to be confused with what is broadly understood as rationality but is rather a term to describe a mathematically defined concept, the criteria for which are met by nematodes. If this is not absolutely clear, then the reader can be easily misled.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph that makes clear that GARP establishes a limited type of rationality, which we refer to as <italic>technical rationality</italic>. We state that technical rationality neither presupposes nor establishes rationality in the psychological sense of awareness and reasoning (lines 222-230).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 301 (related also to response 3.18): &quot; [The preference of naïve worms] could be the result of prior experience or developmental maturation&quot;: I do not understand this. What kind of prior experience? If I understand correctly, the worms have been grown in the lab for their entire life, and for a number of prior generations. Have they been fed anything else than <italic>E. coli</italic> during some part of their life? Have they been exposed to H or M food before? Have their ancestors been exposed to H or M food? If not, then the &quot;prior experience&quot; argument cannot possibly apply. If yes, then this should be mentioned, as it would dramatically change the perspective. As for developmental maturation: If the authors believe this is true, then assessing worms ranging from L3 to Day 1 is obscuring, and distinct age cohorts should be assayed separately (L3, L4, Day 1). Moreover, if this were true, it would mean that older or younger animals prefer, for example, H. Therefore, the ratio of younger/older animals in the tested population could skew the results this way or the other. How do the authors comment on that? As for the trained worms, acquiring a preference because of sampling the two foods during the 60 min training assay seems the most reasonable thing to assume. However, the authors claim that this scenario does not apply, because of the findings of the familiarity experiments in the Y chip, but it is not clear to me why this is the case. Besides, the conclusion in line 522 that the foods are qualitatively distinct, would explain the development of a preference during the 60 min of the assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted the sentence quoted above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The new information provided in the revised manuscript on the budget constraint and the price of goods H and M, and how the budget constraint is imposed because of the Y-chip design, allowed me to get a new perspective of the Y-chip experiments. In consequence, several concerns arise. The process is as follows, roughly: A worm is placed in the chip, and two streams, one of H and one of M food, are provided. The preference is revealed by the worm bending its head toward the M or the H stream, and by performing pumps. The combination of pumps of H or M food is the preferred bundle. The whole process lasts for 12 mins. Therefore, it takes 12 min for the worms to behave in a way that reveals their preference. During these 12 mins, the preference is revealed through a sequential decision-making process, in which the worms sample the goods.</p><p>i) The sequential nature of this process is fundamentally different than the one-time decision made by human subjects in analogous experiments. In those, humans select the bundle of preference in a single decision. Nematodes, however, make many decisions, sequentially, that define the preferred bundle. How do the authors believe that this affects the interpretation of the results, with respect to adhering to the GARP prerequisites? I posit that this difference can have many implications as someone is trying to determine whether nematodes meet the same prerequisites that humans meet but while under very different experimental conditions. Some additional methodological concerns are listed below.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an important point here. Yes, the worm can be said to make a series of decisions during the 12 min. testing period, whereas GARP tests on humans involve one-shot decisions. This could be confusing to readers. However, the history of GARP and its relation to behavioral economics is illuminating here. As the reviewer will know, GARP is a refinement of the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference (SARP) which, in turn is a refinement of Samuelson’s 1938<sup>1</sup> Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP). In that work, which launched revealed preference theory, consumption is amount purchased per unit time:</p><p>“I assume in the beginning as known, i.e., empirically determinable under ideal conditions, the amounts of <italic>n</italic> economic goods which will be purchased per unit time by an individual faced with the prices of these goods and with a given total expenditure.”</p><p>Clearly, Samuelson had in mind the accumulation of goods over time and, therefore, a series of consumption decisions. Later, revealed preference theory was used to build models of ‘lifetime consumption,’ <sup>2–4</sup> including retirement spending. As this type of spending also occurs over time, it too implicitly involves a series of consumption decisions.</p><p>As our consumption metric integrates the rates of consumption of H and M foods over a fixed time, it is consistent with Samuelson’s original theory. Our definition of preference includes whatever micro-decisions are made during that time. This situation is akin to defining consumption in humans, as economists do, in terms of what is in the grocery cart as a consumer leaves the store. Placing items in the cart is a sequential process (one orange at time, so to speak), and initial biases and non-stationary preferences are irrelevant. Of course, by changing the definition of preference one could take those phenomena into account, but revealed preference theory does not require this.</p><p>It was not until the studies of Andreoni, Glimcher, Harbaugh, and Kariv that the classical theory of revealed preference was realized in terms of one-shot decisions. The one-shot decision framework was adopted purely for experimental purposes. Therefore, GARP can be investigated either way: in terms of sequential decisions over time, or in terms of one-shot decisions.</p><p>We have added to the manuscript a paragraph that explains why sequential decisions are consistent with revealed preference theory (lines 222-230).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) During the sequential sampling, the worm needs to bend its body toward this or the other side, in order to perform a pump. Consequently, switching between sides, therefore foods, has a cost for the worm (note that bending just the head does not allow for switching between the two flows, as evident in Video 1). How do we know that this cost does not affect its decision-making with respect to switching between foods? In addition, even though the authors say that the body bending while in the chip resembles the body bending during the sinusoidal locomotion on a GNM plate, in Video 1 we can clearly see the worm bending multiple times toward one side before switching to the other side. This is not what happens during regular locomotion. This can be related to the worm preferring to feed on one food, but also to the cost of the effort required in order to bend to the other side. Given the constraint along the mid-body, this effort seems not to be negligible.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that, in theory, there could be energetic costs for switching sides. There could also be opportunity costs. And, during sequential decision making, these costs may contribute to relative preference for each food, in a process akin to effort discounting. But revealed preference theory by design is blind to underlying factors contributing to preferences. Therefore, costs, if they do occur, do not undermine our finding of utility maximization. One could argue that costs might be different in a differently shaped chip and, therefore, that relative preferences might be different as well. But we do not claim that our methodology measures the worm’s preferences independent of testing conditions. Nor would such a claim be a necessary condition for utility maximization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) How do we know that the worm is not biased by the content of the first few pumps? Is there a correlation between the first few pumps and the final preferred bundle?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. Our study does not have the statistical resolution to answer it, but we believe this question is not relevant to our finding of utility maximization. That’s because the food first eaten in the chip can be assimilated to the individualized history of the worm, its accumulated experience over its lifetime, including during testing. This history is part of what makes preferences subjective. And, as noted above, revealed preference theory is blind to underlying factors contributing to individual preferences.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the type of bias the reviewer imagines does not necessarily have an effect on population-level preference. Here’s the proof.</p><p>Let’s assume that worm <italic>is</italic> biased by the content of the first few pumps, such that it strongly prefers what it first ate. As stated in Materials and methods, worms are accommodated to the Y-chip in food-free buffer. After accommodation, foods are introduced. We can reasonably assume that the initial pumps will be left-right randomized, according to posture of the worm when food first reaches it.

Thus, the initial experience of each worm in the chip could be a factor that shapes preference. But, as noted above (lines 223-225) revealed preference theory is blind to underlying factors contributing to preferences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) The initial body orientation of the worm is not controlled, as I would guess. How do we know that it does introduce a bias with respect to the initial conditions of the system?</p></disp-quote><p>This concern seems analogous to (iii). Initial posture can be assimilated to the worm’s subjective history, with no implications for the applicability of revealed preference theory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) The fact that the worm develops a preference over the course of 12 min, as it is tasting (sampling) the two foods, cannot be overlooked. According to the literature, this can be enough time, for worm standards, to develop behavioral plasticity. How could this affect the &quot;revealed preference&quot; and the adherence of the worm to the GARP prerequisites? Especially since human subjects, who participate in carefully controlled experiments, do not undergo a similar (sequential) process.</p></disp-quote><p>As point of clarification, it is not a <italic>fact</italic> that preference “develops” during the 12 min. testing period. At this point, we don’t know whether or not this happens because, again, our data do not have the required statistical resolution. But, even if preference is modulated by experience in the chip, that experience can be assimilated to the worm’s subjective history, with no implications for the applicability of revealed preference theory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v) The (iv) relates to the development of a preference during training in a plate with patches, for the accumulation assay, see comment #5. The authors are reluctant to admit that worms can develop a preference because of sampling the two foods during the 60min training assay. (1) They attempt to justify this reluctance based on the results of the familiarity experiments on the Y-chip. As mentioned in comment #5, I am not sure how the familiarity experiments lead to the conclusion that worms do not develop a preference during training. (2) Does this have to do with the authors not acknowledging that worms might be developing a preference during the Y-chip experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>1. It is conceivable that learning-through-sampling occurs during the 60 min food-preference assays. We now say this in the text (lines 302-303). But whether or not learning occurs during this assay has no bearing on the main conclusion of the paper – that the worm behaves as if maximizing utility – because that conclusion is based a different assay.</p><p>2. We agree that the logic behind the statement that familiarity experiments argue against preference acquisition during the Y-chip assay was unclear; it has been deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All the above (i-iv) leave the key claim &quot;Overall, this methodology results in decision-making paradigm that is formally analogous to GARP experiments in humans&quot;, line 1054, unsupported.</p><p>To conclude: the revised manuscript is in much better shape than the original draft, and I recognize the authors' efforts to respond to the reviewers' many comments. The amount of work performed is impressive. However, this paper still presents fundamental problems. These are reflected mainly in comments #1, #5, and #11. Worm's adherence to GARP prerequisites is proposed to be the case, but the methodologies through which this conclusion is drawn and the interpretation of some of the findings are problematic. Trying to adjust human GARP behavioral experiments so that they can be run with nematodes does not seem to work, in this reviewer's opinion. Many of the parameters that experimenters are trying to control when studying humans, in order for them to be able to reliably claim adherence to GARP, are not controlled in the nematode experiments presented here (comment #11), something that can dramatically affect the interpretation of the results. Furthermore, important clarifications need to be made so that the reader is not misled (comment #1), and some explanations the authors provide for some of the observed behaviors are inadequately substantiated (comment #5).</p><p>In light of the above, even if the authors addressed everything else satisfactorily, with concern #11 unresolved, I do not see how the main claim can be sufficiently supported and how this paper can be published in eLife. The claims that the authors are making are such that their substantiation should be above any ambiguity.</p><p>Reviewer #3's additional comments from the consultation session:</p><p>Sequential decision-making in the Y-chip is a fundamental concern. Here is why: The main claim the authors are making is that <italic>C. elegans</italic>' behavior abides by the GARP requirements. They claim so, based on their interpretation of experimental findings. By implementing a certain experimental design, they experimentally pose a question to the system, and the system (nematode consumers) responds by demonstrating a certain behavior, and this behavior is interpreted as GARP behavior because presumably, it is similar to the behavior displayed by the human counterparts. As a reference, when behavioral economists run experiments with human subjects, they apply a certain experimental design, they experimentally pose a question to the system (human consumers), and the system responds by demonstrating a certain behavior, and this behavior is defined as GARP behavior. Note that the experimental design followed by behavioral economists is very strictly controlled, to make sure that no undesired variables interfere with the results. However, the Y-chip experiments pose a different question to nematodes, than the question posed to human consumers: the Y-chip asks what the outcome is of a sequential decision-making process, whereas the GARP-defining human experiments ask what is the outcome of a one-time decision-making process. In other words, the problem is that Katzen et al. introduce a variable that is not present in the experimental design used in behavioral economics to decide whether the subject behaves as GARP: the variable of time. The worms display sequential decision-making, but GARP is supposed to explain a one-time decision-making behavior, not a sequential one. This discrepancy, ignoring the extra variable in the Katzen et al. experiment, is problematic and potentially very misleading.</p><p>I am particularly concerned because of the potential impact of the claim that authors make: nematodes make economic decisions that can be described by the same set of principles that describe human economic decisions. For such a huge claim to stand, it has to be supported in a concrete way, without gaps in the thought process.</p><p>Bottom line: I understand that the experimental design is what it is and that there is no way the Y-chip experiments are performed differently so that the worms could make a one-time decision. Therefore, I see two options: (A) In the current version of the manuscript, because of this discrepancy, the claim is weak and is not adequately supported, in my view. Therefore, I cannot suggest the manuscript be published in eLife. (B) The authors update the manuscript to admit the discrepancy, and they make it absolutely clear to the reader that the nematode system makes its decision according to a process very different than the one that human systems make their decision, in corresponding reference experiments that decide the subjects' GARP behavior. If the authors do that, then everything will be transparent, and the readers can decide for themselves whether the claim stands or not. In such a case, I am fine with publishing the work in eLife, if such is the suggestion made by everyone else.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the distinction the reviewer has made and the confusion it could cause, and we are grateful to the reviewer for pointing this out to us. However, as described above (lines 173-207), quantification of consumption over time (sequential decisions), is consistent with classical revealed preference theory. Accordingly, relative to (A), the use of this method does not in any way weaken the claim of utility maximization in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and, regarding (B) there is no discrepancy to admit.</p><p>That said, we agree that the manuscript could be improved by clarifying the relationship between one-shot decisions and sequential decisions relative to classical revealed preference theory.
