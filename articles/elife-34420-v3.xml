These mutational effects can shift as the virus evolves. However, the prevalence of such shifts in mutational effects remains unclear. Here, we quantify the effects on viral growth of all amino acid mutations to two HIV envelope (Env) proteins that differ at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>100 residues. Most mutations similarly affect both Envs, but the amino acid preferences of a minority of sites have clearly shifted. These shifted sites usually prefer a specific amino acid in one Env, but tolerate many amino acids in the other. Surprisingly, shifts are only slightly enriched at sites that have substituted between the Envs—and many occur at residues that do not even contact substitutions. Therefore, long-range epistasis can unpredictably shift Env’s mutational tolerance during HIV evolution, although the amino acid preferences of most sites are conserved between moderately diverged viral strains.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34420.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The virus that causes AIDS, or HIV, has a protein called Env on its surface, which is essential for the virus to infect cells. Env can also be recognized by the immune system, which then targets the virus for destruction or blocks it from infecting cells. Unfortunately, Env evolves very quickly, which means that HIV can evade our defenses. However, there are limits to how much this protein can change, since it still needs to perform its essential role in helping viruses enter cells.</p><p>In the century since HIV first appeared in human populations, the virus has evolved considerably. There are now many HIV strains that infect people, and they bear Env proteins with substantially different sequences. However, it is not clear if these changes in sequence have resulted in Envs from distinct strains being able to tolerate different mutations.</p><p>To examine this question, Haddox et al. compared how the Envs from two strains of HIV react to modifications in their sequences. They created all possible individual mutations in the proteins, and the resulting collections of mutated viruses were then tested for their ability to infect cells in the laboratory.</p><p>Most mutations had similar effects in both Env proteins. This allowed Haddox et al. to identify portions of the protein that easily accommodate changes, and portions that must remain unchanged for viruses to remain infectious—at least in the laboratory. Some of these mutations are under different types of pressures when the virus faces the immune system, and those were identified using computational approaches.</p><p>However, some mutations were tolerated differently by the two Env proteins. Therefore, viral strains differ in how their Env proteins can evolve. The parts of Env that showed differences in mutational tolerance between the strains were not necessarily the parts that differ in sequence. This shows that changes in sequence in one part of the protein can modify how other portions evolve.</p><p>It remains to be determined whether changes in tolerance to mutations translate into differences in how the virus can escape immunity. This is an important question given that the rapid evolution of Env is a major obstacle to creating a vaccine for HIV.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>deep mutational scanning</kwd><kwd>BG505</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>transmitted-founder virus</kwd><kwd>ExpCM</kwd><kwd>positive selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI127893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1256082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dingens</surname><given-names>Adam S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Scholar Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Scholar Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1111923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1-DA039543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Overbaugh</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haddox</surname><given-names>Hugh K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep mutational scanning of Env proteins from two transmitted-founder strains of HIV shows how the accessible evolutionary space changes as the virus evolves.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIV’s envelope (Env) protein evolves very rapidly. The major group of HIV-1 that is responsible for the current pandemic originated from a virus that entered the human population <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>100 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sharp and Hahn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Worobey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Faria et al., 2014</xref>). The descendants of this virus have evolved so rapidly that their Envs now have as little as 65% protein identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lynch et al., 2009</xref>). For comparison, protein orthologs shared between humans and mice have only diverged to a median identity of 78% over 90 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Waterston et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hedges et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Env’s rapid evolution has dire consequences for anti-HIV immunity, since it erodes the efficacy of most neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wei et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Richman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burton et al., 2005</xref>). Because of this public-health importance, numerous studies have experimentally characterized aspects of the ‘evolutionary landscape’ that Env traverses. The immediate evolutionary space accessible to any given Env is largely defined by the effects on viral fitness of all single amino acid mutations to Env. Most mutational studies have measured how just a small number of these mutations affect viral growth in cell culture, although it has recently become possible to use deep mutational scanning to measure the effects of many (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Mawsawi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Duenas-Decamp et al., 2016</xref>) or even all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haddox et al., 2016</xref>) single amino acid mutations to an Env variant.</p><p>But interpreting these studies in the context of Env evolution requires addressing a fundamental question: How informative are mutational studies of a single protein variant about constraints on long-term evolution? During protein evolution, substitutions at one site can change the effect of mutations at other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Natarajan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Harms and Thornton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Starr and Thornton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klink and Bazykin, 2017</xref>). We will follow the nomenclature of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pollock et al., 2012</xref>) to refer to these changes in mutational effects as <italic>shifts</italic> in a site’s amino acid preferences. Such shifts can accumulate as substitutions become entrenched via epistatic interactions with subsequent changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Starr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pollock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bazykin, 2015</xref>)—although the magnitude of these shifts is usually limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Risso et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given that the Envs of circulating HIV strains represent a vast collection of homologs that often differ at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>100 residues, shifts in amino acid preferences could make the outcome of any study highly dependent on the Env used. Indeed, epistasis among a few combinations of Env mutations has been experimentally demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">da Silva et al., 2010</xref>), and epistatic fitness landscapes have been computationally inferred for a variety of HIV proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kouyos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferguson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barton et al., 2015</xref>) including Env (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Louie et al., 2018</xref>). However, the only protein-wide experimental studies of how amino acid preferences shift during evolution have examined proteins that are structurally far simpler than Env, which forms a large heavily glycosylated heterotrimeric complex that transitions through multiple conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Munro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ozorowski et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use an improved version of a previously described deep mutational scanning strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haddox et al., 2016</xref>) to measure the effects on viral growth of all single amino acid mutations to two transmitted-founder virus Envs that differ by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>100 mutations. We compare these complete maps of mutational effects to identify sites that have shifted in their amino acid preferences between the Envs. Most sites show no detectable shifts, but 30 sites have clearly shifted preferences. These shifted sites usually prefer a specific amino acid in one Env but have shifted to tolerate many amino acids in the other Env. The shifted sites cluster in structure but are often distant from any amino acid substitutions that distinguish the two Envs, demonstrating the action of long-range epistasis. By aggregating our measurements for both Envs, we identify sites that evolve faster or slower in nature than expected given the functional constraints measured in the lab, probably due to pressure for immune evasion. Overall, our work provides complete across-strain maps of mutational effects that inform analyses of Env’s evolution and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two Envs from clade A transmitted-founder viruses</title><p>The viruses most relevant to HIV’s long-term evolution are those which are transmitted from human-to-human. However, the only prior work that has measured how all Env amino acid mutations affect HIV growth is a study by some of us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haddox et al., 2016</xref>) that used a late-stage lab-passaged CXCR4-tropic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peden et al., 1991</xref>). The properties of Env can vary substantially between such late-stage viruses and the transmitted-founder viruses relevant to HIV’s long-term evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sagar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wilen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parrish et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ronen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We therefore selected Envs from two transmitted-founder viruses, BG505.W6M.C2.T332N and BF520.W14M.C2 (hereafter referred to as BG505 and BF520), that were isolated from HIV-infected infants shortly after mother-to-child transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nduati et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goo et al., 2014</xref>). The BG505 Env has been extensively studied from a structural standpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Julien et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pancera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sanders et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stewart-Jones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gristick et al., 2016</xref>), and variants of this Env are being tested as vaccine immunogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sanders et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Taeye et al., 2015</xref>). We used the T332N variant of BG505 Env because it has a common glycosylation site that is targeted by many anti-HIV antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>). The BF520 Env was isolated from an infant who developed an early broad anti-HIV antibody response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Simonich et al., 2016</xref>). We have previously created comprehensive codon-mutant libraries of the BF520 Env and used them to map HIV antibody escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dingens et al., 2017</xref>), but these BF520 libraries have not been characterized with respect to how mutations affect viral growth.</p><p>Both BG505 and BF520 are from clade A of the major (M) group of HIV-1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the phylogenetic relationship among these two Envs and other clade A sequences. BG505 and BF520 are identical at 721 of the 836 pairwise-alignable protein sites (86.2% identity). However, in our experiments we mutagenized only the ectodomain and transmembrane domain of Env, and excluded the signal peptide and cytoplasmic tail. The reason is that we measure how Env mutations affect viral growth, which is influenced both by the functionality of Env protein molecules and their expression level. Mutations in the signal peptide and cytoplasmic tail commonly affect Env expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chakrabarti et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yuste et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 1994</xref>), so we excluded these regions with the goal of reducing the degree to which we simply identified mutations that affected Env expression. In the ectodomain and transmembrane domains of Env, BG505 and BF520 are identical at 549 of the 616 sites (89.1% identity) that are alignable across clade A Envs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). The divergence between BG505 and BF520 therefore offers ample opportunity to investigate mutational shifts during Env evolution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34420.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of BG505 and BF520 to other clade A Envs.</title><p>The tree shows the 69 Envs in the alignment in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, which is a subsample of clade A sequences from the group M alignment in the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov</ext-link>).

Direct comparisons between experimentally measured amino acid preferences and amino acid frequencies in natural sequences are confounded by the fact that the natural sequences are evolutionarily related. This problem can be overcome by making the comparison in a phylogenetic context to account for the evolutionary relationships among sequences.</p><p>Specifically, we used our deep mutational scanning data to construct experimentally informed codon models (ExpCM’s) for Env’s evolution. An ExpCM is a phylogenetic substitution model that incorporates the functional constraints measured in a deep mutational scanning experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hilton et al., 2017</xref>). If the experiment captures much of the actual evolutionary constraint on a gene, then an ExpCM will describe the gene’s natural evolution better than a standard phylogenetic codon substitution model. The reason is that standard codon substitution models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yang et al., 2000</xref>) only model functional constraint via a single parameter that represents the rate of fixation of nonsynonymous protein-altering mutations relative to synonymous ones; this parameter is called dN/dS or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. In contrast, an ExpCM accounts for the preference of each site for each of the 20 amino acids under the functional selection in the deep mutational scan, and then additionally adds an <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> parameter that represents the relative rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions after accounting for these functional constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hilton et al., 2017</xref>).

Recall that for standard codon substitution models, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is simply the rate of fixation of nonsynonymous mutations relative to synonymous ones.

Re-scaling both sets of preferences to optimally describe Env evolution in nature is a principled way to standardize the measurements; see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hilton et al., 2017</xref>) and the Materials and methods section entitled ‘Re-scaling the preferences’ for a more detailed explanation.</p><p>A qualitative way to assess if the deep mutational scanning authentically describes selection on Env function is to visually compare the measurements with existing knowledge. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> show the re-scaled across-replicate average of the amino acid preferences for each Env. At sites of known functional importance, these preferences are usually consistent with prior knowledge. For instance, residues T257, D368, E370, W427, and D457 are important for Env binding to CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Olshevsky et al., 1990</xref>), and all these amino acids are highly preferred in our deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Likewise, Env has 10 disulfide bonds (linking sites 54–74, 119–205, 126–196, 131–157, 218–247, 228–239, 296–331, 378–445, 385–418, and 598–604), most of which are important for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">van Anken et al., 2008</xref>)—and the cysteines at these sites are highly preferred in our deep mutational scanning. The deep mutational scanning is also consistent with prior knowledge about sites that are tolerant of mutations. For instance, Env has five variable loops that mostly evolve under weak constraint in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Starcich et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zolla-Pazner and Cardozo, 2010</xref>)—and most sites in these loops are mutationally tolerant in our deep mutational scanning (see sites indicated by gray overlay bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, such as 132 to 195). It is beyond the scope of this paper to catalog associations between our measurements and all other prior mutational studies of Env, but the concordance of our findings with the above mutational studies, and the fact that our data improve phylogenetic models of Env’s natural evolution, suggest that our experiments do a reasonable job of authentically measuring functional selection on Env.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34420.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Amino acid preferences for the BG505 Env.</title><p>At each site, the height of the letter is proportional for that site’s preference for that amino acid.

Most sites have relatively small shifts (close to zero), although there is a long tail of sites with large shifts. This tail reaches its upper value with site 512, which has a shift of 0.52 out of a maximum possible of 1.0. How should we interpret this distribution—have mutational effects shifted a lot, or not very much? We can establish an upper-bound for how much sites might shift by comparing Env to a <italic>non</italic>-homologous protein. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows the distribution of shifts when comparing Env to influenza’s hemagglutinin protein, which has previously had its amino acid preferences measured by deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doud and Bloom, 2016</xref>). Most sites have large shifts between Env and hemagglutinin, with the typical shift being <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf53"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>0.4 and some approaching the maximum value of 1.0. We can also establish a lower-bound by creating a null distribution for the expected shifts if all differences are simply due to experimental noise. This null distribution is created by randomizing the experimental replicates among Envs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows that the null distribution is more peaked at zero than the real distribution, and does not have the same prominent tail of sites with large shifts. The answer to the question of how much mutational effects have shifted is therefore nuanced: they have substantially shifted at some sites, but remain vastly more similar between the two Envs than between two unrelated proteins.</p><p>We can use the null distribution to identify sites where the shifts between BG505 and BF520 are significantly larger than the noise in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). There are 30 such sites at a false discovery rate of 0.1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> shows the amino acid preferences of these significantly shifted sites for each Env. For the majority of shifted sites, one Env prefers a specific amino acid whereas the other Env tolerates many amino acids; for instance, see sites 512, 516, 599, 165, 605 and 505 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. Such broadening and narrowing of a site’s mutational tolerance is frequently linked to changes in protein stability, with a more stable protein typically being more mutationally tolerant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). Work with engineered Env protein in the form of ‘SOSIP’ trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanders et al., 2002</xref>) has shown that BG505 SOSIP is more thermostable than BF520 SOSIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Verkerke et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this fact, sites with altered mutational tolerance are often (although not always, see sites 165 and 520 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) more mutationally tolerant in BG505. Differences in Env’s expression level might also contribute to a general broadening or narrowing of tolerance to subsequent mutations. The reason is that our experiments select for viral growth (which is affected by both Env function and expression), so it is possible that some of the shifts are due to epistatic mutational effects on expression rather than function.</p><p>However, not all of the significantly shifted sites show a simple pattern of broadening or narrowing of mutational tolerance. For instance, site 288 does not alter its mutational tolerance but rather flips its rather narrow amino acid preference from phenylalanine in BG505 to leucine in BF520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, there is variation in both the extent and types of shifts observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Structural and evolutionary properties of shifted sites</title><p>What distinguishes the sites that have undergone significant shifts?

These sites are in Env’s first/second variable loop (164 and 165) and its third variable loop (307 and 309), which pack against one another and against an adjacent Env protomer (the inter-protomer boundary is indicated by a dashed line). Each of the shifted sites has substituted. And these sites are in the immediate vicinity of other non-shifted, but substituted sites. Thus, it seems likely that these shifts at least partially arise from short-range epistatic interactions within this cluster. However, longer range epistatic interactions with more distant sites also seem plausible given the highly dynamic nature of this region.

A statistical analysis confirms that there is clustering of shifted sites for the closed and open conformations, with the effect being strongest when we define contacts based on the closest intra-residue distance across these two conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Therefore, the factors that drive shifts in Env’s mutational tolerance often affect physically interacting clusters of residues in a coordinated fashion. We also investigated clustering of shifted sites in the post-fusion six-helix bundle. Because structures of this conformation only resolve the coordinates of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf57"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>80 residues, we did not perform a statistical analysis. However, a qualitative analysis revealed that three of the four shifted sites that are resolved in the post-fusion conformation cluster at one end of the helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>An obvious hypothesis is that strongly shifted sites have substituted between BG505 and BF520, or physically contact such substitutions. According to this hypothesis, substitutions would alter the local physicochemical environment of the substituted site and its neighbors, thereby shifting the amino acid preferences of sites in the physical cluster. But surprisingly, for both the closed and open conformations, the typical magnitude of shifts is not significantly larger at sites that have substituted, or at sites that contact sites that have experienced substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). For the six-helix bundle, there are five structurally resolved substituted sites, one of which is adjacent to the cluster of shifted sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The number of resolved shifted and substituted sites in this structure is too small for a meaningful statistical analysis of the type in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. However, the cluster of shifted and substituted sites in the six-helix bundle is also present in the closed and open states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), and so is included in the statistical analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>.</p><p>There is a borderline trend for the significantly shifted sites to be more likely to have substituted between BG505 and BF520 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), but most shifted sites have not substituted (only 8 of the 30 shifted sites differ in amino acid identity between the two Envs). The lack of strong enrichment in shifts at substituted sites contrasts with previous protein-wide experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doud et al., 2015</xref>) and simulation-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pollock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shah et al., 2015</xref>) studies of shifting amino acid preferences, which found that shifts were dramatically more pronounced at sites of substitutions. The difference may arise because these earlier studies examined proteins that are fairly conformationally static (absolutely so in the case of the simulations). The fact that Env is extremely complex and conformationally dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Munro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ozorowski et al., 2017</xref>) may increase the opportunities for long-range epistasis to enable substitutions at one site to shift the amino acid preferences of distant sites.</p><p>Indeed, many of the shifted sites cluster within regions of Env that are highly conformationally dynamic. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the structural context of these clusters in finer detail. One cluster is at the trimer apex where two of Env’s variable loops pack against one another and against an adjacent protomer. These interactions are likely involved in regulating the transition between conformational states, and upon CD4 binding, these loops become highly disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guttman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ozorowski et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations at two of the shifted sites in this cluster (165 and 307) have been shown to cause Env to assume aberrant conformations, suggesting that these sites can strongly modulate Env’s dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, this cluster of shifted sites may reflect previously observed differences in the conformational dynamics of this regions between these two Envs; the V2 region of BF520 SOSIP trimer is more accessible to deuterium exchange than the BG505 SOSIP trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Verkerke et al., 2016</xref>). The other cluster of shifted sites is near a network of hydrophobic amino acids that has been proposed to help transmit the large-scale conformational change that takes place upon CD4 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ozorowski et al., 2017</xref>). One of the shifted sites (site 69) overlaps with this network, and mutations at another (site 64) have been shown to strongly modulate the relative stability of the open and closed conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Taeye et al., 2015</xref>). In total, these two clusters consist of nearly half of the shifted sites (13 out of 30). One hypothesis why so many shifted sites cluster in these regions is that their dynamic nature allows long-range epistatic interactions to be readily propagated between substituted sites and distant shifted sites. It is difficult to discern exactly how these interactions might occur, but there is certainly a trend for sites that are conformationally dynamic to also be sites that show shifts in their amino acid preferences during evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Entrenchment of substitutions modestly contributes to mutational shifts</title><p>One idea that has recently gained support in the protein-evolution field is that substitutions become ‘entrenched’ by subsequent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pollock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Starr et al., 2017</xref>). Entrenchment is the tendency of a mutational reversion to become increasingly unfavorable as a sequence evolves. Given two homologs, if there is no entrenchment then the effect of mutating a site in the first homolog to its identity in the second will simply be the opposite of mutating the site in the second homolog to its identity in the first. But if there is entrenchment, then both mutations will be unfavorable, since the site is entrenched at its preferred identity in each homolog.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows the distribution of effects for mutating all sites that differ between BG505 and BF520 to the identity in the other Env. As expected under entrenchment, the average effect of these mutations is deleterious—although there are a substantial number of sites where the mutational flips are not deleterious. We can get some sense of the magnitude of the entrenchment by comparing the effects of the BG505<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf58"><mml:mo>↔</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>BF520 mutations to the distribution of effects of all possible amino acid mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This comparison shows that even unfavorable inter-Env mutational flips are generally more favorable than random amino acid mutations. Therefore, entrenchment occurs for some but not all substitutions that distinguish BG505 and BF520, and the magnitude of entrenchment is less than the effect of a typical random mutation. Entrenchment of substitutions therefore contributes to some of the mutational shifts. But given that many of these shifts occur at sites that do not even differ between the Envs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), entrenchment of substitutions is clearly not the only cause of the shifting amino acid preferences.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34420.029</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Entrenchment of substitutions during Env evolution.</title><p>There are 12,521 possible amino acid mutations at the 659 mutagenized sites alignable between BG505 and BF520. The blue densities show the effects of all these mutations to each Env. The orange densities show the effects of just the 92 mutations that convert BG505 to BF520 or vice versa. In the absence of entrenchment, mutating a site in BG505 to its identity in BF520 should have the opposite effect of mutating the site in BF520 to its identity in BG505. In this case, we would expect the BF520<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf59"><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>BG505 distribution to be the mirror image of the BG505<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>BF520 distribution—and both distributions should be centered around zero if the two Envs are equivalently functional. Instead, mutating a site in either Env to its identity in the other Env tends to be deleterious, indicating that substitutions are often entrenched in the Env in which they have fixed. The effect of a mutation is quantified as the log of the ratio of the site’s preference for the mutant amino acid to the preference for the wild-type amino acid.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34420-fig8-v3.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Comparing selection in the lab to natural selection</title><p>Our experiments measure the effects of mutations on viral growth in a T-cell line in the lab.

All three models test if individual sites evolve faster or slower than expected, but they ‘expect’ different things: the dN/dS model expects nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations fix at the same rate, while the ExpCM expects the rate at a site to depend on the experimentally measured functional constraints.

These strategies include shielding immunogenic regions with glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wei et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stewart-Jones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gristick et al., 2016</xref>) or hiding them by adopting a closed protein conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kwong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guttman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ozorowski et al., 2017</xref>). Sites that contribute to such general immune-evasion strategies will be under a constraint in nature that is not present in our experiments—and indeed, such sites evolve more slowly than expected from our experiments. For instance, we find very little selection to maintain most glycans in our cell-culture experiments. Of the 21 N-linked glycosylation sites shared between BG505 and BF520, only four are under strong selection to maintain the glycan in our experiments—despite the fact that most are conserved in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). This finding concords with prior literature suggesting that these glycans are selected primarily for their role in immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pugach et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rathore et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, a network of sites that help regulate Env’s transition between open and closed conformations that have different antibody susceptibilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) also evolve slower in nature than expected from our experiments. Therefore, we can distinguish evolutionary patterns that are shaped by simple selection for Env function from those that are due to the additional complex pressures imposed during human infections.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have experimentally measured the preference for each amino acid at each site in the ectodomain and transmembrane domain of two Envs under selection for viral growth in cell culture. These amino acid preference maps are generally consistent with prior knowledge about sites that are important for protein properties such as receptor binding or disulfide-mediated stability. However, the main value of these maps comes not from comparing them with prior knowledge, but from the fact that such prior knowledge encompasses just a small fraction of the vast mutational space available to Env. Because Env evolves so rapidly, every study of this protein must be placed in an evolutionary context, and our comprehensive amino acid preference maps potentially enable this in ways that prior piecemeal studies of mutations cannot.</p><p>But these maps come with a potentially serious caveat: each one is measured for just a single Env variant. The major question that our study aimed to answer is whether the maps are still useful for evolutionary questions, or whether Env’s amino acid preferences shift so rapidly that each map only applies to the specific HIV strain for which it was measured. This question is reminiscent of one that was grappled with in the early days of protein crystallography, when it first became possible to build maps of a protein’s structure. Because it was not (and is still not) possible to crystallize every variant of a protein, it was necessary to determine whether protein structures could be usefully generalized among homologs. Fortunately for the utility of structural biology, it soon became apparent that closely homologous proteins have similar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chothia and Lesk, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sander and Schneider, 1991</xref>). This rough generalizability of protein structures holds even for a protein as conformationally complex as Env—for although there are many examples of mutations that alter aspects of Env’s conformation and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kwong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">White et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almond et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davenport et al., 2013</xref>), SOSIP trimer structures from diverse Env strains remain highly similar in most respects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Julien et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pugach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stewart-Jones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Verkerke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gristick et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that amino acid preference maps of Env also have a useful level of conservation for many purposes. From a qualitative perspective, the amino acid preferences look mostly similar between BG505 and BF520, and so provide a valuable reference for estimating which mutations are likely to be tolerated at each site in diverse HIV strains. Indeed, we anticipate that the complete maps of mutational effects in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> will be useful for future sequence-structure-function studies. From an analytical perspective, a powerful use of our maps is to identify sites that evolve differently in nature than is required by the simple selection for viral growth imposed in our experiments—and the identified sites are largely the same regardless of whether the analysis uses an amino-acid preference map from BG505 or BF520.</p><p>Of course, from the perspective of protein evolution, the most interesting sites are the exceptions to the general conservation of amino-acid preferences. Consistent with studies of other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Natarajan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Harms and Thornton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Starr et al., 2017</xref>), we find a subset of sites that change markedly in which mutations they tolerate. Some shifted sites simply accommodate more amino acids in the more stable BG505 Env—a type of shift that has been well-documented for other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). But interestingly, there is no strong trend for shifts to be enhanced at sites that differ between BG505 and BF520. Recent studies of protein evolution have focused on the idea that substitutions become ‘entrenched’ as sites shift to accommodate new amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pollock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bazykin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Starr et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, a prior protein-wide comparison of amino acid preferences across homologs of influenza nucleoprotein found a significant enrichment of shifts at sites of substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doud et al., 2015</xref>). But although there is some entrenchment of differences between BG505 and BF520, this is not the major factor behind the shifts in amino acid preferences: the majority of sites that have shifted between BG505 and BF520 actually have the same wild-type amino acid in both Envs even though the preferences have shifted. This rather surprising result might be due to Env’s exceptional conformational complexity—mutations can cause long-range alterations in Env’s conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kwong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">White et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almond et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davenport et al., 2013</xref>), so it seems plausible that they might also shift mutational tolerance at distant sites. Regardless of the exact mechanism, our large-scale datasets of mutational effects in multiple viral strains should be useful for efforts to computationally parameterize ‘fitness landscapes’ of Env (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kouyos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferguson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Louie et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments provide highly quantitative data on the mutational tolerance of Env under selection for viral growth in cell culture. These data are amenable to rigorous functional and evolutionary analyses. Here, we have shown how these data can be compared between Envs to identify sites where mutational tolerance shifts with viral genotype, or between experiments and nature to identify sites under different pressure in the lab and in humans. Future experiments that modulate selection pressures in other relevant ways should provide further insight into the forces that drive and constrain HIV’s evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Creation of codon-mutant libraries</title><p>Our codon mutant libraries mutagenized all sites in <italic>env</italic> to all 64 codons, except that the signal peptide and cytoplasmic tail were not mutagenized.

Note how for these Env alignments, using a gamma-distributed <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf104"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is very important in order for the ExpCMs to outperform the M5 model—we suspect this is because there are many sites of strong diversifying selection.</p><p>For detection of sites with faster or slower than expected evolution, we used the approach in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom, 2017</xref>), which is exactly modeled on the FEL approach of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005</xref>) but extended to ExpCM.

However, the extent that any mutation is enriched or depleted is a combination of two factors: the inherent effect of that mutation, and the ‘stringency’ of the experimental selection. For instance, if the selection is weak, then deleterious mutations will only be slightly depleted; conversely, if selection is strong, then deleterious mutations will be greatly depleted. The fact that the preferences depend on the stringency of the experimental selection is important if we want to compare results between Envs. The reason is that our goal is to identify differences in the inherent effects of mutations between Envs, not simply find differences due to variation in experimental stringency. Of course, we have done our best to perform the experiments for BG505 and BF520 equivalently, but because these are different viruses with different growth rates, it is impossible to exactly match the experimental stringencies. This can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, which shows that stop codons were more depleted for BG505 than BF520, indicating that selection in our experiments was more stringent for BG505.</p><p>How should we best re-scale the preferences? Raising them to a power is a sensible approach. To see why, imagine a mutation that is depleted 3-fold after 2 rounds of viral growth. If our experiment instead allowed <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf111"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> rounds of viral growth, then the mutation would be depleted <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf112"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>9</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> -fold. More generally, if a mutation is enriched in frequency by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf113"><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-fold after <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf114"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> rounds of viral growth, then it will be enriched in frequency by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf115"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>-fold after <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf116"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> rounds of viral growth. Since the amino acid preferences are conceptually equivalent to the re-normalized enrichments of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloom, 2015</xref>) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/prefs.html">https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms-tools2/prefs.html</ext-link>, it therefore makes sense that the re-scaled preference <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf117"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for amino acid <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf118"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> at site <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf119"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> should be related to the directly measured preference <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf120"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf121"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∝</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. And indeed, this is exactly the re-scaling scheme described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hilton et al., 2017</xref>) that we use to re-scale our preferences for BG505 and BF520.</p><p>The last point is how to choose the re-scaling parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf122"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> for each Env. It turns out that the features that we have described above for our experiments are also a feature of natural evolution: the expected frequency of a substitution during evolution depends not only on the inherent fitness effect of that mutation, but also on the effective population size, which is conceptually somewhat similar to the stringency of selection. It turns out that in a mutation-selection phylogenetic model of evolution, if the amino acid preferences are taken to represent the ‘fitness effects’ of mutations, then the exponential scaling parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf123"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is proportional to the effective population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Halpern and Bruno, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McCandlish and Stoltzfus, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bloom, 2014b</xref>). Therefore, fitting the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf124"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> parameter using a phylogenetic approach enables standardization of the preferences for the two Envs, and re-scales the preferences so that they best match with the actual stringency of selection observed in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hilton et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Note that in practice this re-scaling scheme is roughly equivalent to a more heuristic approach that has been used by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gray et al., 2017</xref>) and others. In this heuristic approach, the log-transformed enrichment ratios from different experiments are adjusted so that the distributions have equal spreads. Since multiplying log-transformed enrichment ratios is equivalent to exponentiating amino acid preferences, these two re-scaling procedures apply the same mathematical transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Identifying sites of shifted amino acid preference</title><p>When identifying shifts in amino acid preferences between the two Envs, we needed a way to quantify differences between the Envs while accounting for the fact that our measurements are noisy. The approach we use is based closely on that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doud et al., 2015</xref>) and is illustrated graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Arup Chakraborty as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor.

In this manuscript, you extend previous work from your lab analyzing the mutational landscape of the HIV-1 Env gene during in vitro viral replication. The work focuses on two clade A transmitter founder viruses, BG505 and BF520, which differ by more than 100 mutations. A deep mutational scanning approach is used to identify the permitted mutations at each residue of Env. Of particular interest is how amino acid preferences differ for these two proteins. A set of 30 sites with clear shifts in amino acid preference are identified. These data are compared to known mutational constraints on Env and to one another, and sources for the shifts in mutant affects are proposed by eliminating many scenarios. The results offer a body of knowledge useful for identifying i) residues and networks that are critical for basic function and ii) hot spots for evolvability or immune pressure. The analysis has been performed to a high standard (though some clarifications are necessary), and the openness of the data is a great service to the community. The paper represents a significant contribution towards understanding the structure-function relationship of HIV envelope. Therefore, the paper is likely to be accepted for publication if the following points are adequately addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How are mutations that strongly modulate Env's expression level taken into account?</p><p>2) Only the native, pre-fusion Env trimer is used to calculate proximity of substituted and shifted residues. It is possible that substitution-shift colocalization may be detected in other conformations of Env as it undergoes structural rearrangement to mediate fusion, as opposed to acting through longer-range allostery in the pre-fusion conformation. Another well-characterized structure that should be considered is the post-fusion six-helix bundle of gp41.</p><p>3) Overall, it is found that the shifted sites tend to cluster together, but they are not necessarily the same as the sites with substitutions between the two Envs or ones that contact them. This analysis is not pursued in great detail, however, leaving the reasons why shifted sites tend to cluster together unexplained. Given that the authors also observe some evidence of entrenchment of substitutions between the Envs, is it possible that interactions between the shifted sites themselves are important? This question could be explored through a more detailed examination of the structure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34420.047</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How are mutations that strongly modulate Env's expression level taken into account?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. Our experiments directly measure how mutations affect viral growth. This approach has many advantages over simple surface display approaches, since it is more relevant to the true function of Env. However, a caveat is that viral growth is a convolution of Env function and expression, so our experiments cannot separate these two phenotypes.</p><p>We have taken steps to limit simply finding mutations affect expression. We have done this by <italic>not</italic> mutagenizing the signal peptide and cytoplasmic tail, which are the most common sites of mutations that affect expression levels.</p><p>We have added text to make this point clear, and emphasize the associated caveats. When we first describe the deep mutational scanning approach, we now say:</p><p>“However, in our experiments we mutagenized only the ectodomain and transmembrane domain of Env, and excluded the signal peptide and cytoplasmic tail. The reason is that we measure how Env mutations affect viral growth, which is influenced both by the functionality of Env protein molecules and their expression level. Mutations in the signal peptide and cytoplasmic tail commonly affect Env expression level (Chakrabarti et al., 1989; Yuste et al., 2004; Li et al., 1994), so we excluded these regions with the goal of reducing the degree to which we simply identified mutations that affected Env expression.”</p><p>Then when we describe the results, we clearly emphasize how expression level (like Env protein stability, which was already discussed) could have general effects on the results:</p><p>“Differences in Env’s expression level might also contribute to a general broadening or narrowing of tolerance to subsequent mutations. Because our experiments select for viral growth – which is affected by both Env function and expression – it is possible that some of the shifts are due to epistatic mutational effects on expression rather than function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Only the native, pre-fusion Env trimer is used to calculate proximity of substituted and shifted residues. It is possible that substitution-shift colocalization may be detected in other conformations of Env as it undergoes structural rearrangement to mediate fusion, as opposed to acting through longer-range allostery in the pre-fusion conformation. Another well-characterized structure that should be considered is the post-fusion six-helix bundle of gp41.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. In the initial paper, we only analyzed the closed prefusion conformation of the Env trimer. We now analyze substitution-shift co-localization in two other conformations: the open CD4-bound conformation and the post-fusion six-helix bundle. In the end, our basic conclusions remain the same, adding greater support to the hypothesis that epistasis is acting via long-range interactions.</p><p>First, we investigated the open CD4-bound conformation. Figure 7D statistically tests the hypothesis that shifts are larger at sites that have substituted or sites that contacts substitutions. Initially, this figure only showed the results of this test for the closed prefusion conformation. Now, it shows the results for both the closed and open conformations. Both conformations gave the same general result: there is no significant trend for shifted sites to contact sites of substitutions. We also considered both structures at once, classifying sites as contacting substitutions if they do so in at least one structure. Even then, we did not find an association (see the new right-most panel in Figure 7D). Thus, our investigation of the open conformation re-enforced our initial conclusion that many of the shifts are likely due to long-range, rather than short-range, epistatic interactions.</p><p>We also repeated the analyses in Figure 7B and Figure 7C with the open conformation. Our initial conclusions about the solvent accessibility (Figure 7B) and clustering of shifted sites (Figure 7B) also held for the open conformation. Next, we investigated substitution-shift co-localization in the post-fusion six-helix bundle. Only ∼80 residues per Env monomer are resolved in available structures of the six-helix bundle. The structure with largest number of shifted sites (PDB: 1ENV) only contains four shifted sites and five substituted sites. These numbers are too low for the statistical tests used in Figure 7. But we have added a new figure (Figure 7—figure supplement 2) that qualitatively analyzes substitution-shift co-localization in the post-fusion six-helix bundle. Three of the four shifted sites cluster at one end of the helix, along with one of the five substitutions. However, this cluster is also present in the closed and open states as well (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). Thus, the post-fusion six-helix bundle did not reveal any new patterns of co-localization that were not also present in the other states.</p><p>We now describe the results of the analyses in the first two paragraphs of the Results subsection “Structural and evolutionary properties of shifted sites”, interleaved with the original text in these paragraphs.</p><p>In the process of making these revisions, we discovered a minor bug that affected our calculations of residue-residue distances. We fixed that bug in the revised version. None of the main results change, but some of the quantitative values in the box plots and the corresponding P-values have changed slightly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Overall, it is found that the shifted sites tend to cluster together, but they are not necessarily the same as the sites with substitutions between the two Envs or ones that contact them.

This question could be explored through a more detailed examination of the structure.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we examined the clusters of shifted sites in greater detail. Two clusters occur within conformationally dynamic regions of Env. One hypothesis as to why shifted sites cluster in these regions is that their conformationally dynamic nature allows long-range epistatic interactions to be propagated between shifted and substituted sites that are distant from one another.</p><p>We have added a new figure supplement (Figure 7—figure supplement 3) that provides a fine-grained structural view of each of the clusters. We have also added an entire paragraph detailing these observations at the end of the section in the Results called “Structural and evolutionary properties of shifted sites”. Overall, these additions strengthen the manuscript by providing a better structural intuition for how long-range epistatic interactions might occur in Env.</p></body></sub-article></article>
