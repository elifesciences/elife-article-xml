One simple mechanism for long distance dispersal of the lipid modified Hh is the direct contact between cell membranes through filopodia-like structures known as cytonemes. Here we have analyzed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the interaction between the glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein, necessary for Hh signaling, and the adhesion molecules and Hh coreceptors Ihog and Boi. We describe that glypicans are required to maintain the levels of Ihog, but not of Boi. We also show that the overexpression of Ihog, but not of Boi, regulates cytoneme dynamics through their interaction with glypicans, the Ihog fibronectin III domains being essential for this interaction. Our data suggest that the regulation of glypicans over Hh signaling is specifically given by their interaction with Ihog in cytonemes. Contrary to previous data, we also show that there is no redundancy of Ihog and Boi functions in Hh gradient formation, being Ihog, but not of Boi, essential for the long-range gradient.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hedgehog signaling</kwd><kwd>ihog</kwd><kwd>boi</kwd><kwd>glypicans</kwd><kwd>cytonemes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2014-59438-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Eléanor</given-names></name><name><surname>Seijo-Barandiarán</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name><name><surname>Aguilar</surname><given-names>Gustavo</given-names></name><name><surname>Sánchez-Hernández</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Aguirre-Tamaral</surname><given-names>Adrián</given-names></name><name><surname>González-Méndez</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Guerrero</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2017-83789-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Eléanor</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiménez-Jiménez</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name><name><surname>Sánchez-Hernández</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>González-Méndez</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Guerrero</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RED2018-102411-T</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guerrero</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The glypicans Dally-like protein and Dally reveal functional non-redundancy of the Hedgehog co-receptors Boi and Ihog through independent interactions and specifically regulate cytoneme dynamics via the Ihog FNIII domain, thus setting long-range signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has a conserved central role in cell–cell communication during tissue patterning, stem cell maintenance, and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). During development, Hh ligand is usually released from a localized source inducing at distance concentration-dependent cellular differentiation and/or proliferation responses. Hh is synthetized as a precursor molecule that undergoes two post-translational lipid modifications: cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porter et al., 1996</xref>) and palmitic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pepinsky et al., 1998</xref>), which associate Hh to cell membranes restricting its free spreading through the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peters et al., 2004</xref>). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain Hh dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 2001</xref>); among these, the transport by filopodia-like structures (known as cytonemes) is the most suitable model, since they facilitate direct contact between cell membranes for delivery and reception (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Méndez et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Cytonemes have been described as dynamic actin-based protrusive structures that deliver or uptake many signaling proteins in different biological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramírez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Méndez et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Hh has been shown to be localized along cytonemes in the germline stem cells niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rojas-Ríos et al., 2012</xref>), in abdominal histoblast nests, and in wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callejo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gradilla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Spatial and temporal correlations between Hh gradient establishment and cytoneme formation have also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>). As the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gradilla et al., 2014</xref>), the vertebrate homolog Sonic-hh (Shh) has also been visualized in vivo in vesicle-like structures moving along filopodia protruding from Shh-producing cells during chick limb bud development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>), in mouse tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2021</xref>), and during regeneration of axolotls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Although the importance of cytonemes in the coordination of growth and patterning is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali-Murthy and Kornberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Méndez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang and Scholpp, 2019</xref>), much less is known about the intrinsic and extrinsic cues that regulate their establishment and dynamics.</p><p>In larval wing imaginal discs and pupal abdominal histoblast nests, Hh is produced and secreted by the Posterior (P) compartment cells and transported towards the receiving Anterior (A) compartment cells, resulting in a graded Hh distribution in this compartment. Cytonemes emanating at the basal surface of the polarized epithelia guide Hh delivery directly from P to A at cytoneme contact sites where Hh reception takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">González‐Méndez et al., 2020</xref>). To activate its targets in a concentration-dependent manner, Hh binds to its receptor complex formed by the canonical receptor Patched (Ptc), the co-receptors Interference hedgehog (Ihog) and Brother of Ihog (Boi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yao et al., 2006b</xref>), and the membrane-anchored glypicans Dally-like protein (Dlp) and Dally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desbordes and Sanson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lum et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2010</xref>).

In addition, Boc and Cdo, homologs of Ihog and Boi in vertebrates, have been reported to be associated to Hh transport and reception through cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The glypicans Dlp and Dally have been described as necessary for cytoneme attachment in the wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang and Kornberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>) and for cytoneme formation in the air sac primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang and Kornberg, 2016</xref>). Dally and Dlp contain heparan sulfate (HS) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains attached to a core of glypican proteins, which in turn are bound to the membrane via a GPI anchor; they have a generalized, but not uniform, expression in the wing imaginal disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakato et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baeg et al., 2001</xref>). Glypicans regulate most morphogenetic gradients, i.e. Hh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2004</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Filmus and Capurro, 2014</xref>), Wingless (Wg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franch-Marro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2009</xref>), Decapentaplegic (Dpp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jackson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belenkaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Norman et al., 2016</xref>), and FGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan and Lin, 2007</xref>); however, how glypicans achieve their specificity for each signal is not known. In Hh signaling, Dlp is needed for Hh reception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desbordes and Sanson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lum et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2010</xref>) and delivery from the Hh-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callejo et al., 2011</xref>), while Dally is needed for maintenance of Hh levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To date, the co-receptors Ihog and Boi are thought to have redundant functions because Hh signaling is only blocked when both are simultaneously absent in the Hh-receiving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). Both adhesion proteins share sequence similarities: they are type one transmembrane proteins with four Ig and two Fibronectine type III (FNIII) extracellular domains, and an undefined intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao et al., 2006a</xref>). Nevertheless, Ihog and Boi are separately needed for the maintenance of normal Hh levels in Hh-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). Both proteins are expressed ubiquitously in the wing disc, although their protein levels are reduced at the A/P boundary in response to Hh signaling. More specifically, Ihog is more abundant in basal plasma membranes of the wing disc epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsia et al., 2017</xref>) and it has the ability to stabilize cytonemes when overexpressed, clearly influencing cytoneme dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we further analyze the interactions of glypicans with Ihog and Boi and the role of these interactions on cytoneme dynamics and Hh signaling. We describe that whereas Ihog and Boi functions are not needed for the maintenance of glypicans levels, glypicans are required to maintain Ihog, but not Boi, protein levels. In addition, we observe that ectopic Ihog, but not Boi, stabilizes cytonemes. We further dissect the functional domains of Ihog responsible for the interaction with Dally and Dlp, Hh and Ptc, as well as for cytoneme stability and Hh gradient formation. We describe that the Hh-binding Fn1 domain of Ihog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLellan et al., 2006</xref>) is crucial for glypican interaction and cytoneme stabilization, though the amino acids involved are different from those responsible for the Ihog/Hh interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the previously described Ptc-interacting Fn2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>) is also key for Ihog interaction with glypicans as well as for the stabilization of cytonemes. We conclude that the FNIII domains of Ihog interact with glypicans to regulate cytoneme behavior and that these interactions provide glypican specificity for Hh signaling as well as a key function for Hh gradient formation. We further propose that the presence of Ihog, but not of Boi, in basally located cytonemes is essential for Hh signaling gradient formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Glypicans interact with Ihog to stabilize it at the plasma membranes</title><p>Previous work described interactions between glypicans and Ihog that were revealed by the ectopic Ihog recruitment of glypicans in wing disc cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>).

In summary, these data reveal a novel functional role of Dally and Dlp to maintain Ihog, but not Boi, protein levels.</p><p>We further explored the interaction of Ihog and Boi with glypicans. The apical–basal cellular distribution of Dally and Dlp in the disc epithelium is different: Dlp is more basally distributed than Dally, as it has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallet et al., 2008</xref>). Since the ectopic Ihog recruits glypicans in wing disc cells, we analyzed if ectopic Boi also does. Overexpressing in the dorsal compartment of the wing disc of Ihog or Boi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), using the ventral compartment as internal control, we observed that although ectopic Boi also accumulates glypicans, the apical/basal distribution of this increase in the disc epithelium was different than that of Ihog. While Boi accumulates Dally and Dlp mainly at the apical side of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), Ihog accumulates them basally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This result, together with the differential effect of Dally and Dlp to maintain Ihog, but not Boi, protein levels at the plasma membrane, suggests that the ways in which Ihog and Boi interact with glypicans differ both in function and in mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ihog functional domains implicated in the glypican–Ihog interaction</title><p>To investigate the role of the various Ihog protein domains in Ihog–Dally and Ihog–Dlp interactions, we generated transgenic lines to ectopically express Ihog proteins carrying deletions for the different extracellular domains, each fused to the red fluorescent protein (RFP) in the C-terminal.

To further analyze the potential Fn1 domain sequences responsible for Hh and/or glypican accumulation, we made an in silico prediction of the amino-acid residues responsible for the Ihog–Hh interaction based on structural analysis of Ihog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McLellan et al., 2008</xref>). We then generated an Ihog variant carrying point mutation substitutions in three residues (D558N, N559S, E561Q) in the region previously predicted to interact with Hh via hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLellan et al., 2006</xref>). As anticipated, overexpression of this Ihog form (<italic>UAS.IhogFn1***-RFP</italic>) does not accumulate Hh, probably due to loss of the Ihog–Hh interaction when at least one of the three amino acids is mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,G</xref>). We next analyzed the interaction of the same Ihog mutant form, <italic>UAS.IhogFn1***</italic>, with glypicans and observed that both Dally and Dlp accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,H’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,I’</xref>) at a level similar to that following overexpression of the wild-type Ihog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,A’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,E’</xref>), indicating that the Fn1 amino acids that interact with glypicans are different from those carrying out the Ihog–Hh interaction. To test the sufficiency of Ihog–Fn1 domain for the interaction with Hh, we targeted it to the membrane by fusing it to the extracellular domain of CD8 (<italic>UAS.CD8.Fn1-Cherry</italic>). Expression of this construct in the dorsal compartment resulted in a small increase of Hh levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Altogether these results suggest that although Fn1 is the specific Ihog domain binding Hh and interacting with Dlp and Dally, the optimal binding may also require the cooperation of the Fn2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ihog–Fn2 domain partially influences Hh interaction</title><p>The ectopic expression of <italic>UAS-ihog.ΔFn2-RFP</italic> still accumulates Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,G</xref>), although at noticeably lower levels than the expression of the wild-type Ihog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,G</xref>). This last reduction in Hh increase might result from a diminished interaction of Ihog.ΔFn2 with Dally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), as Dally seems to be needed for Hh stability at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, as expected, Hh recruitment is not observed when expressing only the intracellular part of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We therefore conclude that, although the Ihog interaction with Hh is primarily mediated by Fn1, the Fn2 domain may play a minor secondary role as a consequence of its implication in Ihog–Dally interaction.</p><p>Previous research has described the role of the Fn2 domain of Ihog as enhancing Hh protein binding in cells co-expressing its receptor Ptc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yao et al., 2006b</xref>) through Ptc interaction with two specific Fn2 amino-acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). Since Dlp, and probably Dally, are also part of the Hh reception complex, we next studied if these amino acids could also be implicated in the interaction of Fn2 with Hh and the two glypicans. We generated an Ihog variant carrying point mutations in the two amino-acid residues (K653 and Q655) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>) and fused it to RFP (<italic>UAS.ihogFn2**-RFP</italic>).

We then analyzed the effect on Hh gradient of knocking down Boi without altering Ihog. We observed the opposite effects: a slight flattening of the Hh gradient with a decrease in the high levels of Ptc, a slight extension of the Ci gradient and a maintenance of En levels in the A compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results indicate that in the absence of Ihog the long- and short-range gradient of Hh is affected and it is not rescued by the co-receptor Boi, which is only capable of partially maintain the Hh responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Glypicans and Ihog interaction</title><p>There is strong experimental evidence for the glypicans Dally and Dlp to regulate the release, dispersal, and reception of Hh in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yan and Lin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Filmus and Capurro, 2014</xref>). Although the glypican core region of Dlp is known to function as a Hh signaling binding protein, a direct high-affinity interaction between Dlp and either Hh or the Hh-Ihog complex had not yet been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, it has previously been postulated that Ihog and Boi, two adhesion molecules that act as Hh coreceptors, are required for all known biological responses to Hh signaling during embryonic and imaginal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yao et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Camp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we show evidence of the Ihog–glypican protein interaction in wing imaginal discs. First, we demonstrated that Ihog is stabilized at the plasma membrane by glypicans, since the level of Ihog drastically decreases in double mutant clones for genes encoding glypicans (dally and dlp). Interestingly, this interaction between glypicans and Ihog could be mediated by the HS-GAG chains of the glypicans, as the same effect is observed in clones mutant for the enzymes that synthetize the HS-GAG chains (<italic>ttv</italic> and <italic>btv</italic>). The molecular mechanisms leading to this regulation are still unknown; nonetheless, as glypicans are required for Hh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>) and Wg recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallet et al., 2008</xref>) they might also be required for a hypothetical recycling of Ihog. Second, we showed a different role of glypicans with respect to Boi: under the same experimental conditions, Boi plasma membrane levels are not affected, indicating that the modulation of Ihog by glypicans is specific. Third, we determined that the glypicans–Ihog interaction is mediated by both Ihog FNIII domains, Fn1 and Fn2; however, even though the Fn1 domain interacts equally with both glypicans (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), the Fn2 domain is almost dispensable for the interaction with Dlp, but necessary for that with Dally.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ihog–glypican interaction regulates cytoneme dynamics</title><p>In wing discs and in the abdominal histoblast nests, the ectopic expression of Ihog stabilizes cytonemes, although without affecting their normal length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, general cytoneme establishment and dynamics are not affected after inhibiting Ihog and Boi using actin reporters to visualize them. However, with our current experimental tools we cannot discriminate Hh specific cytonemes from those probably used for other signaling pathways. Thus, the formation of cytonemes may probably be regulated by a general cell machinery, notwithstanding the existence of pathway specific regulation.</p><p>It was interesting finding out that the Ihog cytoneme stabilization effect depends on these extracellular FNIII domains. In particular, the Fn1 domain is involved in the recruitment of Hh and the two glypicans Dally and Dlp at cytonemes. In addition, the expression of Ihog without the Fn2 domain results on dynamic cytonemes in abdominal histoblast nests. Ihog ΔFn2 lacks the ability to interact with the glypican Dally, but still retains its interaction with Dlp, suggesting a more specific role of Dally in cytoneme dynamics. Besides, the expression of Ihog lacking the intracellular domain still stabilizes cytonemes, while the expression of the intracellular domain only does not. Therefore, the intracellular fragment, potentially in contact with the actin machinery (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanchez-Arrones et al., 2012</xref>) needed for the elongation and retraction of cytonemes, does not appear to influence their stabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ihog binding to Hh is influenced by its interaction with glypicans</title><p>Ihog has a known role in Hh recruitment to the membranes of both producing and receiving cells in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been proposed that Ihog may act as an exchange factor by retaining Hh on the cell surface, competing with Dlp for Hh binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, of the three Ihog extracellular domains (Fn1, Fn2, and Ig), only Fn1 and Fn2 are necessary for in vivo Hh signaling, although accomplishing independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLellan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The Fn1 domain has been described as specifically needed for Hh binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLellan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yao et al., 2006b</xref>). In agreement, we have observed that the ectopic expression of the variant of Ihog lacking Fn1 does not accumulate Hh in the P compartment as the ectopic wild-type Ihog does. Specifically, the amino-acid changes (D558N, N559S, E561Q) that we have generated in the Fn1 domain (Ihog-Fn1***) impede Hh accumulation. These mutations are not identical to those described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLellan et al., 2006</xref>, although they map in the same Ihog protein region predicted to interact with Hh. Interestingly, our amino-acid alterations maintain the Ihog–glypican interaction, showing that both interactions (with Hh and with glypicans) are mediated by different sequences within the same Ihog extracellular domain. Accordingly, crystal structure of the Hh-binding fragment of Ihog has shown that the Fn1 domain is specifically needed for heparin binding-dependent Ihog dimerization as well as required for high-affinity interactions between Ihog and Hh. Also in agreement with our data, the putative heparin-binding site near the Ihog–Ihog dimer interface was found to be separated from the basic strip bridging Hh to Ihog-Fn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLellan et al., 2006</xref>). Besides, we have also observed that ectopic expression of a construct carrying only the wild-type Fn1 domain recruits low levels of Hh, suggesting that, although Fn1 binds physically to Hh, cooperation between Fn1 and Fn2 domains is needed for an efficient Fn1-Hh binding. Both domains are required for proper Ihog–Dally interaction, what explains why the Fn2 domain also slightly influences Hh accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Ihog, but not Boi, function is needed for cytoneme-mediated Hh gradient</title><p>As Hh co-receptors, the functions of Ihog and Boi have been described to be interchangeable for Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yao et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Camp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, here we have shown different functional requirements for each protein: (1) ectopic Ihog, but not Boi, accumulates glypicans in the basal part of the wing disc tissue; (2) the levels of glypicans are key to maintain Ihog, but not Boi, protein levels at cytoneme membranes; and (3) Ihog, but not Boi, has a cytoneme-stabilizing function in vivo. These observations overall suggest a specific function of Ihog and its interaction with glypicans to stabilize cytonemes and regulate the Hh gradient. In agreement, we show that Hh gradient was affected in the absence of Ihog, even though Boi levels are maintained. Although Ihog and Boi are both part of the Ptc-coreceptor complex, our data demonstrate that Boi cannot substitute Ihog function in the formation of the Hh gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We have previously proposed that cytonemes at the basal part of the epithelia regulate both the short- and long-range Hh gradient, while apical contacts significantly contribute to the short-range gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callejo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, basal glypicans–Ihog interactions indicate a main function of Ihog in long-range Hh gradient formation. Boi is located more apically in the disc epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsia et al., 2017</xref>), where no long cytonemes have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>).

At these contact places, most of the extracellular components needed for Hh signaling colocalize in a dynamic way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>), similar to a synaptic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">González‐Méndez et al., 2020</xref>). Our results support the hypothesis that the interactions of Hh, Ptc, and Ihog with the glypicans, among other complex components, might guide the Hh reception at cytoneme contact sites. In this context, it has recently been proposed that the Ihog–Ihog homophilic interaction is competing with the Ihog-Hh heterophilic interaction through the Ihog Fn1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). This competing interaction at the cytoneme contact sites between presenting and receiving cytonemes could allow the Hh reception. On the other hand, recent research describes that the Dlp class of glypicans shields the highly hydrophobic lipid moiety of Wnt from the aqueous environment, allowing its handing over to receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGough et al., 2020</xref>). For Hh signaling, Dlp could also tunnel Hh lipid modifications while transferring Hh to its receptor Ptc and coreceptors Ihog and Boi. Interestingly, Dlp, as part of the reception complex, interacts specifically with the Ihog Fn1 domain, the same domain that binds Hh.</p><p>Glypicans control several morphogenetic gradients (Bmp, FGF; Dpp; Jak/Stat) in addition to those of Hh and Wnt. Based on our data, glypican regulation over Hh signaling is mainly given by their interaction with Ihog, thus conferring pathway specificity. We, therefore, propose that the glypicans–Ihog interaction could aid cytoneme dynamics, Hh-maintenance at cytonemes, Hh presentation to Ptc, as well as Hh release during the reception process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Since the results showed a non-parametric distribution of the experimental data, we selected a Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the numerical lifetimes between two genotypes.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In summary, this manuscript elucidates the function of Glypicans in Hh transport via cytonemes. The reviewers felt that the manuscript describes convincingly that the fly glypicans Dally and Dally-like are required to maintain the expression of the Hh co-receptor Ihog, which stabilises cytonemes to establish the Hh gradient in the wing imaginal disc. A molecular analysis of Ihog domains was well executed.</p><p>Although the manuscript provides an in-depth analysis, the reviewers believe that the presentation of the data is rather challenging for the readers. The authors need to clearly describe the different roles that have been attributed to the glypicans and for every experiment presented, a clear explanation of the impact of the results is needed e.g. Figure 5. In addition, the stability of Ihog and Boi by altered Glypican levels and their ability to stabilize cytonemes needs to be investigated. Finally, linking the Ihog analysis to cytoneme stability analysis needs improvement.</p><p>The detailed criticisms of the reviewers are listed below:<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the article &quot;Glypicans specifically regulate Hedgehog signalling through their interaction with Ihog in cytonemes&quot; Simon et al., elucidate the function of Glypicans in Hh transport via cytonemes. The manuscript describes convincingly that the fly glypicans Dally and Dally-like are required to maintain the expression of the Hh co-receptor Ihog. Ihog – in turns – stabilises Hh cytonemes through its interaction with Glypicans to establish the Hh gradient in the wing imaginal disc. The authors further carried out an extensive molecular analysis of Ihog and identified the relevant domains within the protein required for interactions with Glypicans, Patched, and Hh. In general, this is a very thorough, detailed analysis of Ihog function. The images and videos are excellent. However, prior publication, there are two major criticisms, which needs to be addressed, in my opinion.</p><p>Firstly, the first part of the manuscript, the molecular analysis of Ihog (Figure 1-4) seems to be detached from the second cytoneme-focussed part (Figure 5, 6). Independent evidence is needed to show support for the idea that the Ihog-Gly mediated stabilisation of cytonemes is responsible for the expansion of the signalling gradient. Are the static cytonemes involved in a flattened gradient or are the receiving cells just sensitised for Hh? Can cytonemes be (de-) stabilised w/o interfering with Hh components to untangle these observations?</p><p>The authors write &quot;Intriguingly, the same Ihog domains that regulate cytoneme dynamics are those also involved in the recruitment of Hh ligand, glypicans and the reception complex. &quot;</p><p>My concern is that cytoneme dynamics and Hh gradient formation could be two parallel, independent events -&gt; one needs to show this interdependency in a clear way. I could imagine an analysis of the consequences when Ihog is overexpressed, and cytoneme formation is inhibited (by other means). Consistently, could one stabilise cytonemes in an Ihog-reduced background and analyse gradient formation?</p><p>Secondly, the authors demonstrate an effect of Ihog alterations on the formation of the gradient. However, what is the physiological relevance? What are the consequences of Ihog/Gly-mediated cytoneme stabilisation and gradient formation on tissue patterning and wing formation? If this is not possible to show experimentally, this needs to be discussed.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>First, the authors describe the interaction between Ihog and Dally/Dally-like. They make use of the double mutants to show that Dally/Dlp are required for stabilisation of Ihog in the wing imaginal disc. Here it would be essential to strengthen the statement that Ihog is stabilised by glypicans. Can the authors provide supporting evidence e.g. biochemical ones?</p><p>Next, in an exquisite set of experiments, the authors demonstrate that the FN1 and FN2 domains are required for glypican stabilisation. The Western blot analysis – to demonstrate the different weight of the constructs- needs improvement or at least the authors need to provide alternative evidence.</p><p>The authors then analyse the interaction of Ihog with Hh and glypicans by using specific constructs with point-mutation in the FN1 or FN2 domain. This is an excellent set of data and shows very convincingly that FN1 (D558N, N559S, E561Q) is vital for Hh retention but not for interaction with glypicans. These experiments show that specific amino-acids of FN1 interact with glypicans, and these are different from those that carry out the Ihog -Hh interaction.</p><p>Next, the authors investigate the implication in Hh gradient formation. Again, the set of experiments is well documented. However, in Figure 4F, the authors show the activation of Ptc directly at the border zone. To my understanding, the interaction with Hh should not be permitted in this experiment and target genes should not be induced. So, it is unclear to me why the authors observe restricted but quite strong Ptc expression. The authors need to explain this observation. Would an independent TC approach help to elucidate signalling capability of Ihog-FN1***?</p><p>The authors claim that the stabilisation of Ihog-bearing cytonemes is glypican-dependent. The movies and the still pictures present in Figure 5 are challenging to interpret. The clone sizes are variable, and the authors claim that larger and smaller clones show different results. Furthermore, it is unclear to me why the authors use for this experiment the ttv/botv mutant instead of the dally/dlp mutant. The author should add these experiments or explain why this is not possible.</p><p>The videos accompanying Figure 6 are compelling and show the role of Ihog domains in the regulation of cytoneme dynamics, however, require a better explanation.</p><p>The discussion is well structured. However, there is data showing that glypicans can regulate secretion and stability of Hh. The authors need to discuss these findings<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript interrogates function of Ihog and Boi adhesion molecules in cytoneme-based transport of the Hedgehog morphogen in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The cell biology of how cytonemes are regulated to deliver morphogen signals is not yet well understood, so the work addresses an important topic that will be of interest to a broad audience. However, much of the study refines previous work from the same group to provide only a modest advance in understanding of how Ihog impacts cytoneme behavior.</p><p>The authors use genetic strategies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to investigate how Ihog and Boi influence cytoneme dynamics. They find that the two proteins act differently with regard to cytoneme function. Boi effects are not exhaustively analyzed, but a number of genetic experiments are performed to interrogate Ihog. The authors reveal that the extracellular domains of Ihog interact with the glypicans Dally and Dlp to stabilize cytonemes that originate from Ihog over-expressing cells. Knockdown of Ihog does not alter cytoneme dynamics.</p><p>The most novel aspect of the study – that Boi functions differently than Ihog in cytonemes – is, unfortunately, not expanded upon. Some experiments lack controls or are presented in a manner that prevents clear interpretation of results. Thus, the study appears too preliminary for publication at this time.</p><p>Key points to be addressed:</p><p>Figure 1: Null alleles and RNAi silencing are used interchangeably to reduce Ihog, Boi, Dally and Dlp function in vivo. Results between methods are directly compared. Oftentimes, controls are not included to confirm the level of knockdown following RNAi. If possible use null alleles due to consistency. However, if this is not possible due to experimental reasons, give an explanation and state impact in the discussion.</p><p>Ihog levels decrease following loss of Dally or Dlp and Boi levels appear to increase following knockdown of Ihog, Dally, or Dlp. These stability changes have previously been reported. The mechanism is not clear, so should have been investigated here – especially the increased Boi protein level. How does this occur? Is stabilization occurring at the protein level or is gene expression changing? Is this a compensatory upregulation?</p><p>Based upon the supplement for Figure 2, it looks like the Ihog truncation mutants show variable stability. Might this be affecting the extent to which they alter Dally or Dlp stability? The western blot data are presented as crops of single bands adjacent to crops of a molecular weight ladder. Blots should be shown as intact images, preferable with all variants compared across a single gel with a loading control. As presented, relative stability/expression levels are impossible to assess.</p><p>Figures 3-4: Ihog mutant transgenes are tagged with either HA or RFP. Best to be consistent with tags when mutant function is being directly compared. Given that the HA tag is a small epitope and the RFP is a protein tag, they may differentially alter protein functionality. To be consistent it would be preferable to use the same tags. However, if this is not possible due to experimental reasons, the technical implication can also be mentioned in the discussion.</p><p>Figure 5: Investigation of histoblast cytonemes reaching into ttv, botv mutant clones: The ability of cytonemes to invade double mutant clones is altered only under the engineered situation of glypican dysfunction combined with Ihog over-expression. From this, it is concluded that Ihog is acting with glypicans to stabilize cytonemes.

It is unfortunate that most of the literature has presented results and phenotypes in simplistic or simple-minded ways that do not recognize the different roles or the glypicans, or do not take experimental approaches that might distinguish them. This work of the Guerrero lab is an exception, as it is an important contribution to understanding these different roles, especially given the additional complexity introduced by the role of cytonemes. If its thoroughness and in-depth analysis are typical of work from this lab, so is the challenging presentation that makes understanding it so difficult.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stacey K Ogden (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. All reviewers found that the manuscript was significantly improved, but also made some additional suggestions which we would like you to consider.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In general, the revised version of the manuscript has improved substantially. The structure is clear, and the experiments are ordered in a logical way. The re-organisation of the results has improved readability. The authors have introduced new figures and eliminated those which were unnecessary. Overall, I think this is an excellent manuscript, with only a few further suggestions.</p><p>For me, the main question remains: is iHog (specifically via the FNIII domains) directly involved in cytoneme stabilisation or indirectly via stabilisation of Hh and/or Glypicans. I feel this is an important question to discuss as in the iHog-/- situation, Glypican level on the basolateral side are reduced, which is also the side at which the cytonemes form. In contrast, in Boc mutants, glypicans still accumulate at the basal side, and therefore cytoneme formation is unaltered.</p><p>It is very much appreciated that most RNAi experiments have been removed or exchanged by induced null clones. This gives the experimental setting a compelling flow. The improved Western blot analysis is convincing (Figure 2 suppl. 1).</p><p>The authors have now tagged all constructs with RFP. This is an enormous effort and very much appreciated. The interpretation that the Fn2-RFP domain is more required explicitly for Dally interaction is good – while Fn1 is equally needed for both Dally and Dlp interaction.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript is significantly improved over the initial submission.

They make use of the double mutants to show that Dally/Dlp are required for stabilisation of Ihog in the wing imaginal disc. Here it would be essential to strengthen the statement that Ihog is stabilised by glypicans. Can the authors provide supporting evidence e.g. biochemical ones?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to perform π assays between Ihog and glypicans, but we did not succeed to get a biochemical interaction. Although other groups identified a structural region located on the surface of Dlp important to mediate its role in Hh signaling, apparently the core of the purified Dlp protein did not interact appreciably with Hh or with a Hh: Ihog complex (Kim et al., 2011).</p><p>In addition, based on our results about the Ihog stabilizing effects observed in double mutant clones for <italic>ttv</italic>/<italic>btv</italic> and <italic>dally</italic>/<italic>dlp</italic> (Figure 1), we think possible that for the interaction between Ihog and glypicans to be mediated through the sugar chains of HS. These type of interactions may not be very stable and, therefore, difficult to obtain positive results through π assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, in an exquisite set of experiments, the authors demonstrate that the FN1 and FN2 domains are required for glypican stabilisation. The Western blot analysis – to demonstrate the different weight of the constructs- needs improvement or at least the authors need to provide alternative evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done new Western blots showing clearly the different molecular weights of the Ihog mutant constructs. In the revised version of the manuscript a better Western blot is now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, the authors investigate the implication in Hh gradient formation. Again, the set of experiments is well documented. However, in Figure 4F, the authors show the activation of Ptc directly at the border zone. To my understanding, the interaction with Hh should not be permitted in this experiment and target genes should not be induced. So, it is unclear to me why the authors observe restricted but quite strong Ptc expression. The authors need to explain this observation. Would an independent TC approach help to elucidate signalling capability of Ihog-FN1***?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Referee for his/her comments on this point. We have repeated the experiments several times to make sure of the activation of Ptc in the first cell row that we had presented in the original version of the manuscript. From the data obtained we conclude that this construct is acting as dominant negative, blocking all Hh responses (Ptc, En and Ci). We have also observed that after Ihog-ΔFN1and Ihog-FN1*** expression the endogenous Ihog protein is much decreased. Although there is still a very mild activation of Ptc in the first cell row, we have not given much importance to this small activation that could be caused by the possible presence of Boi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that the stabilisation of Ihog-bearing cytonemes is glypican-dependent. The movies and the still pictures present in Figure 5 are challenging to interpret. The clone sizes are variable, and the authors claim that larger and smaller clones show different results. Furthermore, it is unclear to me why the authors use for this experiment the ttv/botv mutant instead of the dally/dlp mutant. The author should add these experiments or explain why this is not possible.</p></disp-quote><p>For this work, we have considered unnecessary to induce dally/dlp double mutant clones in the histoblast nests, since it is an experiment difficult to do by life imaging. Additionally, we had previously demonstrated in wing imaginal discs the requirement of the HSPG (Bischoff et al., 2013) and of Dally and Dlp (González-Mendez et al., 2017) for the ectopic Ihog stabilizing effect on cytonemes. Therefore, we have eliminated the trans interaction of HSPG and Ihog for cytoneme stability shown originally in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The videos accompanying Figure 6 are compelling and show the role of Ihog domains in the regulation of cytoneme dynamics, however, require a better explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to better label the presentation of the videos.

However, there is data showing that glypicans can regulate secretion and stability of Hh. The authors need to discuss these findings</p></disp-quote><p>In the new version of the manuscript we have discussed the functions of Dally and Dlp in Hh secretion and stability. As far as we know, the specific role of Dally in the stability of Hh in the A compartment was first proposed by Han et al., (2004) and in the P compartment by Bilioni et al., (2013). The specific role of Dlp in Hh secretion interacting with Dispatched was proposed by Callejo et al., (2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors use genetic strategies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to investigate how Ihog and Boi influence cytoneme dynamics. They find that the two proteins act differently with regard to cytoneme function. Boi effects are not exhaustively analyzed, but a number of genetic experiments are performed to interrogate Ihog. The authors reveal that the extracellular domains of Ihog interact with the glypicans Dally and Dlp to stabilize cytonemes that originate from Ihog over-expressing cells. Knockdown of Ihog does not alter cytoneme dynamics.</p><p>The most novel aspect of the study – that Boi functions differently than Ihog in cytonemes – is, unfortunately, not expanded upon.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Referee for this comment that has allowed us to further explore these differential functions of Boi and Ihog in Hh signaling. Since we agreed with the referee that this was the most novel aspect of our work, we reoriented the writing of the manuscript basing it on the new results about the differential roles of Boi and Ihog on Hh signaling. Accordingly, we have also changed the title of the manuscript in this regard.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some experiments lack controls or are presented in a manner that prevents clear interpretation of results.

However, if this is not possible due to experimental reasons, give an explanation and state impact in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the Referee’s concern is appropriate, we have eliminated the knockdowns following RNAi expression in Figure 1. We have now induced null clones and analyzed the expression of Ihog and Boi in all cases. Therefore, the old Figure 1 figure supplementary 1 has been eliminated in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>However, the expression of RNAis to silence Ihog and Boi were used in the new Figures 5 and 6. The controls to confirm the knockdown of Ihog and Boi following expression of the RNAis are now shown in Figure 5 figure supplementary 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ihog levels decrease following loss of Dally or Dlp and Boi levels appear to increase following knockdown of Ihog, Dally, or Dlp. These stability changes have previously been reported. The mechanism is not clear, so should have been investigated here – especially the increased Boi protein level. How does this occur? Is stabilization occurring at the protein level or is gene expression changing? Is this a compensatory upregulation?</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, we had previously investigated the cause of the slight increase of Boi levels after knocking down Ihog. We had found that it was at the protein level because no <italic>boi</italic> transcriptional changes were observed using a transcriptional reporter. This is possibly due to compensatory upregulation, but we have not investigated this further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based upon the supplement for Figure 2, it looks like the Ihog truncation mutants show variable stability. Might this be affecting the extent to which they alter Dally or Dlp stability?</p></disp-quote><p>All Ihog mutant forms show similar levels of expression with the exception of IhogΔIg, which shows lower levels but still accumulate Hh, Dlp and Dally as the full length Ihog. However, the cytonemes are as dynamic as the expression of Ihog FN2 mutants. Therefore, we still think that the differential effects on Dally and Dlp after expressing all mutant forms are specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The western blot data are presented as crops of single bands adjacent to crops of a molecular weight ladder. Blots should be shown as intact images, preferable with all variants compared across a single gel with a loading control. As presented, relative stability/expression levels are impossible to assess.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done new Western blots, which are presented in the new Figure 2 figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 3-4: Ihog mutant transgenes are tagged with either HA or RFP. Best to be consistent with tags when mutant function is being directly compared. Given that the HA tag is a small epitope and the RFP is a protein tag, they may differentially alter protein functionality. To be consistent it would be preferable to use the same tags. However, if this is not possible due to experimental reasons, the technical implication can also be mentioned in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the Referee’s suggestion and to be consistent with the use of the same tag in all the constructs, we made another ΔFn2 transgene tagged to RFP. Besides, Dfn2HA and DFn2-RFP behave similarly regarding the effects concerning Hh interaction, gradient formation and cytoneme dynamics. However, following the quantification of the effects on the accumulation of Dally and Dlp we found that the Fn2-RFP domain is more specifically required for Dally interaction while Fn1 is equally needed for both Dally and Dlp interaction. Only the results obtained using the DFn2-RFP and not of DFn2-HA are presented in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: Investigation of histoblast cytonemes reaching into ttv, botv mutant clones: The ability of cytonemes to invade double mutant clones is altered only under the engineered situation of glypican dysfunction combined with Ihog over-expression.

This may be the case, but they ability to see it only under an engineered situation of compound mutation plus Ihog over-expression leads this review to question the physiological relevance of the observation.

The work is focused on both receiving and producing cells.</p><p>The effect on glypicans is analyzed in both compartments, in random clones or using ApGal4. The effect on Hh in the P compartment was also analyzed using ApGal4. The effect on dynamics is presented using Hh Gal4 but the effect is similar when using Ptc-Gal4. Finally, the effect on Hh reception was done expressing the Ihog mutants in the receiving cells. Altogether these results show that ectopic Ihog induced cytoneme</p><p>stability is dependent on Ihog-glypican interactions and that the two Ihog FNIII domains (which are also responsible for the Ihog-glypicans interaction) have a predominant role in this stabilization.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>For me, the main question remains: is iHog (specifically via the FNIII domains) directly involved in cytoneme stabilisation or indirectly via stabilisation of Hh and/or Glypicans. I feel this is an important question to discuss as in the iHog-/- situation, Glypican level on the basolateral side are reduced, which is also the side at which the cytonemes form. In contrast, in Boc mutants, glypicans still accumulate at the basal side, and therefore cytoneme formation is unaltered.</p></disp-quote><p>We conclude that the FNIII domains of Ihog recruit glypicans at the basolateral side of the epithelium where cytonemes are formed. This Ihog interaction with glypicans could regulate cytoneme behavior and these interactions provide glypican specificity for Hh signaling as well as a key function for Hh gradient formation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
