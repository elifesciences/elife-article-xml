However, the functions of PLK1 beyond cell cycle regulation remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression in prostate epithelial cells triggers oncogenic transformation. It also results in dramatic transcriptional reprogramming of the cells, leading to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stimulation of cell migration and invasion. Consistently, PLK1 downregulation in metastatic prostate cancer cells enhances epithelial characteristics and inhibits cell motility. The signaling mechanisms underlying the observed cellular effects of PLK1 involve direct PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of CRAF with subsequent stimulation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 signaling pathway. Our findings highlight novel non-canonical functions of PLK1 as a key regulator of EMT and cell motility in normal prostate epithelium and prostate cancer. This study also uncovers a previously unanticipated role of PLK1 as a potent activator of MAPK signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10734.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10734.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10734.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells grow and divide via a series of events called the cell cycle. If this process is disturbed in animals, it can lead to cancer. In the later stages of tumor development, cancer cells frequently change their structure and behavior in a process called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enables them to migrate and form new tumors around the body.</p><p>A protein called Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) plays a central role in the cell cycle and has been implicated in the development of various cancers, including prostate cancer. Recent evidence suggests that PLK1 also has other roles in cells, but it is not clear how much they contribute to the development of cancer.</p><p>Wu et al. studied PLK1 in human cells and mice and showed that manipulating healthy prostate epithelial cells to produce more PLK1 caused the cells to go through the EMT and increased their ability to migrate. In other experiments, the levels of PLK1 in prostate cancer cells were deliberately lowered, which caused the cells to change to become more like epithelial cells and become less mobile. Wu et al. also investigated how PLK1 promotes the EMT and cell migration. These experiments showed that PLK1 activates a protein that controls an important chain of signaling events called the ERK/MAPK pathway, which is essential for cell growth and migration.</p><p>Wu et al.’s findings uncover a new role for PLK1 in promoting the spread of cancer cells around the body. A future challenge is to find out how PLK1 is regulated in people with prostate cancer and whether the EMT is involved in promoting other processes in cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10734.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10734.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>polo-like kinase 1</kwd><kwd>epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>CRAF</kwd><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Scholar Grant, 127626-RSG-15-005-01-CCG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA191002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 CA058236</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Paul B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Overexpression of PLK1 triggers oncogenic transformation and transcriptional reprogramming of prostate epithelial cells, which stimulates cell migration and invasion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays key roles in the regulation of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Llamazares et al., 1991</xref>). It contains a conserved N-terminal kinase catalytic domain and a C-terminal polo-box domain (PBD) that is involved in substrate binding. PLK1 mediates almost every stage of cell division, including mitotic entry, centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle formation, sister chromatid segregation, mitotic exit, and cytokinesis execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to its canonical role in mitosis and cytokinesis, recent studies suggest that PLK1 may have other important functions such as regulation of microtubule dynamics, DNA replication, chromosome dynamics, p53 activity, and recovery from the G2 DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>PLK1</italic> is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and its expression level often correlates with increased cellular proliferation, enhanced metastatic potential, and poor prognosis in cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cholewa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takai et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>PLK1</italic> is frequently (&gt;50%) overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa), and <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression is linked to higher tumor grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weichert et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that PLK1 may play a pivotal role in PCa etiology. Constitutive expression of <italic>Plk1</italic> in NIH/3T3 cells causes oncogenic foci formation and these transformed cells are tumorigenic in nude mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 1997</xref>). In contrast, depleting PLK1 in U2OS cells abrogates anchorage-independent growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckerdt et al., 2005</xref>). These results highlight PLK1 as a possible driver of oncogenic transformation, although it remains unclear if PLK1 itself is sufficient to induce tumor development. It has been suggested that PLK1 controls cancer development through multiple mechanisms that include canonical regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis, as well as modulation of DNA replication and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deeraksa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo and Liu, 2012</xref>). Importantly, previous studies reported that increased PLK1 expression levels positively correlate with the invasiveness of colorectal, breast, and thyroid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rizki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). These data imply a possible role for PLK1 in tumor invasion and metastasis; however, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis and mechanisms of the proinvasive activity of PLK1 during PCa progression are lacking.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the roles of PLK1 in regulating the motility of prostate epithelial cells and PCa cells. Our data highlight PLK1 as a crucial positive regulator of different modes of cell migration. This pro-migratory activity of PLK is mediated by induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via activation of the CRAF/MEK/ERK/Fra1/ZEB1/2 signaling cascade.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression induces prostate epithelial cell transformation and stimulates cell motility</title><p>It has been reported that PLK1 is frequently overexpressed in human PCa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weichert et al., 2004</xref>).

RWPE-1 cells are derived from normal human prostate epithelial cells and are immortalized with human papillomavirus 18 E7 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bello et al., 1997</xref>). In contrast to E6-immortalized cells, RWPE-1 cells express p53 and have a functional p53-dependent checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bello et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roh et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, they express luminal cytokeratins and do not grow in soft agar or form tumors in nude mice. We detected low levels of androgen receptor (AR) expression in RWPE-1 cells by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, RWPE-1 cells provide an excellent model for studying normal prostate epithelial functions, prostate epithelial transformation, and different stages of prostate carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bello et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roh et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>RWPE-1 cells were infected with lentivirus containing human <italic>PLK1</italic> cDNA. To avoid clonal variation, stable cell lines were established from a mixed population of multiple clones. Cells transduced with empty lentivirus served as a control. RWPE-1–PLK1 cells were designed to express PLK1 at a level comparable to asynchronous metastatic C4-2B PCa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) in order to determine the effect of cell cycle-independent <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression on PCa development. We examined the ability of PLK1-overexpressing cells to grow in soft agar, a property that frequently correlates with cell tumorigenicity. Under these conditions, control RWPE-1 cells formed few, if any, colonies in soft agar, whereas RWPE-1–PLK1 cells showed robust colony formation after 3 weeks of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This indicates that <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression is sufficient for cellular transformation of RWPE-1 cells. To assess <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenicity of PLK1-overexpressing prostate epithelial cells, control RWPE-1 or RWPE-1–PLK1 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of NOD/SCID/γ<sub>c</sub><sup>null</sup> (NSG) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2003</xref>). Six weeks after implantation, 100% (7 out of 7) of mice injected with RWPE-1–PLK1 cells developed primary tumors with an average size of 2,356 ± 589 (SEM) mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, no tumors developed in mice injected with control RWPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Interestingly, lung micrometastases were found in 5 of the 7 mice injected with RWPE-1–PLK1 cells. The micrometastases stained positive for PSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), indicating that they were of human origin and were derived from RWPE-1–PLK1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bello et al., 1997</xref>). This data suggests that <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression not only leads to oncogenic transformation of prostate epithelial cells, but may also drive PCa metastasis.</p><p>Based on the results of our tumor xenograft experiments implicating PLK1 in PCa metastasis, we next investigated the role of PLK1 in regulating prostate epithelial cell motility <italic>in vitro</italic>. Two classical assays of cell motility were used: one examined the collective cell migration during closure of planar epithelial wounds and the other analyzed the invasion of individual cells into Matrigel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> demonstrates that <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression significantly accelerated both wound closure and Matrigel invasion of RWPE-1 cells. Importantly, <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression also promoted migration and invasion of PrEC (human primary prostate epithelial cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rudolph et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), thereby indicating that this pro-migratory effect is not a peculiar feature of the RWPE-1 cell line. Since PLK1 is a crucial regulator of the cell cycle, it may promote epithelial cell motility indirectly by stimulating cell proliferation.

EMT is believed to play key roles in tumor progression and metastasis by enabling a switch from the stationary epithelial-like cell phenotype to the motile mesenchymal phenotype. On a molecular level, EMT is characterized by the decreased expression of epithelial markers and the increased expression of mesenchymal markers. In order to investigate whether <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression triggers EMT in RWPE-1 cell, we examined the expression of most of the characteristic epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Remarkably, relative to control RWPE-1 cells, RWPE-1–PLK1 cells downregulated epithelial markers (E-cadherin and cytokeratin 19) and upregulated mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, and SM22), at both the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The switch from epithelial to mesenchymal markers did not depend on the stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with the results obtained in RWPE-1 cells, <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression also induced an EMT-like phenotype in PrEC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, we compared induction of EMT in cells expressing wild-type (WT), constitutively active (TD), or kinase-defective (KM) PLK1. Constitutively active PLK1 induced the most robust reprogramming of gene expression in RWPE-1 cells, whereas expression of kinase inactive PLK1 failed to induce EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results suggest that a PLK1-mediated phosphorylation event contributes to the induction of EMT in prostate epithelial cells. Importantly, <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression in RWPE-1 cells disrupted localization of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-A at the areas of cell-cell contacts, thereby indicating profound disassembly of adherens and tight junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, arrows). This was accompanied by dramatic reorganization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton manifested by redistribution of non-muscle myosin IIB from the perijunctional F-actin bundles into basal stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, arrowheads). Taken together, these data demonstrate induction of EMT in PLK1-overexpressing prostate epithelial cells, which is likely to promote a pro-motile phenotype by disrupting intercellular adhesions and creating isolated mesenchymal cells with invasive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno-Bueno et al., 2008</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10734.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Overexpressing PLK1 in RWPE-1 cells induces EMT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative phase-contrast images of control RWPE-1 and RWPE-1–PLK1 cells.

Phosphorylation of CRAF at S338, S339, and S621 was significantly elevated in cells expressing WT or TD PLK1, but not KM PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Cells expressing TD PLK1 displayed higher levels of phosphorylated CRAF compared to those with WT PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). These data suggest that the enzymatic activity of PLK1 is both directly and indirectly responsible for those phosphorylation events. Consistently, phosphorylated ERK was significantly increased in cells expressing WT or TD PLK1, but not KM PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), suggesting that a PLK1-induced phosphorylation event triggers the activation of ERK signaling. On the other hand, shRNA-mediated downregulation of PLK1 led to dramatic reduction of CRAF phosphorylation at S338, S339, and S621, which was rescued by WT PLK1, but not KM PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of ERK signaling, manifested by decreased MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation along with reduced expression of Fra1, ZEB1, and ZEB2, was observed upon PLK1 knock down, and these effects were reversed by re-expressing WT, but not KM PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further confirm that PLK1 directly phosphorylates CRAF at S338 and S339, cells were synchronized in M phase by nocodazole treatment followed by a transient inhibition of PLK1 activity with 2 different concentrations of BI 2536 for 30 min. Significant reduction in phosphorylation of CRAF at S338 and S339 was immediately observed upon treatment with the higher dose of the PLK1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), thereby suggesting that PLK1 indeed directly phosphorylates CRAF at S338 and S339. Furthermore, when we blocked the PLK1 phosphorylation sites on CRAF by mutating S338 and S339 to alanines (CRAF-A/A), S621 phosphorylation was significantly diminished as compared to WT CRAF or the phospho-mimetic mutant (CRAF-D/E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>), suggesting that PLK1-induced phosphorylation of CRAF at S338 and S339 contributes to the CRAF autophosphorylation of S621. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PLK1 is responsible for phosphorylation-mediated activation of CRAF, which leads to CRAF autophosphorylation.</p><p>Elevated CRAF protein levels, but unchanged CRAF mRNA expression, were observed in RWPE-1–PLK1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, data not shown). In order to elucidate the mechanisms of this selective upregulation of CRAF protein, we asked whether PLK1 can stabilize CRAF. Cells were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis and the expression level of CRAF was compared at different time points (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 15 hr) in control cells and cells overexpressing different forms of PLK1 (WT, TD, and KM). Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated significant degradation of CRAF in control cells and cells expressing an inactive PLK1-KM mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). CRAF degradation was inhibited by MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor), but not by chloroquine (a lysosomal inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). In contrast, no significant CRAF degradation was observed in cells overexpressing either WT PLK1 or its constitutively active TD mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Given the previous finding that CRAF autophosphorylation of S621 is critical for preventing its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noble et al., 2008</xref>) and our observations that PLK1 phosphorylation of CRAF leads to its activation and subsequent autophosphorylation at S621 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–H</xref>), we hypothesized that PLK1-induced phosphorylation of CRAF contributes to CRAF stabilization by promoting its autophosphorylation. To corroborate the previous findings from another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noble et al., 2008</xref>), we mutated S621 of CRAF to alanine (CRAF-S621A) or aspartate (CRAF-S621D) and examined their stability. Consistently, CRAF-S621A displayed a much shorter half-life when compared to WT CRAF or CRAF-S621D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>). Importantly, the CRAF-A/A mutant (lacking PLK1-mediated phosphorylation) was quickly degraded over a 15-h time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>), which is in agreement with our observation that the CRAF-A/A mutant harbors a much lower level of S621 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). In sharp contrast, the CRAF WT and the CRAF-D/E mutant showed minimal degradation during that period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>). These results demonstrate that PLK1 increases the stability of CRAF protein by preventing proteasome degradation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PLK1 is an established mitotic kinase that is involved in multiple steps of mitotic progression. The present study revealed unanticipated non-canonical functions of PLK1 as a potent inducer of EMT and a stimulator of the motile phenotype of prostate epithelial cells. These functions of PLK1 are mediated by the CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 signaling pathway and are independent of effects on cell cycle regulation.</p><p>Our results are consistent with previous studies that suggested pro-migratory activity of PLK1 in colorectal, breast, thyroid cancer, and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kneisel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rizki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). However, our study is the first to demonstrate the causal role of PLK1 in regulating cancer cell motility. Indeed, by using a combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we established that PLK1 is necessary and sufficient to promote both planar migration and invasion of prostate epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Furthermore, our time-lapse microscopy experiments clearly demonstrated that PLK1 directly regulates the velocity of epithelial cell migration, independently of its effects on other cellular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D–F</xref>).</p><p>PLK1 controls prostate epithelial cell motility by mechanisms requiring transcriptional reprogramming and dramatic alterations of cell phenotype. Indeed, overexpression of PLK1 induced EMT-like alterations in prostate epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), whereas PLK1 knockdown restored epithelial features of invasive prostate cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This PLK1-dependent regulation of cell phenotype has not been previously reported in any cell type, and it is likely to underlie the observed effects of PLK1 on epithelial cell motility. There are several potential mechanisms by which the induction of EMT can promote cell motility. One mechanism involves disassembly of epithelial junctions that weaken intercellular adhesions, thereby allowing cell dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Godde et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Bras et al., 2012</xref>). Another mechanism involves rearrangement of the actomyosin cytoskeleton from epithelia-specific perijunctional bundles to basal stress fibers that are characteristic of mesenchymal cells. This rearrangement enhances cell-matrix adhesion and enables more efficient cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yilmaz and Christofori, 2009</xref>). We observed both junctional disassembly and cytoskeletal rearrangements in prostate epithelial cells undergoing PLK1-mediated EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our finding that <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression potently induced EMT in prostate epithelium is important given recent evidence highlighting EMT as an emerging mechanism of PCa progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. For instance, several EMT markers, such as vimentin and N-cadherin, are commonly expressed in circulating tumor cells from patients with relapsed metastatic PCa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong et al., 2011</xref>). A 'cadherin switch' with increased N-cadherin and reduced E-cadherin expression has been associated with relapse after PCa surgery and development of metastatic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gravdal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Umbas et al., 1992</xref>). Work from Reiter’s group demonstrates a central role for N-cadherin in PCa metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, the levels of ZEB proteins positively correlate with Gleason grading and PCa metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Through a series of biochemical analyses, we delineated the molecular mechanism underlying PLK1-mediated cell motility and EMT. Previous studies demonstrated that CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling plays a crucial role in the regulation of EMT as well as cell migration and invasion in several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birchmeier et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hay and Zuk, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schoenenberger et al., 1991</xref>). The CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway is regulated by Ras as well as various kinases including Src, PKC, and PAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">King et al., 1998</xref>). In this study, we discovered a novel regulatory pathway for MAPK signaling. We demonstrated that CRAF is a physiological substrate of PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). CRAF consists of a N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The 'N-region', located at the N-terminal of the kinase domain, contains the critical activating phosphorylation sites, S338 and S339 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diaz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edin and Juliano, 2005</xref>). S338 can be phosphorylated by the p21 activated kinase (PAKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">King et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhary et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2000</xref>) and other as yet unidentified kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiloeches et al., 2001</xref>). Our data support a dual-mechanism model of PLK1-mediated regulation of CRAF signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>): PLK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates CRAF at S338 and S339, which leads to CRAF activation. The activated CRAF undergoes autophosphorylation of S621, thereby preventing proteasome-mediated degradation of CRAF, which generates a positive-feedback loop, leading to a further increase in CRAF level and activity. This activation event triggers the activation of downstream MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling in prostate epithelial cells overexpressing PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>). Consistently, Mielgo et al. reported that PLK1 associates with CRAF and that this interaction does not require CRAF kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mielgo et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, they also found that CRAF indirectly promotes PLK1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mielgo et al., 2011</xref>). This adds an additional layer of complexity to the PLK1-CRAF interplay to further activate CRAF. In addition, PLK1 may differentially trigger distinct signaling pathways under different physiological conditions. For instance, PLK1 can directly activate MEK/ERK signaling through phosphorylation of the MEK activating site in airway smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang and Tang, 2015</xref>), although that is not the case for PCa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>We showed that the ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 pathway is aberrantly activated in PLK1-overexpressing prostate epithelial cells and that blocking the ERK/Fra1/ZEB1/2 pathway by shRNA or pharmacological inhibition reverses EMT and decreases cell motility in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These results indicate that PLK1 promotes EMT and motility through the CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 pathway in prostate epithelial cells. These findings highlight PLK1 as a critical molecular rheostat that controls phenotypic plasticity of normal prostate epithelial cells as well as PCa progression and dissemination. Identification of the CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling cascade as an essential downstream effector of PLK1 in prostate epithelial cells corresponds with the known roles of this cascade in the pathogenesis of various types of cancer, including PCa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCubrey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roberts and Der, 2007</xref>). Given the fact that the frequency of <italic>Ras</italic> gene mutations in prostate tumors is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carter et al., 1990</xref>), PLK1-induced activation of CRAF provides mechanistic insights into the aberrant activation of CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling frequently detected in PCa. Future experiments will further establish PLK1-mediated regulation of CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling in patients with PCa. Interestingly, it was reported that ERK2/Fra1/ZEB1/2 signaling is responsible for induction of EMT in RasG12V-transformed MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that ERK/Fra1/ZEB signaling could be a common pathway to induce EMT in mammalian epithelial cells.</p><p>PLK1 deregulation has been linked with the initiation and progression of many human cancers, including PCa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cholewa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weichert et akl., 2004</xref>). The current dogma in the field implies that PLK1 controls cancer development through multiple mechanisms, including canonical regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis as well as modulation of DNA replication and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deeraksa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo and Liu, 2012</xref>). Whether and how PLK1 drives PCa metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic> remain to be elucidated. Our xenograft studies showed that <italic>PLK1</italic> overexpression in human prostate epithelial cells leads to cellular transformation <italic>in vitro</italic> and promotes tumor formation in NSG mice, which suggests that PLK1 has a tumor-promoting role in the prostate. Strikingly, NSG mice engrafted with RWPE-1–PLK1 cells developed lung micrometastases at a high frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which provides <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that PLK1 plays a role in PCa invasion and metastasis. Our study establishes the role of PLK1 in the induction of EMT and stimulation of cell motility, which adds a novel and previously unanticipated role for PLK1 during PCa development. Furthermore, our observation that partial downregulation of PLK1 in metastatic PCa cells has no effect on cell cycle progression and cell viability suggests that a low level of PLK1 is sufficient to maintain cell viability and regulate the cell cycle. In contrast, upregulation of PLK1 promotes its non-canonical functions, including stimulation of EMT and acceleration of cell motility. This could explain why normal cells develop a complex system to tightly control the level and activity of PLK1 throughout the cell cycle, and how increased PLK1 promotes tumorigenesis.</p><p>EMT is an important mechanism of tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalluri and Weinberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang and Weinberg, 2008</xref>). Loss of cell-cell contacts and reorganization of the intracellular cytoskeleton during EMT results in increased cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno-Bueno et al., 2008</xref>). This allows cells to invade the surrounding stroma and vasculature, which leads to tumor dissemination and metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hugo et al., 2007</xref>). However, the mechanisms that drive EMT in PCa remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gravdal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howard et al., 2008</xref>). This study provides strong evidence that PLK1 is a key regulator of EMT in prostate epithelial cells and in PCa, which represents an underlying mechanism for PLK1-driven PCa progression and spreading. EMT also enables cancer cells to avoid apoptosis, anoikis, and oncogene addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tiwari et al., 2012</xref>). An emerging mechanism of EMT is reprogramming epithelial cells into cancer stem cells that have been strongly associated with resistance to chemotherapy and disease recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Whether PLK1-induced EMT contributes to these oncogenic processes will need further investigation. Interestingly, the low level of endogenous PLK1 observed in RWPE-1 cells appears to be sufficient to mediate growth-factor–induced EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This suggests that in tumor cells that do not overexpress PLK1, the low level of PLK1 that is required for cell division could also mediate induction of EMT under certain circumstances, such as in the tumor microenvironment. This finding would have important implications in targeting PLK1 for anticancer treatments. For instance, targeting PLK1 might be applied to a wide variety of cancers, regardless of their PLK1 expression levels, to prevent induction of EMT and tumor metastasis. Including PLK1 inhibitors in current standard therapeutic regimens could expand the scope of clinical efficacy that currently available drugs have established.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that PLK1 drives planar cell migration and matrix invasion of prostate epithelial cells and PCa by mechanisms involving induction of EMT. This previously unanticipated pro-migratory activity of PLK1 is driven by direct phosphorylation and activation of CRAF, which results in enhanced signaling through the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 pathway. The insights gained from this study will fundamentally advance our understanding of the oncogenic functions of PLK1 and the molecular basis of PCa development and metastatic dissemination, which have the potential to facilitate optimization of treatment regimens targeting PLK1 signaling to significantly enhance anticancer efficacy. Furthermore, our novel findings may be generalizable to many other cancers since preliminary clinical evidence suggests that PLK1 is involved in the development of several other human cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, synchronization, and reagents</title><p>The cell lines used were as follows: RWPE-1 (prostate epithelial cells); LNCaP, LAPC4, PC3, C4-2B, and DU145 (prostate cancer cells); 293T (human embryonic kidney cells); HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma cells, obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA); PrEC (human primary prostate epithelial cells, obtained from Lonza, Basel, Switzerland); and ARCaP<sub>E</sub> and ARCaP<sub>M</sub> (Novicure Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;PLK1 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and promotes epithelial cell motility by activating CRAF/ERK signaling&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>These studies show that overexpression of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) was able to induce EMT in prostate epithelial cells. Mechanistically, overexpression of PLK1 was found to activate MEK/ERK via direct phosphorylation and stabilization of CRAF at S338. Activated ERK kinase has been reported by others to upregulate FRA1, which in turn induces ZEB1/2 to promote EMT, consistent with their conclusions. The reviewers' main concern is that essentially all the experiments rely on PLK1 overexpression, which may or may not be physiological, with only two PLK1 knockdown experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the study, there is heavy reliance on overexpression of PLK1 in prostate epithelial cells. This raises the question how much Flag-PLK1 was overexpressed compared to endogenous PLK1 (what fraction of cells were productively infected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>?), and how this relates to the level of PLK1 expression in tumor cells known to overexpress PLK1, and expression levels need to be documented. More importantly, although overexpression of PLK1 was able to induce EMT, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> about endogenous PLK1 on EMT are not convincing. First, only a single shRNA was used and there was no re-expression control (see concerns in point 3). Second, it is unclear whether PLK1 is differentially expressed and/or activated in the metastatic cell lines used in this figure compared to the non-metastatic lines used in the rest of the study. In this regard, it would also be important to determine, whether PLK1 is involved in any physiological EMT events, such as TGFβ-induced EMT.</p><p>2) Although the effect of endogenous PLK1 in cell motility is well demonstrated, its role in EMT is still in question. Immunoblotting analyses of four EMT gene products are not sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that knockdown of PLK1 blocked EMT and caused partial MET. Morphological and immunostaining analyses are needed in addition. In addition, a standard system to analyze EMT in prostate cancer is &quot;ARCaP, ARCaP-E and ARCaP-M&quot;, and these gold standard cell lines for studying EMT in prostate cancer field could be used to verify the EMT results.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> a single shRNA was used to knock down PLK1, and only CRAF phosphorylation was monitored. This experiment needs to be repeated with additional PLK1 shRNAs, combined with re-expression of shRNA-resistant WT and kinase-dead PLK1 to establish that the observed effect on CRAF effect is due to loss of PLK1 kinase activity. This is particularly important because the level of CRAF protein was significantly reduced by the PLK1 shRNA, which could account at least in part for its decreased phosphorylation. At the same time, the consequences of knocking down endogenous PLK1 on activation of the rest of the ERK/FRA1/ZEB pathway needs to be analyzed using the same controls. Since PLK1 is generally believed to be essential for cell cycle progression, the authors should also analyze the cell cycle distribution of the cells to determine if this might account for any observed change when PLK1 is knocked down. In addition, depletion of Plk1 not only enriches cells in mitosis, but subsequently induces apoptosis in a broad range of cancer cells, and this could also attenuate migration and lead to a reduced expression or decay/degradation of mesenchymal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and CRAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). For this reason, it would also be informative to carry out and include apoptosis assays.</p><p>4) The authors need to rule out that PLK1 overexpression in the epithelial cell lines does not induce autocrine stimulation of the CRAF pathway, which would also increase pS338 levels.</p><p>5) The authors need to acknowledge and discuss the relevance prior work in this area to their own findings. For example, Mielgo et al. (Nat Med. 17:1641) reported that PLK1 and CRAF associate, but they concluded that CRAF pS338 is upstream of PLK1 activation, rather than, as you propose, PLK1 being upstream of CRAF activation. In addition, Jiang and Tang (Respir Res 16:93) reported that PLK1 can activate MEK/ERK, although that study suggested the activation was CRAF pS338-independent, with PLK1 phosphorylating MEK activating sites. Finally, much of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> replicates what Shin et al. (Mol Cell 38:114) reported for v-Ras transformed MCF-10A cells undergoing EMT.</p><p>These points need to be addressed in a revised version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10734.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) Throughout the study, there is heavy reliance on overexpression of PLK1 in prostate epithelial cells.

Immunoblotting analyses of four EMT gene products are not sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that knockdown of PLK1 blocked EMT and caused partial MET. Morphological and immunostaining analyses are needed in addition. In addition, a standard system to analyze EMT in prostate cancer is &quot;ARCaP, ARCaP-E and ARCaP-M&quot;, and these gold standard cell lines for studying EMT in prostate cancer field could be used to verify the EMT results.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewers suggested, we have performed additional experiments (morphological and immunostaining analyses) to more comprehensively demonstrate the role of endogenous PLK1 in EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, we validated the role of PLK1 in EMT using the ARCaP model (ARCaP-E and ARCaP-M cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). These studies were performed in collaboration with Dr. Paul Fisher, a co-author on this paper, who obtained these cells from Novicure Biotechnology under an MTA agreement. This agreement specifically prevents providing these cells to other investigators or developing stable variants of these cells. Based on these limitations, we employed transient transfection assays to upregulate and downregulate PLK1 in ARCaP<sub>E</sub> and ARCaP<sub>M</sub> cells, respectively, to address the specific comments of the reviewers. The results obtained with several gold standard cell lines (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>) support our conclusion about PLK1-dependent regulation of EMT in prostate cancer cells.</p><p> <italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> a single shRNA was used to knock down PLK1, and only CRAF phosphorylation was monitored. This experiment needs to be repeated with additional PLK1 shRNAs, combined with re-expression of shRNA-resistant WT and kinase-dead PLK1 to establish that the observed effect on CRAF effect is due to loss of PLK1 kinase activity. This is particularly important because the level of CRAF protein was significantly reduced by the PLK1 shRNA, which could account at least in part for its decreased phosphorylation. At the same time, the consequences of knocking down endogenous PLK1 on activation of the rest of the ERK/FRA1/ZEB pathway needs to be analyzed using the same controls.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have performed the recommended experiments, which include 2 different shRNAs along with re-expression of WT and kinase-dead PLK1. In addition to the effect on CRAF phosphorylation, the consequences of knocking down endogenous PLK1 on activation of the rest of the ERK/FRA1/ZEB pathway were monitored. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> of the revised manuscript, loss of PLK1 kinase activity led to reduction in CRAF phosphorylation at S338 and S339, and downstream ERK/FRA1/ZEB1/2 signaling.</p><p><italic>Since PLK1 is generally believed to be essential for cell cycle progression, the authors should also analyze the cell cycle distribution of the cells to determine if this might account for any observed change when PLK1 is knocked down. In addition, depletion of Plk1 not only enriches cells in mitosis, but subsequently induces apoptosis in a broad range of cancer cells, and this could also attenuate migration and lead to a reduced expression or decay/degradation of mesenchymal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and CRAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). For this reason, it would also be informative to carry out and include apoptosis assays.</italic> We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion and have examined the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in those cells. It is noteworthy that in order to avoid the effects of severe PLK1 depletion on growth inhibition and cell death, we used partial depletion of endogenous PLK1 in this study. Partial PLK1 knockdown did not significantly affect cell cycle progression or induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The authors need to rule out that PLK1 overexpression in the epithelial cell lines does not induce autocrine stimulation of the CRAF pathway, which would also increase pS338 levels.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewers suggested, we have performed an additional experiment to rule out the possibility that PLK1-induced activation of the CRAF pathway is due to autocrine stimulation. We transiently inhibited PLK1 activity in mitotic shake-off cells by treating cells with BI 2536, a pharmacological PLK1 inhibitor, (at a low and a high concentration) for a short period of time (30 min). Phosphorylation of CRAF at S338 and S339 was dramatically decreased immediately upon brief exposure to the PLK1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), which provides another line of evidence that PLK1 directly phosphorylates CRAF at S338 and S339.</p><p> <italic>5) The authors need to acknowledge and discuss the relevance prior work in this area to their own findings.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have included the acknowledgement and discussion of the relevant prior work in this area to our findings in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>For example, Mielgo et al. (Nat Med. 17:1641) reported that PLK1 and CRAF associate, but they concluded that CRAF pS338 is upstream of PLK1 activation, rather than, as you propose, PLK1 being upstream of CRAF activation.</italic> </p><p>We have included additional evidence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> demonstrating that PLK1 directly phosphorylates CRAF. Mielgo et al. reported that PLK1 associates with CRAF and this interaction does not require CRAF kinase activity. Interestingly, they also found that CRAF indirectly promotes PLK1 activation (Nat Med. 17:1641). This would add an additional layer of complexity to the PLK1-CRAF interplay (as we proposed) to further activate CRAF.</p><p><italic>In addition, Jiang and Tang (Respir Res 16:93) reported that PLK1 can activate MEK/ERK, although that study suggested the activation was CRAF pS338-independent, with PLK1 phosphorylating MEK activating sites.</italic> </p><p>Interestingly, Jiang and Tang reported that PLK1 can directly activate MEK/ERK signaling through phosphorylation of a MEK activating site in airway smooth muscle cells (Respir Res 16:93); however, that is not the case for prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This would suggest that PLK1 may differentially trigger distinct signaling pathways under different physiological conditions.</p><p><italic>Finally, much of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> replicates what Shin et al. (Mol Cell 38:114) reported for v-Ras transformed MCF-10A cells undergoing EMT.</italic> </p><p>It has been reported that ERK2/Fra1/ZEB1/2 signaling is responsible for EMT induction in RasG12V transformed MCF10A cells (<italic>Mol Cell</italic> 38:114). Our results convincingly demonstrate that PLK1 functions as a key regulator of EMT and cell motility in normal prostate epithelium and prostate cancer. The signaling mechanisms underlying the observed cellular effects of PLK1 involve direct PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of CRAF with subsequent stimulation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 signaling pathway. Our new findings along with the results from this other group suggest that ERK/Fra1/ZEB signaling could be a common pathway to induce EMT in mammalian epithelial cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
