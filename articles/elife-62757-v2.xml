gametes is necessary for normal reproduction, for which the regulation of proliferation from early gonadal development to adulthood is key in both sexes. Cystic proliferation of germline stem cells is an especially important step prior to the beginning of meiosis; however, the molecular regulators of this proliferation remain elusive in vertebrates. Here, we report that <italic>ndrg1b</italic> is an important regulator of cystic proliferation in medaka. We generated mutants of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> that led to a disruption of cystic proliferation of germ cells. This loss of cystic proliferation was observed from embryogenic to adult stages, impacting the success of gamete production and reproductive parameters such as spawning and fertilization. Interestingly, the depletion of cystic proliferation also impacted male sexual behavior, with a decrease of mating vigor. These data illustrate why it is also necessary to consider gamete production capacity in order to analyze reproductive behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ndrg1</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>gametogenesis</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>mating vigor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003074</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0366/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandino</surname><given-names>Juan I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003074</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2501/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arias Padilla</surname><given-names>Luisa F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14/07620-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosa</surname><given-names>Ivana F</given-names></name><name><surname>Nóbrega</surname><given-names>Rafael H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18/10265-5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosa</surname><given-names>Ivana F</given-names></name><name><surname>Nóbrega</surname><given-names>Rafael H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002923</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CONICET and São Paulo Research Foundation International Cooperation Grant D 2979/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Ricardo S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernandino</surname><given-names>Juan I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>São Paulo Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CONICET and São Paulo Research Foundation International Cooperation Grant D 2979/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Ricardo S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernandino</surname><given-names>Juan I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In medaka fish, the reduction of cystic proliferation of germ stem cells declines gametogenesis, reproduction success, and male sexual behavior, with a decrease of mating vigor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell division and differentiation are well-controlled processes for the development of a functional organ in multicellular organisms. In gonads, these processes are also essential to guarantee the correct production of gametes necessary for successful reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lombardi, 1998</xref>). Vertebrate gonads acquire sex-specific features during gonadogenesis, an exceptional, complex, multistep process that includes migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) to reach the gonadal primordium, proliferation, differentiation, and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeFalco and Capel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richardson and Lehmann, 2010</xref>). Defects in any of these steps may lead to sex abnormalities including infertility and sex reversal.</p><p>Proliferation of embryonic germline stem cells (EGSCs, the name applied to PGCs after they reach the gonadal primordium) gives rise to a cohort of germ cells that will ultimately form the primary population of germ cells in the gonads of both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka, 2019</xref>). This type of slow, intermittent division, also called type I proliferation, is similar to the self-renewal of germline stem cells in the adult ovary or testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Liu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2010</xref>), and is responsible for ensuring the production of the correct number of germline stem cells that will initiate gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka, 2019</xref>). In addition, the hyperproliferation of mitotically active germ cells in <italic>hotei</italic> medaka, a mutant fish for anti-Müllerian hormone receptor II (<italic>amhrII</italic>), induces 50% male-to-female sex reversal and loss of reproductive success in adult fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morinaga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakamura et al., 2012</xref>). On the contrary, lack of this proliferation of EGSCs during the embryo stage induces the opposite sex reversal in zebrafish and medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurokawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodríguez-Marí et al., 2010</xref>), showing that this initial proliferation can be also involved in gonadal sex fate.</p><p>A second EGSC proliferation occurs prior to meiosis, following a special program of synchronous, successive and incomplete mitosis, generating interconnected daughter cells known as cysts or nests, which are surrounded by somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saito et al., 2007</xref>). Following several rounds of mitosis, the cells enter meiosis to become oocytes in the ovary or spermatocytes in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lei and Spradling, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matova and Cooley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanaka, 2016</xref>). Cystic division is a highly conserved mechanism that precedes gametogenesis in both invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hansen and Schedl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lei and Spradling, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quagio-Grassiotto et al., 2011</xref>). It has been well established in vertebrates that female germ cells enter meiosis earlier, while male germ cells are arrested and undergo meiosis at the onset of the prepubertal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkouby and Mullins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koubova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lei and Spradling, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pepling, 2006</xref>). In medaka, this type of cystic cell division is known as type II proliferation, by which, in females, the number of EGSCs increases dramatically during embryonic stages; whereas in males, this exponential proliferation to form cysts begins later, in the juvenile stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Satoh and Egami, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka, 2019</xref>). Despite the importance of cystic cell proliferation during early life to ensure reproductive success, this process is not fully understood at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkouby and Mullins, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the search for genes that regulate EGSCs proliferation, <italic>ndrg1</italic> (n-myc downstream regulated gene 1) is one of the genes that was found to be upregulated in germ cells with mutated <italic>foxl3</italic>, a switch gene involved in the germline sexual fate decision in medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kikuchi et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Ndrg1</italic> is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation in different cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCaig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, this gene has homologs from mammals (<italic>Ndrg1</italic>) to fish (<italic>ndrg1</italic>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (ZK1073.1) to fruit fly (Dmel\MESK2), suggesting that NDRG1 is highly conserved among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kovacevic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Ndrg1</italic> has been demonstrated to inhibit the TGF-β signaling cascade, a very well-known pathway involved in cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), regulating the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tojo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2014</xref>), establishing <italic>ndrg1</italic> as a potent inhibitor of proliferation. However, its role in non-cancerous cells is not well established. In this study, we provide clear evidence of the important role of <italic>ndrg1</italic> in the regulation of EGSC cystic proliferation, with subsequent impact on reproductive success in medaka.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of <italic>ndrg1</italic> during gonadal development</title><p>To understand the role of <italic>ndrg1</italic> in cystic proliferation, the expression pattern of <italic>ndrg1</italic> during gonadal development was first determined. <italic>ndrg1</italic> belongs to the n-myc downstream regulated gene 1 family, and in the medaka genome has two paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as a result of teleost-specific genome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kasahara et al., 2007</xref>): <italic>ndrg1a</italic> (ENSORLG00000003558) on chromosome 11 and <italic>ndrg1b</italic> (ENSORLG00000004785) on chromosome 16, with 60% identity. The <italic>ndrg1a</italic> transcripts were not detectable in the medaka gonads during embryo developmental stages by whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, the medaka <italic>ndrg1b</italic> was specifically observed in gonads during embryo developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The transcript level of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> was quantified by qPCR at stage 35, when female (XX) and male (XY) gonads appear morphologically indistinguishable and germ cells only show type I proliferation. No difference for <italic>ndrg1b</italic> transcript levels was detected between female and male individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, differences between sexes were observed at stage 39, at 10 and 20 days post hatching (dph) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). At stage 39 and 10 dph, where female gonads have higher number of cysts compared to male gonads due to type II cystic division, the level of <italic>ndgr1b</italic> transcripts is higher in male than in female gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). The opposite sex transcriptional profile of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> was observed at 20 dph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), when type II proliferation begins in male individuals.

In mammals, it has been well established that <italic>Ndrg1</italic> exerts an inhibitory effect on cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCaig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, several studies have shown that <italic>Ndrg1</italic> is expressed in the gonads of humans, mice, sheep, and medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kikuchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lachat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stévant and Nef, 2019</xref>); however, its role in gonadal function and reproduction is still unknown. In medaka, there are two paralogs of <italic>ndrg1: ndrg1a</italic> and <italic>ndrg1b</italic>, although only <italic>ndrg1b</italic> is expressed in the gonad. Interestingly, <italic>ndrg1b</italic> expression is opposite to EGSC cystic proliferation in both sexes. Present from invertebrates to vertebrates, cystic division is a highly conserved mechanism that precedes gametogenesis and is crucial to reproductive success. However, its molecular regulation remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dinardo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Narbonne-Reveau et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To study the participation of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> in cystic proliferation, our first idea was to generate the loss of function of this gene through the generation of a homozygous mutant. However, obtaining a mutant line for <italic>ndrg1b</italic> was not possible because in homozygosis it would appear to be lethal. From the analysis of F2 individuals, and waiting for the presence of 25% homozygous KOs to <italic>ndrg1b</italic>, surprisingly, this genotype was not obtained because individuals died during embryonic early development for unknown reason. Moreover, it is important to highlight that obtaining these F1 and F2 required a significant investment of time given the very low spawning rate of the heterozygote females, the low fertility of heterozygote males, and the low hatching rate. The impossibility of obtaining a stable line for the loss of function of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> led us to search for another robust and reproducible alternative.</p><p>In fish, and especially in medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ansai and Kinoshita, 2014</xref>), it has been well established that the complex Cas9/sgRNA generated a high-efficiency biallelic mutations of injected animals (cas9+sgRNA). The high efficiency of biallelic mutant and the use of this approach to research in medaka were already corroborated recently in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castañeda Cortés et al., 2019</xref>). This high efficiency is observed in the present work too, in which two different sgRNAs used to generate the biallelic mutant of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> presented 96.6% for sg1_ndrg1b and 80% for sg2_ndrg1b. Despite this high efficiency, this could not translate into a robust and reproducible phenotype, so were performed different controls. In this regard, we analyzed the gonadal phenotype of a second sgRNA (sg2-ndrg1b) injection, obtaining the same reduction of cystic proliferation of germ cells and adding to the verification of the absence of off-target, it supports the high directionality of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate the loss of function through the generation of biallelic mutants for <italic>ndrg1b</italic>. Another important concern to analyze is the reproducibility of the chosen system. On this regard, the phenotype throughout the different experiments, both in embryonic, juveniles, and in adult stages, carried out in many different individuals, supports the high repeatability and robustness of the phenotype of the biallelic mutant of <italic>ndrg1b</italic>. Furthermore, in a previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castañeda Cortés et al., 2019</xref> in medaka using biallelic mutants of two different sgRNAs targeting other loci, the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors (crhr1 and crhr2), no relevant gonadal phenotype was observed in biallelic mutant fish reared at 24°C, showing the lack of a relevant phenotype in the germline after the use of CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, and something that is a strong point of the present work, this phenotype of the biallelic mutant was also analyzed and observed in both sexes, which even present different developing times in cystic proliferation.</p><p>In the present study, we generated <italic>ndrg1b</italic> F0 mutants by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and showed that the lack of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> leads to a reduction in the total number of germ cells by inhibiting cystic proliferation in both sexes during early gonadal development and adulthood. This is evidence that <italic>ndrg1b</italic> is likely involved in the molecular regulation of cystic division in medaka. Gametogenesis commences within the spermatocysts or cysts in males and within germline cradles in females, from germline stem cell precursors called spermatogonia or oogonia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nishimura et al., 2016</xref>). Histological examination of adult gonads showed that medaka <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutants displayed typical female and male gonadal structure with all the different stages of germ cells; however, they had a lower production of gametes. In this regard, although a previous study has shown that type I proliferation is important to germline stem cell number in adult medaka gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morinaga et al., 2007</xref>), here we showed that type II proliferation (cystic) is also crucial to gamete production, and consequently, to related reproductive parameters such as the number of spawned eggs, spermatozoa, and fertilization rate. Moreover, expression of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> in testis is restricted to the most peripheral region of the tubule, where A-type undifferentiated spermatogonia (SGa) are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwai et al., 2006</xref>). This location of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> expression is in agreement with the reduction of cystic proliferation since it is not observed in B-type spermatogonia (SGb), which have already entered that proliferation.</p><p>Additionally, we observed that the reduction of cystic proliferation in <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutants did not induce any sex reversal or modification in the sex ratio. These observations are in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishimura et al., 2018</xref> in <italic>figla</italic>, <italic>meioC,</italic> and <italic>dazl</italic> mutants in medaka, in which follicle formation is disrupted, germ cells are unable to commit to gametogenesis, and germ cells do not develop into EGSCs, respectively. All these mutants exhibited female secondary characteristics and ovary structures, demonstrating that the mechanism underlying sex reversal is manifested before germline cells exit from the status of stem cells/gonocytes and enter the gametogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishimura et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, medaka mutants that had an effect on type I proliferation, like the germ cell-deficient <italic>cxcr4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurokawa et al., 2007</xref>) and also loss of <italic>amhrII</italic> (TGF-β pathway member) that display hyperproliferative germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morinaga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakamura et al., 2012</xref>), showed sex reversal. Interestingly, our results showed that the TGF-β pathway is not involved in the cystic division, and the increased proliferation in males is due to inhibition of TGF-β members involved in controlling germ cell type I proliferation, such as <italic>amh</italic>. Further studies are therefore necessary to elucidate the regulatory pathways of this type of proliferation.</p><p>An interesting observation in the present work was the lower spawn by normal females paired with <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutant males. It has been established that sexual behavior is linked to reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oshima et al., 2003</xref>), and, fortunately, the sexual behavior of medaka consists of a sequence of several actions that are easily quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ono and Uematsu, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walter and Hamilton, 1970</xref>). We specifically observed differences in male mating behavior related to stimulation of female spawning and fertilization, such as the duration of quivering and number of convulsions; actions that seem to be conserved in vertebrates because ejaculation in male rats is accompanied by strong vibration and significant abdominal contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qin et al., 2017</xref>). Sexual behavior has been found to be strongly controlled by the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiraki-Kajiyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang and Shah, 2014</xref>) and levels of sex steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiraki-Kajiyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munakata and Kobayashi, 2010</xref>). Here, it is important to note that in medaka the secondary sex characters are induced by sex steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kikuchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sato et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutants showed normal secondary sex characters in both males and females. Moreover, the level of the main androgen in fish, 11-KT, did not show differences between wt and <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutants, thus establishing that sex steroid synthesis is not impaired in these animals. Regarding sexual behavior, in studies where the regulation of sex hormones was altered, changes in sexual behavior were primarily related to courtship, such as the frequencies of following, dancing, and latency from the first courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiraki-Kajiyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oshima et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, when brain regulators were altered, such as arginine-vasotocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yokoi et al., 2015</xref>), oxytocin ligand (oxt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yokoi et al., 2020</xref>), and TN-GnRH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okuyama et al., 2014</xref>), changes in courtship display and sexual motivation, latency to mating and number of courtships displays, and latency to mating were observed, respectively. None of these courtship actions changed in the male <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutants, leading us to consider whether the specific mating actions of quivering and convulsions are exclusively related to the lower number of spermatogonia and spermatozoa in males. To our knowledge, only one other study has observed this loss of mating vigor in medaka. In it, successive multiple mating-induced depletion of sperm reserves decreased fertilization and mating rate, and even females responded by reducing clutch size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weir and Grant, 2010</xref>). In this respect, this association warrants further investigation in vertebrates including brain, endocrine, and gonadal features.</p><p>Taken together, our data show that mutations of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> lead to disruption of germline stem cell cystic proliferation with a subsequent reduction in the number of gametes and an unexpected change in mating behavior of medaka. Altogether, these data are significant for three main reasons: (1) we showed that <italic>ndrg1b</italic> is involved in the regulation of cystic proliferation during different stages of medaka development (embryo, juvenile, and adult) in a TGF-β-independent manner; (2) we demonstrated that mutation of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> leads to changes in number of gametes, decreasing reproductive success for both sexes; and (3) <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutation affected male mating behaviors in medaka without changing androgen production.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Source of medaka</title><p>All experiments were performed with medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) (strain hi-medaka, ID: MT835) supplied by the National BioResource Project (NBRP) Medaka (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/">http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/</ext-link>).

These stages are important for medaka gonadal development. Stage 35 corresponds to a sexually undifferentiated gonad in both sexes and only type I divisions (first mitotic proliferation).

Stage 39 corresponds to the maximum EGSC proliferation in XX embryos, and involves sexually dimorphic gonads, just at the time of hatching. At 10 dph, type II division is present only in XX gonads, while in XY gonads, it begins only at 20 dph. At 80 dph, animals have become sexually mature adults.

For the TGF-β inhibitor treatment, stage 39 individuals were fixed in 4% buffered glutaraldehyde, embedded in Technovit (7100-Heraeus Kulzer), sectioned at 5 μm thickness, and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue to quantify the germ cells using a light microscope (Leica DM6000 BD, Leica Microsystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cell quantification</title><p>All section photographs were taken using a ZEISS Axio Observer 7 Led colibri 7, Nikon Eclipse E600 and Nikon Digital Sight DSQi1Mc. Images were analyzed using FIJI software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Individual cells were counted manually with the Cell Counter plugin for FIJI. Type I and II germ cells were counted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saito et al., 2007</xref>), where single isolated germ cells were counted as type I, while clusters with more than two germ cells were counted as germ cells undergoing type II division. Spermatogonia were counted based on the description by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iwasaki et al., 2009</xref> and oocytes based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seki et al., 2004</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gay et al., 2018</xref>. All gonadal sections were counted for stage 39 individuals. For 20 and 80 dph individuals, three gonadal sections were counted, setting the distance between each section to avoid counting the same cell twice. Each section was counted two times in all experiments to reduce technical errors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Sperm quantification</title><p>Sperm was collected from mutant and control adult males after immersion in tricaine at 30 ± 50 mg/l. Each male was placed on a foam rubber holder with the belly facing up; the urogenital pore was dried and sperm was collected with a micropipette while gentle pressure was applied from bilateral abdominal toward the anal opening using fine forceps. Prior to the analysis, the sperm was diluted 5000 times in cold Ringer’s solution (NaCl 0.75%, KCl 0.02%, CaCl<sub>2 </sub>0.02%, NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>0.002%) and kept at 4°C. Sperm counts were determined by hemocytometer (Bright-Line, Hausser Scientific) analysis under light microscope at ×200 magnification, performing three counting replicates per individual.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Evaluation of reproductive success</title><p>To evaluate reproductive success, we used three categories of sexually mature couples: control (wt female and male), mutant female (wt male and <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutant female), and mutant male (wt female and <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutant male). Each couple was acclimated for 5 days in a breeding tank to ensure and standardize their reproductive conditions. For 10 consecutive mornings, each couple’s fertilized and unfertilized eggs were carefully collected by hand, placed in a separate dish, and counted to calculate total spawned eggs, fertilization (number of fertilized eggs/number spawned eggs), and hatching (number of hatched larvae/number of fertilized eggs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Sexual behavior assay</title><p>Sexual behavior assay was performed over 10 days using two categories of sexually mature couples, control and mutant male, mentioned above, which were allowed to acclimate for 5 days to ensure and standardize their reproductive conditions. On the remaining 5 days, the procedure was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okuyama et al., 2014</xref>). Males and females were separated in the evening (6–7 PM) the day before the assay using a transparent plastic cup with small holes for water exchange. The following morning the mating pairs were placed together in a single transparent tank and their sexual behavior was recorded for 20 min using a digital video camera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The recording order was randomly changed every day. Water inflow to the tanks was stopped during recording. Females that did not spawn or spawned without any mating behavior were excluded from the analysis. The following behavioral parameters were calculated from the video recordings: latency until first courtship display, latency from the first courtship display to the wrapping that resulted in spawning; number of wrappings before and after spawning, the duration of wrapping, and within wrapping time; and the duration of quivering and number of convulsions. Each action during sexual behavior was identified following the descriptions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ono and Uematsu, 1957</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walter and Hamilton, 1970</xref> and analyzed twice by two different authors of the present study who did not know the category of the couple.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Blood levels of 11-KT in sexually mature males</title><p>Plasma 11-KT concentrations were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Cayman 582751) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, control and <italic>sgN1b</italic> sexually mature males (n = 7) were coupling with wt females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Males and females were separated in the evening (6–7 PM) the day before the assay using a transparent plastic cup with small holes for water exchange, and then blood samples of anesthetized male individuals were collected directly from the caudal vein using a glass capillary tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Royan et al., 2020</xref>). All fish were recovered after blood extraction. Steroid extractions were performed twice with ethyl acetate/hexane from 1 μl of whole blood and then reconstituted in 200 μl of assay buffer. All samples were assayed in duplicate, and hormone levels were determined based on a standard curve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Values are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical variables. Fold change and statistical analysis of RT-qPCR quantifications were performed using FgStatistics software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sites.google.com/site/fgStatistics/">http://sites.google.com/site/fgStatistics/</ext-link>), based on the comparative gene expressions method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pfaffl, 2001</xref>). Statistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Continuous variables were compared between two groups by the unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. If the <italic>F</italic>-test indicated that the variance differed significantly between groups, Welch’s correction to the Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was employed. For more than two groups, continuous variables were compared by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, comparing the mean of each column with the mean of every other column. All differences were considered statistically significant when p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Tech.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript by Arias Padilla et al. the authors investigate the role of ndrg1b in gonad development and mating behavior in medaka. They find ndrg1b is required for cystic proliferation of the gonad and for gamete production, reproductive success and mating vigor.</p><p>This is an interesting and straightforward study that reports a novel function for ndrg1 in gonad development and also generates several insights into gonad development and links defects in gamete production to mating behavior and reproductive success in a way that is not obviously rooted in hormone production. However, there are significant problems related to the use of F0 CRISPR injected animals that cannot be overcome unless stable mutants are analyzed. There is also a need to assess hormone production and provide additional evidence that might help exclude extra-gonadal function for ndrg1b that could explain the behavioral phenotypes.</p><p>We realize revisions would not be feasible within a reasonable time unless establishment of a stable mutant line has already been in progress. The authors should evaluate whether under current conditions the essential revisions listed below are feasible.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reanalyzing the phenotypes using stable mutant fish. Both male and female mutants appear to be fertile, considering that they can produce fertilizable gametes and their offspring can develop normally. Even though male mutants showed lower fertilization and hatching rates, it would thus be possible to generate a stable mutant line and assess the phenotypes of the siblings from the line.</p><p>2) Measuring hormonal production. If the androgen levels are altered in the mutants, the conclusion that the reduced number of germ cells leads to the behavioral deficit would be wrong. Thus, the circulating levels of sex steroids should be directly assessed.</p><p>3) Confirming that ndrg1b functions exclusively in the gonad. While the ideal experiment would be to demonstrate that gonad specific rescue restores mating performance, a careful gene expression analysis using in situ hybridization would help support the claims.</p><p>4) Recommendations for behavioral assays. The medaka strain used in this study (himedaka) is not inbred and exhibits large interindividual genetic variations. In addition, the number of germ cells varies depending on environmental conditions early in life. Therefore, phenotypes should be compared between homozygous knockouts and wild-type/heterozygous siblings that were derived from the same clutch of eggs and reared in the identical environmental condition (after establishing a knockout medaka line) to control for genetic background and environmental effects.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cystic proliferation of germ stem cells is necessary to reproductive success and normal mating behavior in medaka&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Reviewers agree in that he manuscript has been improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. Specifically, controls are need for the F0 CRISPRs and the reported lethality numbers need to be re-examined and/or explained. Additionally, please include a discussion point justifying the use of F0 CRISPRs mentioning the use of a second gRNA and summarizing controls. Along with two experimental points that need to be addressed, there are also several suggestions for editorial changes, editing by a professional or a native speaker would help improve the manuscript and make the work easier to read.</p><p>1) While their results suggest that the use of F0 animals is viable in this case, particularly considering they are investigating a mutation that affects the germ line, additional controls will be needed to rule out non-specific defects due to genome editing. Controls may include: 1-documenting the absence of relevant phenotypes following the use of an inefficient or inactive gRNA targeting ndrg1b; 2-documenting the absence of relevant phenotypes following the use of a gRNA targeting another locus; 3-testing for toxicity by inject the gRNA or Cas9 alone.</p><p>2) A) If the homozygous mutants are lethal, the ratio of wild-type fish to heterozygous fish in progeny should be 1:2 when heterozygous mutants are crossed to each other. However, this was not the case, and the ratio was almost 1:1. Assuming that one parent of the crossed F1 generation fish was the wild-type, the result can be well explained. Did the authors confirm the result that the homozygous mutants cannot be obtained by crossing heterozygous mutants, for example, by conducting a follow-up test using another parent fish?</p><p>B) The methodology of the 2nd HMA, whose results are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, panel D, is not described anywhere. Therefore, it is not possible to see whether the method was designed to detect the homozygous mutants correctly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cystic proliferation of germline stem cells is necessary to reproductive success and normal mating behavior in medaka&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The text changes improved the manuscript but there are two important remaining issues that were raised on the original manuscript and the revised version that need to be addressed. Resolving these issues is essential for ensuring that sufficient minimal quality controls have been made before the manuscript can be accepted.</p><p>The outstanding issues are:</p><p>1) Additional controls for the F0 CRISPRs were requested. Instead of performing additional injections of gRNA alone and documenting the absence of relevant phenotypes upon editing of another locus, literature was cited and it was the point was argued, but without including any discussion points in the manuscript. 1A- If the analyses in Castaneda-Cortes et al. is sufficient for claiming that genome editing of another locus does not lead to the type of germ line defects reported in the present manuscript, a discussion point citing this reference should be added along with a mention of the use of another gRNA targeting ndrg1b and reproducing the reported phenotype, the lack of phenotype following injection of Cas9 mRNA alone and, if possible, the gRNA1 alone (general lack of toxicity for gRNAs cannot be assumed).</p><p>2) The authors did not document in their revised manuscript when the lethality of the homozygous mutation arises and used HMA for genotyping, which is not optimal. At the very least, they need to determine whether homozygous embryos can be generated from heterozygous crosses and attempt to approximately define the developmental window at which homozygous mutants are lost. This issue cannot be dismissed or left open for further studies because if no homozygous mutant embryos can be generated, then heterozygous germ line defects or technical problems may be present. It is recommended that a more robust method than HMA is used for genotyping the offspring of heterozygous crosses, a 31 bp deletion should be easy to detect by PCR across the locus followed by high % agarose or acrylamide gel electrophoresis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62757.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reanalyzing the phenotypes using stable mutant fish.

In agreement with the reviewers, this strategy was the first we chose to study the participation of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> in the proliferation of germ cells. However, obtaining a mutant line for this gene was not possible because in homozygosis it would appear to be lethal. This depends on our previous experiments carried out, and now added such as Figure 2—figure supplement 3, where we were able to make three important observations that support the choice of the use of F0 injected fish (as known as crispant too) in the present study. In the new Figure 2—figure supplement 3, the experimental design can be observed, where the deletion ∆31 (deletion of 31 bp), previously characterized in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, was chosen to cross F1 and obtain the loss of function of the <italic>ndrg1b</italic> gene. It is important to highlight that obtaining these F1 and F2 required a significant investment of time given the low spawning rate of the heterozygote females (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A), the low fertility of heterozygote males (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) and the low hatching rate (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). From the analysis of F2 individuals, and waiting for the presence of 25% homozygous knockouts to <italic>ndrg1b</italic>, surprisingly, this genotype was not obtained (as can be seen in the table of Figure 4—figure supplement 1 performed by means of an HMA test of supplement figure 1C, D). This would establish that <italic>ndrg1b</italic> has another function in early stages of development that should be studied in future studies, since they are outside the scope of the present work.</p><p>In fish, and especially in medaka (Ansai and Kinoshita, 2014), it has been well established that the complex Cas9/sgRNA generated a high efficiency biallelic mutations of injected animals (cas9+sgRNA). The high efficiency of biallelic mutant and the used of this approach to research in medaka was already corroborate recently in our laboratory (Castañeda-Cortés et al., 2019). This highly efficiency is observed in the present work too, in which two different sgRNAs used to generate the biallelic mutant of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> presented 96.6% for sg1-ndrg1b and 80% for sg2-ndrg1b (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D, Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). Despite this high efficiency, each individual was checked for biallelic <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutations before being used for the different analyzes for corroboration. Nevertheless, this high efficiency might not translate into a robust and reproducible phenotype, which is perhaps the question established by the reviewers; however, our data supports the use of this approach to the present study. I am going to focus on some results of this work that support this choice:</p><p>i) A good control supporting the use of F0 injected fish was analyzed the phenotype of a second sgRNA (sg2-ndrg1b). On this concern, testing different sgRNAs we obtained the same reduction of cystic proliferation of gem cells (see Figure 2B, C and Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D), and adding to the verification of the absence of off-target, it supports the high directionality of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate the loss of function through the generation of biallelic mutants for <italic>ndrg1b</italic>. Consequently, the used of two different sgRNA presenting the same phenotype support the robustness of the chosen system.</p><p>ii) Another important point to analyze is the reproducibility of the chosen system. On this regard, the phenotype throughout the different experiments, both in embryonic stages (quantification of the number of germ cells, proliferation, apoptosis; Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, 4C), in juveniles (quantification of the proliferation of germ cells; Figure 3) and in adults (quantification of germ cells, quantification of parameters and reproductive tests and measure by qPCR and ELISA of ndrg1b transcripts and 11-KT respectively; Figure 4, 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1), carried out in many different individuals, support the high repeatability and robustness of the phenotype of the biallelic mutant of ndrg1b. In addition, and something that is a strong point of the present work, is that this phenotype of the biallelic mutant was also analyzed and observed in both sexes, which even present different developing times in cystic proliferation.</p><p>iii) As already observed in medaka (Ansai and Kinoshita, 2014; Castañeda-Cortés, et al., 2019) and confirmed by this study, the overwhelming majority of fish injected with different sgRNAs displayed normal morphological development and growth, compared with non-injected or cas9 injected embryos (Figure 4E-H). Moreover, the expression of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> is restricted to the gonad, at least during the gonadal development in embryo and adults (Figure 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Taking together, our results support that the biallelic mutation of ndrg1b affects preferably, and perhaps exclusively, germ cells and their cystic proliferation, since type I proliferation, characteristic of asynchronous self-renewal of germ cells, is not affected (Figure 2C, 2G, 4J and 4N).</p><p>iv) Another observation supporting the use of biallelic mutant individuals is the similar phenotype observed with F1 reproductive trial (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Firstly, from the beginning we had to rule out the use of F1 to carry out all the experiments of the present work, since as we explained previously, the low fertility and survival in F1 would require that a sufficient number of individuals would take an enormous amount of time, making very It is difficult to compare the data obtained in each experiment, since we would use individuals obtained sporadically over a period of time of months.</p><p>v) Other interesting observation was that the number of spawning eggs was reduced in male and female sgNb1 and F1, the fertilization rate was reduced in sgNb1 and F1 males and, interestingly, the hatching rate was sex dimorphic, and only in embryo from sgNb1 and F1 males was reduced comparing with the respective control male (Figure 4B-D, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C), establishing the need for future studies in this direction. Again, this robust phenotype supports the use of injected medaka individuals, at least for this gene.</p><p>In addition to the robustness and reproducibility of the data generated in the present work, the use of individuals with biallelic mutations generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique has generated an interesting option for the classical use of knockout in some experimental approaches. For example, a resent work in Developmental Cell of Hoshijima et al. (2019) analyzed the generation of F0 embryos to generate the loss of function of different targets using sgRNA and two-RNA component (crRNA:tracrRNA) version of the CRISPR system. They obtained similar full bi-allelic mutants using both CRISPR system, depending of the locus target. Similar results were obtained by Kroll and co-authors (2021) in a very recent paper published in <italic>eLife</italic>, in which standardized a simple and effective F0 knockout method for rapid screening of behavior and other complex phenotypes, obtained the same phenotype to zebrafish mutant lines. Interestingly, although they showed that with 3 gRNA they obtain a complete loss-of-function, in many genes only one was sufficient, establishing that for each gene a standardization of the phenotypes obtained is necessary, something that we efficiently do in our work. In our experiments, we chose sgRNAs that presented high efficiency of DSB, showing by HMA (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, 2). These observations are highly supported for many works in fish (e.g., Hockman et al., 2019). Moreover, the use of biallelic mutation (mosaics) has spread widely in other vertebrate models, although using different approaches but still analyzing a similar result, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, chicken, and others (Feehan et al., 2017; Naert et a., 2016; Véron et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2018), some of them published in <italic>eLife</italic> (Chai et al., 2020; Delventhal et al., 2019; Gandhi et al., 2020; Port et al., 2020; Sanor et al., 2020), so CRISPR / Cas has quickly become the gold standard for many experiments, outperforming pre-existing technologies such as shRNA, RNAi and Morpholinos (Evers et al., 2016; Morgens et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Measuring hormonal production. If the androgen levels are altered in the mutants, the conclusion that the reduced number of germ cells leads to the behavioral deficit would be wrong. Thus, the circulating levels of sex steroids should be directly assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>Initially, we observed that the mutated individuals did not present changes in secondary sexual characteristics, such as the hindmost rays in the dorsal fin, highly related to the presence of androgens in males (Ngamniyom et a., 2009), and for that reason initially we did not take into account their measurement. However, the observation made by the reviewers is valid, and the quantification of circulating androgens is needed to validate our hypothesis that changes in germ cell proliferation directly affect reproductive behavior.</p><p>To carry out the quantification of androgens, specifically 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), the main androgen in fish (Gonçalves and Oliveira, 2011), pairs of wild males and <italic>ndrg1b</italic> mutants (sgNb1) with wild females were generated, which were then acclimatized for 5 days. After this and anesthetizing the fish, we proceeded to extract blood (1 μl) from the caudal peduncle vein using glass capillaries, following the protocol established by Royan et al. (2020). All fish were recovered after blood extraction. Finally, we used whole blood at a dilution of 200 μl PBS, extracting the steroid with diethyl ether and we used Cayman kit for measuring the 11-KT (see details in Materials and methods section and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Finally, the quantification of 11-KT did not show differences between wild-type and sgNb1 males (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B), supporting our hypothesis that changes in mating behavior is related to a reduction in cystic proliferation and a reduced number germ cells in males.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Confirming that ndrg1b functions exclusively in the gonad. While the ideal experiment would be to demonstrate that gonad specific rescue restores mating performance, a careful gene expression analysis using in situ hybridization would help support the claims.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewers recommended was performed extra in situ hybridization in testis and brain of male adults, observing a clear expression in testis and absent of the respective expression in brain (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, E). Since the in situ hybridization is not a very sensitive technique for detecting small amounts of transcript, we decided to add a more sensitive technique, such as qPCR, to the reviewers' suggestion. In concordance, the presence of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> also was observed by qPCR only in male adult gonads (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), confirming with two different techniques the expression of <italic>ndrg1b</italic> exclusively in gonads.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Recommendations for behavioral assays. The medaka strain used in this study (himedaka) is not inbred and exhibits large interindividual genetic variations. In addition, the number of germ cells varies depending on environmental conditions early in life. Therefore, phenotypes should be compared between homozygous knockouts and wild-type/heterozygous siblings that were derived from the same clutch of eggs and reared in the identical environmental condition (after establishing a knockout medaka line) to control for genetic background and environmental effects.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with reviewers all experiments and specially the behavioral and reproductive success assays were carefully carried out under identical conditions. First of all, the individuals derived of a mating set (n=10-12) were randomly selected to the injection the same day. Subsequently injected individuals were reared at identical environmental conditions, such as light, fed, temperature and density. Additionally, fish were randomly selected to establish mating couples and the recording video order and analysis were performed as double-blind.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers agree in that he manuscript has been improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. Specifically, controls are need for the F0 CRISPRs and the reported lethality numbers need to be re-examined and/or explained. Additionally, please include a discussion point justifying the use of F0 CRISPRs mentioning the use of a second gRNA and summarizing controls. Along with two experimental points that need to be addressed, there are also several suggestions for editorial changes, editing by a professional or a native speaker would help improve the manuscript and make the work easier to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate all previous recommendations from the reviewers, being a very good feed-back that has greatly improved the manuscript. In this present version we try to answer all the new recommendations, which can be found below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) While their results suggest that the use of F0 animals is viable in this case, particularly considering they are investigating a mutation that affects the germ line, additional controls will be needed to rule out non-specific defects due to genome editing. Controls may include: 1-documenting the absence of relevant phenotypes following the use of an inefficient or inactive gRNA targeting ndrg1b; 2-documenting the absence of relevant phenotypes following the use of a gRNA targeting another locus; 3-testing for toxicity by inject the gRNA or Cas9 alone.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers present a good point here; however, at point 1, we are not sure that the use of an inefficient or inactive sgRNA targeting <italic>ndrg1b</italic> is a good control in this case, and we will explain why. The addition of a similar molecule that does not present activity, which is an excellent control, for example, to knock-down through the use of morpholinos and for which a control morpholino is used; however, we believe that it is being carried out in our experiments by injecting Cas9 mRNA alone as control. Moreover, we also rely on the substantial evidence of the low toxicity presented by injections in stages of a cell in medaka, not being reported in the concentrations used in the present work (see reference from Ansai and Kinoshita, 2014; Fang et al., 2018; Gay et al., 2018; Homma et al., 2017; Kayo et al., 2019; Sawamura et al., 2017; Seleit et al., 2020; Yeh et al., 2017). That is why in all our experiments we performed Cas9 (RNA control) as a control, and also the manipulation control (since all the embryos were injected). Moreover, there are two other pieces of evidence that support the absence of an inactive sgRNA control. First, the use of a second sgRNA, with a different target sequence from the <italic>ndrg1b</italic> locus in which the same phenotype is observed (sg2-ndrg1b; Figure 2—figure supplement 2). In addition, a second evidence supporting the absent of an inactive sgRNA control can also be complemented with the response to the point 2.</p><p>The point 2, where the reviewers suggest documenting the lack of a relevant phenotype after the use of another sgRNA targeting another locus, in a previous work of our laboratory (Castañeda-Cortés et al., 2019) was used two different sgRNAs to generate biallelic mutants of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors (crhr1 and crhr2), following the morphological analysis of the gonad at 20 dph (from this study we just take that 20 dph is the best time to analyze gonad development). From our published data, analyzing 45 individuals from two sgRNAs of crhr1 and crhr2, and both injected together, we did not observe any relevant gonadal phenotype in the biallelic mutants fish reared at 24ºC.</p><p>Regarding point 3, fortunately, the toxicity of Cas9 and sgRNA alone had been tested by Ansai and Kinoshita (2014) to different concentration and targets to the concentration used in our work. For this reason, we draw on this and other works cited above, as well as our experience. In this way, the concentrations used in the present work have been standardized, so that if, for example, a synthesized sgRNA does not generate enough indels, in general above 80%, the sgRNA is discarded, never opting for the possibility of increasing the concentration of sgRNA to obtain a higher percentage of indels, for which a greater analysis of the toxicity of these concentrations would be necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A) If the homozygous mutants are lethal, the ratio of wild-type fish to heterozygous fish in progeny should be 1:2 when heterozygous mutants are crossed to each other. However, this was not the case, and the ratio was almost 1:1. Assuming that one parent of the crossed F1 generation fish was the wild-type, the result can be well explained. Did the authors confirm the result that the homozygous mutants cannot be obtained by crossing heterozygous mutants, for example, by conducting a follow-up test using another parent fish?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers did an excellent observation about proportion. First, all the individuals used in this experiment were controlled by a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) and then confirmed by sequencing. In addition, we used several pairs (n = 4), which avoid the problem of some error in their establishment. To make this confirmation, the individuals were individualized in small fish tanks until the results were analyzed, which takes around 10 days. Then, the individuals were acclimatized for a month before making the crosses.</p><p>Discarding this, is true that the Figure 2—figure supplement 3 panel B would have led to a deceive interpretation, because the percentages of heterozygous and homozygous individuals are referred to the total number of analyzed F2 individuals by HMA, and don’t to the total number of F2 progeny, that is, it was not referred to the number of fertilized eggs, and therefore the number of dead individuals is not included. This could establish that in heterozygosity the mutation is partially lethal, and more studies would be needed to confirm this.</p><p>The subtitle of Figure 2—figure supplement 3, panel B was changed: “Table indicates the obtained proportion of heterozygous and homozygous of analyzed F2 individuals by heteroduplex mobility assay.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) The methodology of the 2nd HMA, whose results are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, panel D, is not described anywhere. Therefore, it is not possible to see whether the method was designed to detect the homozygous mutants correctly.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct because the methodology didn’t well explain in Figure 2—figure supplement 3. The methodology of F2 screening was detailed in Biallelic CRISPR mutants screening and Off-target analysis – Materials and methods section: “Additionally, F2 generation was obtained by mating F1 fish harboring the same mutation (the ∆31, deletion of 31 bp) with each other, the obtained F2 trial was analyzed by HMA genotyping using genomic DNA extracted from each fin clip of F2 fish (1<sup>st</sup> HMA), and to clearly discriminate homozygous mutants from wild-type fish, each PCR product from the 1st HMA was mixed with a wild-type PCR product separately, and the mixture was reannealed by heating at 95°C for 5 min and gently cooling to room temperature (2<sup>nd</sup> HMA), following the protocol previously established by Ansai and Kinoshita (2017) in the book section (Hatada, 2017) (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).”</p><p>As we mentioned above the method to detect the homozygous mutant was previously stablished by Ansai and Kinoshita (2017) in the book section (Hatada, 2017) and validated by Foster (2019). Additionally, 2<sup>nd</sup> HMA method has been widely used in our laboratory to the homozygous identification.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The outstanding issues are:</p><p>1) Additional controls for the F0 CRISPRs were requested. Instead of performing additional injections of gRNA alone and documenting the absence of relevant phenotypes upon editing of another locus, literature was cited and it was the point was argued, but without including any discussion points in the manuscript. 1A- If the analyses in Castaneda-Cortes et al. is sufficient for claiming that genome editing of another locus does not lead to the type of germ line defects reported in the present manuscript, a discussion point citing this reference should be added along with a mention of the use of another gRNA targeting ndrg1b and reproducing the reported phenotype, the lack of phenotype following injection of Cas9 mRNA alone and, if possible, the gRNA1 alone (general lack of toxicity for gRNAs cannot be assumed).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the observation. It was our mistake do not add the fruitful discussion established with the reviewers in the manuscript. For this, the discussion was added to the main text (see Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors did not document in their revised manuscript when the lethality of the homozygous mutation arises and used HMA for genotyping, which is not optimal. At the very least, they need to determine whether homozygous embryos can be generated from heterozygous crosses and attempt to approximately define the developmental window at which homozygous mutants are lost. This issue cannot be dismissed or left open for further studies because if no homozygous mutant embryos can be generated, then heterozygous germ line defects or technical problems may be present. It is recommended that a more robust method than HMA is used for genotyping the offspring of heterozygous crosses, a 31 bp deletion should be easy to detect by PCR across the locus followed by high % agarose or acrylamide gel electrophoresis.</p></disp-quote><p>We value the observation because we had not mentioned the timing of the F2 selection in the manuscript, and it was added to the Materials and methods section. F2 fish were analyzed by HMA at 80 dph (adult stage).</p><p>About the developmental window when the homozygotes died, we don't know the exact developmental stage, is most probable that it was around early development between 1 to 20 hours post fertilization, moment that correspond to morula to gastrula. Unfortunately, we did not explore it in more detail because is a window that generally present mortality under normal conditions in wild-type individuals. Frankly, at that time our principal objective was to obtain a high amount of homozygous individuals to be able to study cystic proliferation in fundamental stages of gonadal development. But as we added to the discussion, the generation of F1 and F2 required a significant investment of time given the very low spawning rate of the heterozygote females, the low fertility of heterozygote males and the low hatching rate, then we decided to continue with the generation of biallelic mutants. Additionally, at this current moment is not possible repeat the F2 screening to explore in detail the stage of death.</p><p>After analyze the reviewer’s recommendations we decided to delete the phrase “This suggests that <italic>ndrg1b</italic> has another essential function in early stages of development, which should be investigated in future studies” from the main text because the idea “<italic>ndrg1b</italic> has another essential function in early stages of development” is ambiguous and we don’t have enough evidences.</p><p>Looking at the observation that the reviewers make about HMA, we can infer that we have not been clear in explaining the technique. The Heteroduplex Mobility Assay method was better written in a greater detail in the Materials and methods section. This method is a practical and sensible method previously stablished for F2 screening (Hatada, 2017). In the HMA method, accurately as the reviewers mentioned in the current revision, each DNA F2 individuals (Δ31) is used to detect the <italic>ndrg1b</italic> locus by PCR, followed by 10% acrylamide gel electrophoresis, step referred as 1<sup>st</sup>HMA, in which definitely would be possible to distinguish the bands derived from wild-type or KO fish (single band) according to their size. However, as Ansai and Kinoshita suggested in the book of Genome Editing in Animals – Methods and Protocols (Hatada, 2017), is recommended to perform a second HMA (2<sup>nd</sup> HMA), for reliable distinction between wild-type and KO fish, following the next process: “to a PCR product showing a single band pattern in HMA, add a PCR product separately prepared from wild-type template. Reanneal the mixture by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and gently cooling to room temperature. Perform 2<sup>nd</sup> HMA. The wild-type will show only one band, while KO fish will show a multiple banding pattern similar to heterozygotes”. Additionally, HMA method has been satisfactorily used in our laboratory to F2 screening for another locus (unpublished data). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> is an example of HMA for F2 screening: in the left panel is the 1<sup>st</sup> HMA where heterozygous individuals were identified (+/- : 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8) because showed multiple banding patterns. In the right panel is the 2<sup>nd</sup> HMA to clearly discriminate homozygous fish (individuals that showed a single band in 1<sup>st</sup> HMA: 1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 11 and 12). Each PCR product from the 1st HMA was mixed with a wild-type template, to perform the 2<sup>nd</sup> HMA, where showed wild-type fish (+/+ : 1, 5 and 10), and homozygous mutant (-/- : 9, 11 and 12). Fish 2 is discarded because its pattern is not clear.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62757-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>References:Chai, A.
