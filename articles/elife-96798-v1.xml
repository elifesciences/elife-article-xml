evolution. However, the mechanisms governing this resilience remain incompletely understood. In this study, we identified Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) in hepatocytes as a critical regulator in preserving hepatic homeostasis during metabolic challenges, such as short-term fasting or high-fat dieting. Our results demonstrated that hepatocyte-specific deficiency of RIPK1 sensitized the liver to short-term fasting-induced liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis in both male and female mice. Despite being a common physiological stressor that typically does not induce liver inflammation, short-term fasting triggered hepatic inflammation and compensatory proliferation in hepatocyte-specific RIPK1-deficient (<italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO) mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that short-term fasting oriented the hepatic microenvironment into an inflammatory state in <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice, with up-regulated expression of inflammation and immune cell recruitment-associated genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing further confirmed the altered cellular composition in the liver of <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice during fasting, highlighting the increased recruitment of macrophages to the liver. Mechanically, our results indicated that ER stress was involved in fasting-induced liver injury in <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice. Overall, our findings revealed the role of RIPK1 in maintaining liver homeostasis during metabolic fluctuations and shed light on the intricate interplay between cell death, inflammation, and metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fasting</kwd><kwd>RIPK1</kwd><kwd>liver homeostasis</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science and Technology Major Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023ZD0508802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weng</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22376100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weng</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weng</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hepatocyte RIPK1 plays an important role in liver physiology, preventing liver injury and inflammation during metabolic stresses like acute fasting.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the long evolutionary history, mammals have frequently encountered various metabolic stresses arising from fluctuations in food availability. The liver, functioning as the central hub for metabolism, exhibits remarkable adaptability in maintaining both hepatic and systemic homeostasis when faced with these metabolic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernardo-Seisdedos et al., 2021</xref>). Acute fasting, as one of the main causes of metabolic stress, is known to trigger hepatic glycogen depletion, increased production of hepatic glucose and ketone bodies, adipose tissue lipolysis, and the influx and accumulation of lipids in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inokuchi-Shimizu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Petersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>). Under normal circumstances, the liver possesses the capability to shield itself from hepatic lipotoxicity caused by the elevated lipid influx and accumulation during fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cotter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fromenty and Roden, 2023</xref>). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms governing the liver’s adaptive capacity to counteract lipotoxicity induced by metabolic stress are not fully understood.</p><p>The serine/threonine kinase RIPK1 is a crucial mediator of cell death and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mifflin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>). It manifests two distinct, even opposing functions: its scaffold function regulates cell survival and activation of NF-κB pathway, while its kinase activity promotes cell death including apoptosis and necroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clucas and Meier, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ofengeim and Yuan, 2013</xref>). Both functions play crucial regulatory roles across a spectrum of physiological and pathological scenarios. Notably, the kinase activity of RIPK1 has been extensively studied due to its association with the deleterious effects in pathological situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Majdi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, the scaffold function of RIPK1 is less studied and current evidences suggest that it plays an essential role in maintaining tissue homeostasis within physiological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Najafov et al., 2021</xref>). The scaffold function of RIPK1 has been studied using <italic>Ripk1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells or RIPK1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kelliher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Najafov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rickard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silke et al., 2015</xref>). The postnatality death of <italic>Ripk1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice suggested that the scaffold function of RIPK1 plays an essential role in normal development, acting as a brake to prevent cell death and inflammation in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kelliher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rickard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silke et al., 2015</xref>). Deletion of RIPK1 results in the loss of its scaffold function and unleashes the release of subsequent deleterious part with cell death and inflammation. Generation of conditional knockout mice with RIPK1 deletion in different tissues or cell types results in different phenotypes, suggesting that the role of RIPK1 scaffold in different tissues is dependent on the context in tissue or cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dannappel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Filliol et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Imanishi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast to the severe phenotype observed in mice with RIPK1 deletion in epithelial cells, mice lacking RIPK1 in hepatocytes (<italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO) exhibit a surprising state of health and normal under steady conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dannappel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Filliol et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, when confronted with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or viral challenges, <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice display heightened inflammation and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farooq et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Filliol et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Filliol et al., 2016</xref>). However, the precise role of hepatocellular RIPK1 in liver physiology remains unknown.</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the physiological functions of RIPK1 in the liver. Hepatocyte-specific RIPK1-deficient mice (<italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO) were generated and subjected to a 12-hr fasting period. Surprisingly, we observed that RIPK1 deficiency in hepatocytes sensitized the liver to acute liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis. Remarkably, both male and female <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice exhibited fasting-induced liver injury and apoptosis, emphasizing the robustness of this phenotype across genders. Furthermore, short-term fasting triggered hepatic inflammation in <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice, as indicated by elevated expression of inflammatory markers and increased compensatory proliferation, potentially linked to hepatocellular carcinoma markers.</p><p>Transcriptomic profiling of liver tissues revealed that RIPK1 deficiency amplified the proinflammatory response during fasting, with up-regulated expression of inflammation-associated genes and enhanced recruitment of immune cells to the liver. Single-cell RNA sequencing further dissected the altered cellular composition in <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice, highlighting an expansion of recruited macrophages (RMs) and NK&amp;T cells. Sub-clustering of macrophages unveiled an increased presence of RMs in <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice during fasting, suggesting their role in driving the fasting-induced inflammatory state. In summary, our study sheds light on the critical role of RIPK1 in maintaining liver homeostasis during short-term fasting and provides insights into the intricate interplay between cell death, inflammation, and liver adaptation to metabolic challenges.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RIPK1 deficiency in hepatocytes sensitizes the liver to short-term fasting-induced liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis</title><p>To investigate the physiological functions of RIPK1 in liver homeostasis, hepatocyte-specific RIPK1-deficient mice (<italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice) were generated by crossing <italic>Ripk1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<italic>Ripk1</italic>-Con mice) with <italic>Albumin</italic>-Cre transgenic mice. Deletion of RIPK1 in hepatocytes was confirmed by the analysis of RIPK1 expression in the liver tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Filliol et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice were normal and healthy. Then both <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice and their control littermates were subjected to short-term 12-hr fasting from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. To our surprise, short-term fasting induced a significant increase in serum transaminase (alanine amino-transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino-transferase (AST)) levels in <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice but not in their wild-type controls, suggesting that RIPK1 deficiency sensitizes the liver to short-term fasting, inducing acute liver injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Since RIPK1 is a key player regulating cell death including caspase-8-mediated apoptosis and RIPK3-MLKL-mediated necroptosis, we next examined whether the liver injury was due to cell apoptosis or necroptosis. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref> shown, the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the liver of <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice was significantly higher compared to the control mice. Cleaved caspase-3 and phospho-MLKL are widely recognized as key proteins involved in the execution of apoptosis and necroptosis, respectively, and are commonly used as markers to detect these types of cell death. However, we were unable to detect the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and phospho-MLKL using the western blot, possibly due to their low expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Instead, we employed an immunofluorescence assay, which might be more sensitive for such detections. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, the number of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells was significantly higher in <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice compared to controls. In contrast, we did not observe any change in the number of phospho-MLKL-positive cells in <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results suggest that fasting-induced acute liver injury in <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice might be due to apoptosis rather than necroptosis. To further investigate which cell types were undergoing apoptosis, we conducted the co-staining with TUNEL and Alb immunofluorescence, and the results demonstrated that most of TUNEL-positive cells co-localized with Alb-positive staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting that short-term fasting-induced apoptosis mainly in hepatic parenchymal cells in <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RIPK1 deficiency in hepatocytes sensitizes the liver to short-term fasting-induced liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Serum alanine amino-transferase (ALT) levels.

It is known that short-term fasting leads to lipolysis in adipose tissue and temporary lipid burden to hepatocytes.

We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing to characterize the hepatic cellular profiles and transcriptional profiles in response to the physiological inflammation induced by the disruption of homeostasis. Furthermore, we presented evidence indicating the involvement of ER stress in sensitizing RIPK1-deleted liver tissue. In summary, we revealed a novel physiological role of RIPK1 as a scaffold in maintaining liver homeostasis during fasting and other nutritional disturbance. These findings could prove valuable in tailoring intermittent fasting or calorie restriction regimens for specific populations based on their <italic>Ripk1</italic> gene polymorphism or expression profiles.</p><p>Our work shed light on the intricate interplay between cell death, inflammation, and metabolism. While the pathophysiological roles of RIPK1 have primarily been studied in inflammatory diseases and pathogen infections, emerging evidence suggests its involvement in metabolism-related pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Najafov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2023a</xref>). Previous studies, including our own, have linked RIPK1’s kinase activity to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases like NASH, indicating a metabolic regulatory role of RIPK1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Majdi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan et al., 2022</xref>). Subsequently, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronate metabolism are found to suppress NASH pathogenesis and control hepatocyte apoptosis through inhibiting RIPK1 kinase activity, further solidifying the connection between RIPK1 kinase activity and metabolism during the pathogenesis of NASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2023b</xref>). In addition to its pathological roles, RIPK1’s involvement in metabolism physiology has become increasingly apparent. Mei et al. found that the postnatal lethality of <italic>Ripk1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice was attributed to dysregulated aspartate metabolism, leading to impaired starvation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mei et al., 2021</xref>). Zhang et al. recently reported that the classical energy sensor AMPK is able to phosphorylate RIPK1 at S416 in response to metabolic stress like glucose deprivation in vitro and fasting in vivo, and this phosphorylation of RIPK1 by AMPK represents a survival mechanism to keep the kinase activity of RIPK1 in check to prevent RIPK1 kinase-mediated cell death. AMPK deficiency sensitized cells to glucose deprivation-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2023a</xref>). Their results directly linked RIPK1 to key metabolism regulator AMPK. Together with our results, it suggested that hepatic AMPK–RIPK1 axis function as a mechanism to maintain liver homeostasis during suffering metabolic stress. Moreover, <italic>Tak1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice has been shown to exhibit similar phenotypes, suggesting that the key components in the complex I faction in the scaffold complex, all contribute to maintain tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inokuchi-Shimizu et al., 2014</xref>). These findings, together with our study, emphasize the critical role of RIPK1’s scaffold function in sensing nutrient stress and maintaining metabolic homeostasis during various starvation conditions, both in neonatal stages and adulthood. Zhang et al. also noted that RIPK1 knockout MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were more susceptible to cell death induced by glucose starvation compared to WT MEFs, further underscoring the importance of RIPK1 in nutrient stress responses.</p><p>Our study also posited that hepatocyte RIPK1 plays a crucial role in preventing liver damage and inflammation triggered by metabolic stress. Prior investigations have indicated that deficiencies in TAK1 or NEMO in hepatocytes result in spontaneous liver injury and carcinogenesis in mice, with a more severe phenotype than that observed in RIPK1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bettermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Luedde et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). This is attributed to the deletion of TAK1 or NEMO unleashing the kinase activity of RIPK1, leading to the activation of RIPK1 kinase and the associated cell death pathways. Our findings, combined with these earlier studies, suggested that the RIPK1–TAK1–NF-κB axis constitutes an essential scaffold platform necessary for the liver’s adaptation to metabolic fluctuations. Any improper inactivation or deletion of any component within this scaffold axis disrupts the delicate balance between cell death, inflammation, and normal function, rendering the liver vulnerable to metabolic changes and resulting in liver damage, hepatic inflammation, and compensatory proliferation.</p><p>Regarding the upstream signal of RIPK1, both short-term fasting and HFD can increase FFA in the bloodstream, leading to their influx and accumulation in the liver. This accumulation may cause lipotoxicity in hepatocytes through ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Piccolis et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that lipotoxic stress might result in hepatocyte cell death. We observed that treatment with palmitic acid led to a higher rate of apoptosis in <italic>Ripk1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> AML12 liver cells compared to wild-type control cells (data not shown). Moreover, in contrast to organs such as the small intestine and lungs, the liver typically maintains immune tolerance and does not incite inflammation in response to various endogenous and exogenous PAMPs or antigens present in the bloodstream. Recent years have witnessed the increasing attention toward physiological inflammation, which implications have been greatly broadened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Medzhitov, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meizlish et al., 2021</xref>). Our research revealed that hepatocyte RIPK1 serves as a critical mechanism for preserving immune tolerance within the liver microenvironment. Furthermore, we identify an instance of physiological inflammation induced by loss of regulation in normal tissue. The physiological inflammation observed in RIPK1-deficient livers during short-term fasting is milder but akin to hepatic inflammation induced by pathogenic infections and other pathological conditions. It is characterized by the upregulation of typical molecules, including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:98259">Ccl2</ext-link>, <italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Ifng</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, etc., and the recruitment of macrophages into liver tissue, indicating systemic adaptive responses.</p><p>In summary, our study revealed the multifaceted role of RIPK1 in maintaining liver homeostasis in the face of metabolic challenges, shedding light on the intricate interplay between cell death, inflammation, and metabolism. Our findings provide new insights into the role of RIPK1 in various physiological contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Following the purification step, mRNAs were fragmented to 300 bp nucleotides and used for synthesis of single-stranded cDNAs by means of random hexamer priming. With the constructed single-stranded cDNAs as templates, second strand cDNA synthesis was performed to prepare double-stranded cDNAs. These cDNAs were then amplified with end-pair repair, addition of A-tail, and adapter ligation using polymerase chain reaction. The quality control of cDNA library was evaluated by Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Then the high-quality filtered sequencing data was aligned with mouse reference genome (GRCm38) by TopHat (version 2.1.1). To profile DEG, reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RKM) were calculated for each transcript. Paired sample <italic>t</italic>-tests followed by Benjamini–Hochberg correction were performed to identify DEGs. Genes with &gt;twofold changes (|log2 fold change|&gt; 1) and false discovery rate &lt;0.05 were defined as DEGs by DESeq2 (version 1.18.1). Enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed by KEGG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kegg.jp/">http://www.kegg.jp/</ext-link>) pathway enrichment analysis to identify the affected metabolic pathways and signal transduction pathways.

Liver tissue samples were collected from the left lateral lobe, right lateral lobe, and right medial lobe of each mouse and weighed, with approximately 600 mg of tissue per sample. Liver tissue samples were mechanically dissociated and digested in lysis buffer containing collagenase/dispase and 0.001% deoxyribonuclease I, after which the samples were processed. Isolated cells passed through 70 µm cell strainer were treated with Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (10×) (Miltenyi Biotec) for 5 min to lyse blood cells. To acquire cells with &gt;90% viability, dead cells were removed with Dead Cell Removal Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and cell pellet was resuspended in 2% fetal bovine serum/PBS. Then live cells were counted with Countstar and adjusted the cell concentration to 1000 cells/μl. For scRNA-seq, chromium microfluidic chips were loaded with cell suspension with 3′ chemistry and barcoded with a 10× Chromium Controller (10× Genomics). RNA was reverse-transcribed from the barcoded cells. Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen) was used to quantify cDNA concentration and single-cell transcriptome libraries were constructed using the 10× Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library (10× Genomics, v3 barcoding chemistry). Quality control was performed with Agilent 2100 (Agilent Technologies).

Base calling files generated by Illumina sequencer were demultiplexed according to the sample index. Sequences were then aligned to mouse reference genome mm10 reference for whole transcriptome analysis. CellRanger 3.1.0 were used to conducted Filtering, barcode counting, and UMI counting. For the following analysis multiple samples were aggregated. Visualization, quality control, normalization, scaling, PCA dimension reduction, clustering, and differential expression analysis were used by Loupe browser and Seurat (v4.0.0) to perform. Cells with a detected gene number of &lt;200 or &gt;10,000, mitochondrion gene percentage of &lt;10, hemoglobin gene percentage of &lt;10, and doublet nucleus were removed by package Seurat (v4.0.0). Data were subsequently log-normalized (divided by the total expression and amplified scaling factor 10,000) before further analyses. The remaining 22,274 cells were unsupervised clustered after aligning the top 30 dimensions and setting resolution to 0.9. Loupe browser software (10× Genomics) was used to demonstrate UMAP and t-SNE. The identity for each cluster was assigned according to marker genes for known cell types in the mouse liver. DEGs with absolute log-fold change greater than 1.5 and p value less than 0.05 were used for pathway and network enrichment analysis on the KEGG website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kegg.jp/">http://www.kegg.jp/</ext-link>). The R package CellChat was used to infer potential intercellular communication among different major cellular clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2021</xref>). We first identified significant ligand–receptor pairs that mediate signaling. CellChat then analyzed the information flows and revealed both incoming and outgoing communication patterns for selected cells. To compare cellular interactions across different samples, we conducted separate analyses on <italic>Ripk1</italic>-Con and <italic>Ripk1</italic>-hepKO mice liver samples. The inferred cellular interactions were then merged to visualize and highlight the differences between the two samples.

We agree with the reviewer that additional experiments could reinforce our findings. Therefore, we conducted additional experiments including flow cytometry, western blotting, and using kinase-dead mutant mice to further investigate the underlying mechanisms. We carefully addressed every comment by the reviewer as indicated below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Detailed major concerns:</p><p>(1) Related to Figure 1.</p><p>It is imperative to ensure consistency in the number of animals analyzed across the different graphs. The current resolution of the images appears to be low, resulting in unsharp visuals that hinder the interpretation of data beyond the presence of &quot;white dots&quot;. To address this issue, it is recommended to enhance the resolution of the images and consider incorporating zoom-in features to facilitate a clearer visualization of the observed differences. Moreover, it would be beneficial to include a complete WB analysis for the cell death pathways analyzed. These adjustments will significantly improve the clarity and interpretability of Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for the constructive advice. We carefully checked the number of animals and make sure that the animal number were consistent within different figures. We further updated the figures with incorporating zoom-in features in updated Figure 1, and the resolution of the figures were greatly improved. Western blot analysis were also included in updated Supplementary Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Related to Figure 2.</p><p>It is essential to ensure consistency in the number of animals analyzed across the different graphs, as indicated by n=6 in the figure legend (similar to Figure 1). Additionally, it is crucial to distinguish between male and female subjects in the dot plots to assess any potential gender-based differences, which should be consistent throughout the paper. To achieve this, the dots plot should be harmonized to clearly differentiate between males and females and investigate if there are any disparities between the genders. Moreover, it is imperative to correlate hepatic inflammation with the activation of Kupffer cells, infiltrating monocytes, and/or hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Therefore, conducting flow cytometry would be instrumental in achieving this correlation. Additionally, the staining for Ki67 appears to be non-specific, showing a granular pattern reminiscent of bile crystals rather than the expected nuclear staining of hepatocytes or immune cells. It is crucial to ensure specific staining for Ki67, and conducting in vitro experiments on primary hepatocytes could further elucidate the proliferation process. These experiments are relatively straightforward to implement and would provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying hepatic inflammation and proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for the helpful advice. First, we corrected the number of animals analyzed in different graphs and make sure that the number of animals listed in the figure legend were consistent with the graphs in all figures. Second, to distinguish the results between male and female mice, blue represents male mice, pink represents female mice, and green represents RIPK1 kinase inactivated mice. The majority of results were obtained from male mice, and our results indicated that there was no difference between male and female mice herein.</p><p>The percentages of immune cell subpopulations isolated from mouse liver tissue were determined. The results were consistent with single cell analysis that greater number of macrophages were recruited into the liver tissue in <italic>Ripk1Δhep</italic> upon 12-hour fasting (updated Figure 4F&amp;G).</p><p>To confirm the results of Ki67, we first detected the transcriptional expression of Ki67 using real-time qPCR, and the results were consistent with the protein expression measured by immunohistochemical analysis. The percentage of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells in liver cells were also detected, and there was significantly more Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>Ripk1Δhep</italic> mouse liver than WT control mouse upon 12-hour fasting.

Previous suggestions for flow cytometry studies remain pertinent and are indeed necessary to bolster the robustness of the data and conclusions.

Regarding the single-cell RNA sequencing analysis presented in the manuscript, it's worth questioning its relevance and depth of information provided. While it successfully identifies a quantitative difference in the cellular composition of the liver between control and knockout mice, it may fall short in elucidating the intricate interactions between different cell populations, which are crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of hepatic inflammation. Therefore, I propose considering alternative bioinformatic analyses, such as CellPhone-CellChat, which could potentially provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular dynamics and interactions within the liver microenvironment. By examining the dialogue between different cell clusters, these analyses could offer deeper insights into the functional consequences of Ripk1 deficiency in hepatocytes and its impact on hepatic inflammation during fasting.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for the constructive suggestion. We agree with the reviewer that conducting flow cytometry analyses would provide accurate and quantitative assessments of monocyte recruitment, ensuring the reliability of the findings. Following the advice, both WT and <italic>Ripk1Δhep</italic> mice were fasted for 12 hour and then single hepatic cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. As indicated in updated Figure 4F&amp;G, the percentage of F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly higher in <italic>Ripk1Δhep</italic> compared with WT control mice, confirming that more monocytes were recruited into the liver.</p><p>Additionally, we performed CellChat analysis on the single-cell transcriptomic data. As shown in updated Figures 4H-J, both the number of ligand-receptor pairs and the interaction strength among the eight cell types were significantly increased in <italic>Ripk1Δhep</italic> mice, particularly the interactions between macrophages and other cell types. Network analysis indicated that inflammation and proliferation signals were amplified in <italic>Ripk1Δhep</italic> mice. Consistent with the bulk RNA sequencing data, SAA signaling was upregulated in the hepatocytes of <italic>Ripk1Δhep</italic> mice (updated Figure 4K). SAA has been found to play a role in regulating immune responses and tumor development. Based on these findings, we speculate that fasting-induced liver injury in RIPK1 knockout mice may exacerbate the inflammatory response in liver tissue through enhanced SAA signaling. The above data analysis and interpretation were included in the updated Figure 4&amp;S4 and line 421 - 443.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Related to Figure 5.</p><p>What additional insights do the data from Figure 5 provide compared to the study published in Nat Comms, which demonstrated that RIPK1 regulates starvation resistance by modulating aspartate catabolism (PMID: 34686667)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your constructive suggestion.

As you mentioned, the AAV-TBG-Cre-mediated liver-specific RIPK1 knockout mice offer complementary validation of the results obtained from <italic>Ripk1Δhep</italic> mice. Moreover, TBG is a promoter that is exclusively expressed in mature hepatocytes, while the ALB promoter is active not only in mature hepatocytes but also in precursor cells and cholangiocytes. Therefore, we think that the inclusion of AAV-TBG-Cre further strengthens our finding that RIPK1 in hepatocytes is responsible for fasting-induced liver injury and inflammatory responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Related to Figure 7.</p><p>The data from Figure 7 suggest that RIPK1 in hepatocytes is responsible for the observed damage. However, it has been previously demonstrated that inhibition of RIPK1 activity in macrophages protects against the development of MASLD (PMID: 33208891). One possible explanation for these findings could be that the overreaction of macrophages to fasting, coupled with the absence of RIPK1 in hepatocytes (an indirect effect), contributes to the observed damage. Considering this, complementing hepatocytes with a kinase-dead version of RIPK1 could be a valuable approach to further refine the molecular aspect of the study. This would allow for a more precise investigation into the specific role of RIPK1's scaffolding or kinase function in response to starvation in hepatocytes. Such experiments could provide additional insights into the mechanisms underlying the observed effects and help delineate the contributions of RIPK1 in different cell types to metabolic stress responses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the constructive suggestion. We fully agree with the reviewer that employing a RIPK1 kinase-inactive mutant mice could precisely investigate the specific roles of RIPK1's scaffolding and kinase functions in hepatocyte responses to starvation, respectively. In accordance with this advice, we established a 12-hour fasting model using <italic>Ripk1WT/WT</italic> and <italic>Ripk1K45A/K45A</italic> mice, which were previously established and confirmed with the inactivity of RIPK1 kinase activity. As demonstrated in updated Supplementary Figure 2, these mice did not show significant liver damage or inflammatory responses after 12 hours of fasting. These findings suggest that the liver damage and inflammatory response induced by fasting in <italic>Ripk1Δhep</italic> mice may not be contributed by the kinase activity of RIPK1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Zhang et al. analyzed the functional role of hepatocyte RIPK1 during metabolic stress, particularly its scaffold function rather than kinase function.

We conducted additional experiments, including flow cytometry and western blotting, to reassess our findings. Furthermore, to clarify the interactions between cells, we employed CellChat for a more in-depth analysis of the single-cell sequencing results. In the revised manuscript version, changes are highlighted in yellow. In this study, we demonstrated that the specific deletion of RIPK1 in hepatocytes exacerbated the liver's vulnerability to metabolic disturbances, such as short-term fasting and high-fat diet feeding, resulting in increased liver damage, apoptosis, inflammation, and compensatory proliferation. The data indicate that fasting-induced liver injury in RIPK1 knockout mice of hepatic parenchymal cells may exacerbate the inflammatory response in liver tissue through enhanced SAA signaling. In summary, we revealed a novel physiological role of RIPK1 as a scaffold in maintaining liver homeostasis during fasting and other nutritional disturbances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) It would be beneficial for the authors to address the minor weaknesses identified in the study, such as ensuring consistency in the number of animals analyzed across different graphs and enhancing the resolution of images to improve data clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.

The study investigated the change induced by short-term fasting which is metabolic stress. Although RIPK1 knockout promotes cell death and inflammation, how it is involved in this condition is unclear. RIPK1 is never reported as a metabolic sensor and its function is typically downstream of TNFR1 as well as other death receptors such as Fas, TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2. Thus, it's probable that metabolic stress induces the expression and secretion of some ligand of the above receptors. Although TNFα expression is upregulated on both mRNA and protein levels, it could not be concluded that TNFα is the upsteam signal for RIPK1 because expression difference does not always lead to fuctional role. In addition, a recent study, which is also reference 33, reports that knockout of TNFR1/2 does not protect against 18 h liver ischemia, a condition that is similar to the present study. Therefore, the link between the metabolic fluctuation and RIPK1 function is elusive and should be addressed. The expression difference analysis should be extended to other relevant ligands. A functional study using neutralizing antibodies in RIPK1ΔHep mice is encouraged. At least, this should be discussed in the discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your insightful comments. The upstream signals of RIPK1 remains a significant area of scientific inquiry. Fasting, as one of the main causes of metabolic stress, is known to trigger a series of physiological changes, including but not limited to decreased blood glucose levels, hepatic glycogen depletion, increased production of hepatic glucose and ketone bodies, adipose tissue lipolysis, and the influx and accumulation of free fatty lipids in the liver. It is well-established that the elevated lipid influx and hepatic accumulation during fasting may cause lipotoxicity stress for liver. To investigate whether the elevated free fatty acids influx might act as the signal to induce cytotoxicity, we isolated primary hepatocytes but observed that a significant number of cells underwent spontaneous death during the isolation and perfusion processes. To address this question, we utilized CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate <italic>Ripk1-/-</italic> AML12 cells, as illustrated in Author response image 1A.</p><p>To mimic hepatic lipid accumulation induced by short-term fasting, we treated the cells with palmitic acid (PA) or oleic acid (OA) for 12 hours in vitro. Our results indicated a significant increase in cell death among <italic>Ripk1-/-</italic> AML12 cells after PA treatment compared to WT control cells (Author response image 1B). As shown in Author response image 1C, we also observed a marked increase in caspase-3 activity in <italic>Ripk1-/-</italic> AML12 cells following PA treatment.</p><p>Collectively, our results highlight the crucial role of RIPK1 in hepatocytes in maintaining the liver's adaptive capacity to counteract lipotoxicity induced by metabolic stress. These in vitro results were not included in the manuscript; however, we addressed them in the discussion section (line 593 - 597). If the reviewer suggest, we would like to incorporate in our manuscript.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96798-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) What is the exact relationship between ER stress and RIPK1? In Figure 5A and Figure 6B, Ripk1 knockout only slightly promotes the expression of ER stress markers. The evidence of RIPK1 leading to ER stress is limited in the literature and poorly supported in this study. Also in reference 33, the hypothesis is proposed that ER stress leads to death receptor upregulation and activation, which induces RIPK1 activation. Although the ER stress inhibitor showed good efficacy in rescue experiments, it could not determine whether RIPK1 deficiency leads to ER stress-associated phenotype or ER stress leads to death receptor activation and RIPK1 deficiency-associated phenotype. If RIPK1 deficiency leads to ER stress, the possible mechanism should be investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your insightful comments. As the reviewer noted, the specific relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and RIPK1 remains unclear. However, our data, along with findings from other studies (Piccolis M et al., Mol Cell. 2019; Geng Y et al., Hepatol Int. 2021), suggest that fasting-induced lipolysis in peripheral adipose tissue leads to hepatic lipid accumulation. Additionally, excessive deposition of free fatty acids has been shown to induce ER stress in the liver. One possible explanation is that ER stress may trigger the upregulation and activation of death receptors, and the scaffold function of RIPK1 may play a protective and checkpoint role in this process. ER stress during the fasting might locate upstream of RIPK1. This could help explain why short-term fasting results in liver damage in <italic>Ripk1Δhep</italic> mice while control mice remain unaffected. Moreover, the inhibition of ER stress using 4-PBA can effectively alleviate this damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>(13) The study starts directly from functional experiments. However, it should be firstly explored whether RIPK1 expression or activation is modulated in wild-type mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your insightful observation. Previous studies showed that RIPK1 deficiency in hepatocytes does not impact the growth and development of mice, indicating that RIPK1 is dispensable for proper liver development and homeostasis (Filliol A et al., Cell Death Dis. 2016). Furthermore, we did not observe any changes in RIPK1 levels in wild-type mice induced by fasting across different experimental batches. In our bulk transcriptomic analysis, the expression of RIPK1 was not changed before and after 12-hour fasting in <italic>Ripk1fl/fl</italic> mice. Therefore, we focused our attention on the function of RIPK1 and started our study directly with functional experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Knockout of RIPK1 deprived both its scaffold function and kinase function.

To investigate the role of RIPK1 kinase activity in response to metabolic stress, we added fasting experiments using RIPK1 kinaseinactive mice in the updated Supplementary Figure 2, in which blocking RIPK1 kinase activity does not affect the outcome of metabolic stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) In Figure 1, the number of TUNEL+ cells is about 2 times of c-casp3. What is the possible reason?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your careful reading. Indeed, the number of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells in Figure 1 is twice that of cleaved-caspase-3<sup>+</sup> cells. There are two possible reasons. First, we speculate that this discrepancy may be attributed to the higher sensitivity of the TUNEL assay compared to the cleaved-caspase-3 assay. Secondly, TUNEL assay detects DNA fragmentation, indicating that these cells are in a pre-apoptotic state or poised to undergo apoptosis. In contrast, cleaved-caspase-3 specifically identifies cells that have already committed to the apoptotic pathway, whereas TUNEL assay could detects all types of apoptosis, but the mechanisms of apoptosis may involve more than just cleaved-caspase3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Infiltrated innate immune cells could lead to hepatocyte death. Is the hepatocyte death in this study partially caused by immune cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for the advice. As outlined in the response to the 11th comment from the second reviewer, our findings indicate that metabolic stress induced by short-term fasting is the primary cause of hepatocyte death. Additionally, we demonstrate that infiltrated innate immune cells may also play a partial role in hepatocyte death through subsequent cascade reactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) Could the in vivo results be consolidated by in vitro experiments on primary mouse hepatocytes?

Is NF-kB signal transduction influenced by Ripk1 deficiency? If so, to what extent does it contribute to the observed phynotype? If not, what is the direct downstream effect of Ripk1 deficiency?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your insightful perspective. As reported by Clucas J et al., RIPK1 serves as a scaffold for downstream NF-κB signaling through the ubiquitin chains generated by its ubiquitination (Clucas J et al., Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2023). The deficiency of RIPK1 in hepatic parenchymal cells can disrupt NF-κB signaling and impair its pro-survival functions, resulting in increased cell death in response to stress. Our current findings suggest that the RIPK1-NF-κB axis serves as a crucial scaffold platform essential for the liver's adaptation to metabolic fluctuations. Any inappropriate inactivation or deletion of components within this scaffold disrupts the delicate balance between cell death, inflammation, and normal function, making the liver susceptible to metabolic changes, ultimately leading to liver damage, hepatic inflammation, and compensatory proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) In Figure 6B, the 'RIP' should be changed to 'RIPK1'.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your careful observation.
