remodeling family are common events in cancer, but the mechanisms whereby disruption of SWI/SNF components alters tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. To model the effect of loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF subunit Arid1a in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) initiation, we directed shRNA triggered, inducible and reversible suppression of Arid1a to the mouse pancreas in the setting of oncogenic Kras<sup>G12D</sup>. Arid1a cooperates with Kras in the adult pancreas as postnatal silencing of Arid1a following sustained Kras<sup>G12D</sup> expression induces rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC precursor lesions. In contrast, Arid1a silencing during embryogenesis, concurrent with Kras<sup>G12D</sup> activation, leads to retention of acinar cell fate. Together, our results demonstrate Arid1a as a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity, and underscore an unanticipated influence of timing and genetic context on the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35216.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The pancreas produces many different hormones, as well as several substances important for digestion. To perform these roles, the pancreas contains different types of cells; for example, acinar cells make digestive enzymes that help to break down food. But, like other cells in the body, pancreatic cells can accumulate mutations in their DNA that cause them to divide, acquire an altered identity and form a cancerous tumor.</p><p>The DNA of cells is packed into a structure called chromatin. While the DNA sequence is essentially the same across all normal cells of a given individual, chromatin can be more or less compacted in the different cell types that comprise our body tissues. A collection of proteins called the SWI/SNF complex can reorganize the chromatin to change how tightly the DNA is packed. This determines which genes in the DNA are accessible and can be activated, and which ones cannot.</p><p>Around 25% of pancreatic cancers contain mutations in genes that produce proteins of the SWI/SNF complex. These mutations normally occur with an additional mutation that over-activates the gene that produces a potentially cancer-causing protein called Kras. Livshits et al. have now genetically engineered mice to investigate how one such SWI/SNF complex protein, called Arid1a, affects how pancreatic cancer develops using a genetic approach that made possible to temporarily halt the production of Arid1a in acinar cells by feeding these mice an antibiotic. The gene that produces Kras was also over-activated in the pancreases of the mice, making them more likely to develop cancer.</p><p>Within just two weeks of stopping the production of Arid1a, the acinar cells stopped producing digestive enzymes and started making other proteins that are typically found in cancerous cells, indicating that Arid1a is involved in maintaining the normal identity and activity of these cells. Restoring the ability of altered acinar cells to produce normal levels of Arid1a (by removing the mice from the antibiotic diet) did not reverse these changes. Biochemical experiments showed that acinar cells with reduced levels of Arid1a have altered chromatin. In particular, the genes that produce digestive enzymes, which are normally active in healthy pancreases, were less accessible in mice who had over-active Kras and reduced levels of Arid1a.</p><p>The results presented by Livshits et al. provide the first evidence of how alterations to Arid1a can lead to irreversible changes in the identity and activity of pancreatic acinar cells. These results will need to be carefully considered by researchers who are developing treatments for cancer patients with mutations in Arid1a and other SWI/SNF proteins. In particular, methods that attempt to restore the functions of absent SWI/SNF proteins to cancer cells are unlikely to treat the cancer successfully.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreas cancer</kwd><kwd>SWI/SNF</kwd><kwd>acinar cell</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd><kwd>RNAi</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005979</institution-id><institution>Lustgarten Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>388171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Livshits</surname><given-names>Geulah</given-names></name><name><surname>Alonso-Curbelo</surname><given-names>Direna</given-names></name><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>John P</given-names><suffix>IV</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32CA177072-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Livshits</surname><given-names>Geulah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PF-13-037-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Livshits</surname><given-names>Geulah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005979</institution-id><institution>Lustgarten Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>Scott W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA13106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>Scott W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cancer Center Core Grants P30-CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>Scott W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Arid1a loss in the pancreas enables an irreversible reprogramming of cell fate that is dependent on both cellular and genetic context.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aberrant chromatin regulation is a hallmark of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flavahan et al., 2017</xref>). Numerous studies have revealed an abnormal chromatin state in tumor cells in comparison with their tissue of origin, and mutations in genes encoding chromatin readers, writers and remodelers have been detected across the spectrum of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feinberg et al., 2016</xref>). For example, subunits of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex show frequent mutation in many solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Waddell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Witkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>), but understanding of the underlying biology and molecular mechanisms as to how these mutations influence cancer related processes remains limited.</p><p>SWI/SNF complexes regulate chromatin accessibility and thus gene expression by re-positioning nucleosomes and interacting with available transcription factors (TFs) at enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kelso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). While the predominance of apparently inactivating mutations in various SWI/SNF components implies a tumor-suppressive function for the complex, gene perturbation studies in mice have identified both pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles for individual SWI/SNF subunits. For instance, mice lacking Arid1a, the DNA-binding SWI/SNF subunit, in the colon develop adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>). However, opposing and stage dependent roles have been described within the same tissue, as Arid1a deletion can both impair and promote the initiation of liver tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2017</xref>) and accelerates progression and metastasis in established disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Another subunit, Smarca4, displays the opposite pattern in pancreatic tumorigenesis, where its deletion accelerates tumor onset but slows progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">von Figura et al., 2014a</xref>). Thus, the role of various SWI/SNF complex components in tumor initiation and progression can be context dependent.</p><p>As the SWI/SNF complex dictates chromatin accessibility by available TFs, such context dependencies might broadly relate to development or pathological cell state. Indeed, in drosophila and mammalian systems, SWI/SNF complex dependent regulation of gene expression controls cell identity and differentiation in developmental as well as regenerative contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vieira et al., 2017</xref>). How loss of SWI/SNF subunit function contributes to changes in cell plasticity in concert with oncogenes that drive cancer development is poorly understood. Furthermore, it is not known whether the disruption of SWI/SNF activity that accompanies tumorigenesis is needed to sustain neoplastic disease.</p><p>We set out to develop an in vivo model to address the role of the SWI/SNF component ARID1A in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a setting in which mutations in <italic>ARID1A</italic> or other SWI/SNF components occur in up to 25% of cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shain et al., 2012</xref>). PDAC is nearly invariably initiated by activating mutations in the <italic>KRAS</italic> oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>), while additional mutations in tumor suppressor genes are accumulated in the course of PDAC progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hezel et al., 2006</xref>). PDAC can arise from mucinous precursor lesions, including the most common, pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PanIN), as well as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and Mucinous Cystic Neoplasms (MCN), with activating <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations frequently found in these early neoplastic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hosoda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Tissue specific expression of mutant Kras in the developing and adult mouse pancreas recapitulates both the range of preneoplastic lesions and their progression to malignant PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hingorani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izeradjene et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siveke et al., 2007</xref>). Lineage tracing studies indicate mutant Kras can drive PanIN development from acinar cells that undergo a process of persistent trans-differentiation termed acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kopp et al., 2012</xref>). In this process, acinar cells lose their pyramidal morphology, downregulate expression of digestive enzymes and TFs characteristic of acinar cells, and turn on an embryonic progenitor-like transcriptional program that includes expression of ductal markers and development of glandular morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Storz, 2017</xref>). Deletion of key transcriptional regulators of acinar cell identity and regeneration such as <italic>Ptf1a</italic>, <italic>Nr5a2</italic> and <italic>Pdx1</italic>, when combined with oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic>, accelerates ADM and PanIN development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flandez et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">von Figura et al., 2014b</xref>). Thus, maintenance of acinar cell identity and regenerative homeostasis provides an important barrier to tumorigenesis in PDAC.</p><p>Current mouse models of PDAC have limitations. For example, cancer sequencing studies imply that mutations can occur in biologically-relevant orders during tumorigenesis, yet traditional Cre/loxp-based mouse models necessarily recombine all conditional alleles simultaneously. Additionally, traditional gene ‘knockout’ models do not allow for the restoration of the endogenous protein, making it difficult to address questions of phenotypic reversibility and the requirement for sustained gene loss in disease maintenance. Addressing these issues, we implement a powerful mouse-modeling platform that enables inducible and reversible disruption of gene function to show that Arid1a depletion can modulate the early stages of pancreatic neoplasia in a context-specific manner that depends on the timing of Arid1a inactivation and the presence of oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic>. Remarkably, these cell state transitions facilitated by Arid1a perturbation involve reprogramming events that, in contrast to tissue regenerative responses, are irreversible.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A mouse model for inducible and reversible Arid1a depletion</title><p>We sought to create a model with the capability for inducible and reversible Arid1a knockdown at different stages of PDAC progression. To this end, we used a previously developed mouse model of Kras<sup>G12D</sup>-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis that integrates robust and inducible RNA interference (RNAi) technology with embryonic stem (ES) cell genetic engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saborowski et al., 2014</xref>). This model, referred to below as KC-RIK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), incorporates a Ptf1a-Cre that activates Cre-driven alleles in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hingorani et al., 2003</xref>), LSL-Kras<sup>G12D</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jackson et al., 2001</xref>), as well as a set of alleles that allow for doxycycline-regulatable shRNA expression: CAGS-LSL-rtTA3-IRES-mKate2 (CAGS-LSL-RIK), which enables Cre-activatable expression of a reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA); a red fluorescent reporter (mKate2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dow et al., 2014</xref>); and a <italic>Col1a1</italic> homing cassette that enables insertion of a single copy of a construct into the <italic>Col1a1</italic> locus via recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beard et al., 2006</xref>). The Ptf1a-Cre allele used in this study becomes activated in multi-potent pancreas progenitors at embryonic day 9.5 and remains active in acinar but not islet and ductal cells of the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawaguchi et al., 2002</xref>). Thus in our model, Cre recombination occurs most commonly in acinar cells, but leaves some ducts and endocrine cells un-recombined, as indicated by their lack of mKate2 staining. This ES cell system enables the direct production of experimental cohorts of chimeric mice harboring multiple alleles, thereby dramatically accelerating the rate of experimentation while simultaneously reducing animal waste as byproducts of strain intercrossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Premsrirut et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35216.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A mouse model for inducible and reversible Arid1a depletion in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of KC-RIK model. shRNAs against Arid1a and Renilla are targeted into ES cells derived from KC-RIK mice.

At this age, KC-RIK-shRen pancreata exhibited a range of histological phenotypes including normal pancreatic parenchyma, acinar ductal metaplasia, a small number of early stage PanINs, and localized expansion of lesion associated fibroinflammatory stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saborowski et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with coupling of the Arid1a shRNA expression to a GFP reporter, we observed efficient knockdown of Arid1a in the GFP-expressing epithelial cells of the pancreas and not in the GFP- stromal cells and unrecombined duct regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, a substantial portion of shArid1a mice became moribund within two weeks of enrollment on dox chow, while shRen mice remained healthy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Acute morbidity was closely associated with KC-RIK-shArid1a mice exhibiting a high degree of chimerism (&gt;95%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that at some level normal unrecombined cells can compensate for the gross functional defects produced by Arid1a depletion in this context. Moribund mice exhibited marked steatorrhea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating exocrine insufficiency as a possible cause of their failure to thrive. Consistent with decreased exocrine function, histological analyses revealed that Arid1a knockdown induces a dramatic remodeling of the exocrine pancreas compared to shRen mice. shArid1a exocrine parenchyma was predominantly replaced by Alcian Blue, Sox9, and Cytokeratin 19 positive mucinous metaplastic lesion (MMLs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>), characteristic of low-grade PanIN lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). This increase in PanINs was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in cells positive for the differentiated acinar cell marker Cpa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), indicating a role for Arid1a in maintaining acinar cell identity in the setting of mutant Kras. Indeed, acinar cell depletion was likely a consequence of accelerated acinar ductal reprogramming rather than acinar cell death, since pancreata derived from shArid1a mice were not atrophied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), and showed similar levels of cleaved caspase three and Ki67 staining as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35216.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Acute Arid1a knockdown induces rapid changes in acinar cell fate in the setting of Kras<sup>G12D</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kaplan-Meier curve of KC-RIK-shRen and –shArid1a cohort after dox administration.

To this end, we eliminated the LSL-Kras<sup>G12D</sup> allele from ES cell-derived KC-RIK-shArid1a and KC-RIK-shRen mice though one round of breeding.

We thus maintained shRen and shArid1a mice on dox diet for 3 months. Although subtle differences in cell morphology and the pattern of E-cadherin staining were noted in cells with reduced Arid1a levels, no pancreas degeneration or exocrine insufficiency was observed despite sustained Arid1a knockdown.

At day two post-caerulein treatment, both C-RIK-shRen mice and C-RIK-shArid1a animals exhibited a similar increase in inflammation, ADM, and expression of acinar stress response genes (clusterin) and a concomitant decrease in expression of markers of acinar differentiation (Cpa1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).

Thus, Arid1a function plays a genotype-specific role in dictating acinar cell identity.

Among the notable changes were a reduction in acinar-related digestive enzymes and an increase in cellular components needed for the mucin production characteristic of PDAC precursor lesions. Consistent with our histological findings, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed a general activation of a mucinous lesion transcriptional program after 5 days on dox: genes that are decreased in PanIN organoids relative to normal organoids were also downregulated, while genes enriched in PanIN organoids were up in shArid1a pancreata as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boj et al., 2015</xref>). Selected genes within the upregulated set included known PanIN and PDAC markers such as Agr2 and Mesothelin, which were confirmed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Interestingly, gene sets associated with proliferation and ‘E2F’ were also enriched despite no detectable increase in proliferation at the timepoints analyzed. These observations raise the possibility that Arid1a depletion in this context ‘primes’ acinar cells for tumorigenesis by facilitating shifts in cell identity, but additional inactivation of tumor suppressor pathways may be required for PanINs to acquire increased proliferative capacity associated with malignant transition to PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caldwell et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In parallel with mucin upregulation characteristic of PanIN development in KC-RIK-shArid1a mice, GSEA identified downregulation of genes associated with acinar function, such as those encoding the digestive enzymes Cel, Klk1 and Amy1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoang et al., 2016</xref>), which was confirmed by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Thus, the destablization of acinar cell identity that occurs upon Arid1a suppression in the setting of oncogenic Kras most likely results from impaired recruitment or function of these acinar TFs at their appropriate targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Acute Arid1a silencing decreases chromatin accessibility</title><p>Building on recent observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bossen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller et al., 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that the transcriptional changes induced by Arid1a loss may be triggered by changes in chromatin accessibility. To test this in the context of pancreas tumor initiation, we performed the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin followed by high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>) on mKate2<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>+</sup> cells sorted from KC-RIK-shRen and shArid1a mice after 5 days on dox, as in our transcriptional profiling experiments. ATAC-seq assesses chromatin accessibility genome-wide, and therefore provides a direct readout of the chromatin remodeling activity of SWI/SNF complexes. Importantly, ATAC-seq requires substantially fewer cells than current ChIP-seq protocols and, as such, is appropriate for analyzing chromatin states in the limited cell numbers that can be recovered from the preneoplastic murine pancreas.</p><p>We found that knockdown of Arid1a resulted in striking changes in chromatin accessibility, with shArid1a chromatin profiles that clearly separated from shRen by PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). 50,000–60,000 dynamic peaks were observed, virtually all of which were reduced in the shArid1a samples relative to the shRen controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). This indicates that Arid1a-containing SWI/SNF complexes are required to maintain substantial regions of open chromatin in the pre-neoplastic pancreas. Interestingly, although the chromatin accessibility was highest around transcriptional start site (TSS) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the majority of dynamic sites were located in intergenic regions or introns, while promoters displayed fewer dynamic peaks (relative to the genome-wide distribution of total detectable peaks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

Increased chromatin closing observed upon Arid1a knockdown at these TF target sites was associated with reduced gene expression at adjacent genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, Nr5a2, Ptf1a and Pdx1 target genes losing chromatin accessibility upon Arid1a suppression were significantly downregulated in shArid1a vs. shRen mice.

These data support a model whereby Arid1a depletion results in loss of chromatin accessibility at acinar-specific enhancers, limiting the transcriptional output of acinar master TFs and, consequently, the expression of transcriptional programs that direct acinar cell fate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mutations in chromatin remodelers are prevalent across the human cancer spectrum, making identification of tissue specific relationships between chromatin regulation and tumorigenesis an important goal in understanding neoplastic progression. In this study, we used a rapid and robust mouse-modeling platform to study the consequences of inducible and reversible suppression of the Arid1a SWI/SNF subunit in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Suppression of Arid1a in adult acinar cells harboring oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> mutations accelerates acinar to ductal reprogramming and specification of mucinous, pancreatic cancer precursor lesions that cannot be reversed by restoring endogenous Arid1a expression. Thus, our data suggest that Arid1a can provide a potent barrier to Kras driven acinar to ductal metaplasia and, consequently, early stage pancreatic neoplasia. Once disrupted by Arid1a mutation, these altered cells are reprogrammed in such a manner that Arid1a is no longer needed to sustain the aberrant cell fate.</p><p>The phenotype produced by Arid1a depletion in the presence of an oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> mutation is characterized by reduced chromatin accessibility accompanied by loss of acinar morphology, reduced expression of acinar genes, and upregulation of a signature characteristic of mucinous lesions. These features imply that genomic areas rendered accessible by Arid1a harbor elements involved in preventing acinar to duct like trans-differentiation in the context of mutant Kras, a critical rate-limiting step in Kras driven pancreatic neoplasia. Indeed, our transcriptional and chromatin profiling data imply that Arid1a disruption, in the presence of oncogenic Kras, reduces the chromatin accessibility of key TFs to the enhancers of genes needed to sustain acinar cell fate. At least one such factor, Nr5a2, can physically interact with the SWI/SNF complex via the Baf60 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Debril et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting a possible mechanism for aberrant Nr5a2 target deregulation upon Arid1a loss. Further studies will be necessary to determine the interplay between Nr5a2 and other acinar TFs that may underly the Arid1a-depletion phenotype.</p><p>The accelerated PanIN formation produced by Arid1a suppression required the presence of a Kras mutation, the initiating event in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Thus, Arid1a suppression in the normal pancreas did not appreciably perturb acinar differentiation, even during wound healing responses that force a reversible acinar to ductal metaplasia. Apparently, Arid1a suppression sensitizes pancreatic epithelial cells to mucinous reprogramming by oncogenic Kras or, alternatively, increases the efficiency of Kras-induced acinar-to-ADM-to-PanIN transitions. Regardless, this Kras-dependence differs from the phenotype produced by deletion of acinar TFs such as Ptf1a or Nr5a2, whose loss generally perturbs acinar maintenance and/or regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cobo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flandez et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">von Figura et al., 2014b</xref>). We hypothesize that the potent and cooperative effects between oncogenic signaling and chromatin remodeling at eroding barriers to cellular plasticity contributes to the high frequency of SWI/SNF component inactivation in many cancer types.</p><p>The enhanced PanIN phenotype observed in our model has intriguing differences and commonalities with other models harboring conditional deletions of different SWI/SNF components. Deletion of Brg1 during pancreatic development in conjunction with oncogenic Kras results in the formation of IPMN-like lesions contiguous with the native duct system that may derive from the ductal compartment rather than through ADM. Furthermore elimination of Brg1 in adult acinar cells prevents the development of Kras driven acinar to duct-like transdifferentiation and PanIN development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">von Figura et al., 2014a</xref>). While a recent study employing conditional deletion of Arid1a in the pancreas also observed IPMN formation, PanIN formation was not suppressed, pointing towards distinct molecular consequences of targeting different SWI/SNF components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kimura et al., 2018</xref>). The striking predominance of PanINs over IPMNs in our model may be due to a dosage effect, where IPMN formation requires complete loss of Arid1a in ductal progenitors or ductal cells, while acinar cells expressing mutant Kras are more highly dependent on Arid1a to maintain their identity, and thus are rapidly reprogrammed to mucinous PanINs upon partial Arid1a suppression. This has important implications for human cancers, which exhibit a broad spectrum of Arid1a levels.</p><p>Unlike our Arid1a suppression strategy, mouse models using conditional alleles necessarily disrupt SWI/SNF concomitantly with Kras activation. Indeed, when we recapitulate such timing during embryonic development, we see a lower level of PanIN formation with shArid1a pancreata showing the retention of acinar cells, that contrasts with the effects of sequential suppression of Arid1a in acinar cells harboring pre-existing expression of mutant Kras. While the distinct molecular consequences of different SWI/SNF component mutations may contribute to phenotypic variability in other aspects of PDAC progression, these observations indicate that the timing of SWI/SNF perturbation can have a dramatic effect on tumorigenesis phenotypes. Whether the temporal effects of SWI/SNF action are a consequence of developmental stage or priming events produced by the prior presence of activated Kras remains to be determined. In any case, it seems likely that one or both processes influences the transcription factor milieu and, accordingly, the specific consequences of SWI/SNF disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Regardless of the precise mechanism, the fact that Arid1a suppression can produce distinct phenotypes depending on the timing of gene suppression has ramifications for studying the SWI/SNF complex in other cancer types and, more generally, for cancer modeling in the mouse. Indeed, human cancers evolve as a consequence of a stepwise accumulation of mutations rather than the acquisition of multiple mutations simultaneously. Consequently, some phenotypes attributed to particular gene mutation in mice may not always extrapolate to the human system – not because of species differences, but because of the differential consequences of the timing of genetic events. Efforts to combine different recombination systems (e.g. Cre/Loxp and Flp/Frt) provide one way to uncouple events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akagi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orban et al., 1992</xref>). Additionally, our approach, which uses Cre-specific recombination to produce some oncogenic events and the tetracycline system to dictate timing of others, provides another. Such models may develop tumors with progression kinetics or therapeutic sensitivity profiles that more closely resemble those of patients.</p><p>Another unique advantage of our mouse modeling system is its ability to evaluate the reversibility of loss-of-function phenotypes, an approach that helps elucidate whether a cancer promoting event is required to sustain established disease. Indeed, the inducible shRNA technology used herein has been optimized to produce gene suppression that approaches that produced by gene deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ebbesen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hemann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Premsrirut et al., 2011</xref>) yet, by leaving the target locus intact, enables the endogenous protein to be re-expressed upon shRNA silencing. Here, shRNA mediated knockdown of Arid1a produced a shift in acinar to mucinous cell fate and a PanIN histopathology that was not reversed by subsequent Arid1a re-expression. Such results suggest that ectopic overexpression studies in cell lines with mutations in SWI/SNF components may not reflect the biological activity of that component during tumor evolution. Furthermore, they stand in contrast to what has been noted for other tumor suppressor genes, for example, in colon cancer models where reversible APC suppression promoted the expansion of undifferentiated cells that readily underwent differentiation upon APC restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dow et al., 2015</xref>). Since ARID1A controls the expression of thousands of gene targets via interaction with available TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kelso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that factors absent from mucinous lesions might be needed to reestablish an acinar transcriptional program when Arid1a is restored. Although Kras<sup>G12D</sup> itself prevents acinar regeneration after pancreatitis-induced ADM, expression of the bHLH protein E47 in PDAC cells induces expression of digestive enzymes and activates a Mist1-based transcriptional network, indicating that such a reversion is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data identify a role for Arid1a in the early stages of PDAC. This supports a model where initiating oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations trigger ADM and PanIN conversion at low efficiency; mutation of <italic>ARID1A</italic> may boost the frequency of this process by increasing cellular plasticity. Other tumor suppressor mutations (such as <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>CDKN2A</italic>) that co-occur with <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>ARID1A</italic> can then contribute to further PanIN progression. While studies to explore the role of <italic>ARID1A</italic> in later stage PDAC progression are in progress, the irreversibility of the Kras-induced PanIN phenotype indicates that impaired SWI/SNF function may not be required for tumor maintenance. If confirmed, the identification of genotype-specific dependencies produced by SWI/SNF dysfunction rather than restoration of its normal activity may be a more effective way to exploit SWI/SNF mutations for new therapeutic approaches. While some proposed vulnerabilities, such as ARID1B, extend across multiple tissues and mutational landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helming et al., 2014</xref>), our data imply that many

ATAC libraries were constructed using the NEBNext High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (NEB M0541) as in Buenrostro et al with the following modifications: DNA was PCR-amplified for 1 cycle of 5’ at 72°C and 30’ at 98°C followed by 12 cycles of 10’ at 98°C, 30’ at 63°C and 1’ at 72°C. Amplified DNA was purified on a Qiagen MinElute column and eluted in 22 ul of Qiagen elution buffer. Purified libraries were assessed using a Bioanalyzer High-Sensitivity DNA Analysis kit (Agilent). Paired-end 50 bp reads were sequenced with the Center for Epigenetics Research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

Enriched regions were discovered using MACS2 and scored against input sequence (fold change &gt;2 and p-value&lt;0.001). Dynamic regions between two conditions were discovered using a similar method, with the second ATAC library replacing input. Peaks were then filtered against genomic ‘blacklisted’ regions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mitra.stanford.edu/kundaje/akundaje/release/blacklists/mm9-mouse/mm9-blacklist.bed.gz">http://mitra.stanford.edu/kundaje/akundaje/release/blacklists/mm9-mouse/mm9-blacklist.bed.gz</ext-link>) and those within 500 bp were merged. All genome browser tracks and read density tables were normalized to a sequencing depth of ten million mapped reads. K-means clustering was performed on all dynamic peaks, with the optimal k determined by silhouette analysis. Dynamic peaks were annotated using linear genomic distance and motif signatures were obtained using the ‘de novo’ approach with Homer v4.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.ucsd.edu/">http://homer.ucsd.edu/</ext-link>). For analyses of TF density, transcription factor ChIP-seq enriched regions were discovered by comparison with matched input using MACS2, as with the ATAC-seq data. TF peaks overlapping sites decreasing in accessibility were classified using 'bedtools intersect' with an overlap of 1 bp. Gene density of these peaks was calculated using RefSeq annotated gene boundaries ± 30 kb of gene start or end, and these gene names were then matched with either differentially expressed genes, or genes with expression not changing by more than 10%.

To study the consequences of Arid1a-deficieny on acinar fate in the presence and absence of oncogenic Kras activation the authors utilize a very elegant ES cell RNAi based mouse model that facilitates inducible and reversible targeting of Arid1a independent on the Cre-mediated activation of oncogenic Kras during embryogenesis. In addition to phenotypic analyses using the described mouse model system the manuscript provides first mechanistic insights into pancreatic carcinogenesis in the context of Arid1a deficiency using RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq analysis. Together, the authors demonstrate that Arid1a can function as a barrier to Kras-driven pancreatic cancer initiation, albeit the impact of Arid1a-deficiency underlies a significant context-dependency. The manuscript significantly extends our understanding of the involvement of chromatin remodeling processes in general and the function of Arid1A in particular in pancreatic cancer development. All together the manuscript is perfectly written and follows a logical order and the conclusions drawn from the data are largely justified.</p><p>1) Please provide more information about the lesions in the mice. The authors state that the ductal lesions found in the Arid1a KD mice can be described as PanIN or IPMN-lesions. In Figure 2D only PanINs have been quantified. How have the lesions been distinguished from IPMNs so that only PanINs were counted? Do the Arid1a KD mice give rise to both, PanINs and IPMN? As BRG1-deficiency in the context of oncogenic Kras activation in the pancreas results to development of IMPN lesions (v. Figura et al., 2014), formation of IPMN might be a likely phenotype in Arid1A kd mice. As the severity of PanINs can be more important than their total numbers, it is important to illustrate the PanIN quantification in Figure 2D for the different PanIN stages separately. Please state how many mice have been observed until an age of app. 1 year (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A)? Was there a significant number of mice to justify the authors´ statement that Arid1a kd animals do not progress to PDAC? Can the authors show that Arid1a is still absent after one year of Dox treatment? How exactly have those lesions been quantified? Counting the lesions per field might lead to misleading numbers, if the Arid1 kd pancreata suffer from pancreatic atrophy. How is the number of ADMs normalized to pancreatic size?</p><p>Figure 3J: Arid1a kd and control mice are challenged with caerulein to induce pancreatitis. The authors state that they observe comparable ADM formation and pancreatic inflammation in both genotypes. Could the authors please quantify the inflammatory response (e.g. by using a scoring system considering edema, infiltration of inflammatory cells into the pancreas etc.) to objective the statement of comparable inflammation? In the same line: is the caerulein-induced damage comparable in both models? If blood samples from the mice were available, lipase and amylase serum levels could be assessed. Comparable damage in both models is important to justify the statement of equal regenerative potential in both models.</p><p>2) Please provide more information about the transcriptional analysis. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering depicted in Figure 6B shows 3 samples for each Arid1a shRNA. In contrast, the PCA in Figure 6A only shows two dots for A1A.1803. Is the dot hidden behind another one or have the authors excluded one sample? If so, what has been the rationale for excluding the sample? In the same line: in ATAC-Seq, there are four replicates for shRen, but 3 in shArid1A. Why? Has a shArid1A sample been excluded? The transcriptional analysis in cell extracts from KC-Ren and KC-shArid1a cells reveals genes and signatures associated with carcinogenesis and acinar cell fate. Could the authors please validate the distinct expression of some of these genes in their isolated cells and in the tissue of the mice? Have RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq been performed using cells from identical animals?</p><p>3) Please solidify the analysis of transcriptional programs and chromatin accessibility by demonstrating clearer relationships between the two. For example, the text states &quot;gene sets comprising the targets of these transcription factors were enriched among the downregulated genes in GSEA analysis of transcriptional profiles derived from shArid1a animals (Figure 7H).&quot; However, Figure 7H only shows that genes whose chromatin accessibility decreased showed reduced expression. The authors should analyze the data to correlate expression and accessibility at target sites of key acinar transcription factor binding sites, and separately determine the accessibility at genes whose expression changes in shArid1a.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35216.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] 1) Please provide more information about the lesions in the mice.

Regarding PanIN grades, histological analysis 2 weeks after shArid1a inhibition in this adult cohort reveals the majority of lesions are consistent with PanIN-1, though a small number of PanIN-2 lesions were present as well. No PanIN-3 lesions were observed. Similarly, few IPMNs were identified. These data have been included in new Figure 2D. The differences between Arid1a KD and Brg1-deficiency mouse models are discussed in Results subsection “Temporal context dictates the outcome of Arid1a depletion” (first paragraph), and in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please state how many mice have been observed until an age of app. 1 year (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A)?

We have confirmed the stability of Arid1a knockdown in mucinous PanIN lesions in this aged cohort (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, 2C).This frequency of PDAC development after a year is consistent with historically reported rates in mouse models where mutant Kras is expressed in the developing pancreas in the absence of genetic modification of other tumor suppressors (subsection “Acute Arid1a knockdown induces rapid changes in adult acinar cell fate in the setting of Kras<sup>G12D</sup>”, last paragraph). This supports a role for Arid1a suppression constraining Kras driven preneoplastic development rather than malignant progression as addressed in the original and revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How exactly have those lesions been quantified?</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification was performed by a veterinary pathologist experienced in murine pancreas histology (J.

As suggested, we also updated the graphs that reported “lesion per field” to express lesions relative to mm2 of tissue area analyzed (new Figure 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3J: Arid1a kd and control mice are challenged with caerulein to induce pancreatitis.

Comparable damage in both models is important to justify the statement of equal regenerative potential in both models.</p></disp-quote><p>To exclude the possibility that genotype specific differences in acute pancreatic damage in response to caerulein prevents accurate evaluation of the regenerative capacity of shArid1a expressing pancreatic cells, we have more fully characterized the time course of pancreatic inflammation, exocrine stress, and exocrine regeneration in shArid1a and shRen expressing mice. Scoring inflammation based on histological analysis and CD45 immunohistochemistry reveals similar levels of inflammation at D2 post caerulein in both shArid1a and shRen expressing mice, as well as comparable resolution at D9. (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B).While no blood samples were available to measure serum pancreatic enzyme levels as proxy for pancreatic damage, we compared molecular markers of acinar stress and acinar differentiation after caerulein treatment. As shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, caerulein treatment induced a comparable increase in clusterin, a well-established anti-apoptotic gene that is transiently expressed in damaged acini following pancreatic damage and downregulated upon regeneration (Siveke et al.,2008, Morris et al., 2010), in both genotypes at D2 that is markedly reduced upon regeneration (D9). Furthermore, we now show an inverse expression pattern of the differentiated acinar marker Cpa1 in both shRen and shArid1a acinar cells undergoing injury-induced regeneration (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B). Importantly, as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, Arid1a levels remained suppressed at all stages of response and regeneration following acute pancreatitis, thus confirming the absence of counter selection against Arid1a suppressed cells and expansion of Arid1a expressing cells. These results provide strong evidence that Arid1a suppression does not alter the damage:regeneration capacity of adult acinar cells and that Arid1a is dispensable for restoring acinar fate after injury. These issues are now detailed fully in the results (subsection “Arid1a is not required for acinar cell maintenance or regeneration in the normal pancreas”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please provide more information about the transcriptional analysis.

Moreover, histological validation of select up- and down-regulated genes at 2 weeks post dox treatment shows that early transcriptional changes induced by Arid1a suppression (e.g. mesothelin upregulation, and amylase downregulation) are maintained in the resultant metaplastic pancreas (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq been performed using cells from identical animals?</p></disp-quote><p>Technical challenges involved in dissociating epithelial cells from fibrotic pancreata undergoing Kras driven metaplasia precluded our ability to collect sufficient cells to perform both ATAC and RNA SEQ from the same animals. This is clarified in the revised Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please solidify the analysis of transcriptional programs and chromatin accessibility by demonstrating clearer relationships between the two. For example, the text states &quot;gene sets comprising the targets of these transcription factors were enriched among the downregulated genes in GSEA analysis of transcriptional profiles derived from shArid1a animals (Figure 7H).&quot; However, Figure 7H only shows that genes whose chromatin accessibility decreased showed reduced expression. The authors should analyze the data to correlate expression and accessibility at target sites of key acinar transcription factor binding sites, and separately determine the accessibility at genes whose expression changes in shArid1a.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a comprehensive analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility at targets of pancreatic TFs necessary for maintenance of acinar differentiation (Nr5a2, Ptf1a) and acinar regeneration (Pdx1) that previously demonstrated to constrain Kras driven preneoplastic development (von Figura et al.,2014, Krah et al.,2015, Roy et al.,2016). We compared ATAC-SEQ profiles following Arid1a suppression to high confidence, experimentally-defined datasets of TF binding sites defined by ChIP-seq (Holmstrom et al.,2011, Hoang et al.,2016, Roy et al.,2016). This analysis showed a significant enrichment of TF binding sites at ATAC-seq peaks that lose accessibility upon Arid1a KD compared with sites not changing in accessibility (Nr5a2 and Ptf1a: p &lt; 2.2e-16, Pdx1: p &lt; 0.0016; Fisher's exact test). Composite plots of average ATAC-seq signal at these TF binding sites also demonstrated decreased accessibility in Arid1a KD compared with control (Figure 7E). Importantly, increased chromatin closing observed upon Arid1a KD at these TF target sites is associated with reduced gene expression at target genes, now documented in two ways. First, by associating these TF-ATAC sites with genes by linear genomic distance and then using GSEA, we were able to find significant enrichment of these peaks in genes that become downregulated upon Arid1a KD as compared with control (Figure 7F). Second, by computing the density of these TF-ATAC sites per gene, we found increased density in genes downregulated compared with genes whose expression is upregulated or unchanged (Figure 7H; mean TF density in DEG down: 1.53, DEG up: 0.72, p = 2.55e-14, Welch’s t test). While the TF density was calculated per gene, we note that this is not simply an effect of underlying gene size discrepancies in the different expression categories (median gene size is 24 kb and 21 kb in downregulated and upregulated sets, respectively). Lastly, we note that various intersections of ATAC-seq dynamics and TF binding sites failed to yield a correlation with genes that become upregulated upon Arid1a KD.</p></body></sub-article></article>
