are uncovering previously-undefined cell populations and molecular markers at an unprecedented pace. While single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing is an attractive approach for unbiased transcriptional profiling of all cell types, a complementary method to isolate and sequence specific cell populations from heterogeneous tissue remains challenging. Here, we developed Probe-Seq, which allows deep transcriptional profiling of specific cell types isolated using RNA as the defining feature. Dissociated cells are labeled using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for RNA, and then isolated by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). We used Probe-Seq to purify and profile specific cell types from mouse, human, and chick retinas, as well as from <italic>Drosophila</italic> midguts. Probe-Seq is compatible with frozen nuclei, making cell types within archival tissue immediately accessible. As it can be multiplexed, combinations of markers can be used to create specificity. Multiplexing also allows for the isolation of multiple cell types from one cell preparation. Probe-Seq should enable RNA profiling of specific cell types from any organism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>cell types</kwd><kwd>FISH</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Probe-Seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Jiho</given-names></name><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name><name><surname>Cepko</surname><given-names>Constance L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Edward R and Anne G Lefler Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amamoto</surname><given-names>Ryoji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5K99EY028215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lapan</surname><given-names>Sylvain W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008035</institution-id><institution>Harvard Stem Cell Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HSCI Internship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Mauricio D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders did not have a role in the direction of the study.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Probe-Seq is a cell type specific bulk RNA sequencing method that can be applied to a wide-ranging tissue types from both vertebrates and invertebrates without genetic labeling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellular eukaryotic tissues often comprise many different cell types, commonly classified using their morphological features, physiological functions, anatomical locations, and/or molecular markers. For example, the retina, a thin sheet of neural tissue in the eye that processes and transmits visual information to the brain, contains seven major cell classes – rods, cones, bipolar cells (BC), amacrine cells (AC), horizontal cells (HC), Müller glia (MG), and retinal ganglion cells (RGC), first defined primarily using morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vlasits et al., 2019</xref>). More recently, scRNA profiling technologies have led to the appreciation of many subtypes of these major cell classes, bringing the total number of retinal cell types close to 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rheaume et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>). Such accelerated discovery of cellular diversity is not unique to the retina, as scRNA profiling is being carried out in many tissues and organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Regev et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several approaches have been used to transcriptionally profile tissues. Bulk RNA sequencing of whole tissues can be done at great depth, but does not capture the diversity of individual transcriptomes and often fails to reflect signatures of rare cell types. Currently, bulk sequencing of specific cell types is limited by the availability of cell type-specific promoters, enhancers, dyes, or antigens for their isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arlotta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsuda and Cepko, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Molyneaux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siegert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Telley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). This has limited bulk RNA sequencing primarily to select cell types in genetically-tractable organisms. Single cell and single nucleus RNA sequencing methods have allowed for the recording of transcriptional states of many individual cells simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaitin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Picelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shalek et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the undeniable appeal of scRNA sequencing, capturing deep profiles of specific cell populations in bulk can be sufficient or preferable for many experiments, for example when the goal is to understand the results of perturbations.</p><p>We and others have used antibodies to enable FACS-based isolation for transcriptional profiling of specific cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Molyneaux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amamoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hrvatin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pechhold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamada et al., 2010a</xref>). However, antibodies are frequently unavailable for a specific cell type. Furthermore, marker proteins in certain cell types, such as neurons, are often localized to processes that are lost during tissue dissociation. We therefore aimed to create a method that would leverage the newly discovered RNA expression patterns for the isolation of specific cell populations from any organism. This led us to develop Probe-Seq, which uses a FISH method based upon a new probe design, Serial Amplification By Exchange Reaction (SABER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kishi et al., 2019</xref>). Probe-Seq uses RNA markers expressed in specific cell types to label cells for isolation by FACS and subsequent transcriptional profiling. Although specific cells cultured in vitro have been successfully labeled by FISH for isolation using FACS, this method had not yet been tested for use in tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klemm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamada et al., 2010b</xref>). We used Probe-Seq to isolate rare bipolar cells from the mouse retina, cell types that were previously defined using scRNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>). We demonstrate that probe sets for multiple genes can be hybridized at once, allowing isolation of multiple cell types simultaneously. Moreover, the fluorescent oligos used to detect the probe sets can be quickly hybridized and then stripped. This enables isolation of an indefinite number of cell types from one sample by serial sorting and re-labeling. We extended Probe-Seq to specific bipolar cell subtypes in frozen archival human retina by labeling nuclear RNA. To further test the utility of Probe-Seq in non-vertebrate animals and non-CNS tissues, we profiled intestinal stem cells from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut. In each of these experiments, the transcriptional profiles of isolated populations closely matched those obtained by scRNA sequencing, and in most cases, the number of genes detected exceeded 10,000. Finally, we used Probe-Seq on the chick retina, an organism that is difficult to genetically manipulate, to determine the transcriptional profile of a subset of developing retinal cells that give rise to the chick high acuity area. Taken together, Probe-Seq is a method that enables deep transcriptional profiling of specific cell types in heterogeneous tissue from potentially any organism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Specific bipolar cell subtypes can be isolated and profiled from the mouse retina using Probe-Seq</title><p>To determine whether Probe-Seq can enable the isolation and profiling of specific cell types based upon FISH labeling, we tested it using the mouse retina. The retina is a highly heterogeneous tissue, with cell classes and subtypes classified by scRNA sequencing, as well as more classical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vlasits et al., 2019</xref>). We used a new method for FISH, SABER-FISH, to label the intracellular RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kishi et al., 2019</xref>). SABER-FISH uses OligoMiner to design 20–40 nt oligonucleotides (oligos) that are complementary to the RNA species of interest and are optimized for minimal off-target binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beliveau et al., 2018</xref>). The oligos are pooled and extended using a Primer Exchange Reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kishi et al., 2018</xref>), which appends many copies of a short-repeated sequence (concatemers) to each oligo in the set. This pooled, extended oligo preparation will be referred to as a gene-specific probe set. To allow for detection of multiple gene-specific probe sets, the concatemer sequences can be made unique for each probe set. The concatemers can then be detected by the hybridization of fluorescent oligos.</p><p>To isolate specific BC subtypes, fresh adult mouse retinas were dissociated, fixed, and permeabilized prior to FISH labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We designed gene-specific probe sets against <italic>Vsx2</italic>, a marker of all BCs and MG, and <italic>Grik1</italic>, a marker of BC2, BC3A, BC3B, and BC4 subtypes (~2% of all retinal cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). <italic>Vsx2</italic> and <italic>Grik1</italic> probe sets were hybridized to the dissociated retinal cells overnight at 43°C, and fluorescent oligos were subsequently hybridized to the gene-specific probe sets. By FACS, single cells were identified by gating for a single peak of Hoechst<sup>+</sup> events, while debris and doublets were excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Out of these single cells, the <italic>Vsx2</italic><sup>+</sup> population was judged to be the cells that shifted away from the diagonal <italic>Vsx2</italic><sup>-</sup> events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Out of the <italic>Vsx2</italic><sup>+</sup> population, we found three populations that were <italic>Grik1<sup>-</sup></italic>, <italic>Grik1<sup>MID</sup>, and Grik1<sup>HI</sup>.</italic> Based upon scRNA sequencing of BC subtypes, <italic>Grik1<sup>MID</sup></italic> likely corresponded to BC2, and <italic>Grik1<sup>HI</sup></italic> to BC3A, BC3B, and BC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>). We isolated both <italic>Grik1<sup>MID</sup></italic> and <italic>Grik1<sup>HI</sup></italic> (henceforth called <italic>Grik1</italic><sup>+</sup>) cells as well as <italic>Vsx2</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Grik1</italic><sup>-</sup> (henceforth called <italic>Grik1</italic><sup>-</sup>) and <italic>Vsx2</italic><sup>-</sup> cell populations. We expected the <italic>Grik1<sup>+</sup></italic> population to contain BC2 – BC4, the <italic>Grik1<sup>-</sup></italic> population to contain other BC subtypes and MG, and the <italic>Vsx2<sup>-</sup></italic> population to contain non-BC/MG cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The isolated populations displayed the expected FISH puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). To determine the purity of populations isolated using FACS, based on their SABER signal, the cells were placed on a microscope slide after FACS, and the percentage of cells that had <italic>Vsx2</italic> puncta was quantified. This analysis showed 92.3 ± 0.6% had <italic>Vsx2</italic> puncta, based on three individual sorts. On average, we isolated 200,000 ± 0 <italic>Vsx2</italic><sup>-</sup> cells, 96,000 ± 18,600 <italic>Grik1</italic><sup>-</sup> cells, and 22,000 ± 1,000 <italic>Grik1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells per biological replicate, with each replicate originating from two retinas. These results indicate that gene-specific SABER-FISH can label dissociated cell populations for isolation by FACS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isolation and transcriptional profiling of specific BC subtypes from the adult mouse retina.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of Probe-Seq for the adult mouse retina.

From the DE analysis, the top 20 most DE genes that were specific to a cell population were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The expression of <italic>Tpbgl</italic>, a previously uncharacterized transcript, was confirmed in <italic>Grik1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells by SABER-FISH in retinal tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that the cell populations isolated and profiled by Probe-Seq correspond to the expected BC subtypes.</p><p>We next aimed to determine the relative quality of the transcriptomes obtained by Probe-Seq versus those obtained from freshly dissociated cells. To this end, the Grik1<sup>CRM4</sup>-GFP reporter plasmid was electroporated into the developing retina at P2. We previously showed that 72% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were <italic>Grik1</italic><sup>+</sup> using this reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kishi et al., 2019</xref>). At P40, the retinas were harvested, and the electroporated region was dissociated into a single cell suspension. GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were FACS isolated into Trizol (henceforth called Live cells). Simultaneously, cells from the unelectroporated region from the same retina were used for Probe-Seq of <italic>Grik1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (henceforth called Probe-Seq cells). On average, 836 ± 155 GFP<sup>+</sup> Live cells (n = 3) and 10,000 ± 0 <italic>Grik1<sup>+</sup></italic> Probe-Seq cells (n = 3) were collected for transcriptional analysis. To measure the RNA quality of the Live cells and Probe-Seq cells, 100,000 GFP<sup>-</sup> Live cells (n = 3) and 100,000 <italic>Grik1<sup>-</sup></italic> Probe-Seq cells (n = 3) were collected. Based on the gene body coverage of the 10,000 most highly expressed genes, a slightly higher 3’−5’ bias was observed for the RNA originating in the Probe-Seq population (1.02 ± 0.02) compared to the Live cell population (0.90 ± 0.01), indicating mild degradation of RNA with the Probe-Seq protocol. Based on the gene body coverage graph, the level of degradation for the Probe-Seq population would project to a RIN score of approximately 4–6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sigurgeirsson et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Next, the extent to which the gene expression levels correlated between Live and Probe-Seq cells was determined. An analysis of expression levels of all genes between Live and Probe-Seq cells showed an average Pearson correlation of 0.78 ± 0.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Since 72% of the GFP<sup>+</sup> population in the Live cell population was expected to be <italic>Grik1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, the correlation for markers of BC2 – BC4 was expected to be approximately 0.72. Notably, when analyzing only the (BC2 – BC4) subtype-specific markers, the average correlation was 0.66 between Live and Probe-Seq cells, with enrichment of these markers in the Probe-Seq population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Therefore, expression of GFP in <italic>Grik1</italic><sup>-</sup> cells using the Grik1<sup>CRM4</sup>-GFP reporter plasmid could explain, at least partially, the difference in BC2 – BC4 subtype marker gene expression between the Probe-Seq and Live cell populations. In addition, as predicted by the reporter expression specificity, DE analysis for all genes between these two populations indicated enrichment of rod, cone, and MG markers, as evidenced by high expression of marker genes (i.e. Rho, Opn1mw, and Apoe) in the Live cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Despite the imperfect match in the cellular compositions of these two preparations, the strong correlation between the transcriptomes obtained by Probe-Seq and traditional live cell sorting indicates that high quality transcriptomes of specific cell types can be obtained by this method.</p><p>We next sought to investigate the parameters for gene-specific probe sets that are important for successful FACS isolation. The ability to resolve a targeted cell population from the total cell population was predicted to be dependent upon the total number of fluorescent probes in that cell, which could be increased by targeting more oligos to each transcript, and/or by targeting more abundant RNA species. To investigate these parameters, three gene-specific probe sets were made for <italic>Grik1</italic>, <italic>Grm6</italic>, and <italic>Neto1</italic>, which exhibit high-to-low levels of gene expression based upon FISH analysis in retina tissue sections (Number of puncta per positive cell: <italic>Grik1:</italic> 37; <italic>Grm6:</italic> 20; <italic>Neto1:</italic> 6.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). For each gene-specific probe set, 48, 24, or 12 randomly-chosen oligos were pooled for extension. These were then used for Probe-Seq, and the fluorescent signals from the FACS were analyzed to calculate the ‘Stain Index’ (SI; see Materials and methods for calculation of SI). This allowed for quantification of the separation of the positive population from the negative population. The SI was found to decrease with the reduced number of oligos and the level of expression of each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). However, with an SI cutoff of 2, 12 oligos were sufficient for confidence in the separation of gene-positive and negative populations. This was evident only when the events were displayed in a 2-dimensional flow cytometry plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Of note, <italic>Neto1</italic><sup>+</sup> BCs constitute ~0.3% of all retinal cells; nonetheless, a clear separation could be observed for this rare population. These results demonstrate that short transcripts, or few oligos can be used successfully to isolate rare cell types using Probe-Seq.</p><p>To label multiple cell types, or cellular states, it is often necessary to use a combination of gene-specific probe sets. This has been achieved in tissue sections using ‘Exchange-SABER’. Multiple gene-specific probe sets targeting different genes are hybridized simultaneously, and then several different fluorescent oligos are used in a short hybridization reaction to label several different gene-specific probe sets. Imaging is carried out, and then the fluorescent oligos are stripped using conditions that do not strip the gene-specific probe sets. Additional rounds of hybridization using fluorescent oligos targeting different gene-specific probe sets are carried out. This allows fluorescent channels to be reused for detection of different genes in the same cells. Exchange-SABER has enabled the labeling of seven retinal cell classes using three cycles of FISH. To determine whether multiplexing is feasible with Probe-Seq, dissociated mouse retinal cells were incubated with three gene-specific probe sets for <italic>Gad1, Vsx2,</italic> and <italic>Grm6</italic>, each with a unique concatemer sequence (<italic>Gad1.</italic>26, <italic>Vsx2.</italic>25<italic>, Grm6.</italic>27). For the first round of flow cytometry, the fluorescent oligos (26.633 nm and 25.488 nm) for detecting <italic>Gad1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> were applied and assayed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). Then, the remaining cells (i.e. those that were not put through the first round of flow cytometry) were stripped using 50% formamide. The removal of the fluorescent oligos was confirmed by sampling a small number of stripped cells and confirming the lack of signal in a second round of flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). The fluorescent oligos (27.488 nm) for <italic>Grm6</italic> were then applied to the remaining stripped cells, enabling detection of a distinct population of cells from the same pool of dissociated cells. These results indicate that multiplexed Probe-Seq can allow detection of multiple cell types in the same cell preparation with one overnight hybridization of multiple gene-specific probe sets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Probe-Seq enables isolation and RNA sequencing of cell type-specific nuclei from frozen postmortem human tissue</title><p>To determine whether Probe-Seq will allow one to access the transcriptomes of the many archived human tissue samples, we tested the method on frozen human retinas.

However, each organism across the evolutionary tree possesses unique traits, and understanding these traits will greatly enrich our understanding of biological processes. Non-model organisms can now be investigated at the genetic level, due to advances in DNA sequencing, transcriptional profiling, and genome modification methods. Despite progress, challenges remain to achieve greater depth in the characterization of the transcriptomes of rarer cell types within heterogeneous tissues. Even in model organisms, deep transcriptional profiling of specific cell types remains difficult if specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements are unavailable. To overcome these challenges, we developed Probe-Seq.</p><p>Probe-Seq uses a FISH method based upon SABER probes to hybridize gene-specific probe sets to RNAs of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kishi et al., 2019</xref>). This method provides amplified fluorescent detection of RNA molecules and can be spectrally or serially multiplexed to mark cell populations based on combinatorial RNA expression profiles. Previously-identified markers can thus be targeted by gene-specific probe sets to isolate specific cell types by FACS. Subsequently, deep RNA sequencing can be carried out on the sorted population to generate cell type-specific transcriptome profiles. Due to the reliance on RNA for cell sorting, rather than protein, this method is applicable across organisms. Other RNA-based methods to label specific cell types for downstream sequencing have not been tested with tissue samples, and/or require cell encapsulation in a microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klemm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eastburn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pellegrino et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Probe-Seq allowed the isolation and profiling of RNA from fresh mouse, frozen human, and fresh chick retinas, as well as gut cells from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Aside from the different dissociation protocols, Probe-Seq does not require species- or tissue-specific alterations. To profile multiple cellular subtypes, multiplexed Probe-Seq allows for iterative labeling, sorting, and re-labeling with one overnight hybridization of multiple gene-specific probe sets. This strategy enables separation of FACS-isolated, broad populations into finer sub-populations. The Probe-Seq method is also cost and time effective, with less than 6 hr of hands-on time, including FISH, FACS, and library preparation. Excluding the wait time for oligo delivery, libraries ready for sequencing can be made by Probe-Seq in less than three days. Per sample, we estimate the cost to be less than $200, from start to finish, achieving ~15 million paired-end reads. The Probe-Seq protocol may be further optimized to maximize utility. For example, the protocol may be further modified to use other single molecule FISH methods such as clampFISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rouhanifard et al., 2019</xref>) or RNAscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) rather than SABER-FISH, as these methods have their respective strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the protocol may be made for efficient for cell capture, for example a cell strainer can be used for the wash steps to minimize cell loss from centrifugation. Further development for scRNA sequencing after cell type enrichment using Probe-Seq may also be possible. For this, however, adaptation of Probe-Seq for the reversal of crosslinks for scRNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Attar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) will likely be necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Vsx2</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Ensembl: ENSMUSG00000021239</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Grik1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Ensembl: ENSMUSG00000022935</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tpbgl</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Ensembl: ENSMUSG00000096606</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Grm6</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Ensembl: ENSMUSG00000000617</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Neto1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Ensembl: ENSMUSG00000050321</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Gad1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Ensembl: ENSMUSG00000070880</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">GRM6</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Ensembl: ENSG00000113262</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CDH12</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Ensembl: ENSG00000154162</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">esg</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FlyBaseID: FBgn0001981</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Sox100B</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FlyBaseID: FBgn0024288</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">FGF8</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Ensembl: ENSGALG00000007706</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BMP2</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Ensembl: ENSGALG00000029301</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CD1</td><td valign="top">Charles River Laboratories</td><td valign="top">022</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Oregon-R</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">White Leghorn</td><td valign="top">Charles River Laboratories</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Variable oligos</td><td valign="top">This Paper</td><td valign="top">See Supplementary Table for sequences</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">RecoverAll Total Nuclear Isolation Kit</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">AM1975</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">SMART-Seq v.4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit</td><td valign="top">Takara Bio</td><td valign="top">634890</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit</td><td valign="top">Illumina</td><td valign="top">FC1311096</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse retina samples</title><p>All animals were handled according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Harvard University.

Immediately before FACS, the cells were filtered through a 35 µm filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #352235) for mouse, chick, and human retina cells/nuclei or a 70 µm filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #352350) for <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. FACSAria (BD Biosciences) with 488 nm, 561 nm or 594 nm, and 633 nm lasers was used for the sorts. 2N single cells were gated based on the Hoechst histogram. For the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut, debris was gated out first by FSC/SSC plot because the high number of debris events masked the Hoechst<sup>+</sup> peaks. Out of the single cells, a 2-dimensional plot (with one axis being the fluorescent channel of interest and another axis that is empty) was used to plot the negative and positive populations. The events that ran along the diagonal in this plot were considered negative, and the positive events were either left- or right-shifted (depending on axes) compared to the diagonal events. The empty channel was used to determine autofluorescence, and the events that displayed high intensity for both the channel of interest and the empty channel were deemed negative as they may be events with high autofluorescence in all channels. For some samples, the number of sorted cells was capped, as indicated by a standard deviation of 0. Different populations were sorted into microcentrifuge tubes with 500 µL of PBS and kept on ice after FACS. The protocol was later modified so that the cells were sorted into 500 µL of 1% BSA/PBS, as this significantly improved cell pelleting. The data obtained for this study did not use 1% BSA/PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA isolation and library preparation</title><p>The sorted cells were transferred to a 5 mL polypropylene tube and centrifuged at 3000 xg for 7 min at RT.

The downstream steps were according to the manufacturer's protocol. The volume of ethanol/additive mix in the kit was adjusted based on the total volume (100 µL of Digestion Mix and remaining volume after cell pelleting). The libraries for RNA sequencing were generated using the SMART-Seq v.4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Takara Bio, cat. #634890) and Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, cat. #FC1311096) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

The gene of interest was searched in the UCSC Genome Browser. Then, the BED files for genes of interest were generated through the UCSC Table Browser with the following parameters: group: Genes and Gene Predictions; track: NCBI RefSeq; table: UCSC RefSeq (refGene); region: position; output format: BED; Create one BED record per: Exons. If multiple isoforms were present in the BED output file, all but one was removed manually.

transcriptionally profile genetically-defined populations of cells. The protocol involves FACS-sorting cells based upon strong fluorescence signals produced by a new method of fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization. Cells or nuclei collected with this protocol can produce high-quality RNA sequencing data. The method therefore allows deep sequencing of rare cell populations and it compares well to the efficiency of single cell RNA sequencing using the SMART-seq method. The authors show that Probe-Seq can be applied to a variety of tissues from different organisms and to frozen nuclei isolated from archival material. The method described in this paper can therefore have many applications and will be of interest to large numbers of biologists from diverse fields.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript &quot;Probe-Seq enables transcriptional profiling of specific cell types from heterogeneous tissue by RNA-based isolation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They developed a protocol in which FACS sorting of cells is performed based upon strong fluorescence signals produced by SABER-FISH, a method that allows specific labeling of RNAs. They subsequently demonstrate that cells/nuclei collected under this protocol can produce high-quality RNA sequencing data.</p><p>Accordingly, the manuscript shows that Probe-Seq allows deep transcriptome profiling of a rare population of cells and compares well to the efficiency of scRNA using the SMART-seq. Several strengths of this manuscript are notable. First, the isolation of cells via RNA FISH has not been very straightforward, and I find this study a major technical achievement. Second, the authors demonstrate that Probe-Seq can be applied not only to mouse retina, but also to a variety of tissues from different organisms, including human, fly, and chick embryos, as well as nuclear samples. Therefore, this study is likely relevant to a broad biological community. The Materials and methods section of this manuscript is clearly written, and supplementary data provide the necessary information, including DNA sequences, to reproduce their data. Overall, I found the data is well presented and convincing.</p><p>One minor weakness of the study is that it's not clear how this method fares with more traditional scRNA-seq given only a few comparisons. Also, while the isolation of even finer cell types using sequential cell sorting is impressive, sequencing data from the sorted population is not presented in this manuscript to support whether this workflow is indeed feasible for RNA-seq. The manuscript will be significantly improved and more impactful if these data can be added.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This methodological paper combines fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and RNA-sequencing for cell sorting and transcriptional analysis of enriched cell populations. The principal advantage of this approach is its versatility, as it can be applied to a variety of tissues and species without the need for transgenesis.</p><p>Authors show that the FISH procedure is compatible with the identification of differentially expressed genes in various contexts. Although the approach is interesting, I believe that it would be considerably strengthened by performing a more direct quantification of the consequences of the FISH procedure on RNA quality and subsequent transcriptional analysis. The comparison of the Probe-Seq data with those obtained from freshly dissociated cells following retina electroporation, performed in the first part of the manuscript, is not sufficient. Indeed, cells labelled by the two procedures are not directly comparable, thereby preventing a direct comparison of the transcriptional results. A more direct comparison (i.e. RNA quality/transcriptional differences observed following FAC-sorting, vs. Probe-Seq vs. repeated Probe-Seq) should be performed to validate the approach and demonstrate its full potential.</p><p>Please find additional comments below:</p><p>- Figure 1 summarizes the procedure workflow as well as main results obtained for the adult mouse retina. It is accompanied by four supplementary figures, some of which containing important information (e.g. Figure 1—figure supplement 3). I would suggest splitting this figure in order to incorporate some of these data within the main body of the manuscript.</p><p>- Figures 2 and 3 follow the exact same workflow to demonstrate that the approach can be transposed to frozen post-mortem cells and/or other species. These two figures could be merged, as they essentially convey a similar message.</p><p>- Figure 1H and Figure 1—figure supplement 5: although authors conclude that 12 tiling oligonucleotides is sufficient for a confident separation of gene-positive and negative populations, a close look at flow cytometry histograms presented on Figure 1—figure supplement 5 rather suggests that it is insufficient for highly expressed genes (<italic>Grik1</italic>). Please revise.</p><p>- Demonstration of ON BC cell enrichment by <italic>GRM6</italic> Probe-Seq is not convincing if one refers to Figure 2E, as markers of ON BC are barely enriched when compared to those of OFF BC cells on the presented heat map.</p><p>- Validation of <italic>CDH12</italic> as a marker enriched in <italic>GRM6</italic>-sorted cells is not supported by the in situ hybridization presented in Figure 2F. Indeed, expression of CDH12 can be observed in other cell layers/cell types.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper describes a new method for isolating specific cell populations based on gene expression for RNA sequencing. This method uses in situ labeling of specific RNA species using an RNA FISH amplification method called SABER-FISH. The SABER-FISH signal is specific to the gene of interest and sufficiently bright for isolated cells using fluorescently activated cell sorting. They use this strategy to sort their desired cell populations that can then be analyzed by bulk RNA seq to give a more in-depth expression profile of specific types of cells. To show the broad applicability of this method, they apply it on mouse, human, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and chick tissue, and they also show that it is compatible with nuclei from frozen tissue as well. Overall, I believe this is a very practical and useful method for getting in depth and high-quality RNA-seq data on a specific population of cells within a tissue. I can imagine many applications and biological questions where this method will be really useful!</p><p>1) In general, it would be helpful to know the expected purities from these SABER + FACS protocols. The authors show images after sorting the populations of cells (particularly in Figure 1E), but it would be useful to show more quantification of these sorted cells. What fraction of the sorted cells that are supposed to show a particular marker combination actually have that combination of SABER signal when imaging (the <italic>Vsx2</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Grik1</italic><sup>-</sup> and <italic>Vsx2</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Grik1</italic><sup>+</sup> samples)? This helps give an idea of how pure these populations are prior to bulk-seq. Do these fractions match what is expected from previous literature/data?</p><p>2) It would be helpful to provide some quantification for the data shown in Figure 2F. For example, how many of the <italic>GRM6<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are also <italic>CDH12<sup>+</sup></italic> and vice versa? In these images, why does <italic>GRM6</italic> have larger (and more irregularly sized) spots than <italic>CDH12</italic>?</p><p>3) Do the authors know why <italic>Neto1</italic> (lowest expression) has the best stain index and <italic>Grik1</italic> (highest expression) has the worst when using 12 oligos? Is this something systematic about the method or just a particular finding with these genes? How was the cutoff of SI = 2 selected for this analysis? For people who would want to use this method, is SI &gt; 2 what is being recommended?</p><p>4) For the majority of FACS plots, the fluorescence of the gene of interest is plotted against autofluorescence. Is this a proxy for cell size or side scatter? Are there any specific advantages to using autofluorescence the readers should know about?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51452.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides an innovative, non-transgenic method to purify genetically defined populations of cells from a variety of tissues in diverse organisms.

Measurement of 3’ bias is a more reliable method to assess RNA quality, relative to the RNA Integrity Number (RIN). The RIN method measures RNA quality based only on ribosomal RNA, while the 3’ bias method takes into account the 10,000 most highly expressed genes. We used 100,000 cells from the <italic>Grik1<sup>-</sup></italic>Live cell population (FACS isolated and RNA extracted by Trizol) and 100,000 cells from the <italic>Grik1<sup>-</sup></italic>Probe-Seq population. The cell composition and number were nearly identical in these two populations. As expected, the gene body coverage of the Live cell population showed no 3’ bias, suggesting little to no RNA degradation. In comparison, the Probe-Seq gene body coverage showed 3’ bias, likely corresponding to a RIN score of 4-6 (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). In the Results section, we added, “To measure the RNA quality of the Live cells and Probe-Seq cells, 100,000 GFP<sup>-</sup> Live cells (n=3) and 100,000 <italic>Grik1<sup>-</sup> </italic>Probe-Seq cells (n=3) were collected. Based on the gene body coverage of the 10,000 most highly expressed genes, a slightly higher 3’-5’ bias was observed for the RNA originating in the Probe-Seq population (1.02 ± 0.02) compared to the Live cell population (0.90 ± 0.01), indicating mild degradation of RNA with the Probe-Seq protocol. Based on the gene body coverage graph, the level of degradation for the Probe-Seq population would project to a RIN score of approximately 4-6(Sigurgeirsson, Emanuelsson and Lundeberg, 2014) (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data presented suggest that 12 tiling oligonucleotides are not sufficient for a confident separation of gene-positive and negative populations for highly expressed genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the gene-positive events using 12 tiling oligonucleotides were difficult to separate from the gene-negative events when using a histogram. Therefore, we added a new figure panel (Figure 1—figure supplement 5D) showing the 2-dimensional flow cytometry plots which more clearly show the separation between negative and positive populations. In the text, we added, “However, with an SI cutoff of 2, 12 oligos were sufficient for confidence in the separation of gene-positive and negative populations. This was evident only when the events were displayed in a 2-dimensional flow cytometry plot (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The original reviews are included below.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the necessary revisions above, we chose to address the following concerns from the individual reviews as we believe that these changes further improve the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] - Validation of CDH12 as a marker enriched in GRM6-sorted cells is not supported by the in situ hybridization presented in Figure 2F.

Is this something systematic about the method or just a particular finding with these genes? How was the cutoff of SI = 2 selected for this analysis? For people who would want to use this method, is SI &gt; 2 what is being recommended?</p></disp-quote><p>It is unclear to us why <italic>Neto1,</italic> which had the lowest expression of the three genes tested, gave the highest staining index with 12 oligos. We suspect that this is a particular finding with these genes, suggesting that the staining index is not always linearly correlated with the number of tiling oligonucleotides. It is also possible that if we picked 12 different oligonucleotides (out of 48), then the staining index could differ. SI = 2 cutoff was determined empirically as we were able to see a distinct population with SI = 2.4. However, with such a low staining index, we were only able to see a clear separation between negative and positive populations using a 2D plot instead of a histogram (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the majority of FACS plots, the fluorescence of the gene of interest is plotted against autofluorescence. Is this a proxy for cell size or side scatter? Are there any specific advantages to using autofluorescence the readers should know about?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following to Materials and methods, “The empty channel was used to determine autofluorescence, and the events that displayed high intensity for both the channel of interest and the empty channel were deemed negative as they may be events with high autofluorescence in all channels.”</p><p>Additional Changes:</p><p>We have also re-analyzed the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Probe-Seq dataset using an updated single cell RNA sequencing dataset (Hung et al., 2019) that now includes significantly more cells. However, the conclusion remains the same as the previous analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
