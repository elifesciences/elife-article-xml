vivo is key to understanding how cells and tissues progress through development and respond to external cues. Here we perform in vivo injection of alkyne- or azide-modified analogs of thymidine, uridine, methionine, and glucosamine to label nascent synthesis of DNA, RNA, protein, and glycosylation. Three-dimensional volumetric imaging of nascent macromolecule synthesis was performed in axolotl salamander tissue using whole-mount click chemistry-based fluorescent staining followed by light sheet fluorescent microscopy. We also developed an image processing pipeline for segmentation and classification of morphological regions of interest and individual cells, and we apply this pipeline to the regenerating humerus. We demonstrate our approach is sensitive to biological perturbations by measuring changes in DNA synthesis after limb denervation. This method provides a powerful means to quantitatively interrogate macromolecule synthesis in heterogenous tissues at the organ, cellular, and molecular levels of organization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells often respond to changes in their environment by producing new molecules and building new cell components, such as proteins, which perform most tasks in the cell, or DNA and RNA, which carry genetic information. Complex tissues – such as limbs, which are made up of muscles, tendons, bones and cartilage – are difficult to see through, so studying when and where cells in these tissues produce different types of molecules is challenging. New approaches combining advanced three-dimensional microscopy and fluorescent labelling of molecules could provide a way to study these processes within whole animal tissues. One application for this is studying how salamanders regrow lost limbs.</p><p>When salamanders such as axolotls regrow a limb, some cells in the limb stump form a group called the blastema. The blastema contains cells that are specialized to different purposes. Each cell in the blastema produces many new proteins as well as new DNA and RNA molecules. Fluorescently labeling particular molecules and taking images of the regenerating limb at different times can help to reveal how these new molecules control and coordinate limb regrowth.</p><p>Duerr et al. developed a three-dimensional microscopy technique to study the production of new molecules in regenerating axolotl limbs. The method labeled molecules of different types with fluorescent markers. As a result, new proteins, RNA and DNA glowed under different colored lights. Duerr et al. used their method to show that nerve damage, which hinders limb regrowth in salamanders, reduces DNA production in the blastema.</p><p>There are many possible applications of this microscopy method. Since the technique allows the spatial arrangement of the cells and molecules studied to be preserved, it makes it possible to investigate which molecules each cell is making and how they interact across a tissue. Not only does the technique have the potential to reveal much more about limb regrowth at all stages, but the fluorescent markers used can also be easily adapted to many other applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Axolotl</kwd><kwd>light sheet fluorescence microscopy</kwd><kwd>click-chemistry</kwd><kwd>macromolecules</kwd><kwd>whole mount</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1727518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shefelbine</surname><given-names>Sandra J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004184</institution-id><institution>Northeastern University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Matz Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeon</surname><given-names>Eun Kyung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004184</institution-id><institution>Northeastern University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Undergraduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeon</surname><given-names>Eun Kyung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1656429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monaghan</surname><given-names>James R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1558017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monaghan</surname><given-names>James R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MSCA-GF 841047 CompLimb</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Comellas</surname><given-names>Ester</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Whole mount 3D visualization of macromolecule synthesis with light sheet fluorescence microscopy enables quantitative, multiscale analysis at the organ, cellular, and molecular levels of organization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The measurement of nascent DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in animals provides critical information on the state of cells (dividing, growing) in relation to their surrounding cells. Traditionally, radiolabeled or brominated nucleosides/amino acids are introduced to live animals, where they are incorporated into macromolecules during DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sidman et al., 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gratzner, 1982</xref>), transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Uddin et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wansink et al., 1993</xref>), and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garlick et al., 1980</xref>). Performing such approaches have allowed for the characterization of cells actively undergoing macromolecular synthesis as well as quantification of synthesis rates, which facilitates the study of cell behavior during tissue remodeling, proliferation, stress, or disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yoshizawa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rombouts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">O'Brien and Lis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rose et al., 1975</xref>).</p><p>In the past decade, bio-orthogonal macromolecule precursor analogs including 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU), 5-ethynyl-uridine (5-EU), and L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) have become commercially available for analysis of DNA synthesis, transcription, and translation, respectively. After injection of macromolecule precursor analogs into animals, precursors can later be detected in nascent DNA, RNA, and protein macromolecules with fluorescently labeled azides or alkynes through highly selective copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (‘click’) chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kolb et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Best, 2009</xref>). These powerful new analogs provide an alternative to the use of dangerous isotopes and the challenges associated with brominated precursors such as the requirement of large secondary antibodies (~150 kd) and harsh tissue retrieval methods that limit their use in whole tissue samples.</p><p>Advantages of the click-chemistry labeling approach include the inert nature of macromolecule precursor analogs that have minimal impact on the animal, the small size of fluorescently labeled alkynes and azides, and the high selectivity of click-chemistry. These advantages have enabled whole-mount fluorescent labeling of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</xref>), RNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jao and Salic, 2008</xref>), protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hinz et al., 2012</xref>), and glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Laughlin and Bertozzi, 2009</xref>) in animals. These pioneering proof-of-principle experiments have demonstrated that imaging macromolecular synthesis is possible, but the fact that most model organisms are large, optically opaque, and consist of heterogenous tissues has made it a challenge to image biological phenomena in deep tissues. Challenges such as photon penetration, differences in refractive indices among different cellular components, light-induced photodamage, and background fluorescence have limited the use of whole-mount imaging of macromolecular synthesis.</p><p>Advances in light sheet fluorescence microscopes (LSFMs) have recently enabled the imaging of large biological specimens from millimeters to several centimeters in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Power and Huisken, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dodt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Keller and Dodt, 2012</xref>). LSFMs have been utilized for volumetric imaging of many varieties including visualization of mRNA in whole-mount fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mano et al., 2018</xref>) and in vivo interrogation of deep tissue dynamics in transgenic reporter animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tomer et al., 2012</xref>), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Power and Huisken, 2017</xref>). Clearing methods like CLARITY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chung et al., 2013</xref>), CUBIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>), and 3DISCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ertürk et al., 2012</xref>) have further enabled volumetric imaging by decreasing refractive index mismatches and tissue clearing to advance large specimen imaging even further. Together, the rise of three-dimensional imaging, new staining techniques, and tissue clearing has demanded new means for cell counting, segmentation, and fluorescence quantification.</p><p>Here we present a click-chemistry based method to visualize DNA synthesis, transcription, translation, and protein glycosylation in whole-mount samples using LSFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We demonstrate the utility of this technique by imaging macromolecular synthesis in the regenerating axolotl salamander limb. Following limb amputation, the axolotl regenerates its limb by generating a mass of proliferating cells at the limb stump called a blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stocum, 2017</xref>). The blastema is an ideal environment to test our method because it is an accessible, heterogenous tissue that increases DNA synthesis, transcriptional output, and translation rates compared to uninjured tissue. Furthermore, DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis decrease after denervation of the regenerating limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Singer and Caston, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dresden, 1969</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Outline of staining/analysis pipeline and exemplary images.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of entire sample preparation, imaging, and data analysis pipeline.

We also show that optical resolution of images can be improved with the clearing agent 2,2’-thiodiethanol (TDE), and that this method works in a number of tissues. We outline an image analysis pipeline for three dimensional (3D) morphology segmentation, cell counting, and fluorescence quantification of stained tissues. We apply this pipeline to the regenerating humerus to demonstrate the multiscale quantitative analysis capabilities of our method. Finally, we show that our method is sensitive enough to detect and quantify changes in DNA synthesis rates in whole-mount innervated and denervated regenerating limbs. Taken together, our method provides a unique approach to simultaneously interrogate cell state at the organ, cellular, and molecular levels of organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Whole-mount, click-it based visualization of macromolecule synthesis</title><p>To visualize macromolecule synthesis, we injected click-it compatible monomer analogs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) intraperitonially 3 hr before sample collection. During this time, analogs metabolically incorporated into nascently synthesized macromolecules, resulting in in vivo labeling of macromolecule synthesis. Our group has found that collection of tissue after 3 hr provides sufficiently strong metabolic labeling of DNA synthesis (EdU), transcription (EU), translation (AHA), and protein glycosylation (GlcNAz). These labeled macromolecules contain either azide- or alkyne-modified monomers that can be detected with click-it compatible fluorescent molecules, enabling imaging of nascent macromolecules in whole-mount tissues with LSFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). We show that our whole-mount method can be used at the organismal level to visualize the whole torso of a stage 52 axolotl larvae, where we observe proliferating cells in the developing limbs and hematopoiesis within the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To demonstrate the multiplexing capabilities of the approach, modified monomer analogs with disparate functional groups (EdU/AHA, 5-EU/AHA, EdU/GlcNAz, 5-EU/GlcNAz) were co-injected and visualized with LSFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>. For color blind accessible images, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). whole-mount samples were comparable to 2D longitudinal tissue sections of the same stains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–L</xref>), showing that our method generates similar results in both whole-mount and tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) with subcellular resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, the number of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells per blastema area in a single Z slice obtained by LSFM (EdU-AHA: 1954 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>, EdU-GlcNAz: 1458 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) is similar to that of a tissue section obtained by confocal microscopy (EdU-AHA: 1272 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>, EdU-GlcNAz: 1349 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>). We finally demonstrate the specificity of GlcNAz incorporation by pretreating a GlcNAz-specific antibody on tissue sections collected from GlcNAz injected animals. By doing so, the subsequent click-it reaction was prevented due to the antibodies likely sterically hindering alkyne fluorophores from accessing the azide functional groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dual staining of macromolecule synthesis in whole-mount imaging.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Stitched and fused 3D reconstruction of 13 dpa blastemas stained for multiple macromolecules obtained by LSFM.

Additionally, traditional methods of obtaining 3D images of thick tissues with confocal microscopy are impractically slow when imaging hundreds of images in a single stack. LSFM allows for more rapid imaging of whole samples, requiring only minutes to image each sample. However, several considerations exist when imaging whole tissue in 3D with LSFM. Stain penetrates slower in whole 3D tissues compared to 10–20 µm thick tissue sections, requiring longer staining times. An advantage of our method is that the click reaction requires molecularly diminutive reagents that readily pass through cell and nuclear membranes, ensuring stain penetration in the center of dense tissues. Different refractive indices between disparate cellular components and the imaging media cause light to scatter, which can reduce the resolution and brightness of 3D images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fadero and Maddox, 2017</xref>). To improve image resolution and light penetration, overnight refractive index matching with 67% 2,2’-thiodiethanol (TDE) can sufficiently clear axolotl limbs for imaging with LSFM. TDE was chosen due to its simplicity, cost, safety, and compatibility with common imaging modalities. This clearing method rapidly and effectively improves the signal-to-noise ratio of stained samples compared to imaging in PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Tissue morphology was minimally disturbed after clearing, with only mild shrinkage of the blastema epithelium observed. With careful attention to these challenges, our method provides a means to obtain high-quality 3D images from tissues 1 mm in depth in less than 10 min per sample with clear, consistent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>3D, multiscale quantitative analysis of the regenerating humerus</title><p>To demonstrate that our whole-mount click-it method can obtain quantifiable data on the organ, cellular, and molecular levels of organization, we applied our technique to the regenerating humerus.

These measurements of 3D organ size can be obtained with other methods such as microCT and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM). However, microCT is unable to image every tissue due to stain limitations and uses hazardous radiation, while FIB-SEM can capture 3D surface topography but not the entire organ morphology. Our method has the capability to fully image the 3D structure of entire organs (size permitting) without the need for radiation while simultaneously capturing information from both the cellular and molecular levels of organization.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>3D quantification across scales of a regenerating axolotl humerus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The cross-sections of the humerus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> were analyzed with the Fiji plugin BoneJ to quantify humerus shape and volume.

With this segmentation, we identify highly condensed regions of cells undergoing rapid rates of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). From these data, we observe cells synthesizing DNA most abundantly distal to the plane of amputation, as expected for dividing chondrocytes. Traditionally, cell quantification as such is conducted on 2D tissue sections. In heterogenous tissues, however, cells are distributed non-uniformly; 2D sampling may not accurately capture the cellular distribution and cannot be used to determine cell volume or shape. Our whole-mount staining method allows quantification of cells within an entire 3D tissue, resulting in a more accurate assessment of cell density within heterogenous tissues.</p><p>To demonstrate the quantitative molecular analysis of 3D macromolecule synthesis, we assessed the staining intensity of EdU in slices along the proximodistal axis of the regenerating humerus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). EdU intensity represents the rate at which a cell undergoes DNA synthesis, which is one of the first steps of cell division and proliferation. Proliferating cells rapidly synthesize DNA, which enables these cells to integrate EdU into nascent DNA strands. This provides ample opportunities for covalent linkage of fluorescent molecules to the DNA strand. Thus, higher pixel values within EdU<sup>+</sup> cells are representative of more DNA synthesis in the cell. These data show that EdU intensity is strongest in the regions distal to the amputation plane of the humerus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C’</xref>), providing a quantitative measure to assess macromolecule synthesis on the molecular level. Within a tissue, cells synthesize macromolecules heterogeneously, reflected by different fluorescence values between cells. Thus, quantifying macromolecule synthesis based on the presence/absence of signal instead of fluorescence does not account for variability in macromolecule synthesis rates among cells. To compound this issue, quantifying fluorescence in tissue sections only represents the rate of macromolecule synthesis from a fraction of cells in larger, heterogenous tissues. Our method provides a means to capture this molecular heterogeneity in 3D samples, allowing us to observe whole 3D regions in the regenerating humerus that synthesize DNA more rapidly than others, which further demonstrates the utility of our whole-mount click staining method.</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that our method can provide quantifiable data on the organ, cellular, and molecular levels of organization. This highlights the novelty of our method, as we have not found previous examples of multiscale analysis as outlined here. We foresee this multiscale, quantitative analysis having broad applications in the examination of dynamic cell processes in 3D, such as in cancer metabolism and mammalian neurogenesis or other fields where macromolecule synthesis is traditionally studied in tissue sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>3D, molecular analysis of biological perturbations</title><p>To demonstrate that our method is sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in macromolecule synthesis in vivo, we quantified the difference in EdU intensity between limbs regenerating with and without a nerve supply. Blastema cells are thought to have a cell cycle length of 40–50 hr, with S phase approximately 30 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tassava et al., 1987</xref>). In newts, it has been shown that amino acid, RNA, and DNA analog incorporation decreases approximately 30% by 24 hr after denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Singer and Caston, 1972</xref>). Based upon these estimates, we amputated both forelimbs at the mid-humerus and denervated the left limb at the brachial plexus 24 hr before collection. This timepoint for denervation was chosen because it should be sufficiently long to have an impact on DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis rates. At 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 25 d post-amputation (dpa) animals were pulsed with EdU for 3 hr before collection to label proliferating blastema cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We chose 3 hr of EdU incorporation to provide a snapshot of DNA synthesis in the 30 hr total S phase of blastema cells. LSFM was used to image samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), ensuring pixel resolution was consistent between samples. We quantified DNA synthesis in denervated limbs compared to innervated limbs by creating a 175 × 175 × 175 µm cube 250 µm from the distal most tip of the blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The size and location of the quantification cube was chosen to maximize the number of EdU<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells and to exclude any epithelial cells. Although we limited the cube to the size of the smallest blastema, these parameters can be customized depending on the size of the blastemas. For this study, we estimate 50–150 blastema cells are found within the cube. From these results, we observed a marked decrease in blastema EdU incorporation due to denervation at 9, 12, and 15dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that our whole-mount staining approach is capable of detecting changes in macromolecule synthesis after biological perturbations. One potential limitation of our method in the blastema is the inability to perform single cell segmentation. This is due to the density and abundance of cells within the blastema. We predict that higher magnification imaging and deep learning segmentation techniques may overcome this limitation but will significantly increase imaging time and file size. For comparison, we have included estimates of imaging time and file sizes for confocal microscopy with a 20X objective and LSFM with a 5× objective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>3D visualization of DNA synthesis in innervated/denervated regenerating limbs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experimental design used to obtain samples from B-O.

While tissue sections were previously the standard for studying these cellular processes, a new standard in the field must be expected where dynamic processes like macromolecule synthesis are visualized in 3D to obtain a more complete understanding of how these processes occur in a larger tissue context. Few modalities of imaging exist to provide this level of analysis. Here, we outline a method to study macromolecule synthesis at the organ, cellular, and molecular levels of organization, which is important in understanding cell state and how cell state affects neighboring cells and tissues. To this end, we show high levels of DNA synthesis, transcription, translation, and protein glycosylation in the entire 3D space of the regenerating blastema after limb amputation and that these processes can be visualized concurrently. Our lab has also demonstrated this whole-mount technique in other axolotl tissues including the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jensen, 2018</xref>). We outline a multiscale pipeline for analysis and quantification of heterogeneous tissues at the organ, cellular, and molecular levels of organization. Further, we demonstrate that our method is sensitive to detect biological perturbations by showing a decrease in DNA synthesis in the blastema following limb denervation.</p><p>We foresee our method being used to similarly readdress other classical questions with modern techniques for a more exhaustive understanding of biological processes; traditional questions within the fields of cancer biology and neurobiology may especially benefit from technology as such. Additionally, as more click-it ready macromolecules monomer analogs are generated, our method will provide a means to study more biological processes in whole tissues. Finally, we expect that this method should be amenable both with other staining techniques such as whole-mount immunohistochemistry and to a number of animal models, including mouse and zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>)</td><td valign="top">d/d axolotl</td><td valign="top">Ambystoma genetic stock center</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AGSC_101L">AGSC_101L</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine <break/>(EdU)</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clickchemistrytools.com">clickchemistrytools.com</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cat# 1149</td><td valign="top">Monomer analog</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">5-Ethynyl Uridine (5-EU)</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clickchemistrytools.com">clickchemistrytools.com</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cat# 1261</td><td valign="top">Monomer analog</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">L-Azidohomoalanine (AHA)</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clickchemistrytools.com">clickchemistrytools.com</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cat# 1066</td><td valign="top">Monomer analog</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">N-azidoacetylglucosamine-tetraacylated (Ac4GlcNAz)</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clickchemistrytools.com">clickchemistrytools.com</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cat# 1085</td><td valign="top">Monomer analog</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">AFDye 488 Azide</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clickchemistrytools.com">clickchemistrytools.com</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cat# 1275</td><td valign="top">Fluorescent azide</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">AFDye 594 Azide</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clickchemistrytools.com">clickchemistrytools.com</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cat# 1295</td><td valign="top">Fluorescent azide</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">AFDye 594 Alkyne</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clickchemistrytools.com">clickchemistrytools.com</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cat# 1297</td><td valign="top">Fluorescent alkyne</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">2,2′-Thiodiethanol (TDE)</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat# 166782</td><td valign="top">Clearing agent</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">L(+)-Ascorbic acid sodium salt</td><td valign="top">Thermo</td><td valign="top">Cat# AC352680050</td><td valign="top">Click-it cocktail component</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, 98+%</td><td valign="top">Thermo</td><td valign="top">Cat# AC423615000</td><td valign="top">Click-it cocktail component</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">SlowFade Gold Antifade Mountant</td><td valign="top">Thermo</td><td valign="top">Cat# S36936</td><td valign="top">Mountant</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal procedures</title><p>Axolotls were either bred in captivity at Northeastern University or purchased from the Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center at the University of Kentucky.

A cryostat was used to obtain 10 µm sections, and slides were baked at 65°C for 15 min. Slides were then washed with water for 30 min at room temperature to remove residual OCT. Slides were washed once with 1× PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The click-it cocktail (same as above) was applied to the slides and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. If staining for a second macromolecule, slides were washed five times for 5 min with 1× PBS at room temperature. The samples were then stained for 30 min at room temperature in the dark using the above click-it cocktail with a different a fluorophore dye. Following the final click-it reaction, slides were washed once with 1× PBS at room temperature for 5 min, then stained with 2.86 µM DAPI for 5 min at room temperature. Slides were washed again with 1× PBS for 5 min at room temperature and water for 5 min at room temperature and mounted with SlowFade Gold Antifade Mountant. Slides were imaged using a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Light sheet microscopy</title><p>All 3D images were acquired using a Zeiss light sheet Z.1 microscope paired with Zen software. Unless otherwise indicated, samples were cleared and imaged in 67% TDE. Post-processing for visualization purposes was performed with Arivis Vision4D v3.1.4 on a workstation with a 64-bit Windows Embedded Standard operating system, and an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40 GhZ (two processors), 128 GB RAM, and NVIDIA Quadro K2200 GPU. Sub-volumes were stitched together with the Tile Sorter in Arivis, using the manual projection option. Volume fusion was performed through automatic landmark registration of manually selected points for alignment. For visualization, background intensity was corrected using the automatic functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All data were processed on desktop computers with the aid of Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">The MathWorks, 2019</xref>). The custom Fiji scripts and Matlab codes used are available in the supplementary material. We performed all analyses on unprocessed. czi files acquired directly from the light sheet microscope.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Organ level</title><p>The goal of the organ level analysis was to determine gross morphology of the organ, such as area, principal axes, and maximum diameters in said axes for each cross section. Critical to this step is alignment of the images to a standard defined axis and reslicing in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the long axis of the humerus). The image stack of a regenerating axolotl elbow was imported into Fiji and aligned along the proximodistal axis of the humerus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Morphological segmentation of the humerus was performed semi-automatically with the Segmentation Editor plugin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The segmented surface was then exported from Fiji as a mesh via an. stl file using 3D Viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pietzsch et al., 2015</xref>). Volumetric analysis was performed in Fiji by reslicing the aligned mask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) to obtain a stack of cross-sections perpendicular to the proximodistal axis, and then quantified the shape and volume with the Slice Geometry option in the BoneJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doube et al., 2010</xref>) Fiji plugin. Slice Geometry calculates cross-sectional geometric properties of shapes, including area, second moment of area around the major and minor axes, and maximum chord length from these major and minor axes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Cellular level</title><p>The goal of the cellular level analysis was to determine the number of proliferating cells (EdU<sup>+</sup>) as a function of proximodistal position along the humerus, as well as average size, shape, and orientation. The aligned image stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) was cropped using the morphological segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) as a mask with the aid of the Image Calculator in Fiji. Based on the EdU staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we segmented the nuclei of the proliferating cells with Trainable Weka Segmentation 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017</xref>). We used a combination of filters available in Fiji before and after training the algorithm to improve segmentation results. Filters applied include the 3D Edge and Symmetry, Background Subtraction, 3D Fill Holes, Gaussian Blur 3D, and 3D Watershed Split. A detailed description of the sequence and parameters used is available in the supplementary materials. The 3D Objects Counter then provided a list of identified cells as well as their volume and position, among other information. In addition, the surfaces of the segmented cell nuclei were exported and processed in MeshLab, similarly to the process followed with the organ segmentation, to be visualized in Matlab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The centroid coordinates and corresponding object volumes identified in Fiji were imported into Matlab for further processing and plotting. We computed the number of cell centroids within 50 μm thick slices perpendicular to the proximodistal axis to obtain a density-like measure of proliferating cells. Slice thickness was selected as slightly larger than the average cell diameter to ensure cells were not sampled across more than two slices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Molecular level</title><p>The goal of the molecular level analysis was to determine molecular activity, characterized by fluorescent signal, which in our study represented DNA replication (EdU). The aligned and cropped image stack used as a starting point of the cellular-level analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) was also analyzed at the molecular level. We resliced the image stack along the proximodistal axis in the organ under study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The histogram and pixel intensity statistics were listed for each slice via the getRawstatistics function. These allow for further quantification of the fluorescent signal in Matlab, for example, we calculated the mean intensity of each plane along the proximodistal axis and the histogram of the whole organ. For the example showing nerve-dependent regeneration in axolotl blastemas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we compared overall pixel intensity of the left (denervated) and right (control, innervated) forelimbs of the same animal. To ensure full repeatability of our data analysis, we selected the same cubic volume in all blastemas processed: a cube with 175 μm sides, centered along the proximal-distal axis and at a distance of 250 μm from the distal tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The cube size was adjusted to maximize the cube volume for all blastemas processed, while ensuring that the entire cube was contained within the blastema. Histograms of each cubic volume and the ratio between the innervated and denervated limb of the same animal were computed and plotted with Matlab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) to quantify the changes in proliferation in innervated versus denervated limbs at different stages of regeneration. All scripts for blastema cube quantification are provided in the supplementary materials.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Tyler Jensen for his early assistance in developing the whole-mount staining protocol, and both Alex Lovely and Gouxin Rong for their microscopy and image analysis assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Tatiana Sandoval-Guzman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. This decision includes a summary redacted from the three reviews.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Duerr and colleagues present a combination of click-it, tissue clearing and light sheet technologies to examine macromolecule synthesis (namely DNA synthesis, transcription, translation, and glycosylation). This pipeline allows the visualization and quantification of cellular processes in growing 3-dimensional tissue. The authors use axolotl limb regeneration, a challenging system to tackle given its complex tissue types and large volume. Upon amputation, the remaining tissue in the limb will produce proliferating progenitors that accumulate forming a structure called the blastema, which the authors use to test macromolecule synthesis simultaneously. The authors demonstrate that administration of macromolecule analogs can be visualized simultaneously in a single sample. Furthermore, the authors create an image analysis pipeline that allows the analysis of individual elements or segments within the limb; they use the regenerating humerus to demonstrate the multiscale quantitative analysis capabilities of their method.</p><p>While the technologies used in this manuscript are not novel, the combination of these techniques together provide a compelling foundation to answer questions in this and other similar systems, while decreasing labor-intensive techniques such as tissue sectioning. The ability to look into these processes while preserving structure, helps understand the underlying biological function of a cell and its intricate relation to other tissues. This method opens up the possibility to analyze complex heterogeneous changes across heterogeneous tissues.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript has a potential broad scope and by using already commercial and open source tools, it can facilitate a broader applicability.</p><p>We have the following suggestions to improve the validation of the methods described in this manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the strengths of this methods is the diminution of a labor-intensive sectioning/staining/imaging track. One concern is that a more persuasive effort could be presented to validate the number of cells identified by both methods. Using the EdU+ quantification as a point of reference between the imaging protocols, the authors could provide a direct comparison with the standard methodology. One possibility is a randomized quantification of single planes from the wholemount volume and tissue sections. This would demonstrate side by side the detection sensitivity of the whole mount/LSFM visualization. Additionally, there is no information related to imaging parameters such as magnification, pixel size and its comparison between wholemount light sheet and confocal imaging. Many of the figures would be greatly enhanced by zoom insets to show the level of resolution and a comparison of resolution between the two methods.

One concern is that a more persuasive effort could be presented to validate the number of cells identified by both methods. Using the EdU+ quantification as a point of reference between the imaging protocols, the authors could provide a direct comparison with the standard methodology. One possibility is a randomized quantification of single planes from the wholemount volume and tissue sections. This would demonstrate side by side the detection sensitivity of the whole mount/LSFM visualization. Additionally, there is no information related to imaging parameters such as magnification, pixel size and its comparison between wholemount light sheet and confocal imaging. Many of the figures would be greatly enhanced by zoom insets to show the level of resolution and a comparison of resolution between the two methods.

We have found that strong labelling occurs at 3 hours of labeling for EdU. We have observed from previous experience that 1 hour EU labeling provides a weak signal while 3 hours provides a signal comparable to a 3 hour EdU pulse. For consistency with these results, we presumed that 3 hours of AHA and GlcNaz labeling would also provide strong labeling of translation and glycosylation in action. We clarified this information in the text. The lines read “Our group has found that collection of tissue after three hours provides sufficiently strong metabolic labeling of DNA synthesis (EdU), transcription (EU), translation (AHA), and protein glycosylation (GlcNAz).”</p><p>We chose TDE based upon its simplicity, cost, safety, and compatibility with common imaging objectives.

Once this area is opened, the nerves can be accessed and cut. Johnson et al. 2018 (DOI: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.07.010) showed that skin injuries on the limb have little impact on EdU incorporation. For this reason, we deemed it unnecessary to use a mock denervation. This has also not generally been the standard in limb denervation studies in the past, although we see the utility for rigorous experimental design in the future. Our assumptions are based upon a series of experiments from Marcus Singer between 1942-1950 showing it is the absence of a sufficient motor, sensory, and sympathetic innervation that supports proliferation during regeneration and not an injury alone. As an example, in 1943 Singer cut the dorsal and ventral roots of dorsal root ganglia 3, 4, and 5 and showed that limbs still regenerated comparable to contralateral control amputated limbs. This demonstrates that as long as sufficient nerve axons reach the limb, it will regenerate. It is the lack of these axons in the limb after denervation that leads to a lack of proliferation. As examples of a lack of sham control through the years using salamander denervation, see Butler and Schotte, 1941 (Histological alterations in denervated non-regenerating limbs of urodele larvae); Olsen et al., 1984 (Rescue of blocked cells by reinnervation in denervated forelimb stumps of larval Ambystoma); Wu et al., 2013 (de novo transcriptome sequencing of axolotl blastema for identification of differentially expressed genes during limb regeneration). We agree with the reviewer though that this should be a standard control in the field moving forward.</p><p>More information on the 24-hour denervation timepoint was included in the text. The lines read “Blastema cells are thought to have a cell cycle length of 40-50 hours with S phase approximately 30 hours (Tassava, Goldhamer and Tomlinson, 1987). […] Three hours of EdU incorporation was chosen to provide a snapshot of DNA synthesis in the 30 hour total S phase of blastema cells.”</p><p>More information on the size/location of the quantification cube was included in the text. We estimate that 50-150 blastema cells are located within the quantification cube. In terms of the cube that was measured in limbs, we generated the largest cube possible to fit within all blastemas at all time points. Larger fields of view could be chosen in later blastema stages, but for comparison across time points, we decided to limit our analysis to the largest cube available across all limbs. Also, we chose to exclude the epithelium as this tissue has different cell cycle dynamics compared to the mesenchyme during regeneration. The new lines now read “The size and location of the quantification cube was chosen to maximize the number of EdU+ mesenchymal cells and to exclude any epithelial cells. […] For this study, we estimate 50-150 blastema cells are found within the cube.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6 can show the power of the method, however, there is no statistical test to quantify the difference between the two experimental groups.

With our multiscale analysis pipeline, we simply wished to demonstrate that macromolecule synthesis rates can be quantified using pixel intensity. This is also why we chose to analyze three time points. While we agree the biology would be interesting, we feel that the scope of our paper is to demonstrate the capabilities of our method to address biological questions. It is for this reason that we chose a well characterized biological perturbation such as denervation to demonstrate our method.</p><p>We now represent the data with violin plots in Figure 6 and it represents the data in a clearer manner. It is also obvious now after two biological replicates that the difference between innervated and denervated limbs is in accordance with the known impacts of limb denervation. We have also separated the histograms and included them in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
