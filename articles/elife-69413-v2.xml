development by secreting molecules governing arteries alignment and maturation with nerves. Here, we show in mice that a specific, nerve-attached cell population, derived from boundary caps (BCs), constitutes a major source of mural cells for the developing skin vasculature. Using Cre-based reporter cell tracing and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that BC derivatives migrate into the skin along the nerves, detach from them, and differentiate into pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Genetic ablation of this population affects the organization of the skin vascular network. Our results reveal the heterogeneity and extended potential of the BC population in mice, which gives rise to mural cells, in addition to previously described neurons, Schwann cells, and melanocytes. Finally, our results suggest that mural specification of BC derivatives takes place before their migration along nerves to the mouse skin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Schwann cell precursors</kwd><kwd>mural cells</kwd><kwd>boundary caps</kwd><kwd>neural crest</kwd><kwd>meninges</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-54 MEMOLIFE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charnay</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02 PSL* Research University</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charnay</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charnay</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name><name><surname>Topilko</surname><given-names>Piotr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charnay</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name><name><surname>Topilko</surname><given-names>Piotr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charnay</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name><name><surname>Topilko</surname><given-names>Piotr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002717</institution-id><institution>Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charnay</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name><name><surname>Topilko</surname><given-names>Piotr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neural tube-associated boundary caps are heterogeneous with a non-neural crest-derived subpopulation that may originate from the developing meninges, which gives rise to derivatives that migrate along nerves to detach and differentiate into skin mural cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood vessels and nerves are branched structures that are established in parallel during development to supply almost every organ in the body. Their patterning is achieved through the coordinated action of a common set of factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carmeliet and Tessier-Lavigne, 2005</xref>). Indeed, recent studies have shown that in addition to using similar signals to differentiate, grow, and navigate, the vascular and nervous systems maintain a cross-talk that plays a key role in their mutual development. For instance, sympathetic nerves follow specific guidance cues produced by the vasculature to reach their appropriate targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glebova and Ginty, 2005</xref>). Reciprocally, studies by Mukouyama and colleagues have demonstrated that nerves and Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) play a decisive role in the development of the vascular network, as they provide essential diffusible factors, drive the alignment of blood vessels with nerves, and promote arteriogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukouyama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mukouyama et al., 2002</xref>). Using <italic>Neurogenin</italic> mutant mice, which lack cutaneous nerves, they showed that both blood vessel patterning and arterial differentiation are prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mukouyama et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, using in vitro and in vivo approaches, they demonstrated that two proteins secreted by cutaneous nerves, CXCL12 and VEGF-A, act as key factors to trigger the remodeling and nerve alignment of cutaneous blood vessels and arterial differentiation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukouyama et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Over the last decade, numerous studies have revealed an unexpected plasticity of SCPs, which give rise, apart from a plethora of glial derivatives, to skin melanocytes, adrenal medulla chromaffin cells, tooth mesenchymal stem cells, osteocytes, chondrocytes, and enteric and parasympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adameyko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dyachuk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espinosa-Medina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaucka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uesaka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). However, a cellular contribution from SPCs to the endothelial or mural components of the vascular plexus has not been reported so far. Mural cells (MCs) include pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) that cover capillaries and larger vessels, respectively, and participate in blood vessel remodeling and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holm et al., 2018</xref>). MCs have been shown to have multiple embryonic origins, depending on their maturation location: hence, facial and thymic MCs derive from the neural crest (NC), whereas gut, lung, and liver MCs are mesoderm-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asahina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Etchevers et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Que et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilm et al., 2005</xref>). In the skin, although an MC subset has been recently reported to originate from myeloid progenitors, the major source(s) of MCs remain(s) to be unraveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamazaki et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Boundary cap (BC) cells form transient aggregates during embryogenesis at the central/peripheral nervous system (CNS/PNS) interface, at the levels of dorsal entry and ventral exit points of all cranial and spinal nerves. Most BC cells express the genes <italic>Egr2</italic> (also known as <italic>Krox20</italic>) and/or <italic>Prss56</italic> that have been used as molecular markers in functional and tracing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coulpier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niederländer and Lumsden, 1996</xref>). Fate mapping experiments using a murine <italic>Prss56<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele have recently revealed that Prss56-positive BC cell derivatives migrate between embryonic day (E) 11.5 and E13.5 along nerve roots into dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), where they give rise to Schwann cells (SCs) and a subpopulation of sensory neurons, and along spinal nerves to reach the skin, where they differentiate into SCs, terminal glia, and melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gresset et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Radomska et al., 2019</xref>). Tracing experiments performed with an <italic>Egr2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele led to similar conclusions concerning nerve roots and DRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maro et al., 2004</xref>). However, in this case, peripheral migration was not explored. Here, we show that Egr2-positive BC cell derivatives migrate, during the same time period, along spinal nerves to reach the skin. In the skin, most of them detach from nerves, integrate the vascular plexus, and provide the major source of MCs to the adult skin vasculature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Derivatives of Egr2-positive BC cells join the skin vascular plexus after migration along the nerves</title><p>To investigate the contribution of Egr2-positive BC cells to the developing trunk skin, we crossed mice carrying <italic>Egr2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Rosa26R<sup>Tom</sup></italic> alleles and traced derivatives, on the basis of tdTomato (Tom) expression in <italic>Egr2<sup>Cre/+</sup>,Rosa26R<sup>Tom</sup></italic> embryos. As previously reported, we found numerous Tom-positive cells in the dorsal and ventral roots at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as well as in the DRGs at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, traced cells were observed in the proximal spinal nerve segments at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>), in the intermediate segments of dorsal and ventral rami at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>) and E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and finally at dorsal and ventral skin nerve terminals from E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). This dynamic time-course of proximo-distal distributions strongly suggests a migration of derivatives of Egr2-positive BC cells along nerves. We also noticed that some of the traced cells were not in contact with nerves, near the ventral roots at E11.5–12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, arrows) and later in the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>, arrows). To ensure that all traced cells originate from Krox-20-positive BC cells, i.e., that Tom expression does not result from de novo activation of <italic>Egr2</italic> in other cells populations, we searched for <italic>Egr2</italic> expression at E12.5 by in situ hybridization on whole embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), RT-PCR analysis of total RNA extracted skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and RNAscope on whole embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–J</xref>). These experiments did not reveal the presence of <italic>Egr2</italic> mRNA apart from BC cells. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of Tom-positive skin cells in E12.5 <italic>Egr2<sup>Cre/+</sup>,Rosa26R<sup>Tom</sup></italic> embryos did not reveal any expression of Cre (see below). Together these data indicate the absence of de novo <italic>Egr2</italic> expression in traced cells outside of the BC. In conclusion, these analyses establish that derivatives from <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing BC cells migrate along spinal nerves into the skin, and that some of them detach from the nerves during their journey.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Boundary cap (BC) cell derivatives migrate along the nerves and incorporate into the vascular plexus.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Trunk transverse sections from <italic>Egr2<sup>Cre/+</sup>,Rosa26R<sup>Tom</sup></italic> embryos at the indicated stages, and labeled with antibodies against Tomato (magenta) and Tuj1 (orange).

Notably, this population differs from <italic>Prss56</italic>-expressing BC cells, which never give rise to such derivatives. Two main hypotheses can be proposed to explain this process. First, a subpopulation of <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing BC cells is already specified as MPs before migration to the skin and their derivatives detach from nerves and differentiate into MCs once reaching their target. Second, <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing BC cell-derived glial progenitors migrate along nerves to the skin and undergo a glial-to-vascular transition that allows them to detach from nerves and mature into MCs. In both scenarios, nerve detachment would likely be dictated by the microenvironment through the influence of locally secreted factors.</p><p>To further explore the identity of <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing BC cells and their derivatives, we first analyzed E12.5 ventral nerve roots to assess whether all Tom-positive cells were expressing the glial marker Sox10, at the protein or mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>).

However, since <italic>Sox10</italic> activation occurs progressively in early-stage glial progenitors, we could not exclude that Tom-positive/Sox10-negative cells could correspond to early glial progenitors that have not yet activated this marker. This led us to repeat this analysis on skin nerve endings at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Similarly, we found among nerve-attached Tom-positive cells a majority of Sox10-positive cells, but also some Sox10-negative cells. An additional argument in favor of an early commitment of some ventral root cells toward a Sox-10-negative fate came from the analysis of the dorsal root (data not shown). In this case, we never observed Tom-positive/Sox10-negative cells.

We noticed that genetic ablation of <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing cells induced embryonic lethality at around E15.5, as we were unable to obtain mutant embryos beyond that stage, and we often observed sites of necrosis in the uterus when collecting embryos at E15.5. At E15.5, among the 60 collected embryos, issued from <italic>Egr2<sup>Cre/+</sup>,Rosa26R<sup>Tom</sup></italic> × <italic>Egr2<sup>GFP(DT)</sup></italic> breeding, 10 were <italic>Egr2<sup>Cre/GFP(DT)</sup>,Rosa26R<sup>Tom</sup></italic> based on PCR genotyping.

Unexpectedly, we observed traced cells in the skin in six of these embryos, suggesting that BC cell ablation was not complete. The four others displayed a complete loss of traced cells and were used for further analyses of the vascular network.

Hence, we identified a specific subpopulation derived from <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing, ventral BCs that migrate along nerves into the skin, then detach and give rise to pericytes and vSMCs. The remaining BC-derived cells follow the same path, but remain attached to nerves and give birth to SCPs. Whereas these latter cells express the typical NC lineage marker Sox10, our observations suggest that the former population giving rise to MCs do not express this marker and originates from the developing pia matter. In accordance with our tracing studies, genetic ablation of <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing BC cells results in a depletion of the skin MC compartment. Finally, we found that numerous MCs in serous membranes protecting the trachea, heart, and digestive tract are derived from <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing cells, suggesting a broader implication of BCs in the development of the systemic vasculature.</p><p>Our observations highlight a novel role for BCs in peripheral vascular development and further expand peripheral glia recently reported broad potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adameyko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dyachuk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espinosa-Medina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaucka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uesaka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). While virtually all BC cells at the dorsal root express <italic>Sox10</italic> and give rise to either SCP or DRG sensory neurons, the situation appears more complex in the ventral roots. We discovered that ventral roots encompass two populations of <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing BCs with distinct molecular and functional profiles. In addition to the Sox10-positive BCs at the origin of SCPs that migrate along nerve roots and spinal nerves, we identified a population of Sox10-negative BC-derived cells that express mesenchymal markers such as Tbx18, Col1a1, and Pdgfra. Our scRNA-seq analysis of traced cells extracted from E12.5 skin, at a time when the majority of BC-derived cells are still in contact with nerves, further supports the presence of nerve-attached BC derivatives with mesenchymal signature. Interestingly, at the same time, myeloid precursors are recruited by the primitive vascular plexus to form MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamazaki et al., 2017</xref>). In both systems, traced cells along blood vessels do not form continuous blocks, but are interrupted by blocks of non-traced cells. This suggests the existence of an attraction mechanism operated by the developing vascular plexus and acting on neighboring cell populations of at least two distinct origins, which have the potential to mature into MCs. In this scenario, nerves would act as a track for the migration of one of these populations from the ventral BCs to the skin and probably some deeper structures in the developing embryo. Since this migration of BC derivatives was observed along all spinal nerves, this mechanism is likely to provide an important source of MCs to the developing embryonic skin. Notably, <italic>Egr2</italic> inactivation does not appear to have any obvious effect on the migration and differentiation of this population. Nevertheless, more detailed analyses will be required to exclude any later function in MCs.</p><p>BCs are cell clusters, defined by their location at the CNS/PNS boundary and which were shown to express specific markers such as <italic>Egr2</italic> and <italic>Prss56</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coulpier et al., 2009</xref>). Using genetic tracing with the <italic>Prss56</italic> gene, we have previously established that a population of BC-derived traced cells give rise to SCs, DRG sensory neurons, and, in the skin, to terminal glia and melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gresset et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Radomska et al., 2019</xref>). Genetic tracing performed with the <italic>Egr2</italic>, also revealed a BC cell population that gives rise to DRG neurons and SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maro et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, we establish that the ventral BC cell population traced with the <italic>Egr2</italic> marker also gives rise to skin MCs, derivatives that are never observed in the case of <italic>Prss56</italic> tracing. The common derivatives observed in the two tracing studies are likely to reflect an already noticed, partial overlap between Prss56- and Egr2-positive BC subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gresset et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the differences in fates observed in the skin points to the existence of a functional heterogeneity within BC cells. The developmental fates of BC cells might be determined by the encounter with environmental cues during their migration or, in contrast, by the existence of blueprints established at or even before the BC cell stage. Our studies support such an early specification in the development of ventral BC cells; genetic tracing of cells expressing <italic>Tbx18</italic> indicate that some of them attach to ventral roots before E11.5, where they do not express <italic>Sox10</italic> and may activate <italic>Egr2</italic>. It is likely that these cells contribute to the <italic>Egr2</italic>-traced subpopulation that migrates along nerves to the skin, detaches and differentiates into MCs.</p><p>In accordance, our findings require to revisit the simplistic concept of BCs as transient and homogenous clusters of stem-like cells, characterized by co-expression of a panel of markers including <italic>Egr2</italic> and <italic>Prss56</italic> and initially thought to be entirely derived from the NC. The present data suggest that ventral exit point BCs possess mixed NC and mesenchymal origins. In particular, we show that the <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing BC cells that give rise to MCs are neither derived from the NC nor from the neural tube. They are likely to originate from <italic>Tbx18</italic>-expressing cells that are also at the origin of developing meningeal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeSisto et al., 2020</xref>). Actually, molecular heterogeneity was also observed within NC-derived BCs, as they contain populations expressing either <italic>Egr2</italic> or <italic>Prss56</italic>, or co-expressing both markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gresset et al., 2015</xref> and unpublished results). This heterogeneity in the embryonic origin of BC cells is likely to explain another observation: whereas targeted ablation of NC-derived cells expressing <italic>Egr2</italic>, obtained by combining <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Egr2<sup>GFP/DT</sup></italic> alleles, is effective, but not lethal before birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Odelin et al., 2018</xref>), targeted ablation of all <italic>Egr2</italic>-expressing cells does lead to embryonic death at around E15.5 (this study). This may be explained by the fact that the populations ablated in those experiments do not completely overlap.</p><p>Our demonstration of a novel source of MCs in the skin is of interest in the context of recent advances in understanding MC lineages. Based on their location, MCs have been divided into pericytes that ensheath capillaries, and vSMCs that cover arterioles, venules, and larger vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>). However, this simplistic view has been recently challenged by growing evidence supporting a continuum of MC lineages with intermediate types associated to specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holm et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, molecular analysis of CNS MCs at the single-cell level revealed the existence of subpopulations specifically involved in processes such as inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duan et al., 2018</xref>) or fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Göritz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soderblom et al., 2013</xref>). A similar heterogeneity among NG2-positive MCs has recently been reported in the skin, with different subpopulations at specific locations and with differing roles in wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goss et al., 2021</xref>). Our study reveals the existence of at least two embryonic origins for both skin pericytes and vSMCs, BCs derivatives and myeloid precursors, which are recruited during the same period to form MCs. Each population appears to be unable to fully compensate the other upon depletion: we report that targeted ablation of BC cells results in a significant decrease in NG2-positive MCs at E15.5 and, conversely, Yamazaki and colleagues have shown that in <italic>PU.1</italic> (also known as <italic>Spi1</italic>) mutants, depleted of tissue myeloid cells, there is also a loss of MCs at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamazaki et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, our data show molecular differences between MP clusters susceptible to give rise to MCs in the peripheral vasculature, with most MP clusters (1–4) sharing molecular markers (<italic>Pdgfrα</italic> and <italic>Col1a1</italic>) with CNS MC subtypes involved in fibrosis. Whether these differences in embryonic origin or marker expression identify distinct functional lineages corresponding to those reported at later stages remains an open question.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines, genotyping, and ethical considerations</title><p>Mice used in this study were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium on a 12 hr dark-light cycle with free access to food and water.

Cell Ranger v3.0.2 (10X Genomics) was used to process raw sequencing data. This pipeline converted Illumina base call files into Fastq format, aligned sequencing reads to a custom mm10 transcriptome with added sequences for the Tomato and Cre transgenes using the STAR aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2009</xref>), and quantified the expression of transcripts in each cell using Chromium barcodes. The count matrix generated by Cell Ranger v3.0.2 was loaded into R, thanks to the Seurat package v3.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) for R 3.6.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>). Empty droplets were filtered out using the EmptyDrops method implemented into the droplet Utils package v1.6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lun et al., 2019</xref>), with an FDR-adjusted p-value cut-off of 1E-03. Cells were selected if they expressed at least 500 genes including Tom, and if mitochondrial genes accounted for at most 20% of the total, and ribosomal genes for at least 7.5% of the total. Genes expressed in less than 10 cells were filtered out. Doublet cells were identified by a combination of two methods: the hybrid method implemented in the scds v1.2.0 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bais et al., 2020</xref>) and the method from the scDblFinder v1.0.0 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McGinnis et al., 2019</xref>). This resulted in a dataset of 2672 single-cell transcriptomes, among which three contaminating cell types were detected: Myod1-positive myoblasts (n=64), PECAM-positive endothelial cells (n=22), Neurod1-positive sensory neurons (n=5), and C1qb-positive immune cells (n=3). These cell types, accounting for 3% of the total cell number, were removed from the raw dataset for the following analysis. Cells for which no counts were measured for Tomato (n=377) were also removed. Cell cycle scores and class prediction were performed with the cyclone method implemented in the scran v1.14.5 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lun et al., 2016</xref>). Count values were normalized using the LogNormalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>) method implemented in Seurat, regressing out cell cycle (S minus G2M) as covariates. Principal component analysis (PCA)-based dimensionality reduction, graph-based cell clustering, and uniform manifold approximation and projection embedding were performed with Seurat, using 19 PCA dimensions with a 0.9 resolution and all the other parameters to default values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Materials availability</title><p>Mouse strains carrying the <italic>Egr2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Rosa26R<sup>Tom</sup></italic> alleles are freely available from The Jacksons Laboratory (USA). <italic>Prss56<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice will require an MTA for future users.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal manipulations were performed according to French and European Union regulations.

I really enjoyed reading it, and I believe this question deserves a serious attention. Although the authors performed a lot of accurate experiments, the current results do not come together with the current knowledge in the field, mostly because other Cre strains recombining in the neural crest populations do not recapitulate trunk perivascular cells, which the authors find to be traced with Krox20 Cre line.</p><p>The key would be to rule out the neural crest (classical Sox10+/Wnt1+) or non-neural crest origin of these perivascular cells. It might be that the embryonic nerves contain non-neural crest-derived cells with the plasticity discovered by the authors.</p><p>Below I list my suggestions for the critical improvements:</p><p>1. Other NCC and SCP-specific Cre lines should be used in parallel. The authors shall try Sox10-CreERT2, PLP1-CReERT2, Wnt1-Cre or similar.</p><p>2. The authors should check the expression of Krox20-driven Cre mRNA throughout all investigated stages for ruling out any ectopic recombination.</p><p>3. The in situ for Krox20 in the entire embryo and mostly in skin should be done for addressing possible expression outside of the boundary cap.</p><p>4. In the case, where the authors will not be able to confirm the neural crest-derived nature of the pervascular cells in the trunk, the authors will need to re-write the manuscript suggesting an alternative origin. Indeed, it might be possible that ventral boundary cap is a heterogeneous populations, and is only partly derived from the classic neural crest. The rest of this population, in theory, might come from the ventral neural tube (<italic>Sox2</italic> Cre lines should clarify it) or from mesoderm (feels unlikely), and in that case Mesp1 Cre or similar might be helpful. Of note: the paper will appear even more interesting to me in case when non-neural crest progenitors are associated with the peripheral nerves and give rise to the perivascular component.</p><p>5. The transitions should be validated in single cell data with RNA velocity. Krox20 expression needs to be shown on UMAPs. It is well known that Schwann cell precursors give rise to endoneurial fibroblasts. Those can be similar in their transcriptomics profile to the collected perivascular populations, leading to the false idea of connectedness. This needs to be investigated deeper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Krox20 is a marker for boundary cap (BC) cells. The authors trace BC derivatives in the mouse using Krox20Cre/+, Rosa26RTom embryos, where Tom-positive cells represent Krox20 derivatives. The authors identify BC derivatives that migrate along nerves towards the skin where a large proportion of these then detach from the nerves and instead attach to blood vessels. While these BC derived cells express glial markers for Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) (Sox10, BLBP) during their migration along the nerves, expression of these markers is reduced in some cells when they reach the skin. BC derived cells that detach from the nerves and instead associate with vessels express markers of mural cells (ABCC9, NG2, PDGFR β, SMA). At postnatal day 1, two-thirds of NG2-positive cells in the skin were Tom-positive, suggesting that two thirds of mural cells were BC-derived at this stage. Analysis of cell transcriptomes (from scRNAseq) of Tom-positive cells, at the stage when these cells begin to detach from the nerve (E12.5), revealed four general cell clusters; SCP-like, mesenchymal progenitor-like, transition-like cells, and a mural cell-like cluster. Inferred lineages from this data were used to suggest that SCPs go through a transition phase; from SCPs to mesenchymal progenitor like cells, before becoming mural cells.</p><p>Beautiful immunohistochemistry images provide strong support for the authors' claims through most of the paper. However, there are a couple more images that would be nice to have, to visualise some of the conclusions that authors derived from the scRNAseq data.</p><p>1. Authors say that for some cells, the transition from SCP to mural identity initiates while the cell is still attached to the nerve. The authors show antibody staining for SCP markers but not for mural cell markers at these stages (E12.5-E13.5, Figure 2). Antibody staining for both SCP and mesenchymal progenitor and/or mural cell markers in the same section showing positive signal for both in the same cell while detaching from a nerve would reinforce and visualise the authors' claims from the scRNAseq data.</p><p>2. Analysis of the scRNAseq data lead authors to suggest that BC derivatives also give rise to chondroprogenitors in the trunk. Antibody staining for chondroprogenitor markers (e.g. <italic>Sox9</italic>, Dlx5, Col2a1, <italic>Fgfr2</italic>) in the traced (Tom-positive) cells would reinforce the authors' claims from the inferred lineages from scRNAseq.</p><p>This is a great paper. My only recommendation to the authors would be to add a couple of antibody stainings. The most crucial would be for both SCP markers and mesenchymal progenitor and/or mural cell markers in the same section at E12.5, showing Tom-positive cells that co-express glial and mesenchymal and/or mural molecular markers in the same cell. Showing this in a Tom-positive cell that is detaching from a nerve would reinforce the authors' claims from the scRNAseq data for a 'transition' phase.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Gerschenfeld et al. investigate offspring of boundary cap (BC) cells in the embryonic dermis using lineage tracing in mice. They report that Krox20 positive BC cells travel along the nerves to the dermis, where they undergo a glial to vascular identity switch, detach from nerves and incorporate into the vascular plexus to become mural cells. Knockout of Krox20 does not affect cell migration, suggesting this gene is a marker but not involved in cell fate switch. Quantifications of immune-labelled sections showed that up to 60% of neonatal dermal mural cells are derived from Krox20+ BC precursors. Single cell RNA sequencing confirms heterogeneity of Krox20+ cells, including a cluster of cells with mural cell identity.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is well written and illustrated and provides what constitutes to my knowledge the first evidence of a neural crest origin of a portion of mural cells in the dermis of the trunk, thereby adding to the multiple known origins of vascular mural cells.</p><p>I have just a few comments that should be addressed before publication can be recommended.</p><p>Figure 3 Quantification of PdgfrB+Tom+ double positive cells would strengthen the quantification and the authors conclusion and should be added.</p><p>Figure 3 and S5a-c show that Tom-positive MCs do not form a continuum and are separated by non-traced MCs, suggesting that multiple sources of mural cells contribute to the dermal vessel wall. Why do the authors think that is?</p><p>Figure 4 and 5: can the scRNA seq analysis be further exploited towards more mechanistic understanding of the transdifferentiation. It would also be interesting to compare mural cells from different origins ie BC derived versus other sources.</p><p>Figure 6 Ablation of Krox20+ cells using DTR led to embryonic lethality, and analysis of a few surviving embryos revealed incomplete ablation of BC progeny in 4/6 embryos, while two showed compete loss of BCs and were chosen for analysis of the vascular network. The authors measured vascular area in those embryos and found no differences. This result is surprising and deserves some consideration. One would expect lack of mural cell coverage to lead to microaneurysms and hemorrhage, yet this was apparently not observed? The vasculature in Figure 6 panels C and F does look different between controls and mutants, I would encourage the authors to further characterize the vascular defects in these mice. Also, presence and absence of Schwann cells in these mice should be shown and discussed.</p><p>Figure S2c: please label the two circular NG2+ structures.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neural tube-associated boundary caps are a major source of mural cells in the skin&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>One of the main concerns from the original submission was the origin of the perivascular cells. The authors have addressed this and tested for possible neural crest (Sox10Cre-Ert2 and Wnt1Cre lines), neural tube (Olig2Cre line), and pial (Tbx18Cre-Ert2 line) origins. Sox10Cre-Ert2, Wnt1Cre lines, and Olig2Cre lines did not give rise to traced mural cells. With the Tbx18Cre-Ert2 line, tamoxifen was administered to pregnant females at E9.5, and embryos analyzed at E11.5. SOX10 negative traced cells were identified at E11.5 along the ventral root and spinal nerve. This was used to suggest a pial cell origin of perivascular cells. If possible, it would be beneficial to have a visual of the expression of Tbx18 at E9.5, to visualize the origin of the traced cells. It is also unclear why traced cells from the TBX18 line were not followed through to later stages (E14.5) where cells could be more stringently verified as mural cells by immunostaining for some mural cell markers (as in Figure 2A-D) and their morphology and migratory behavior could also be better verified as 'mural cell'.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69413.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers find the paper potentially very interesting but also raise a major important question regarding the neural crest origin or lack thereof of these perivascular cells.</p><p>1) It is essential to provide further data regarding whether or not the boundary cap cells producing mural cells are of neural crest origin, as promised.

On this basis, we have chosen to explore whether the developing pia matter could contribute to BCs. Using a Tbx18<sup>Cre-Ert2</sup> line, we show that traced cells are found in close contact with the ventral root, and that they migrate along the nerves on top of Schwann cell precursors. In addition, we performed RNA scope in situ hybridization and show that some Krox20-positive BC cell derivatives along the ventral root do not express Sox10, but are positive for mesenchymal markers such as Tbx18, Col1a1 and Pdgfra. Finally, after upgrading our scRNA-seq analysis pipeline, we observe two separate superclusters of Tomato-positive cells with glial and mesenchymal signatures, further supporting a dual origin of ventral BCs, with a neural crest-derived population at the origin of SCPs and a mesenchymal-like population at the origin of mural cells.</p><p>Our new findings are detailed in two new subsections in the Results from page 6 (line 30) to page 10 (line 5), with their associated Figures 3 to 5.

To investigate this issue, we attempted to reveal Cre mRNA using RNAscope and Cre protein with immunostainings. However, both techniques are known to be delicate with Cre and this actually did not work. To tackle the issue in another way, we included the Cre sequence in our scRNA-seq analysis. We did not observe any <italic>Cre</italic> expression either at E12.5 (in our published dataset, which included 2209 cells), or at E13.5, using another unpublished dataset (1029 cells, data not shown). Although this analysis does not cover earlier stages, it demonstrates that from E12.5 no ectopic expression can be detected.</p><p>We have mentioned the absence of Cre expression in the scRNA-seq dataset in the Results on page 9 (lines 5 to 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In the case, where the authors will not be able to confirm the neural crest-derived nature of the pervascular cells in the trunk, the authors will need to re-write the manuscript suggesting an alternative origin. Indeed, it might be possible that ventral boundary cap is a heterogeneous populations, and is only partly derived from the classic neural crest. The rest of this population, in theory, might come from the ventral neural tube (Sox2 Cre lines should clarify it) or from mesoderm (feels unlikely), and in that case Mesp1 Cre or similar might be helpful. Of note: the paper will appear even more interesting to me in case when non-neural crest progenitors are associated with the peripheral nerves and give rise to the perivascular component.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explored whether the neural tube or the developing pia matter (future meninges) might contribute to the ventral to BC cells population. Using an <italic>Olig2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> line, we have found no traced cells in the periphery, excluding a neural tube contribution. In contrast, using a <italic>Tbx18<sup>Cre-Ert2</sup></italic> line, we have identified traced cells on the ventral roots, within the BCs and migrating along the nerves on top of Schwann cell precursors. In addition, we performed RNAscope in situ hybridization analyses that revealed the presence on the ventral root of <italic>Krox20</italic>-positive BC derivatives negative for Sox10 and displaying mesenchymal markers such as Tbx18, Col1a1 and Pdgfra. Finally, upon upgrading our scRNA-seq analysis pipeline we have observed two distinct superclusters of Tomatopositive cells that further support the idea that ventral BCs are composed of two subpopulations: neural crest-derived cells that give rise to SCPs and cells with a mesenchymal identity that will give rise to mural cells and may be pia matter-derived.</p><p>Our new findings are detailed in two new subsections in the Results from page 6 (line 30) to page 10 (line 5), with their associated Figures 3 to 5.

The transitions should be validated in single cell data with RNA velocity. Krox20 expression needs to be shown on UMAPs. It is well known that Schwann cell precursors give rise to endoneurial fibroblasts. Those can be similar in their transcriptomics profile to the collected perivascular populations, leading to the false idea of connectedness. This needs to be investigated deeper.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we have upgraded our scRNA-seq analysis pipeline and found that most of the Tom-positive cells that connected the two super-clusters did not reach a proper quality and should be excluded from the analysis. In these conditions, it appears that the two super-clusters are clearly separated, which is consistent with the observations presented above. Together our data support the existence of a major heterogeneity in ventral BCs, both in terms of identity and origin as discussed above.</p><p>Our new scRNA-seq analysis is detailed in the Results from page 8 (line 29) to page 10 (line 5), with its associated Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1.

The authors trace BC derivatives in the mouse using Krox20Cre/+, Rosa26RTom embryos, where Tom-positive cells represent Krox20 derivatives. The authors identify BC derivatives that migrate along nerves towards the skin where a large proportion of these then detach from the nerves and instead attach to blood vessels. While these BC derived cells express glial markers for Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) (Sox10, BLBP) during their migration along the nerves, expression of these markers is reduced in some cells when they reach the skin. BC derived cells that detach from the nerves and instead associate with vessels express markers of mural cells (ABCC9, NG2, PDGFR β, SMA). At postnatal day 1, two-thirds of NG2-positive cells in the skin were Tom-positive, suggesting that two thirds of mural cells were BC-derived at this stage. Analysis of cell transcriptomes (from scRNAseq) of Tom-positive cells, at the stage when these cells begin to detach from the nerve (E12.5), revealed four general cell clusters; SCP-like, mesenchymal progenitor-like, transition-like cells, and a mural cell-like cluster. Inferred lineages from this data were used to suggest that SCPs go through a transition phase; from SCPs to mesenchymal progenitor like cells, before becoming mural cells.</p><p>Beautiful immunohistochemistry images provide strong support for the authors' claims through most of the paper. However, there are a couple more images that would be nice to have, to visualise some of the conclusions that authors derived from the scRNAseq data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for his/her encouraging comments. Please note that the manuscript has been substantially modified following additional analyses detailed in the answers to the editor and to the other referees.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Authors say that for some cells, the transition from SCP to mural identity initiates while the cell is still attached to the nerve. The authors show antibody staining for SCP markers but not for mural cell markers at these stages (E12.5-E13.5, Figure 2). Antibody staining for both SCP and mesenchymal progenitor and/or mural cell markers in the same section showing positive signal for both in the same cell while detaching from a nerve would reinforce and visualise the authors' claims from the scRNAseq data.</p></disp-quote><p>To look for nerve-attached cells with SCP or mesenchymal identities, we have performed immunolabeling and RNAscope in situ hybridization analyses on Krox20-traced ventral roots and subcutaneous nerves. Using neural crest/glial (Sox10) and mesenchymal (Tbx18, Col1a1 and Pdgfra) probes, we have identified traced cells on ventral roots that do not express Sox10 and also observed traced cells on nerves that express the mesenchymal markers. On subcutaneous nerves, we have identified Krox20-traced Sox10-negative cells. Although we could not perform double-labeling analyses, these data strongly support the presence on nerves of two subpopulations of BC-derived cells with glial and mesenchymal identities.</p><p>Our new findings are detailed in a new subsection in the Results from page 6 (line 30) to page 7 (line 34), with its associated Figure 3.

Analysis of the scRNAseq data lead authors to suggest that BC derivatives also give rise to chondroprogenitors in the trunk. Antibody staining for chondroprogenitor markers (e.g. Sox9, Dlx5, Col2a1, Fgfr2) in the traced (Tom-positive) cells would reinforce the authors' claims from the inferred lineages from scRNAseq.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that immunostainings would be potentially of interest to support the scRNAseq data. However, given the known expression of <italic>Krox20</italic> at E14 in chondroprogenitors, we felt that the time window to perform such an analysis was too narrow and that additional controls would be required to exclude late ectopic <italic>Krox20</italic> activation.

They report that Krox20 positive BC cells travel along the nerves to the dermis, where they undergo a glial to vascular identity switch, detach from nerves and incorporate into the vascular plexus to become mural cells. Knockout of Krox20 does not affect cell migration, suggesting this gene is a marker but not involved in cell fate switch. Quantifications of immune-labelled sections showed that up to 60% of neonatal dermal mural cells are derived from Krox20+ BC precursors. Single cell RNA sequencing confirms heterogeneity of Krox20+ cells, including a cluster of cells with mural cell identity.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is well written and illustrated and provides what constitutes to my knowledge the first evidence of a neural crest origin of a portion of mural cells in the dermis of the trunk, thereby adding to the multiple known origins of vascular mural cells.</p><p>I have just a few comments that should be addressed before publication can be recommended.</p><p>Figure 3 Quantification of PdgfrB+Tom+ double positive cells would strengthen the quantification and the authors conclusion and should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that such a quantification would be of interest. However, it is not technically feasible on wholemount immunostaining. Pdgfrb immunostaining presents a higher background noise and is more difficult to attribute to a specific cell than NG2, for which we have performed quantifications, which were already challenging. An alternative way would be to use flow-cytometry, but it would be also challenging to restrict the analysis to cells attached to the vasculature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 and S5a-c show that Tom-positive MCs do not form a continuum and are separated by non-traced MCs, suggesting that multiple sources of mural cells contribute to the dermal vessel wall. Why do the authors think that is?</p></disp-quote><p>Our study and the one from Yamazaki and colleagues suggest a dual origin for mural cells in the skin vasculature. Approximately one-third of them originate from myeloid progenitors and the remaining ones derive from a subpopulation of ventral root BCs. The fact that each model of mural cell tracing shows a non continuous distribution of traced cells along blood vessels, while we know that the distribution of mural cells is homogeneous and continuous suggest that the two populations are intermingled. This might results from a simultaneous colonization of the vascular plexus by both populations. Interestingly, the genetic ablation of one population leads only to a partial compensation by the cells from the other origin.</p><p>We have updated the Discussion to address this question on page 12 (lines 25 to 30).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 and 5: can the scRNA seq analysis be further exploited towards more mechanistic understanding of the transdifferentiation.

The authors measured vascular area in those embryos and found no differences. This result is surprising and deserves some consideration. One would expect lack of mural cell coverage to lead to microaneurysms and hemorrhage, yet this was apparently not observed? The vasculature in Figure 6 panels C and F does look different between controls and mutants, I would encourage the authors to further characterize the vascular defects in these mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding embryonic lethality at E15.5 following the targeted ablation of Krox20expressing BC cells, we strongly suspect that it is the ablation of the BC-derived MC component that is responsible for two reasons:</p><p>1.

The authors have addressed this and tested for possible neural crest (Sox10Cre-Ert2 and Wnt1Cre lines), neural tube (Olig2Cre line), and pial (Tbx18Cre-Ert2 line) origins. Sox10Cre-Ert2, Wnt1Cre lines, and Olig2Cre lines did not give rise to traced mural cells. With the Tbx18Cre-Ert2 line, tamoxifen was administered to pregnant females at E9.5, and embryos analyzed at E11.5. SOX10 negative traced cells were identified at E11.5 along the ventral root and spinal nerve. This was used to suggest a pial cell origin of perivascular cells. If possible, it would be beneficial to have a visual of the expression of Tbx18 at E9.5, to visualize the origin of the traced cells.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the question about the origin of traced cells, we performed RNAscope <italic>in</italic></p><p><italic>situ</italic> hybridization with the Tbx18 probe on E9.5 and E10.5 embryos, as tamoxifen-induced recombination is considered to take around 12-24h to occur.

In the skin, we also found that traced cells did not express Sox10 and that some of them were in contact with blood vessels and expressed NG2.
