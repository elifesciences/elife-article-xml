These results not only support the Trim71-let-7-microRNA bi-stable switch model in controlling stem cell fate, but also reveal that repressing the conserved pro-differentiation let-7 microRNAs at the mature microRNA level by Ago2 availability is critical to maintaining pluripotency.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Trim71</kwd><kwd>Lin41</kwd><kwd>let-7</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>translational control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL141112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qiuying</given-names></name><name><surname>Novak</surname><given-names>Mariah K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenqian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM136869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qiuying</given-names></name><name><surname>Novak</surname><given-names>Mariah K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenqian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI146431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xiaoli</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Shaojie</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenqian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Repressing the conserved pro-differentiation let-7 microRNAs through limiting Ago2 levels is critical to maintaining pluripotency in stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The switch between pluripotency and differentiation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains incompletely understood. Although nuclear events controlling stemness are becoming increasingly clear, how cytoplasmic pathways of gene expression regulate ESCs’ fates between pluripotency and differentiation are still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ye and Blelloch, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Genetic studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> led to the postulation that a conserved cytoplasmic bi-stable switch controls the pluripotency and differentiation of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ecsedi and Grosshans, 2013</xref>). This switch is proposed to involve reciprocal negative regulation between the conserved pro-differentiation let-7 microRNA (miRNA) and Trim71 (Lin41 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>), a conserved and ESC-specific RNA-binding protein (RBP). The following observations support this model. First, the let-7 miRNA negatively correlates with Trim71 during stem cell differentiation: the let-7 miRNA level increases, while Trim71 decreases during differentiation. Second, Trim71 is a conserved target of the let-7 miRNA, and repressing Trim71 by let-7 promotes stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeschimann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ecsedi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grishok et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Roush and Slack, 2008</xref>). Third, inhibiting Trim71 suppresses developmental defects caused by mutations in the core components of the miRNA pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Büssing et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grishok et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that Trim71 may negatively regulate the miRNA pathway. Thus, it is hypothesized that let-7 miRNA and Trim71 reciprocally repress each other. This double-negative feedback loop forms a molecular bi-stable switch, in which stem-cell differentiation is controlled by the let-7-miRNA-mediated inhibition of Trim71 and pluripotency is controlled by the hypothetical Trim71-mediated inhibition of the let-7 miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ecsedi and Grosshans, 2013</xref>). Due to the conservation of let-7 miRNA, Trim71, and the let-7-mediated inhibition of Trim71, the cytoplasmic bi-stable switch controlling stem cell fate is thought to be conserved in animals. A lingering question in this bi-stable switch model, however, is whether and how Trim71 inhibits the let-7 miRNA and regulates pluripotency in stem cells.</p><p>Trim71 was proposed to interact with and ubiquitylate Ago2, a critical component of the miRNA pathway, resulting in Ago2 degradation in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rybak et al., 2009</xref>). Although the functional significance of this interaction to stem cell biology was not examined, this observation seemed to support the bi-stable switch model. Later studies, however, indicated that the Trim71-Ago2 interaction is RNA dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loedige et al., 2013</xref>), and the proposed Trim71-mediated Ago2 degradation is absent in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Welte et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is unclear how Trim71 modulates the let-7 miRNA. In terms of biological functions, Trim71 knockout mice are embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuevas et al., 2015</xref>), while Trim71 knockout mouse ESCs (mESCs) have no proliferation or stemness defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitschka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Welte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Worringer et al., 2014</xref>), indicating an enigmatic role of Trim71 in stem cell biology. Collectively, these results highlight the hypothetical status of Trim71’s function and mechanisms in the bi-stable switch model and beg for investigations on how Trim71 regulates the let-7 miRNAs and whether this regulation plays a role in controlling pluripotency in stem cells.</p><p>Here, we show that Trim71 maintains pluripotency through inhibiting the let-7 miRNAs. We identified the transcriptome-wide targets of Trim71 in mESCs and determined that Trim71 binds and represses <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA translation. Specific disruption of this repression leads to an elevated Ago2 level, which results in a specific post-transcriptional increase of the mature let-7 miRNAs, decreased stemness, and accelerated differentiation in mESCs. These stem cell defects are dependent on the let-7 miRNAs, as specific inhibition of the let-7 miRNAs abolishes the stemness defects caused by the loss of Trim71-mediated repression of <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA translation in mESCs. Collectively, these results provide direct support for the cytoplasmic bi-stable switch model of stem cell fate decision. Moreover, this study reveals that repressing the conserved pro-differentiation let-7 microRNAs at the mature miRNA level by Ago2 availability is critical to maintaining pluripotency.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome-wide identification of Trim71’s target mRNAs in mESCs</title><p>To study Trim71’s function in mESCs, we created bi-allelic FLAG-tagged Trim71 in mESCs.

Using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, we could specifically detect Trim71 in the FLAG-Trim71 mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, most Trim71 could be immunoprecipitated (IP) from the FLAG-Trim71 mESCs lysate via the anti-FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This IP is specific because: (a) in the IP using IgG, Trim71 remained in the supernatant; and (b) when the IP was performed in the control mESC without the FLAG-tag, the IP sample generated little signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether Trim71 regulates mESCs, we identified transcriptome-wide targets of Trim71 in mESCs using cross-linking immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnell, 2010</xref>). This method not only revealed which mRNAs Trim71 binds but also identified the binding sites on those mRNAs. Trim71-binding sites are mainly located in the introns and 3’UTRs of the target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Sequence analysis identified an over-represented stem-loop structure, but no enriched primary sequence motifs, in the Trim71-binding sites compared to randomized sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This observation suggests that Trim71 recognizes RNA secondary structures, but not a primary sequence, which is consistent with recent in vitro and in vivo studies on Trim71:RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Welte et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), a validated Trim71 target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2012</xref>), is among the identified mRNAs with Trim71-binding sites in the 3’UTR. This observation argued for the validity of the 3’UTR Trim71-binding sites we identified.</p><p>In this study, we focused on the Trim71:<italic>Ago2–</italic>mRNA interaction because: (a) the <italic>Ago2</italic>’s 3’UTR contains only one Trim71-binding site with the predicted stem-loop structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>); (b) this binding site is also present in a recent study on identifying transcriptomic-wide targets of Trim71 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Welte et al., 2019</xref>; (c) genetic studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggest that Trim71 has links to the miRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ecsedi and Grosshans, 2013</xref>), in which Ago2 is a key component.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Specific inhibition of the Trim71’s binding on <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA</title><p>Previous studies indicated that knocking out/down Trim71 had no impact on Ago2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Welte et al., 2019</xref>), which we recapitulated in our mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). One caveat of this loss-of-function approach, however, is that hundreds of Trim71:mRNA interactions and potential Trim71-mediated protein interactions are lost in Trim71 knockout cells, making it difficult to evaluate the functional significance of a specific Trim71:mRNA interaction (e.g., Trim71:<italic>Ago2–</italic>mRNA interaction in this study).</p><p>To specifically investigate the function of the Trim71:<italic>Ago2–</italic>mRNA interaction, we deleted the Trim71-binding region (115 bp), defined from the CLIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), in the 3’-UTR of <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA using genome editing. We identified two independent mESC clones with bi-allelic deletions, which we named CLIPΔ clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The levels of the conserved let-7 targets, Trim71 and Lin28a, increased in the CLIPΔ mESCs when the exogenous Lin28a or Lin28b was expressed, but the levels of non-let-7 targets (e.g., Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2) were not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The ectopically expressed Lin28a or Lin28b alleviated the decreased ability to maintain stemness and inhibited the increased rate of exit pluripotency in the CLIPΔ mESCs, as determined by the colony formation assay and the exit pluripotency assay, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Moreover, western blotting revealed that the ectopically expressed Lin28a or Lin28b also inhibited the rapid decrease of pluripotency factors during EB formation in the CLIPΔ mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

In these reporters, FLuc was produced by the canonical translation, and the RLuc was generated by the IRES-mediated translation. Tethering Trim71 to either of these two reporter mRNAs led to a decrease of both FLuc and RLuc activities, while no changes in mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). This result indicated that Trim71 either interferes with 40S ribosomal subunit recruitment or inhibits an event at or after the 60S subunit joining step during mRNA translation. Moreover, we found that Trim71-mediated translation repression does not require 3’ end poly(A) tail. When tethered to a FLuc mRNA that is devoid of both poly(A) tail and the poly(A) tail binding protein, Pabpc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), Trim71 also specifically represses the reporter mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>).

This regulation is critical for pluripotency in stem cells. Our findings raise several interesting aspects in stem cell biology and RNA biology.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ago2 and let-7 miRNAs</title><p>Previous studies indicate that overexpressing Ago2 in certain cells (e.g., 293T and NIH3T3) elevated global miRNA levels by stabilizing mature miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diederichs and Haber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Winter and Diederichs, 2011</xref>). Our results, however, indicate that elevated Ago2 specifically increased the let-7 miRNAs in mESCs at the post-transcriptional level. Although different cell types may contribute to these different results, an important variable is the Ago2 level. Transfection-based assays tend to result in high expression of exogenous genes. In our CLIPΔ mESCs or the WT mESCs with the dox-induced exogenous Ago2, however, the Ago2 level increased approximately twofold or maximally approximately fivefold, respectively, compared to that in the WT mESCs. This modest increase is biologically relevant because the Trim71-mediated repression of <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA translation only has an approximately twofold effect on the Ago2 level in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When this approximately twofold repression on Ago2 was specifically disrupted, the mESCs displayed let-7-miRNA-dependent defects in maintaining pluripotency (Figures 3 and 6). Thus, although previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diederichs and Haber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Winter and Diederichs, 2011</xref>) and ours all indicate that Ago2 is the limiting factor in forming the effector miRNPs, modulating Ago2 levels under biologically relevant settings is likely to result in changes of specific miRNAs, such as the let-7 miRNAs. Ago2 and let-7 miRNAs levels are frequently dysregulated in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ye et al., 2015</xref>). We speculate that modulating Ago2 levels may also regulate tumorigenesis by altering the activities of specific miRNAs (e.g., the tumor-suppressive let-7 miRNAs).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Two inter-connected layers of regulations on let-7 miRNAs in stem cells</title><p>Let-7 is a conserved pro-differentiation miRNA that is abundantly expressed in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Roush and Slack, 2008</xref>). In stem cells, although the genes encoding let-7 miRNAs are actively transcribed, the levels of mature let-7 miRNAs are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Suh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thomson et al., 2006</xref>), indicating post-transcriptional inhibition of let-7 miRNAs. Previous studies characterized that the conserved RBPs Lin28a and Lin28b inhibit let-7 miRNAs’ maturation at the pre- and pri-miRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tsialikas and Romer-Seibert, 2015</xref>). Here, we revealed an additional layer of regulation of let-7 miRNAs at the mature miRNA level by Ago2 availability.</p><p>Interestingly, these two layers of regulation on let-7 miRNAs are intertwined through Lin28a, a conserved let-7 target that promotes let-7 pre-miRNA degradation, in mESCs. When the let-7 miRNAs were elevated by the increased Ago2, in either the CLIPΔ mESCs or the WT with induced Ago2, there was a corresponding decrease of the endogenous Lin28a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, the decreased Lin28a resulted in a compromise in the degradation of let-7 pre-miRNAs, as indicated by twofold to threefold increase of let-7 pre-miRNAs in the CLIPΔ mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This compromise explains the significant increase of mature let-7 miRNAs upon a modest increase of Ago2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>): the initial increase of the let-7 miRNAs caused by the elevated Ago2 decreases Lin28a and alleviates Lin28a-mediated inhibition on the maturation of let-7 miRNAs, resulting in more let-7 pre-miRNAs become mature let-7 miRNAs. This positive regulatory loop amplifies let-7 miRNAs and makes the pro-differentiation let-7 miRNAs sensitive to Ago2 levels in stem cells.</p><p>The two inter-connected layers of inhibition on the potent pro-differentiation let-7 miRNAs are important to maintaining stemness. During self-renewal of mESCs, although genes encoding let-7 miRNAs are transcribed, the production of these potent pro-differentiation miRNAs is inhibited at both the pre-miRNA level by Lin28a and the mature miRNA level by Ago2. These two layers of regulation may work together to ensure low levels of let-7 miRNPs in stem cells. Considering that let-7 miRNAs are repressed in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Büssing et al., 2008</xref>), and Lin28a or Lin28b are highly expressed in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Piskounova et al., 2011</xref>), we speculate that the Ago2-mediated regulation of let-7 miRNPs may also be employed by cancer cells for their dysregulated proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Trim71 and Ago2</title><p>The Trim71-mediated downregulation of Ago2 occurs through repressing <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA translation in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), but not the proposed E3-ligase-mediated protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rybak et al., 2009</xref>). This result is consistent with previous observations that the potential E3 ligase activity is not required for Trim71-mediated gene regulation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Welte et al., 2019</xref>). In human cells, TRIM71 level negatively correlates with AGO2 level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we speculate that the Trim71-mediated repression of <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA translation is conserved between mouse and human. Although the Trim71-binding region in the 3’UTR of mouse <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA is not conserved in sequence, Trim71 recognizes its RNA targets via structural features but not sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Welte et al., 2019</xref>). Both human and mouse <italic>Ago2</italic> have long 3’UTRs (5.2 kb and 11.8 kb, respectively) with multiple in silico predicted hairpins that Trim71 can bind. However, our CLIP-seq data indicated that Trim71 only binds one such predicted hairpin in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), suggesting that either not all the predicted hairpins form in vivo or Trim71 uses additional features for target recognition. Trim71 can both repress mRNA translation and induce mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aeschimann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loedige et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Welte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Worringer et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to determine what features determine whether Trim71 represses translation or destabilizes mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A new approach for functional characterization of RBPs</title><p>Trim71 is essential for animal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuevas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ecsedi and Grosshans, 2013</xref>). Previous studies, however, reported no stemness defects in Trim71 knockout mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitschka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Welte et al., 2019</xref>).

In contrast to these results, our study indicates that Trim71 plays a critical role in regulating pluripotency in mESCs through repressing <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA translation. How to reconcile these results?</p><p>The main difference is the number of disrupted Trim71:mRNA interactions. In the CLIPΔ mESCs, we specifically inhibited one: the Trim71:<italic>Ago2–</italic>mRNA interaction; while in Trim71 knockout/knockdown mESCs, hundreds of Trim71:mRNA interactions and potential Trim71-mediated protein–protein interactions are lost/attenuated. The phenotype of the Trim71 knockout mESCs is the functional additions of all the disrupted interactions. If Trim71’s target mRNAs contain both positive and negative regulators of pluripotency, knocking out Trim71 may result in no phenotypical changes. Interestingly, our Trim71 CLIP-seq indicated that besides <italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA, Trim71 also binds mRNAs encoding pluripotency factors, such as Nanog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, it is possible that in the Trim71 knockout mESCs, the defects caused by the increased Ago2 may be compensated by an increased Nanog from the lost Trim71:<italic>Nanog–</italic>mRNA interaction. Alternatively, Ago2 protein level does not change in the Trim71 knockout/knockdown mESCs due to combinatory results of the disrupted Trim71:<italic>Ago2</italic> mRNA interaction and secondary effects from other lost Trim71:mRNA interactions, leading to no stemness defects in the knockout mESCs. Thus, an important caveat in interpreting results from the knockout studies on RBPs is that no phenotypical changes does not necessarily mean that the target RBP is not functionally significant. Then, how to effectively characterize biological functions of RBPs?</p><p>Thanks to the wide applications of CLIP-based methods, many RBPs’ target RNAs and the binding regions in these RNAs are being well characterized. In addition to the loss-of-function methods, we believe specific inhibition of candidate RBP:mRNA interaction(s) via mutating/deleting binding sites on the target mRNA(s) will reveal more exciting roles of RBPs and significant RBP:mRNA interactions under many biological processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

To generate target gene knockout mESCs, 2 µg of pWH464 expressing a pair of sgRNAs target a coding region of the target gene was transfected into the mESCs. 24 hr post-transfection, top 10% GFP-positive cells were sorted into 96-well plates, with a single cell sorted into each well. After 7–14 days incubation, the correct mESC clones were screened and identified through genotyping PCR followed by western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Trim71 CLIP-seq</title><p>The Trim71 CLIP-seq was performed using the previously established HITS-CLIP protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnell, 2010</xref>) with the following modifications. The FLAG-Trim71 mESCs were cross-linked by 0.4J UV254nm. The cell lysate was treated by RNase1 (Ambion) at 40 U/ml for 5 min at 37°C, and then 250 U/ml SUPERaseIn RNase Inhibitor (Ambion) was added to the cell lysate to inactivate the RNase1. 100 µl anti-FLAG M2-coupled Dynabeads M-270 (Invitrogen, Cat# 14301) per 10 mg cell lysate was used for the FLAG-Trim71 IP. Then 2.5% Input and IP samples were resolved on a 4–12% NuPage gel followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. Trim71–RNA complexes and size-matched input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Van Nostrand et al., 2016</xref>) were cut off from the membrane and were subject to RNA isolation and library preparation. The CLIP-seq libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq4000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>For mRNA quantification, reverse transcription was performed on total RNA using random hexmers and Superscript2 reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). miRNA and pre-miRNA quantification was performed in accordance with the protocols described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wan et al., 2010</xref>) or using the Takara’s Mir-X miRNA quantification method. qPCR was performed using the SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Western blot</title><p>Cells were lysed in the RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 140 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktail). The cell lysate protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Cat# 23225). Equal amount of cell lysate from the samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 3% non-fat dry milk in the TBS-T buffer for 1 hr at room temperature and then incubated with the indicated primary antibody overnight at 4°C. After washing, the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied for 1 hr at room temperature. Then the membranes were washed three times in the TBS-T buffer. The signals on the membranes were generated by the Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad, Cat# 1705061), followed by X-ray film exposure. The exposed films were developed by an automatic Kodak film processor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Polysome analysis</title><p>Polysome analysis was performed using the protocol described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).

The dish was placed on a horizontal rotator with a rotating speed of 30 rpm in a tissue culture incubator with temperature at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The medium was changed every other day, and the resulting EBs were harvested at the indicated time points. For monolayer differentiation, two million mESCs were cultured in 10 ml differentiation medium on a gelatinized 9 cm tissue culture dish. The dish was placed in a tissue culture incubator with temperature at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The resultant cells were harvested at the indicated time points.</p><p>Cell Proliferation Assay mESCs were plated in gelatin coated 24-well plates at 20,000 cells per well, and their proliferation was assessed every day for 3 days using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Cat# G3582). The measurement was performed in accordance with the protocol provided by the kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA-seq and small-RNA-seq analysis</title><p>The reads from RNA-seq and small-RNA-seq were mapped to the mm10 genome by using HISAT2 (v2.1.0). The mapping results were converted into bam format by using SAMtools. The read count for the longest transcript of each gene was calculated by using HTSeq (v0.11.2) and was then converted into TPM value. The genes with TPM ≥ 1 in RNA-seq and miRNAs with TPM ≥ 100 in small-RNA-seq were kept for further analysis. The Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Models with Quasi-Likelihood Tests function in EdgeR was used for differential expression analysis. The p-value cut off for differential expressed miRNAs was set to 0.05. The targets of non-differential expressed miRNAs are obtained from the 'predicted conserved targets' table v7.2 generated by the TargetScan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agarwal et al., 2015</xref>). Mann–Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the probability that the microRNA targets and non-microRNA targets have the same distribution of fold change in expression level between wild type and KO data sets. The scatter plot and the cumulative plots were generated by using python package matplotlib. The correlation matrix of miRNA data sets was visualized by using the R package corrplot and psych.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>CLIP-seq peak calling</title><p>The CLIP-seq reads were quality-checked by using FastQC. The reads from rRNA, tRNA, and mitochondrial DNA sequences were removed from data sets by using Bowtie. The resulting reads were mapped to the mm10 genome by using STAR (v2.5.0) with the parameters suggested in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Van Nostrand et al., 2016</xref>). CLIPper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lovci et al., 2013</xref>) was used to call peaks for the two replicates over the input control data sets. The complement set of peak calling results was kept as the background for the motif study. The peaks were annotated to the mm10 RefSeq mRNAs by bed2annotation tool in the CTK package. To determine secondary structure motifs in the CLIP-seq peak regions, each peak was extended from the peak center to a 50 nt binding bins. The background regions are divided into bins of 50 nt. The RNA sequences of both the binding and non-binding bins were obtained by using the getfasta function in the BEDtools with the parameter ‘-s’. RNAfold (2.1.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>) was used to predict the minimum free energy (MFE) secondary structures for both binding and non-binding bins. The enrichment of each 11-mer secondary structure substring was calculated from the dot-bracket encoded MFE secondary structures of both binding and non-binding bins. The 11-mer secondary structure substrings with counts &lt;10 or do not contain any hairpin loop were discarded. The secondary structure motif logo was generated from the secondary structure substrings with enrichment ≥ 1 by using WebLogo (v3.6.0).</p><p>The CLIP-seq, RNA-seq, and small-RNA-seq data sets generated during this study are available at GEO: GSE138284.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

However, it seems that considerable effort including additional experiments will be required to firm up the conclusions and make the paper suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.

The work is based on previous studies, predominantly in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In essence, the authors assert that Trim71 maintains pluripotency by repressing the translation of the Ago2 transcript, thereby impairing the activity of miRNAs, with repression of the let-7 family playing a key role in maintaining stemness. The key tool developed here is a FLAG-tagged Trim71, which is used to reveal the binding preferences for Trim71 (using CLIP-seq). The experiments are logical and solid, although it needs to be acknowledged that there is relatively little data, and no pivotal experiments that strongly support the model. The manuscript is well-written, and potentially suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, although the concerns raised below should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) As cited in the manuscript, previous publications describe different mechanisms by which Trim71 functions. The current manuscript implies a different mechanism, but much of the data is correlative – key experiments that robustly support the authors model are, largely, lacking. The work would be significantly more impactful if additional data could be added to support the model presented. Many, many such experiments are possible. For example, what would happen if Ago1, 3 or 4 were increased (akin to the experiments in which the authors manipulate Ago2); how does Trim71 control translation (no data is provided for this point)? Additional experiments are suggested below.</p><p>2) The authors suggest that the number of Trim71 binding sequences govern whether translation of stability of the transcript is controlled – is there precedence for this model?

Similarly, what happens when Trim71 is tethered to other transcripts?</p><p>5) Why does inhibition of Ago2 via Trim71 inhibit specifically the let-7 family? The authors provide data that suggests specificity, but they perform no experiments to define the mechanism. Given that previous publications assert mechanisms for Trim71 that are markedly different than that proposed here, it is appropriate for Liu et al. to provide data supporting a key aspect of their model.</p><p>6) A key part of the work relies upon showing that pri-let-7 transcripts are not changed in response to the Trim71 family. Similarly, the authors should investigate whether pre-let-7 transcripts are changing. The authors' model predicts that pre-let-7 will remain unchanged – confirming this would significantly strengthen the model. This experiment is important, as multiple other papers (cited in this manuscript) propose alternative mechanisms for Trim71 function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Liu et al., studied the mechanism by which Trim71 inhibits let-7 miRNA levels. Using CLIP, the authors identified genome-wide binding patterns of Trim71 in murine ESCs, and identified a binding peak in Ago2 3'UTR. Although knocking out Trim71 did not affect Ago2 protein level, the authors proposed that Trim71 inhibits Ago2 translation based on several pieces of evidence, including mutant ESCs (deltaCLIP) with deletion of the Trim71 binding region in Ago2 3'UTR, as well as polysome fractionation experiments. In the δ-CLIP mutant ESCs, Ago2 protein levels were increased by 2 fold. This 2 fold increase of Ago2 was associated with a preferential increase in let-7 miRNAs over other miRNAs, and the causality of this effect was demonstrated by ectopic expression of Ago2 in mESCs. The authors further demonstrated that the δ CLIP clones had reduced self-renewal and enhanced potential to differentiate, which were dependent on Ago2 on let-7.</p><p>Although the effect of Trim71 on ESC biology and the regulation of Trim71 by let-7 have been well reported before, the identification of specific regulation of Trim71 on Ago2, if proven solidly, is interesting. Additionally, a preferential regulation of let-7 by Ago2 levels is also interesting for the field. With these said, I do have some concerns about the data and have some suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) The deltaCLIP clones are critical reagents in this study, yet the genetics are not well described. According to Figure 2A and Figure 2B, there seems to be only one band amplifiable by PCR in each of the deltaCLIP clones, and there seems to be only one allele in each of the clones. This is somewhat surprising given the use of CRISPR in generating such clones. One possibility is that there are identical deletions on the two copies of Ago2 gene. The second possibility is that one of the Ago2 alleles harbors a much larger deletion that evades detection by PCR and subsequent sequencing. So proving the genetics of the clones is critical for data interpretation.</p><p>2) The effect of preferential let-7 accumulation in the presence of increased Ago2 is not easily expected, given that there are multiple Ago family proteins expressed in mESCs and that single KO of Ago2 does not cause any major phenotypes in mESCs. I wonder whether the mechanism could be due to Ago2 processing pre-let-7 in a Dicer independent manner. This possibility is also suggested by the fact that the majority of deregulated let-7 miRNAs are 5p-miRNAs (Figure 5A). This can be tested by examining let-7 vs other miRNAs in the dicerKO/deltaCLIP line. Additionally, expressing a slider activity dead Ago2 in Ago2KO/detaCLIP line can also give some clues.</p><p>3) The self-renewal assay was based on the number of AP+ colonies. This is a useful assay, but it does not exclude the possibility of colony size being different. I suggest the authors also run a competition assay-for example, labeling the deltaCLIP clone with a fluorescent protein, and then mix it with the WT clone in 1:1 ratio, and then follow the ratio with FACS each time the cells are passaged.</p><p>4) Figure 7F is an important figure to show the direct involvement of let-7 in deltaCLIP clones. However, with control LNA, the colony in deltaCLIP is about 25% of WT control, yet in most other figures, e.g Figure 4A, Figure 7C, the difference is only about 50%. Could the authors comment on whether this is due to side effects of LNA, and how reproducible the data in Figure 7F are?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study by Liu et al., is intriguing and is likely to be controversial, given its argument for Ago2 as an important regulatory target of Trim71 in contrast to other published work in the field. Despite this potential controversy, the study provides multiple lines of convincing evidence and experimental paradigms to support their assertions, including a multitude of loss- and gain-of-function studies. The Trim71-let7 axis is a fascinating molecular pathway that is conserved across phylogeny, yet its cellular and molecular functions and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, especially in mammals. The study represents an impressive amount of work that should stimulate much-needed discussion in the field and pave the way for future lines of investigation to better understand how this evolutionarily conserved microRNA pathway controls organogenesis and development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66288.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Specifically, we chose to increase Ago1 level, because in mESCs Ago1 and Ago2 are expressed, while Ago3 and Ago4 are not (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). We found that similar to the results of Ago2 (Figure 5), when Ago1 was induced, there was a specific post-transcriptional increase of mature let-7 miRNAs (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E). The result further supports that the Ago proteins are the limiting factors in let-7 miRNPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors suggest that the number of Trim71 binding sequences govern whether translation of stability of the transcript is controlled – is there precedence for this model? How do the authors envision this working?</p></disp-quote><p>We proposed this model to reconcile our finding that Trim71 represses Ago2 mRNA translation with the previous results that Trim71 promotes mRNA degradation. Since mRNA translation and mRNA degradation are highly intertwined with each other, we speculated that maybe the number of Trim71-binding sites determine whether Trim71 represses translation or destabilizes mRNA. We realized that this model is highly speculative. Thus, in the revised manuscript, we deleted this speculation and revised the Discussion section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be useful to add a simple experiment showing that the mouse Ago2 transcript is also subject to translational regulation by Trim71.</p></disp-quote><p>In the manuscript, we used multiple lines of evidence to show that mouse Ago2 mRNA is translationally repressed by Trim71 in mESCs:</p><p>a) when Trim71-binding site was disrupted in the 3’UTR of Ago2 mRNA, Ago2 level increased ~2-fold, while mRNA level was not altered (Figure 2A-C).</p><p>b) Ago2 mRNA showed increased polysome association in the CLIPD mESCs (Figure 2D,E).</p><p>c) Overexpression of Trim71 did not change Ago2 mRNA level, but decreased Ago2 protein level and Ago2 mRNA association with polysomes (Figure 2G,H).</p><p>d) Using the new results from the tethering experiment (Figure 7), we also found that Trim71 represses mRNA translation whether tethered to a reporter mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A rescue experiment in which Trim71 is tethered to the mutant Ago2 transcript could provide some convincing additional support for the model.

Specifically, we used tethering assays to show that when tethered to a reporter mRNA, Trim71 can represses the translation (Figure 7). Mover, using IRES-containing bi-cistronic reporters, we took a step further by determining that Trim71 represses mRNA translation at post-initiation step(s) in mESCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why does inhibition of Ago2 via Trim71 inhibit specifically the let-7 family?

Using new data presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 2, we addressed this point. Specifically, we found that the increased let-7 miRNAs resulting from elevated Ago2 in mESCs are bound and stabilized by Ago2. Moreover, we added text (Results) explaining that the pro-differentiation let-7 miRNAs are unique in mESCs because although genes encoding let-7 miRNAs are actively transcribed, the let-7 miRNAs levels are low, indicating post-transcriptional regulations of let-7 miRNAs. Previous studies characterized one such regulation at the pre-miRNA processing level mediated by Lin28a.

In the revised manuscript, we analyzed the let-7 pre-miRNAs levels in the CLIPΔ mESCs (Figure 4C). We found that although pre-let-7 miRNAs were elevated in the CLIPD mESCs (Figure 4C), the 2-3-fold increase of let-7 pre-miRNAs was not at the same magnitude as the increased mature let-7 miRNAs (Figure 4C versus Figure 4B). This modest increase of let-7 pre-miRNA is consistent with the observation that Lin28a, a conserved let-7 miRNA target that promotes let-7 pre-miRNA degradation, decreased ~2 fold in the CLIPΔ mESCs (Figure 4D). This finding also revealed the regulations on mature let-7 miRNAs is tightly intertwined: as Ago2 level elevation results in an increase of mature let-7, which leads to downregulation of Lin28a, a let-7 target that promotes degradation of let-7 pre-miRNAs. This downregulation of Lin28a further reinforces let-7 expression. In addition to adding the new results on let-7 pre-miRNA levels, we also revised the Discussion section on the tightly intertwined regulation of let-7 miRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Liu et al., studied the mechanism by which Trim71 inhibits let-7 miRNA levels.

Thus, we measured the let-7 pre-miRNAs in the CLIPΔ mESCs, where Ago2 level was elevated ~2-fold. We found that the pre-let-7 miRNAs were also in the CLIPD mESCs (Figure 4C), although the increased fold was not as high as those of mature let-7 miRNAs.

In the colony formation assay, all the cells in one colony are from a single parental mESC. By examining whether all these progeny cells in the colony maintains the same feature or not (e,g, whether all of them are AP+ or not), we can determine whether stemness/self-renewal is maintained during division.</p><p>In our colony formation assay, we didn’t notice any colony size difference between the</p><p>WT and the CLIPD mESCs.

However, with control LNA, the colony in deltaCLIP is about 25% of WT control, yet in most other figures, e.g Figure 4A, Figure 7C, the difference is only about 50%. Could the authors comment on whether this is due to side effects of LNA, and how reproducible the data in Figure 7F are?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this. This difference is due to the potential side effects of LNA and/or transfecting reagents. Also, we are confident about the results. Because we actually did the transfection experiments at two different dosage of LNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, at low LNA dosage (100nM), the anti-let-7 LNA can increase the stemness from ~5% to ~10% (AP+ colonies); while at the high dosage (500nM), the anti-let-7 LNA can further increase the stemness to ~15% (AP+ colonies). Importantly, the control LNA showed no difference between the low dosage and the high dosage. Since the transfection can never be 100%, the dosage dependent effect strongly argues that the stemness defects in the CLIPD mESCs are dependent on the let-7 miRNAs. In the manuscript, due to space limitations, we only showed the results from the high dosage of LNA transfection.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66288-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
