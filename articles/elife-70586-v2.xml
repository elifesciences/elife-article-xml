Highly processed sensory information underlying experiences are encoded in the dentate gyrus (DG) ‒ CA3 circuit as distinct or updated representations of prior experiences and subsequently, routed out of CA1 to prefrontal cortical sites such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for consolidation. Following learning, prefrontal cortical neuronal ensembles are thought to undergo time-dependent refinement and re-organization as memories transition from recent to remote configurations and become more generalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeNardo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frankland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maviel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wiltgen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Winocur et al., 2010</xref>). The hippocampus is theorized to play a continuous, potentially instructive role in transformation of memories from conjunctive, context-rich representations to semantic, gist-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goode et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Teyler and DiScenna, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tonegawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Winocur et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Winocur et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, a growing body of experimental evidence not only supports a sustained role for the hippocampus in remote memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goshen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vetere et al., 2021</xref>) but also in dictating the extent to which remote memories retain contextual details of the original experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koolschijn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Investigations into neural circuit mechanisms mediating memory consolidation has identified key roles for principal cells and inhibitory neurons in mediating hippocampal-cortical communication. Specifically, genetic silencing of engram-bearing dentate granule neurons post training was shown to impair the maturation of context-specific neuronal ensembles in prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>). Chronic genetic inhibition of CA3 outputs impaired high-frequency network oscillations such as sharp-wave ripples, experience-related firing patterns in CA1 and long-term contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakashiba et al., 2009</xref>). Parvalbumin inhibitory neurons (PV INs) in CA1 are the most extensively studied with regard to their roles in memory consolidation. CA1 PV INs have been shown to orchestrate synchronous activation of principal neurons, promote sharp-wave ripples (SWR), and facilitate hippocampal-cortical communication through increased sharp-wave ripple ‒ spindle coupling in CA1 ‒ ACC networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Çaliskan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ognjanovski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xia et al., 2017</xref>). Chemogenetic inhibition of PV INs in CA1 or in ACC following training inhibited consolidation of contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ognjanovski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xia et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these observations begin to highlight the contribution of principal neurons and INs in CA1 and ACC in memory consolidation. However, we know significantly much less about the contributions of principal neurons ‒ IN circuits in DG ‒ CA3, let alone how PV INs in CA3 govern the evolution of neuronal ensembles in downstream CA1 ‒ ACC networks over time.</p><p>Dentate granule cell recruitment of feed-forward inhibition (FFI) onto CA3 is temporarily enhanced following learning and is one inhibitory circuit mechanism linked to memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruediger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruediger et al., 2011</xref>). In previous work, we found that viral mediated selective enhancement of dentate granule cell recruitment of PV INs in CA3 increased inhibition onto CA3 and enhanced strength and precision of remote memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Using genetic ensemble-tagging approaches and immediate-early gene expression, we found that increasing FFI in DG ‒ CA3 conferred context-specific reactivation of neuronal ensembles in hippocampal ‒ ACC ‒ basolateral amygdala networks at remote timepoints. Furthermore, we found that maintenance of engram-bearing cell connectivity with PV INs prevented the time-dependent decay of the hippocampal engram thereby suggesting a link between maintenance of the hippocampal memory trace and remote memory precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). As with new findings, we were motivated to investigate how FFI in DG ‒ CA3 impacts ongoing neuronal activity, maintenance and specificity of neuronal ensembles in hippocampal-cortical networks during memory consolidation. In this study, we sought to address this goal by combining viral genetics to selectively enhance FFI in DG ‒ CA3 and longitudinal <italic>in vivo</italic> 1 photon calcium imaging and <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology to record ensemble properties in CA1 and ACC over time. We found that enhancing FFI facilitates the formation and maintenance of context-associated neuronal ensembles in CA1. Stable and precise CA1 ensembles, in turn, promoted acquisition of context-specific neuronal ensembles in ACC at remote timepoint and enhanced long-term contextual fear memory. Furthermore, using simultaneous LFP recordings we found enhanced ripple-spindle coupling thus demonstrating a direct role for DG ‒ CA3 FFI in enhancing hippocampal-cortical communication. Our findings illuminate how FFI in DG ‒ CA3 dictates evolution of ensemble properties in CA1 and ACC during memory consolidation and suggest a teacher-like function for hippocampal CA1 in stabilization and re-organization of cortical representations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Viral enhancement of FFI in DG ‒ CA3 increases PV IN perisomatic contacts onto CA3 principal neurons</title><p>To begin to understand how FFI in DG ‒ CA3 contributes to evolution of ensemble properties during memory consolidation, we leveraged our recent discovery of a learning-regulated molecular brake of dentate granule cell connectivity with stratum lucidum PV INs in CA3. Viral downregulation of the cytoskeletal protein, Ablim3, in the DG (using validated shRNA vs. non-target scrambled NT) resulted in increased dentate granule cell mossy fiber contacts with PV INs and an increase in PV IN puncta or contacts with CA3. Consistently, <italic>ex vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings showed that these anatomical changes in FFI connectivity resulted in increased feed-forward inhibition onto CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>) (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We injected mice with lenti-shNT or lenti-shRNA in the DG and quantified PV puncta, an anatomical marker for PV-mediated inhibition, in CA3, CA1 and ACC 2 weeks past injection. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>), we found an increase in PV puncta in CA3 in shRNA injected mice [Two-tailed Mann-Whitney: p = 0.029, n = 4]. Consistent with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soltesz and Losonczy, 2018</xref>), we found a significantly higher number of PV puncta in the deeper layer of CA1 compared to the superficial layer [Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, layer x virus effect: N.S.: main virus effect N.S., main layer effect p &lt; 0.0001, n = 4]. Our manipulation did not affect PV puncta in CA1 or ACC [ACC: Two-tailed Mann-Whitney test: N.S., n = 4] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that our viral manipulation increases FFI onto CA3 without affecting PV IN ‒ principal neuron anatomical contacts in CA1 or ACC.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Anatomical characterization of PV IN contacts and <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging platform for recording neural activity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Simplified wiring diagram of hippocampal-cortical circuits supporting memory consolidation.

Dentate granule cell (DGC) projections (Mossy fibers, MF) synapse onto pyramidal neurons in CA3 and also release glutamate directly onto stratum lucidum PV-positive interneurons (PV INs, red) through filopodia that emanate from mossy fiber terminals (MFTs, gray). Injection of lenti-shRNA into dentate gyrus (DG) increased MFT filopodia onto PV INs. In response to increased DGC excitatory drive PV INs elaborate inhibitory synaptic contacts in CA3 and feed-forward inhibition onto CA3 neurons (feed-forward inhibition, FFI). Pyramidal neurons in CA3 project to CA1 that sends projections to multiple brain regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).

Behavioral analysis of freezing levels revealed that both groups of mice responded similarly to foot-shocks in the training context A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref>). Consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jimenez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pan et al., 2020</xref>), our recordings of calcium transients during contextual fear conditioning revealed a subset of neurons in both CA1 and ACC that exhibited significant elevation in activity in response to foot-shocks (Foot-shock responsive neurons or FSR neurons) in both groups of mice [Two-tailed paired t-test, ACC shNT preFS vs postFS: p = 0.004, n = 5, ACC shRNA preFS vs postFS: p = 0.013, n = 5, CA1 shNT preFS vs postFS: p = 0.007, n = 5, CA1 shRNA preFS vs postFS: p = 0.024, n = 5](<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, d and e</xref>). However, the fraction of FSR neurons in ACC was significantly increased in the shRNA group compared to shNT group [Two-tailed unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction, p = 0.043, n = 5] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Further analysis of FSR neurons revealed that the increase in FSR neuron activity in CA1 and ACC was accompanied by an increase in co-activity of these neurons i.e. increase in number of FSR correlated pairs [Two-tailed paired t-test, ACC shNT: p = 0.021, n = 5, ACC shRNA: N.S., n = 5, CA1 shNT: p = 0.021, n = 5, CA1 shRNA: p = 0.001, n = 5] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g–h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Note, this was not seen in ACC for shRNA group presumably because of high activity levels prior to foot-shocks. Shuffled data indicate that the increase in correlated pairs was mostly due to increased number of calcium events upon foot-shock.

This differential contribution of dorsal and ventral hippocampal FSR neurons to context-associated ensembles may reflect output connectivity (basolateral amygdala vs. other downstream circuits) and distinct roles of dorsal and ventral hippocampus in encoding spatial and non-spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chockanathan and Padmanabhan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strange et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our data demonstrate that increased FFI in DG ‒ CA3 promotes neuronal ensembles in both CA1 and ACC. Following contextual fear learning, we observed emergence of training context-associated ensembles in CA1 in both groups of mice but only mice with increased FFI in DG ‒ CA3 exhibited a learning-induced ensemble associated with the training context in the ACC. Analysis of neuronal ensembles during remote recall demonstrated that increasing FFI in DG ‒ CA3 prevented the decay of training context associated ensemble and promoted the emergence of a neutral context associated ensemble in CA1.</p><p>It is thought that the DG ‒ CA3 ‒ CA1 ‒ ACC network undergoes changes in synaptic weights following learning that likely result in inter-regional ensembles. During memory consolidation, those neuronal representations are reorganized and strengthened potentially through re-activation during sharp-wave ripples and transferred to cortical regions by coupling between ripples and cortical spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng and Frank, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hwaun and Colgin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Makino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xia et al., 2017</xref>). Our manipulation is restricted to the DG ‒ CA3 circuit and thus strongly implicates FFI in DG ‒ CA3 in formation and maintenance of CA1 and ACC ensembles. Previous work showed that increasing FFI in DG ‒ CA3 decreases overlap between two context-associated ensembles in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). We predict that increasing granule cell recruitment of perisomatic inhibition onto CA3 neurons imposes a sparser activity regimen from DG to CA3 thereby reducing the likelihood of recruitment of the same CA3 neurons to distinct ensembles during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Csicsvari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de la Prida et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gómez-Ocádiz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mori et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neubrandt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Torborg et al., 2010</xref>). In turn, assemblies of CA3 neurons encoding different contexts entrain activity of downstream ensembles of CA1 principal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Csicsvari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de la Prida et al., 2006</xref>). Distinct ensembles in CA1 recruit local PV INs to synchronize their activity and form SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Csicsvari and Dupret, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malerba et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ognjanovski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stark et al., 2014</xref>). CA3 neurons that encode novel spatial information were shown to be more likely active during SWR in CA1 suggesting that interregional maps may be strengthened during consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hwaun and Colgin, 2019</xref>). PV INs have been implicated to regulate fidelity of spike transfer (i.e. in form of coordinated spiking or burst firing of excitatory neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lamsa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mori et al., 2007</xref>). Increased FFI inhibition may thus not only enhance sparseness but facilitate activation of CA3 ensembles resulting in improved memory consolidation in the DG ‒ CA3 ‒ CA1 circuit. Consequently, these changes in network properties of DG ‒ CA3 ‒ CA1 facilitate transfer of information to ACC via SWR ‒ spindle coupling for memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xia et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings of enhanced SWR ‒ spindle coupling in mice with increased FFI in DG ‒ CA3 provide direct evidence for such facilitated information transfer across the CA1 ‒ ACC network.</p><p>Importantly, feedforward inhibition in DG ‒ CA3 synapses is naturally enhanced for several hours following learning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruediger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). By leveraging a molecular tool to enhance FFI prior to learning, we were able to reconfigure DG ‒ CA3 circuitry in a learning permissive state. This is perhaps why behaviorally naïve mice with increased FFI in DG ‒ CA3 exhibit increased ripple-spindle coupling prior to learning.</p><p>Increasing FFI in DG ‒ CA3 also enhanced specificity of context-associated ensembles in CA1 and ACC. Previous studies demonstrated that subsets of neurons are shared across ensembles when mice experience two distinct environments proximal in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rubin et al., 2015</xref>). We found a reduction in the number of neurons active in both contexts (A&amp;C neurons) in ACC and a smaller proportion of A&amp;C neurons within context-associated neuronal ensembles in CA1 at remote recall. These A&amp;C neurons may function as “schema” neurons in that they represent shared features (statistical regularities) across ensembles and facilitate the formation of new context-associated ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKenzie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tse et al., 2007</xref>). Increased neuronal excitability has been shown to bias recruitment of neurons into ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Higher activity of A&amp;C neurons (observed upon exposure to context C) may bias their allocation into the ensemble associated with the new context while maintaining context-specific activity through synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gava et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, we can train a decoder on activity of A&amp;C neurons to predict context. The decoder accuracy positively correlated with the mice’ ability to discriminate contexts which indicates that these neurons are behaviorally relevant. Computational modeling has suggested that CA1 balances abstraction of statistical regularities across memories mediated by the temporoammonic pathway (EC → CA1) with encoding of detail-rich distinct contextual representations conveyed through the trisynaptic EC → DG → CA3 → CA1 circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schapiro et al., 2017</xref>). Our data supports this model since we observe a reduction in neurons encoding overlapping features (A&amp;C neurons) in CA1 (this study) when we increase FFI in DG ‒ CA3 and reduce interference between context associated ensembles in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allegra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koolschijn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leutgeb et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, our manipulation biases the trade-off in CA1 towards generation of context-specific ensembles in CA1 over generation of schema. While shifting this balance in healthy animals may come at a cost, reversing reductions in FFI in DG ‒ CA3 found during aging or Alzheimer’s disease may represent a strategy to restore memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Viana da Silva et al., 2019</xref>, Twarkowski and Sahay unpublished observations).</p><p>Our data builds on foundational theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Teyler and DiScenna, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Winocur et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Winocur et al., 2007</xref>) to suggest a continuous role for CA1 in playing an instructive teacher-like role in governing re-organization of ensembles in ACC during memory consolidation. During memory consolidation, conjunctive representations are thought to be transformed into more schema like or gist-like structures necessary for cognitive flexibility and new learning. However, the extent to which memories retain details may be determined by the hippocampus. Increasing FFI in DG ‒ CA3 appears to facilitate re-organization of ensembles in ACC and decrease the number of A&amp;C neurons (potentially, schema neurons) at the remote timepoint. Although in this study’s experimental design, our behavioral analysis did not capture time-dependent generalization of the contextual fear memory, mice with increased FFI in DG ‒ CA3 exhibited significantly greater long-term memory than controls. We infer from our data that stabilization of training-context associated ensembles in CA1 over time governs a toggle switch in the ACC that determines the extent to which memories may retain details over time. Such an interpretation is consistent with hippocampal indexing theory in that the maintenance of the hippocampal index for an experience permits access to details of the original experience stored in distributed neocortical sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besnard and Sahay, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goode et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koolschijn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Teyler and DiScenna, 1986</xref>).</p><p>A major challenge in neuroscience is to assign functional significance to circuit motifs in wiring diagrams. Here, we build on our past work to demonstrate how the identification of learning-induced molecular regulators of connectivity may illuminate the relationship between a DGC ‒ PV IN ‒ CA3 circuit motif with emergent network properties during memory consolidation. The discovery of other molecular specifiers of principal neuron-inhibitory neuron connectivity in combination with a ‘bottom-up synapse to systems approach’ as conveyed here is likely to generate new fundamental insights into the physiological relevance of distinct hippocampal inhibitory circuit motifs in memory processing. It is plausible that connectivity re-engineering strategies such as that described in this study harbor potential to enhance memory consolidation in aging and in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McAvoy and Sahay, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care</title><p>All mice were group housed in a 12 hr (7 am to 7 pm) light/dark cycle at room temperature with ad libitum access to food and water.

Mice that underwent calcium imaging in CA1, received first the GCaMP6f injection in CA1 and 3 days later the angled lenti-virus injection into the DG.

Once the cortex was removed and possible bleeding stopped with gelfoam (Pfizer), the lens was attached to a custom-made lens holder and slowly lowered into the craniotomy. Coordinates for the lens were referenced to bregma. For ACC, no aspiration was performed.

The microscope was lifted towards the best possible visualization of vasculature and putative neurons (approx. 200–250 µm above the focus of the lens surface). Before applying the dental cement, the microscope was raised another 50 µm.

The compacity threshold was empirically determined at 35. While CNMF-E includes a criteria to restrict overlap of neurons, we still found a small set of highly overlapping neurons in our extractions. To avoid a time-costly re-iteration of CNMF-E, we included this part of the CNMF-E approach into our pipeline. We identified candidate pairs with close proximity using an empirically tested threshold of 36 pixels between the center of each neuron.

The area of neurons and the overlap area were calculated using the <italic>polyshape</italic> function. If neurons overlapped more than 50%, the neuron with lower PNR was removed.</p><p>To remove noisy calcium events, we used a 2-step approach. First, we extracted the timestamp of possible calcium events (event-candidates) using the <italic>findpeak</italic> function on the raw fluorescence traces and the denoised traces from CNMF-E (neuron.C_raw, neuron.C). A peak was defined by an amplitude of at least 3 SD from baseline noise, a minimum distance between two peaks of 15 frames (1.5 second) and a minimum duration of 3 frames (300ms). We further extracted 8 features of the event-candidates from both the raw and denoised fluorescence traces based on the <italic>findpeak</italic> function: Peak-to-noise ratio (PNR), Width-to-Height ratio, Peak prominence, Pearson correlation between peaks in the raw and denoised traces, and local PNR of the event candidate in the raw trace. For the local PNR, we calculated the standard deviation of the baseline in the vicinity of the peak rather than the overall recording baseline. We performed a PCA (<italic>pca</italic> function) on those eight parameters for dimension reduction to extract the components of these parameters that could be best used for classification. To reliable identify and remove calcium events that we considered noisy, we then trained a quadratic Bayesian classifier (<italic>fitcdiscr</italic>) on manually classified calcium peaks. After removing noise calcium events, neurons with low activity were removed using a linear classifier<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where N<sub>peaks</sub> is the neuron’s number of calcium events within one calcium recording and H<sub>max</sub> the relative height of the maximal calcium peak. We updated the CNMF-E output (neuron.A, neuron.C and neuron.C raw) to remove all neurons indicated by our pipeline and generated a file with calcium event times (sparse time series) for each neuron matching CNMF-E indexes. The updated data set was used for all further analysis presented in the figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Correlated pairs</title><p>We calculated the correlation of calcium events between neurons using the xcorr function on time series data. We added a 200 ms frame around the calcium event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>). We generated a distribution of correlation using temporally shuffled calcium event timeseries and calculated a threshold (mean + 2 SD) based on this distribution. Correlated pairs were defined as pairs with a correlation above this threshold. For analysis of foot-shock induced changes in cross-correlated pairs, we only included 30 s extracts of the preFS and postFS time series data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To compare numbers of correlated pairs across sessions (e.g. between context A and context C), we normalized the number of correlated pairs to the number of correlated pairs found in the same day baseline (CC<sub>pairs ctx A</sub> / CC<sub>pairs baseline</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>FSR neurons</title><p>To identify FSR neurons, we z-scored the calcium activity (calcium events) of each neuron to its time-binned (5 s) activity (calcium events) prior to the foot-shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pan et al., 2020</xref>). Neurons that increased their activity above 2SD during or after any foot-shock were classified as FSR neurons. To further quantify the foot-shock response we used 30 s timebin before and after the foot-shock (preFS vs postFS) and calculated the normalized activity before and after each foot-shock. We use the average of all three foot-shocks (preFS vs postFS) to quantify the overall effect of foot-shock training on those cells, which is why the average postFS response can be smaller than the initial threshold of 2SD [threshold to qualify as FSR]. To test for re-activated FSR within the population of correlated neurons during recall, we used the following criteria (1) the cell is matched across 2 days that is the cell was active during training and day one recall (in at least one context), (2) it was identified as FSR cell during training, (3) it is correlated with another cell during recall. This is independent of the correlated partner (other cell in pair does not have to fulfill these criteria).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Identification of A&amp;C neurons</title><p>We used CellReg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheintuch et al., 2017</xref>) to register neurons across different sessions (contexts and days). Spatial maps of neuronal contours were extracted by reshaping the spatial CNMF-E output (neuron.A) and down sampled 4 x for faster processing. We used two different approaches to calculate a threshold for same neurons and different neurons, one is the probabilistic approach based on the distribution of our data and the other is a fixed threshold (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheintuch et al., 2017</xref> for details). For all our recordings, spatial correlation was more reliable than centroid distance. We experienced that sessions with larger inter-session intervals (i.e. day 1 and day 16) were less accurate registered using the probabilistic approach than sessions that occurred closely in time. Therefore, we used the probabilistic approach only on sessions that were maximally 24 hr apart (training day and day 1; day 10; day16, data in main figures). To ensure that our findings were not driven by the cell registration approach, we also registered neurons using a fixed spatial correlation threshold of 0.85 as that was the average threshold we obtained in the probabilistic approach. This further allowed us to register neurons across all sessions (training day to day 16) as shown in the figure supplements. A&amp;C neurons were defined as neurons that were active in both sessions (session A and session C) on the same day.</p><p>GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/HannahTwarkowski/DG_CA3_FFI_consolidation">https://github.com/HannahTwarkowski/DG_CA3_FFI_consolidation</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Twarkowski, 2021</xref> copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:4b97734fe0978e50ad52aaf05baf2dfbf5e5a2d6;origin=https://github.com/HannahTwarkowski/DG_CA3_FFI_consolidation;visit=swh:1:snp:fce3575645fd8aecd55f89baafda36848cc38869;anchor=swh:1:rev:f7353d1b9385cda731a943a2415da69875b5d05a">swh:1:rev:f7353d1b9385cda731a943a2415da69875b5d05a</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantification of A&amp;C neurons</title><p>The number of A&amp;C neurons was expressed as normalized jaccard similarity index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>)<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>∩</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>∪</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>with A = neurons in session A, C = neurons in session C. The jaccard similarity index describes the number of A&amp;C neurons relative to the total number of neurons active in A and C. The number of A&amp;C neurons however can be biased by the total number of neurons active during one session. Given that then pool of neurons that we record from is limited, recordings with larger number of neurons are stochastically more likely to contain A&amp;C neurons than recordings with smaller number of neurons. To correct for this bias, we generated a distribution of 1000 jaccard similarity indices by randomizing neuronal indexes while keeping the number of active neurons recorded per session. The jaccard index was then z-scored to that distribution. Furthermore, z-scored indices were normalized to their minimum and maximum to allow cross object comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Decoding context</title><p>We trained a support vector using the MATLAB statistics and machine learning toolbox. To avoid overfitting, we only included mice that had at least 50 A&amp;C neurons per day. Instead of withholding testing data, we used 10fold cross-validation to train and test our data. The decoder was based on time binned (5 s) calcium event time series with averaged events per time bin of A&amp;C neurons for both sessions. Thus, we obtained 72 vectors per context with the length of all A&amp;C neuron reflecting each neuron’s activity at a given time point. We used the decoder to test for differences between these vectors that could predict the context. For all mice, we generated 1000 shuffled data set of randomized calcium event time (maintaining the same number of total calcium events/neuron and neurons) to train the decoder and test prediction certainty. All randomized data sets resulted in chance level of prediction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Ripple and spindle detection</title><p>Analysis of LFP signals was performed offline using Matlab 2020b (Mathworks).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Liset Menendez de la Prida (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers unanimously found this manuscript on feedforward inhibition of the CA3-DG circuit and memory processing to be of interest to the neuroscience community. However, all reviewers noted serious concerns that dampened their enthusiasm for supporting publication of the current version at <italic>eLife</italic>. Reviewers felt that the current experimental results and analyses did not fully support the main claims made in the manuscript. If the authors can address the main concerns listed below, we would be willing to consider a revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>1) All three reviewers asked for substantial additional analyses and additional control groups for proper comparisons. Please see the detailed suggested analyses in the individual reviews below.</p><p>2) Additional data is needed to support the authors' conclusion that there is a direct relationship between the manipulation of DG-CA3 FFI and the network activity changes in CA1 and ACC, as well as the behavioral improvement.</p><p>We know addressing these two concerns requires a substantial amount of additional work so if you do not think you will be able to fully address these concerns, you may want to consider submitting this work elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. For all statistical tests, the degree of freedom and factor values should be reported.</p><p>2. There are some differences between ACC and CA1 groups in terms of the order of viral manipulations. Why? Useful to discuss whether and how this can influence results.</p><p>3. I found the last section of results and associated figure panels very useful to summarize results. However, I feel they would read better at Discussion. Importantly, for explanatory sketches in Figure 2i and 4c,d, the authors should note their correlation analyses only inform about the % of correlated pairs, not about connectivity strengths. Hence thin and thicker lines are not reflecting data. Also, in Figure 2i and 4c, the basal condition may better reflect data in 1g regarding more % of active neurons in CA1 shRNA</p><p>4. Is there any difference between center/periphery exploratory preferences between groups or any other potential confounding factor which could explain activity differences better than the experimental manipulations?</p><p>5. The authors should declare the number of foot-shock responding (FSR) cells in each analysis block and test whether there are differences between groups. For some analyses, the number of cells could be too small so that they may require some specific randomization tests to reinforce conclusion (e.g., randomly picking of similar small number of not-FSR cells).</p><p>6. The authors refer to ACC-CA1 correlations or CA1-ACC networks several times but this is not formally examined (ACC and CA1 imaging is independent therefore there are no formal cross-region comparisons in this paper).</p><p>7. The authors refer to effects of increased SWR-spindle coupling between CA1-ACC in Results section, which reads rather speculative.</p><p>8. Regarding conclusions and physiological relevance, the authors may need to discuss why enhanced feedforward inhibition at DG-CA3 synapses is not naturally established given the beneficial effect in context discrimination.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors claim that there is a significant increase in context A specific correlated pairs in CA1 when FFI was increased (Figure 3d, bottom panel), however this is not supported by the statistical data. Performing one-sample t-tests on each group is not statistically sound, and the authors report 0.055 as a seemingly significant effect (despite explicitly setting 0.05 as their α) and yet do not report p-values for other effects that seem close to significant by eye. This general approach does not seem valid. Furthermore, the broader interpretations of this paper (e.g. the teacher-like function of CA1) rely on this point being significant, so should be corrected to reflect that this is a trend rather than a statistically significant effect or additional experiments should be added to increase the power of the comparison.</p><p>2) Relatedly, there appears to be more variability in the shRNA group compared to what is seen in the controls, especially in measurements from CA1 (e.g. Figure 3d, 3k). Is it possible that this variability might be explained by variable levels of viral transfection? What steps were taken to ensure viral expression was comparable among all animals included in the experiments?</p><p>3) The claims that shRNA increases CA1 activity and correlated firing relative to ACC is not justified (Figure 1g,h). There is no rationale for this specific comparison and the entire rest of the paper compares the shNT and shRNA groups. There needs to be a strong rationale for this analysis or the comparisons should be between experimental groups, which the authors report as not significant for activity.</p><p>4) When comparing FSR cells, the increase in correlated pairs likely reflects higher activity since the cells are selected by having higher activity post-shock. The authors acknowledge this on p4: &quot;Shuffled data indicate that the increase in correlated pairs was mostly due to increased number of calcium events.&quot; Yet this acknowledgement is not considered when the authors draw interpretations from their data and no data is presented showing how activity levels influence the correlated pairs. Any conclusions based on correlated pairs need to clarify how activity levels contributed to the synchronized firing.</p><p>5) The lack of a non-shock control group makes it difficult to interpret how selecting for foot shock responsive cells is influencing the data. Perhaps the authors could use baseline data to do a similar analysis to see how much selection bias is driving the findings of Figure 2.</p><p>6) It is unclear why calculations of correlated pairs are normalized to baseline in Figure 3, but not in Figure 2. In Figure 2, the primary finding that shRNA group increases the number of correlated pairs would seemingly go away if normalized to preFS levels (presumably similar to baseline). This variability makes it difficult to interpret the normalized values since there is clearly substantial variability in the baseline numbers. Perhaps reporting raw correlated pair numbers or adding new subjects would be more clear.</p><p>7) Figures 2i and 4c-d show schematics summarizing the data, but don't seem to represent the data related to correlation accurately. For example, in Figure 2h the authors show that there is an increase in the percentage of neuronal pairs that are co-active in CA1 in both the shNT and shRNA groups, and that this is increase in the number of co-active pairs is more extreme in the shRNA group (Supplementary Figure 1b). The schematic, however, implies that the strength of the correlation between co-active pairs is increased, which does not appear to have been tested.</p><p>8) Page 5 173 – &quot;Using CellReg (Sheintuch et al., 2017) to register neurons across sessions, we found no reactivation of FSR neurons among the correlated pairs of neurons identified in CA1 in the recall session [shNT: mean: 0.0 S.E.M. 0; shRNA: mean 0.0, S.E.M, 0] (data not shown).&quot; Does this mean that to reach this criterion both of the correlated cells would have to be matched across sessions and then again be correlated during recall? Please clarify this statement.</p><p>9) Figure 2f and 3n show pie charts without individual animal information. These are not very interpretable and should be replaced by graphs that showed animal by animal variability.</p><p>10) Page 5 – &quot;We controlled for the possible effect of locomotion on neuronal activity by quantifying the time mice moved in each context and found no correlation between the number of correlated neuronal pairs and the time mice moved in the respective context [Pearson's R2, ACC context A, 0.19, ACC context C: 0.00, CA1 context A: 0.09, CA1 context C: 0.04, n=5 mice per group] (Supplementary Figure 2a-d).&quot; Please add p-values as R2 values are a bit ambiguous.</p><p>11) The authors should consider that the increased activity in CA1 A&amp;C neurons in context C may be driven by locomotion rather than novelty (Figure 3f and Supplemental Figure 2d).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) To follow up on my comment 1), I think it would be useful to quantify the impact of the manipulation on CA3 activity in vivo. This can be done using electrophysiology or imaging. If this is beyond the scope of this study, an indirect read-out of CA3 activity could be obtained through a sharp wave ripple analysis in CA1, which would provide an independent indicator of how intrahippocampal information processing in vivo is changed by the manipulation.</p><p>2) It would be helpful to illustrate at the beginning of the paper how a calcium event is defined. For example, the data in figure 1g appear to show that the activity patterns in CA1 have been changed when increasing DG-CA3 FFI. The frequency is increased, but there is also an increase in &quot;double-peak transients&quot;. How exactly are these handled by the analysis? Along the same lines, it would be helpful to clarify the y axis label 'event rate [SD]'? The term rate implies frequency, but if I understand it correctly, the analysis mixes amplitude and frequency, correct? Including some raw data would, I think, help understand how the analysis impacts the findings of the paper.</p><p>3) The graphics in Figure 1i and Figure 4c are misleading. There is no indication in the data about the strength of the correlation; the data presented only show that the fraction of correlated FSR neuron pairs is increased after footshock, not that there is a change in the correlation strength. If I understand Figure 2h correctly, there seems to be roughly a doubling in the fraction of correlated pairs in all groups, except for the shNT/ACC group showing a 4-5 times increase in the fraction of correlated pairs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70586.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers unanimously found this manuscript on feedforward inhibition of the CA3-DG circuit and memory processing to be of interest to the neuroscience community.

Therefore, we separated the surgeries by 3 days to ensure proper infection that was comparable to mice in the ACC cohort. In addition, we used an angled injection into dDG to reduce impact on dCA1. Interestingly, the order used in our study (AAV first, then lenti virus) was found to be most efficient for high levels of expression of both AAV and lenti payloads. In line with animal welfare, we decided to maintain the original (two injections in one surgery) protocol for the ACC cohort. The difference in protocol could impact our data in regard to the duration of manipulation (lenti-virus) but we think this is highly unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Is there any difference between center/periphery exploratory preferences between groups or any other potential confounding factor which could explain activity differences better than the experimental manipulations?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that behavior is very complex and our readouts of freezing or movement only capture some aspects of it. However, we could not identify another factor that explained the differences better than our manipulation as evidenced in the lack of correlation between cross-correlated pairs and time moving (suppl Figure 2d). It might be interesting to look into neural activity as the mice explore center vs periphery and potentially resolve competing goals (avoidance vs approach etc), but our recording chambers are too small (context A: 18 x 18 cm, context C 18 cm diameter) to reliable distinguish subfields and the position of the mouse within those.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors should declare the number of foot-shock responding (FSR) cells in each analysis block and test whether there are differences between groups. For some analyses, the number of cells could be too small so that they may require some specific randomization tests to reinforce conclusion (e.g., randomly picking of similar small number of not-FSR cells).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this great suggestion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1h</xref>, the absolute number of FSR neurons did not differ between groups or brain regions. Once a neuron was identified as FSR, the neuronal activity of all 3 time blocks (around all 3 foot shocks) was included in the analysis hence the number of FSR is the same for all blocks.</p><p>We strongly agree with you that the small number of FSR neurons may require a different test to reinforce our conclusions and appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions how to address that. We performed two new analyses on our data.</p><p>First, as suggested here, we randomly picked the same number of neurons (FSR neurons) from the pool of non-FSR neurons (nFRS neurons) and repeated the same analysis regarding normalized event rate and correlated pairs on those non-FSR neurons. We found no increase in event rate or correlated pairs in any group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1i, j</xref>) but rather a reduction in event rate in CA1 (Two-tailed paired t-test, shNT p=0.034, n=5, shRNA p=0.033, n=5) and no change in ACC in the small subset of nFSR neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1i, j</xref>) (see Figure 2 e, h in manuscript for comparison).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

We acknowledge the weakness of this comparison, apologize for this misstep in our analysis and have accordingly, removed this dataset from our manuscript. Instead, we performed new experiments using in vivo electrophysiology to allow for cross-region comparison of LFPs in CA1 and ACC within the same animal. We removed data from Figure 1 e-i and added new, simultaneous electrophysiological LFP recordings (Figure 5 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 in revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

We found an increased number of CA1 ripples that are coupled with ACC spindles (“coupled ripples”) in shRNA mice compared to control mice prior to a learning event (Figure 5c, two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test with Welch’s correction, p=0.0499, n=5) with no difference in time spend in slow-wave sleep (SWS) (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1a) or total numbers of spindles or ripples (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1b-c). Control mice show a learning-dependent increase in coupled ripples (Figure 5f, two-tailed paired student’s t-test, p=0.019, n=5) to a similar level as seen in shRNA mice prior to learning. No further increase is seen in shRNA mice indicating a saturation of circuit changes that cannot be further amplified following learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Our aim was to describe the data in reference to the baseline in order to test for neuronal ensembles that may form in response to exposure to a context. To do so, without presenting complicated graphs and posthoc comparisons, we decided to present the data in the current format. Importantly, we avoided multiple comparisons or to draw conclusions across groups and thus did not affect our α level. Based on your remarks, we decided to present the data in a different format. We now show data per context and perform student’s t-test to address across group differences. See edits in Figure 3d,k. However, we still think it is important to test within group to address the question of context-related correlated pairs. Thus, we perform a one-sample t-test within each group and strictly restrict conclusion drawn from that to the tested group as done in similar prior publications.

First, α levels in biological experiments have been used broadly as 0.05 without proper proof of biological relevance (compared to 0.06 or 0.04). Second, the interpretation that CA1 may instruct ACC is guided by our finding that the strength of neuronal representation (CC pairs, A&amp;C neurons within CCpairs) in shRNA mice at remote time points is accompanied by increased precision in ACC (A&amp;C neurons) (Figure 3k,m,n). And our new electrophysiological recordings that demonstrate increase CA1-ACC synchrony in animals in which we increase FFI in DG-CA3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Relatedly, there appears to be more variability in the shRNA group compared to what is seen in the controls, especially in measurements from CA1 (e.g. Figure 3d, 3k). Is it possible that this variability might be explained by variable levels of viral transfection? What steps were taken to ensure viral expression was comparable among all animals included in the experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>First, based on past experience using shRNA virus to downregulate Ablim3 and increase FFI in DG-CA3 (Guo et al., 2018) we only included mice with sufficient infection in the dDG. We now provide a figure with all animals included in the study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). All mice show sufficient expression of the lenti-virus construct. Furthermore, the functional impact of Ablim3 shRNA expressed by the lenti-virus is naturally limited to DG cells given that ablim3 is solely expressed in this cell population (https://hipposeq.janelia.org/full/t1/E18E148C-3805-11EC-A082-ECE49DC49958/) and not in adjacent CA3c or CA3ab or CA1. Second, Terminals of DG granule cell axons (mossy fiber, MF) form synapses onto CA3 pyramidal neurons with low convergence while mossy fiber filopodia innervate parvalbumin positive (PV) interneurons with high convergence. Thus, the level of infection may not have a linear relation to the level of FFI provided within the DG-CA3 network.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Viral expression of lenti-shNT/ shRNA construct in the dorsal DG in all mice included in this study.</title><p>Representative images are shown for each mouse.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70586-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The claims that shRNA increases CA1 activity and correlated firing relative to ACC is not justified (Figure 1g,h). There is no rationale for this specific comparison and the entire rest of the paper compares the shNT and shRNA groups. There needs to be a strong rationale for this analysis or the comparisons should be between experimental groups, which the authors report as not significant for activity.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point and was raised by all reviewers. We acknowledge the weakness of this comparison, apologize for this misstep in our analysis and have accordingly, removed this dataset from our manuscript. Instead, we performed new experiments using in vivo electrophysiology to allow for cross-region comparison of LFPs in CA1 and ACC within the same animal. We removed data from Figure 1 e-i and added new, simultaneous electrophysiological LFP recordings (Figure 5 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 in revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) When comparing FSR cells, the increase in correlated pairs likely reflects higher activity since the cells are selected by having higher activity post-shock. The authors acknowledge this on p4: &quot;Shuffled data indicate that the increase in correlated pairs was mostly due to increased number of calcium events.&quot; Yet this acknowledgement is not considered when the authors draw interpretations from their data and no data is presented showing how activity levels influence the correlated pairs. Any conclusions based on correlated pairs need to clarify how activity levels contributed to the synchronized firing.</p></disp-quote><p>We partly addressed that by showing the average firing rate during the recall sessions in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 j,l and see that in CA1 calcium event rate is actually lower in context A compared to context C while we find more correlated pairs in context A (see Figure 3 d,k). However, averaging over mice may indeed occlude a potential link between neuronal activity and correlated pairs. We provide additional analysis showing the number of correlated pairs plotted against neuronal activity of correlated neurons (averaged over time, as correlated pairs are also calculated over the entire time) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1o</xref>). We find no positive correlation between these two parameters indicating that it is not a general increase in neuronal activity that leads to the findings of correlated pairs in context A. We rather find a negative correlation in shRNA mice (Pearson’s correlation, shNT: R<sup>2</sup>=0.027, p=0.493; shRNA: R<sup>2</sup>=0.236, p=0.03). Comparison between neuronal activity shows a tendency towards higher activity in non-correlated neurons in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1o</xref>, middle-right, Paired t-test , shNT, p=0.06, n=20, shRNA, p=0.085, n=20). Thus, it seems that neuronal activity does not drive the increase in correlated pairs found during recall.</p><p>We also addressed that in the main text (LL 176).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The lack of a non-shock control group makes it difficult to interpret how selecting for foot shock responsive cells is influencing the data. Perhaps the authors could use baseline data to do a similar analysis to see how much selection bias is driving the findings of Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly agree that the small number of FSR neurons may require a different test to reinforce our conclusions and appreciate the reviewers’ suggestions how to address that. We performed two new analyses on our data.</p><p>First, as suggested here, we randomly picked the same number of neurons (FSR neurons) from the pool of non-FSR neurons (nFRS neurons) and repeated the same analysis regarding normalized event rate and correlated pairs on those non-FSR neurons. We found no increase in event rate or correlated pairs in any group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1i, j</xref>) but rather a reduction in event rate in CA1 (Two-tailed paired Student’s t-test, shNT p=0.034, n=5, shRNA p=0.033, n=5) and no change in ACC in the small subset of nFSR neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1i, j</xref>).</p><p>Second, we performed the original analysis to find FSR neurons (“shamFSR”) on the same day Baseline recording as a control recording that did not include a foot-shock. Surprisingly, we found a similar number of neurons that were characterized as shamFSR compared to FSR neurons found in the training session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1k</xref>, see Figure 2 —figure supplement 1a in manuscript for comparison) in CA1 as well as in the ACC shNT mice. Thus, indicating that neuronal activity of a subset of neurons varies within sessions independent of the foot-shocks in those groups. Originally, we reported that shRNA manipulation increases the number of FSR neurons in ACC. To test if this is still valid with the new finding of shamFSR neurons, we compared the percentage of shamFSR neurons (from baseline recording) with the originally reported percentage of FSR neurons in ACC mice. We found that shRNA injected mice show a significantly higher number of FSR neurons compared to shamFSR neurons supporting our original findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1l</xref>, paired t-test, shNT: N.S, n=5; shRNA p=0.0214; n=5). We found no difference in neuronal activity or number of correlated pairs in shamFSR neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1m, n</xref>) indicating that the increase in activity and correlated pairs reported in the original manuscript is specific to foot-shock learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is unclear why calculations of correlated pairs are normalized to baseline in Figure 3, but not in Figure 2. In Figure 2, the primary finding that shRNA group increases the number of correlated pairs would seemingly go away if normalized to preFS levels (presumably similar to baseline). This variability makes it difficult to interpret the normalized values since there is clearly substantial variability in the baseline numbers. Perhaps reporting raw correlated pair numbers or adding new subjects would be more clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Our longitudinal study design includes many different variables that may affect our recordings such as previous experience (e.g. previous recording). We tried to use normalization to account for cross-animal variability and effects of such previous experiences and therefore chose the temporally most proximal reference point to normalize to. In Figure 2 and 3 we asked 2 different questions and therefore used other approaches. In the training session (Figure 2), we wanted to test the effect of a foot-shock while mice are in context A. Therefore, our reference is context A prior to the foot-shock within the same session. In the recall sessions, we wanted to test the effect of context, so our reference is the familiar context of the same day (baseline session). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1p</xref> we provide the percentage of correlated pairs during the baseline recording on the training day. We don’t find a difference between groups in either ACC or CA1 that could drive our findings in Figure 2. Moreover, in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1b we also show the change in correlated pairs, which is a form of normalization to preFS level as suggested here, and find that indeed shRNA mice show a significantly higher change in correlated pairs compared to shNT injected mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figures 2i and 4c-d show schematics summarizing the data, but don't seem to represent the data related to correlation accurately. For example, in Figure 2h the authors show that there is an increase in the percentage of neuronal pairs that are co-active in CA1 in both the shNT and shRNA groups, and that this is increase in the number of co-active pairs is more extreme in the shRNA group (Supplementary Figure 1b). The schematic, however, implies that the strength of the correlation between co-active pairs is increased, which does not appear to have been tested.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We edited the sketch to (1) better reflect the number of correlated pairs instead of the strength and (2) the differences in preFS conditions (Figure 2i and new Figure 6a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Page 5 173 – &quot;Using CellReg (Sheintuch et al., 2017) to register neurons across sessions, we found no reactivation of FSR neurons among the correlated pairs of neurons identified in CA1 in the recall session [shNT: mean: 0.0 S.E.M. 0; shRNA: mean 0.0, S.E.M, 0] (data not shown).&quot; Does this mean that to reach this criterion both of the correlated cells would have to be matched across sessions and then again be correlated during recall? Please clarify this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if that was not clear. Only 1 cell of the correlated pair is sufficient. In detail, the criteria for this analysis are (1) the cell is matched across 2 days meaning that it was active during training and day 1 recall (in at least one context), (2) it was identified as FSR cell during training, (3) it is correlated with another cell during recall. This is independent of the correlated partner (other cell in pair does not have to fulfill these criteria). This is now included in the method section for FSR neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 2f and 3n show pie charts without individual animal information. These are not very interpretable and should be replaced by graphs that showed animal by animal variability.</p></disp-quote><p>These data can be found in the bar graph (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1a (for Figure 2f) and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 e-h (for Figure 3n)). We tried to reduce the number of bar graphs to make the figures easier to read. We added the mean and SEM for each chart in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Page 5 – &quot;We controlled for the possible effect of locomotion on neuronal activity by quantifying the time mice moved in each context and found no correlation between the number of correlated neuronal pairs and the time mice moved in the respective context [Pearson's R2, ACC context A, 0.19, ACC context C: 0.00, CA1 context A: 0.09, CA1 context C: 0.04, n=5 mice per group] (Supplementary Figure 2a-d).&quot; Please add p-values as R2 values are a bit ambiguous.</p></disp-quote><p>We provided those in the statistical table but agree that they need to be stated in the text. We added these values in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1d, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2b and in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors should consider that the increased activity in CA1 A&amp;C neurons in context C may be driven by locomotion rather than novelty (Figure 3f and Supplemental Figure 2d).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1q</xref> we provide additional analysis in CA1 mice. We show the normalized event rate in A&amp;C neurons (from Figure 3f,l) against the percentage of time mice spent moving in context C (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1d and newly included data from day 16) (Pearson’s correlation, shNT, R<sup>2</sup>=0.113, p=0.344; n=10; shRNA, R<sup>2</sup>=0.208, p=0.563, n=10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) To follow up on my comment 1), I think it would be useful to quantify the impact of the manipulation on CA3 activity in vivo. This can be done using electrophysiology or imaging. If this is beyond the scope of this study, an indirect read-out of CA3 activity could be obtained through a sharp wave ripple analysis in CA1, which would provide an independent indicator of how intrahippocampal information processing in vivo is changed by the manipulation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point and was raised by all reviewers. We acknowledge the weakness of this comparison, apologize for this misstep in our analysis and have accordingly, removed this dataset from our manuscript. Instead, we performed new experiments using in vivo electrophysiology to allow for cross-region comparison of LFPs in CA1 and ACC within the same animal. We removed data from Figure 1 e-i and added new, simultaneous electrophysiological LFP recordings (Figure 5 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 in revised manuscript).</p><p>We found an increased number of CA1 ripples that are coupled with ACC spindles (“coupled ripples”) in shRNA mice compared to control mice prior to a learning event (Figure 5c, two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test with Welch’s correction, p=0.0499, n=5) with no difference in time spend in slow-wave sleep (SWS) (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1a) or total numbers of spindles or ripples (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1b-c). Control mice show a learning-dependent increase in coupled ripples (Figure 5f, two-tailed paired student’s t-test, p=0.019, n=5) to a similar level as seen in shRNA mice prior to learning. No further increase is seen in shRNA mice indicating a saturation of circuit changes that cannot be further amplified following learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be helpful to illustrate at the beginning of the paper how a calcium event is defined. For example, the data in figure 1g appear to show that the activity patterns in CA1 have been changed when increasing DG-CA3 FFI. The frequency is increased, but there is also an increase in &quot;double-peak transients&quot;. How exactly are these handled by the analysis? Along the same lines, it would be helpful to clarify the y axis label 'event rate [SD]'? The term rate implies frequency, but if I understand it correctly, the analysis mixes amplitude and frequency, correct? Including some raw data would, I think, help understand how the analysis impacts the findings of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding the extraction of events is important aspect of calcium imaging. We included a trace of raw calcium dynamics and marked detected events to visualize our approach (Figure 1e, lower trace). Events were detected based on the following restrictions: minimum peak height of 3 times standard deviation of the baseline noise, minimum distance between two peaks of 15 frames (1.5 second), minimum peak width of 3 frames (300 ms). Thus, “double-peak transients” were included if they fulfilled these criteria.</p><p>The event rate is indeed the numbers of events/time bin and therefore implies frequency. The amplitude was only considered to detect an event. Analysis of events (i.e. rate or correlation) was based on binary time-series data indicating the timepoint of an event.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The graphics in Figure 1i and Figure 4c are misleading. There is no indication in the data about the strength of the correlation; the data presented only show that the fraction of correlated FSR neuron pairs is increased after footshock, not that there is a change in the correlation strength. If I understand Figure 2h correctly, there seems to be roughly a doubling in the fraction of correlated pairs in all groups, except for the shNT/ACC group showing a 4-5 times increase in the fraction of correlated pairs.</p></disp-quote><p>We edited the sketch to (1) reflect better the number of correlated pairs instead of the strength and (2) the differences in preFS conditions (Figure 2i and new Figure 6a).</p><p>References</p><p>Cai, D.
