However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of macrophage polarization during infection within host remain to be investigated. Here, we implement a model of persistent <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium infection in zebrafish, which allows visualization of polarized macrophages and bacteria in real time at high resolution. While macrophages polarize toward M1-like phenotype to control early infection, during later stages, <italic>Salmonella</italic> persists inside non-inflammatory clustered macrophages. Transcriptomic profiling of macrophages showed a highly dynamic signature during infection characterized by a switch from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory/pro-regenerative status and revealed a shift in adhesion program. In agreement with this specific adhesion signature, macrophage trajectory tracking identifies motionless macrophages as a permissive niche for persistent <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Our results demonstrate that zebrafish model provides a unique platform to explore, in a whole organism, the versatile nature of macrophage functional programs during bacterial acute and persistent infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd><italic>Salmonella</italic></kwd><kwd>bacterial persistence</kwd><kwd>macrophage

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The outcome of bacterial infections is the result of complex dynamic interactions between the pathogen and the host’s cellular and humoral actors of innate immunity. Deciphering this complexity is necessary to predict infection outcomes and guide therapeutic strategies. The development of tractable systems in which bacteria and cellular actors can be tracked at high spatiotemporal resolution in a whole living animal is essential to assess the dynamic of host–pathogen interactions.</p><p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, a Gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen, comprises more than 2000 non-typhoidal and typhoidal serovars inducing a variety of conditions ranging from benign gastroenteritis to severe systemic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gogoi et al., 2019</xref>). Every year typhoidal serovars infect 20 millions of people and cause more than 200,000 of deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crump et al., 2004</xref>). In some cases, <italic>Salmonella</italic> establishes a chronic infection that results in asymptomatic carriers hosting the environmental reservoir for further infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monack, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gal-Mor, 2019</xref>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> resides within the draining lymph nodes and systemic tissues such as the spleen, where the bacteria survive mainly inside macrophages and have to deal with this hostile environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrhardt et al., 2023</xref>). Capitalizing on different virulence factors, <italic>Salmonella</italic> can replicate within macrophages inside modified vacuoles called phagosomes and escape the host’s defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, as reported for several intracellular bacterial pathogens, <italic>Salmonella</italic> uses strategies to interfere with macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thiriot et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages are among the most plastic immune cells that adapt their phenotype and function according to their microenvironment by a process called polarization. In vivo, they form a continuum of activation states whose two extremes are the pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, that have a bactericidal activity, and the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages that promote the resolution of inflammation and healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ginhoux et al., 2016</xref>). During the first hours of infection, most bacteria, including <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium), induce macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory and microbicidal M1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenner and Young, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nau et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, persisting bacteria, like <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>Brucella abort</italic>us, or <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, may preferentially reside inside healing/anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thiriot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xavier et al., 2013</xref>). In a mouse model of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium long-term infection, bacteria were shown to persist mainly in M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pham et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, another in vivo study showed that <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium reside in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-expressing macrophages that clustered within splenic granulomas 42 days post-infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg et al., 2018</xref>). Although iNOS is a known marker of M1 macrophages, the exact polarization status of these macrophages remained undetermined. In addition, intracellular replication of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium was shown to vary according to macrophage polarization, with a greater replication in M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saliba et al., 2016</xref>). To date, however, the dynamics of interactions between pathogenic bacteria and polarized macrophages between early invasion and late survival remain poorly understood at the organism level.</p><p>Perfectly suited to live observation of immune cells and pathogens in vivo, the transparent zebrafish embryo has emerged as a powerful vertebrate model to study host–pathogen interactions at the cellular and whole organism level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torraca and Mostowy, 2018</xref>). This model allows macrophage plasticity and reprogramming to be monitored using dedicated fluorescent reporters to simultaneously tract macrophages and visualize their activation state. Using a non-infected wound model, we previously showed that macrophages first express pro-inflammatory cytokines (M1-like polarization) before switching to a new state expressing both M1 and M2 makers during the wound healing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nguyen-Chi et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, the dynamics of macrophage polarization in the context of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection has not been addressed in zebrafish.</p><p>Here, we establish the first larval zebrafish model of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium persistent infection. Using intravital imaging, we show that during early stages of infection, both neutrophils and macrophages are mobilized to the infection site to engulf bacteria and that macrophages respond by a strong M1-like activation. In later stages of infection, bacteria survive inside non-inflammatory macrophages which accumulate in large clusters and provide a niche for persistent bacteria inside the host. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional profiles of macrophages reveals a highly dynamic transcriptional signature of distinct macrophage subsets during early and late phases of infection, showing changes in inflammatory response and in expression of adhesion molecules upon persistent infection, which correlate with a decrease of macrophage motility. This new model provides a unique opportunity to explore the dynamics of interactions between persistent pathogenic bacteria and polarized macrophages in a four-dimentional living system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Salmonella</italic> hindbrain ventricle infection in zebrafish leads to different outcomes, from systemic to persistent infection</title><p>Previous studies on <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium-infected zebrafish larva, based on intravenous or subcutaneous injection or immersion, have been linked to a rapid disease progression with acute symptoms and high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to larval mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stockhammer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van der Sar et al., 2003</xref>). To develop a model of persistent bacterial infection using <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium (hereafter named <italic>Salmonella</italic>), we chose to inject in a closed compartment, the hindbrain ventricle (HBV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which allows direct visualization of immune cell recruitment in a confined space. To allow direct observation of bacterial burden, a GFP-expressing <italic>Salmonella</italic> ATCC14028s strain was constructed (Sal-GFP). We injected 2 days post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish embryos with different doses of Sal-GFP in the HBV, or with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and monitored larval survival from 0 to 4 days post-infection (dpi).

This shift in adhesion program of activated macrophages during the establishment of persistent infection suggests profound changes in their interaction with their environment and their migratory properties. Indeed, macrophage function relies on the establishment of contact with neighboring cells and stable attachments to their substrate, allowing transmigration through tissues, positioning, and signaling. Cadherins were shown to regulate macrophage functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">To et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van den Bossche et al., 2015</xref>) and integrins and small GTPases are also important for macrophage migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aflaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paterson and Lämmermann, 2022</xref>). To test whether the changes in expression of cell adhesion and cytoskeletal regulators were mirrored by changes in macrophage adhesion associated motility, we generated a double transgenic line, Tg(<italic>mfap4:Gal4/UAS:nfsB-mCherry</italic>), in which <italic>mfap4</italic> promoter drives indirectly the expression of NTR fused with mCherry specifically in macrophages. In these larvae, macrophages are strongly and mosaically labeled by red fluorescence allowing an accurate tracking of individual macrophages. Larvae were infected with Sal-E2Crimson and imaged using confocal microscopy during 2 hr at 1 hpi and at 4 dpi. Analysis of macrophage trajectories at the injection site revealed that macrophage motility at 1 hpi was enhanced in infected larvae, with long-distance migration compared to PBS control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8 video9">Videos 8, 9</xref>). In contrast, macrophage motility at the injection site at 4 dpi in infected larvae was decreased compared to PBS control, with very short trajectories. In addition, macrophage migration speed was significantly enhanced at 1 hpi in the infected larvae compared to the control condition, whereas at 4 dpi, this speed was reduced compared to the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). To compare the motility of uninfected bystander macrophages versus infected macrophages, a similar analysis was performed on macrophages with and without intracellular bacteria. At 1 hpi, bystander macrophages exhibited heightened velocity during acute infection, while infected macrophages maintained a speed comparable to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). In contrast, during persistent infection (4 dpi), both bystander and infected macrophages exhibited reduced velocity compared to unstimulated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). To evaluate the motility of another leukocyte population, we measured neutrophil velocity. At 1 hpi, neutrophil speed was increased by the infection while at 4 dpi, it was unchanged compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, neutrophil velocity was higher than that of macrophages in each condition. These observation underscores the dynamic cellular characteristics exhibited by leukocytes, including macrophages, influenced by their infection status, and the stage of the infection. These data also demonstrate that, during persistent infection, clusters of motionless macrophages are formed while they provide a niche for <italic>Salmonella</italic> to survive.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title><italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence induces drastic changes in cell adhesion-related gene expression and motility in macrophages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in cell adhesion, between macrophage populations across infection (p-adj &lt;0.05).

Here, we describe the first model of <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence in transparent zebrafish that allows the detailed analysis of the dynamic interactions between <italic>Salmonella</italic> and polarized macrophages during early and late phases of infection in a whole organism.</p><p>In other zebrafish infection models with <italic>Salmonella</italic>, acute symptoms – hyper-proliferation of the bacteria, larval mortality – presumably prevent the establishment of a long-term infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stockhammer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van der Sar et al., 2003</xref>). Unlike these studies, we injected <italic>Salmonella</italic> in a closed compartment, the larval HBV. This mode of infection led to diverse outcomes, including acute infection, clearance, and persistence. Indeed, in 47% of the larvae, <italic>Salmonella</italic> replicated intensively, leading to the rapid larval death. In surviving larvae, the bacteria were either cleared or survived inside the host, possibly up to 14 dpi. These bacteria that survive for an extended period of time within the tissues were called ‘persistent <italic>Salmonella</italic>’. These ‘persistent bacteria’ should not be confused with ‘Persisters’, which refers to bacteria that persist for prolonged periods despite antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>), even though they may share some common features. These diverse outcomes of infected zebrafish could be explained by multiple factors, including stochastic cell-to-cell differences in genetically identical bacteria or the complexity of immune cell population. Indeed, in in vitro systems, heterogeneous activity of the bacteria creates phenotypically diverse bacterial subpopulations which shape different cellular environments and potentiate adaptation to a new niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saliba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We focused our in vivo study on embryos infected with persistent <italic>Salmonella</italic> up to 4 dpi. During the course of infection, the infected host displayed two main phases characterized by distinct inflammatory status: an early pro-inflammatory phase and a late phase characterized by both pro- and anti-inflammatory signals. We analyzed the interaction of <italic>Salmonella</italic> with innate immune cells during both phases. Similar to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Masud et al., 2019</xref>), during early infection, both neutrophils and macrophages engulfed the bacteria. Macrophages played a crucial role in bacterial clearance, as shown by the increased bacterial burden upon macrophage depletion. Exploiting the imaging possibilities of this system, we visualized macrophage activation thanks to <italic>tnfa</italic> expression in real time in response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection and showed that engulfing macrophages and bystanders polarized toward M1-like phenotypes. This pro-inflammatory response from the host was rapid and robust as more than 90% of the macrophages activated as M1 like within the first hours. Besides, we assessed the full transcriptome of zebrafish macrophages during early infection and we demonstrated that macrophages adopted a pro-inflammatory program characterized by the up-regulation of genes involved in inflammation, cytokine–cytokine receptor, and phagosome pathways. These results are consistent with our initial analysis on whole larvae and are reminiscent to previous studies using whole <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected larvae where genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokine pathways are up-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stockhammer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ordas et al., 2011</xref>). There are also similarities with the activation program detected in human macrophages infected with different pathogens including <italic>Salmonella (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nau et al., 2002</xref>), which may represent an evolutionarily conserved program for host defense.</p><p>During the persistent phase, high-resolution intravital imaging showed that <italic>Salmonella</italic> mainly localized inside macrophages that were organized in large clusters. In contrast, although some neutrophils were detected in the HBV, they were poorly recruited, not clustered and did not harbor persistent bacteria. Importantly, most of the mobilized macrophages did not express <italic>tnfa</italic> in late stages of infection; we could not observe infected macrophages expressing <italic>tnfa</italic>. Transcriptomic profiling of these non-inflammatory macrophages during bacterial persistence revealed an anti-inflammatory and regenerative profile characterized (1) by the attenuation of pro-inflammatory genes and (2) by the up-regulation of genes involved in anti-inflammation, tissue maintenance, development, and regeneration. This included the expression of <italic>wt1b</italic> an important pro-regenerative gene that defines a pro-regenerative macrophage subtype in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sanz-Morejón et al., 2019</xref>). Surprisingly, neuronal function-related genes, involved in myelination or expressed in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were also up-regulated. This should not result from cell contamination given the macrophage specificity of the RNAseq datasets, which did not recover other cell type markers. We therefore propose two possible scenarios. In the first scenario, the brain damages caused by the persistent infection may trigger a regenerative response involving pro-regenerative macrophages, which participate to the regeneration of axons and the restoration of their function by remyelination and maintenance of myelin homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McNamara et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rawji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsarouchas et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, during persistent infection, macrophages may perform efferocytosis of damaged or dying cells and internalize transcripts originating from them. The internalization of apoptotic RNAs by macrophages during efferocytosis has been demonstrated in the context of murine macrophages co-cultured with apoptotic human T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lantz et al., 2020</xref>). Both scenarios suggest that the macrophages interact tightly with their microenvironment during persistent infection. It is important to emphasize that the dynamic variations in macrophage transcriptomes between acute and persistent infections may indicate disparities in proliferation, death, and polarization, altering the composition of macrophage populations over time. However, it might also denote a phenotypic switch from M1- to M2-like polarization within individual macrophages over time. In the future, a more comprehensive analysis at single-cell level of resolution will better discriminate phenotypically distinct populations of macrophages at play in this model.</p><p>Our data indicate that Non-M1 macrophages which have limited bactericidal activity, can be used by <italic>Salmonella</italic> as a niche to sustain persistent infections in their hosts. <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence was previously associated with M2 macrophages in a mouse model of long-term infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg et al., 2018</xref>). Molecularly, M2-permissive macrophage polarization in granulomas is partially dependent on SteE, an effector of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island-2 type III secretion system (SPI2 T3SS), while the host cytokine TNF limits M2 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pham et al., 2020</xref>). In infected cultured macrophages, SteE regulates STAT3, reorienting macrophage polarization toward M2 phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gibbs et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Panagi et al., 2020</xref>). Another study revealed that macrophages harboring <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium during persistent stages express high levels of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (known as iNOS or NOS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed an up-regulation of <italic>nos2b</italic> in zebrafish macrophages 4 days after <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Furthermore, non-growing, antibiotic-tolerant bacteria, also called persisters, were shown to translocate SPI2 T3SS effectors, including SteE, into the macrophage to reprogram it into a non-inflammatory macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stapels et al., 2018</xref>). Our data are in line with these studies, emphasizing the potential of the zebrafish model for the study of persistent infections. However, further investigations are still needed to identify the bacterial factors involved in macrophage reprogramming in our system.</p><p>An efficient immune response requires the interplay of a cocktail of cell-adhesion molecules and immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedl and Weigelin, 2008</xref>). Macrophages express various cell-adhesion proteins including <italic>integrin b1</italic> (<italic>itgb1</italic>) that is crucial for cell movements and protrusiveness during surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paterson and Lämmermann, 2022</xref>). Tight junctions are important for particle uptake and exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blank et al., 2011</xref>) and RAC proteins were shown to be necessary for macrophage basic motility and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wheeler et al., 2006</xref>). We demonstrated a shift in macrophage adhesion program during persistent stages with several cell adhesion-related genes that were down-regulated, including <italic>itgb1</italic>, <italic>rac2</italic>, and tight junction-related genes. This shift in adhesion program was accompanied with a decrease in macrophage motility. The observation that macrophages remained stationary while neutrophil exhibited normal mobility implies that cell density within tissue does not appear to affect the motility of leukocytes in persistent infection stages. Chemokines also play a pivotal role in macrophage chemotaxis, and alterations in these signaling pathways may contribute to the lower motility of macrophages during persistent infection stages. Previous studies have established the involvement of Ccl2 and its receptor Ccr2 in guiding macrophages toward bacterial pathogens in mice and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cambier et al., 2014</xref>). Here, both <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>ccl2</italic> orthologs, <italic>ccl38a.4</italic>, were up-regulated at 4 hpi, yet their expression reverted to baseline levels by 4 dpi. In contrast, <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection had no impact on the expression of <italic>cxcr4b</italic> and <italic>sdf1</italic> (<italic>cxcl12a</italic>), representing another crucial chemoattractant signal. Based on our transcriptomic analysis, <italic>cxcr3</italic> and <italic>cxcl11</italic> are regulated in response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Therefore, our data suggest a dynamic shift in major chemotaxis signals between the acute and persistent stages of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection that may contribute to the regulation of macrophage motility. Because these motionless macrophages appear non-inflammatory and contain persistent bacteria, they may constitute a permissive environment for bacterial survival. Of interest, the <italic>Salmonella</italic> SPI2 T3SS effector SseI, which is involved in long-term infection in mice, has been previously found to modulate the migration of cultured macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLaughlin et al., 2009</xref>). Subversion of macrophage motility has been also previously observed with another pathogen, <italic>M. marinum</italic>, which uses the ESX-1/RD1 secretion system to enhance macrophage recruitment to nascent granulomas and favor granulomas formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Granulomas are a key pathological feature of some intracellular bacterial infections; they do contain a high proportion of macrophages. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> can cause granuloma formation in different animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Work et al., 2019</xref>), including mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg et al., 2018</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muniraj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narechania et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nasrallah and Nassar, 1978</xref>). The complex cellular structure of granuloma is thought to be important for bacterial persistence. Recently, using single-cell transcriptomics, Pham et al. identified diverse macrophage populations within <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium-induced granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pham et al., 2023</xref>). In the present study, <italic>Salmonella</italic> persisted within aggregates of <italic>tnfa</italic>-negative macrophages that remind early granulomas. Mycobacterial granulomas are characterized by epithelioid macrophages expressing tight junction proteins, E-cadherin (CDH1) and ZO-1 (<italic>tjp1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cronan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pagán and Ramakrishnan, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, in the context of persistent <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we showed that <italic>tnfa</italic>-negative macrophages down-regulated the expression of several tight junction-related genes during persistence, such as <italic>cdh1</italic> and <italic>tjp1a</italic>. This is similar to what has been observed in <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced granulomas in mice where macrophages weakly express E-cadherin or ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg et al., 2018</xref>) and suggests that these structures are non-epithelioid granulomas initiated by an innate immune mechanism.</p><p>In conclusion, the zebrafish larva proves to be an extraordinary platform for the analysis of <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistent infection and the understanding of long-term interactions with host cells inside a whole living animal.

The 15 samples were sent to Montpellier GenomiX plateform (MGX, Institut de Genomique Fonctionnelle, Montpellier, France) for library preparation and sequencing. RNA-seq libraries were generated from 5 ng of RNA with the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit from Takara Bio (#634889) and the DNA Prep Kit from Illumina (#20060060) and were clustered and sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument, a flow cell SP and NovaSeq Xp Workflow according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a read length of 100 nucleotides. Image analysis and base calling were done using the Illumina NovaSeq Control Software and Illumina RTA software. Demultiplexing and trimming were performed using Illumina’s conversion software (bcl2fastq 2.20). The quality of the raw data was assessed using FastQC (v11.9) from the Babraham Institute and the Illumina software SAV (Sequencing Analysis Viewer). FastqScreen (v0.15) was used to identify potential contamination. The RNAseq data were mapped on the zebrafish genome (version GRCz11) and gene counting was performed with Featurecounts v2.0.3. Sequencing depth of all samples was between 53 and 87 million reads. All reads were aligned to the GRCz11 version of the zebrafish genome using TopHat2 v2.1.1 (using Bowtie v2.3.5.1) software, and Samtools (v1.9) was used to sort and index the alignment files. Subsequently, normalization and differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 and edgeR methods. After comparison of the two methods, DESeq2 method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was kept. P values were adjusted using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref> corrections for controlling false-positive rate (False Discovery Rate_FDR, also called p-adjusted (p-adj)) and results were considered statistically significant when p-adj &lt;0.05. Analysis was performed based on the log<sub>2</sub> fold change (FC). Gene Ontology analysis of DEGs and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis were performed with ShinyGO 0.76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ge et al., 2020</xref>) with criteria of p -adj&lt;0.05 up-regulatedǀlog<sub>2</sub>(FC) &gt;0 or ≥1 and down-regulatedǀlog<sub>2</sub>(FC) &lt;0 or ≤1. Purity of the different sorted macrophage populations was confirmed by absence of expression of several marker genes of various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farnsworth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Metikala et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Studies were designed to generate experimental groups of approximatively equal size, using randomization and blinded analysis. The sample size estimation and the power of the statistical test were computed using GPower. A preliminary analysis was used to determine the necessary sample size <italic>N</italic> of a test given <italic>α</italic> &lt; 0.05, power = 1 − <italic>β</italic> &gt; 0.80 (where α is the probability of incorrectly rejecting H0 when it is in fact true and <italic>β</italic> is the probability of incorrectly retaining H0 when it is in fact false). Then the effect size was determined. Groups include the number of independent values, and the statistical analysis was done using these independent values. No inclusion/exclusion criteria of data were applied. The number of independent experiments (biological replicates) is indicated in the figure legends when applicable. The level of probability p &lt; 0.05 constitutes the threshold for statistical significance for determining whether groups differ. GraphPad Prism 7 Software (San Diego, CA, USA) was used to construct graphs and analyze data in all figures. Specific statistical tests were used to evaluate the significance of differences between groups (the test and p value is indicated in the figure legend).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation procedures were carried out according to the European Union guidelines for handling of laboratory animals (https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/index_en.htm) and were approved by the Comité d'Ethique pour l'Expérimentation Animale under reference CEEA-LR-B4-172-37 and APAFIS #36309-2022040114222432 V2.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Please excuse the extraordinary long time it took us to handle the manuscript, due to summer vacations.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study proposes that a shift in macrophage polarization from acute to persistent infection stage supports <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence. Quantitative analyses demonstrating frequencies of infected macrophages and intracellular bacterial levels of infected macrophages during persistent vs. acute infection are not shown. It is also not clear from figure 1E that the total tissue bacterial levels at persistent infection stage (4 dpi) is the same, less, or more compared to 3 dpi, 2 dpi, and 1 dpi, without or without including the infected larvae with high bacterial proliferation. Please provide this.</p><p>2) Transcriptional differences in cell adhesion genes of macrophages between acute and persistent infection stage would benefit from validation with representative protein expression analysis. In addition, whether availability of chemotaxis signals and/or cell density contribute to the low motility of macrophages in persistent infection stage, compared to the acute stage, has not been specifically addressed. Please address this.</p><p>3) in vivo macrophages are very heterogenous and functionally diverse. The dynamic differences in bulk population transcriptomics of macrophages between the acute and persistent infection stage likely reflect differential recruitment, proliferation, cell death, and polarization that change the relative abundances among different macrophage populations at the site of infection from one time point to another, rather than just a &quot;switch&quot; from M1-like to non-M1 like polarization of the same or an equivalent cell population over time. Having a more robust discussion of these possibilities would not reduce the impact of this study and could help encourage future studies in the field. Please discuss this point.</p><p>4) Here authors talk about 'persistent <italic>Salmonella</italic>’: the concept here needs a little care. The authors are more talking about 'chronic infections' than persistent after antibiotic treatment. Can you please specify this carefully, so we avoid another layer of confusion on the topic?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors seek to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of macrophage polarization during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. They undertake intravital microscopy of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium infection in the hindbrain ventricle of zebrafish larvae and couple this with transcriptomic analysis of macrophages from infected tissues. They find that macrophages and neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the site of infection within hours after inoculation. Macrophage abundance is significantly increased in the persistent infection stage at 4 days post-inoculation (dpi), compared to in the early stage, hours post-inoculation. The authors observe that <italic>Salmonella</italic> bacilli selectively co-localize with aggregates of macrophages, but not neutrophils, during persistent infection. Furthermore, they show that in early infection stage, a markedly higher fraction of macrophages at the site of infection expressed tnfa and exhibits stronger transcriptional signature of pro-inflammatory, M1-like phenotype, compared to macrophages in persistent infection stage. Additionally, the authors find that genes involved in cell-cell adhesion are down-regulated in persistent stage macrophages and these cells have reduced motility. This study's approach, further developing and employing a zebrafish S. Typhimuirum infection model and intravital microscopy of whole living animals, presents an exciting strategy to investigate macrophage responses and their roles during vacuolar intracellular bacterial infection in vivo, complementary to the more commonly utilized murine infection models. The study's findings are useful and largely observational. The data presented have the potential but additional analyses and experiments are needed to clarify and support the conclusions.</p><p>Please see below for my specific comments that I hope could be useful for the authors and help strengthen this manuscript:</p><p>1) The study proposes that a shift in macrophage polarization from acute to persistent infection stage supports <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence. Model figure 8 shows M1-like, pro-inflammatory macrophages in acute infection; whereas, in persistent infection there are more macrophages and they are non-M1 like, anti-inflammatory macrophages with higher intracellular bacterial levels. However, quantitative analyses demonstrating frequencies of infected macrophages and intracellular bacterial levels of infected macrophages during persistent vs. acute infection are not shown. It is also not clear from figure 1E that the total tissue bacterial levels at persistent infection stage (4 dpi) is the same, less, or more compared to 3 dpi, 2 dpi, and 1 dpi, without or without including the infected larvae with high bacterial proliferation.</p><p>2) I think quantitative analyses for cellular features, motility, spatial distribution, etc. among uninfected bystander macrophages vs. infected macrophages with low intracellular bacterial levels vs. infected with high bacterial levels during acute and persistent infection stage would provide valuable insights.</p><p>3) Line 599-600, it appears that only larvae that had macrophage clusters in the brain at 4 dpi were used for transcriptomics analysis. What is the rationale for this inclusion/exclusion and how may this factor into the differences in macrophage transcriptional signatures between the compared samples?</p><p>4) It would be useful to note the purity of sorted macrophage populations that underwent transcriptomics analysis.</p><p>5) in vivo macrophages are very heterogenous and functionally diverse. The dynamic differences in bulk population transcriptomics of macrophages between the acute and persistent infection stage likely reflect differential recruitment, proliferation, cell death, and polarization that change the relative abundances among different macrophage populations at the site of infection from one time point to another, rather than just a &quot;switch&quot; from M1-like to non-M1 like polarization of the same or an equivalent cell population over time.</p><p>6) Transcriptional differences in cell adhesion genes of macrophages between acute and persistent infection stage would need validation with representative protein expression analysis. In addition, whether availability of chemotaxis signals and/or cell density contribute to the low motility of macrophages in persistent infection stage, compared to the acute stage, has not been specifically addressed.</p><p>7) Line 410 mentioned that during persistent phase, neutrophils &quot;are poorly immobilized&quot; (data not shown?). Assessing the specificity of cellular motility change from acute to persistent infection would provide useful insights.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>All the best for the revision of the story.

It is also not clear from figure 1E that the total tissue bacterial levels at persistent infection stage (4 dpi) is the same, less, or more compared to 3 dpi, 2 dpi, and 1 dpi, without or without including the infected larvae with high bacterial proliferation. Please provide this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that quantitative analyses demonstrating frequencies of infected macrophages among recruited macrophage population at acute (4 hpi) and persistent (4 dpi) infection stage were missing and we provide this analysis in the revised manuscript. Between 3 and 14 hpi bacteria can be observed outside leukocytes, but they were actively engulfed by neutrophils and macrophages and 20 to 30% of HBV macrophages were infected. During persistent stages (4 dpi), bacteria were predominantly associated with macrophages, and approximately 60% of the HBV macrophage population was infected. This analysis is now included in the new Figure 5A.</p><p>We have also compared intracellular bacterial levels of infected macrophages between these two stages. An accurate quantification of the number of intracellular bacteria per macrophages on microscopy 3D-datasets is challenging because bacteria are aggregated inside the cells. Therefore, we have quantified the size of bacterial aggregates (E2Crimson-positive events) visualized by confocal microscopy. At 5 hpi, the size of E2Crimson-positive aggregates (E2Crimson<sup>+</sup>) was lower than that at 4 dpi. The size distribution analysis of E2Crimson<sup>+</sup> events indicated a higher representation of smaller sizes (0.5-1.5 µm<sup>3</sup> and 1.5-10 µm<sup>3</sup>) at 5 hpi compared to 4 dpi, a stage during which very large E2Crimson<sup>+</sup> events were observed (100-1000 µm<sup>3</sup>, and up to more than 1000 µm<sup>3</sup>). This analysis, which supports an elevated number of bacteria within macrophages during persistent stages, is now included in the new Figure 5B-D. Results and Methods sections have been modified accordingly.</p><p>Further, in Figure 1E we carried out a statistical analysis to determine the differences in total bacterial load at different times, including or not the infected larvae with high bacterial proliferation. We observed no significant differences between the group, regardless infected larvae with high bacterial proliferation were included or not. This analysis is now included in the legend of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Transcriptional differences in cell adhesion genes of macrophages between acute and persistent infection stage would benefit from validation with representative protein expression analysis. In addition, whether availability of chemotaxis signals and/or cell density contribute to the low motility of macrophages in persistent infection stage, compared to the acute stage, has not been specifically addressed. Please address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that gene expression differences in macrophages between acute and persistent infection stage would benefit from further validation with other approaches.</p><p>First, we chose to validate the regulation of wt1b, a gene known to be expressed in</p><p>regenerative macrophages and required for heart and fin regeneration in zebrafish. In our study, the transcriptomic analysis showed that wt1b mRNA is specifically upregulated in macrophages at 4 dpi but not at 4 hpi. To validate this upregulation, we crossed Tg(wt1b:GFP) line with Tg(mfap4:mCherryF) line to track simultaneously wt1b expressing cells and macrophages. Double transgenic embryos were infected and subsequently imaged at 4hpi and 4 dpi. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that,</p><p>during acute infection (4 hpi) macrophages exhibited no expression of wt1b, while they strongly expressed wt1b at 4 dpi. Persistent infection stage was characterized by the presence of large clusters of wt1b+ macrophages. This confirms that the pro-regenerative gene wt1b is upregulated in macrophages during persistent stage, supporting polarization toward a pro-regenerative state; this also reveals phenotypical distinct macrophage signatures during early and persistent infection stages that can be identified in situ. This data is now included in new Figure 8. Results and Methods sections have been modified accordingly.</p><p>Second, we focused on the cell adhesion related gene zo-1 (also known as tjp1a), which was regulated during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection as shown by RNA sequencing. We studied Zo-1 expression in macrophages at protein level by staining infected Tg(mfap4:mCherryF) embryos with an anti-Zo-1 antibody and an anti-mCherry antibody to visualize macrophages. Immunodetection of Zo-1 protein in zebrafish embryo was confirmed by the labelling of enveloping cell layer (EVL) at 50% epiboly as previously shown (Schwayer et al. 2019 -https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.006). EVL (keratinocytes) were also labelled at 3 and 6 dpf. We found that Zo-1 was present at the membrane of some amoeboid macrophages at 4 hpi. By contrast, we did not detect Zo-1 labelling in clustered macrophages at 4 dpi which is consistent with our transcriptomic analysis. Because an accurate quantification is prevented by the high background of the ZO-1 staining, we decided not to include this data in the article. The reviewer can visualize the data obtained in “Figure for reviewers”. Further, we have been looking for candidates to validate gene regulation at protein level, but unfortunately, very few antibodies are available for zebrafish, which is not a model commonly used for protein expression studies.</p><p>Regarding the availability of chemotaxis signals and/or cell density, we thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Analysis of leukocyte motility revealed that both macrophages and neutrophils were highly mobile during acute infection stage, moving with high speed. By contrast, during persistent infection stage, clustered macrophages (bystanders and infected) had a significant decreased motility compared to control. Importantly, neutrophils did not change their motility during persistent stages compared to control. The fact that only macrophages were motionless, while neutrophils moved normally, suggests that cell density does not influence the motility of leukocytes in persistent infection stage. This data is now included in new Figure 9D and new Figure 9—figure supplement 1. Results and Methods sections have been modified accordingly.</p><p>Chemokines play a pivotal role as primary regulators of macrophage chemotaxis, and alterations in these signaling pathways may contribute to the diminished motility of macrophages during persistent infection stages. Previous studies have established the involvement of Ccl2 and its receptor Ccr2 in guiding macrophages towards bacterial pathogens in mice and zebrafish (Cambier et al, 2014). Using RT-qPCR, we showed the upregulation of both ccr2 and ccl2 orthologue, ccl38a.4, following <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection at 4 hpi, yet their expression reverted to baseline levels by 4 dpi. In contrast, <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection had no impact on the expression of cxcr4b and sdf1 (cxcl12a), representing another crucial chemoattractant signal that regulates monocyte-macrophage differentiation (Sánchez-Martín et al. 2011). Furthermore, our transcriptomic analysis revealed that both cxcr3 and cxcl11 are regulated in response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Notably, the levels of cxcl11.1 were markedly higher at 4 hpi compared to 4 dpi, while cxcl11.5, cxcl11.6, cxcl11.7, cxcr3.1 and cxcr3.2 were all down regulated at 4 hpi. The previously established role of the CXCR3-CXCL11 axis in mediating macrophage recruitment during mycobacterial infections adds significance to these findings(Torraca et al. 2025-DOI: 10.1242/dmm.017756). In summary, our comprehensive dataset suggests a dynamic shift in major chemotaxis signals between the acute and persistent stages of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Therefore, chemokines availability may also contribute to the regulation of macrophage motility during the different phases of bacterial infection. These points have been discussed in the “discussion” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) in vivo macrophages are very heterogenous and functionally diverse. The dynamic differences in bulk population transcriptomics of macrophages between the acute and persistent infection stage likely reflect differential recruitment, proliferation, cell death, and polarization that change the relative abundances among different macrophage populations at the site of infection from one time point to another, rather than just a &quot;switch&quot; from M1-like to non-M1 like polarization of the same or an equivalent cell population over time. Having a more robust discussion of these possibilities would not reduce the impact of this study and could help encourage future studies in the field. Please discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that this point has to be discussed. We have now included in the Discussion section the following text:</p><p>“It is important to highlight that the dynamic differences in macrophage transcriptomics between the acute and persistent infection stages can reflect discrepancies in proliferation, death, and polarization, altering the composition of macrophage populations over time. However, it might also denote a phenotypic switch from M1-like to M2- like polarization within individual macrophages over time. In the future, a more comprehensive analysis at single cell resolution should better discriminate phenotypically distinct macrophage populations at play in this model”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Here authors talk about 'persistent <italic>Salmonella</italic>’: the concept here needs a little care. The authors are more talking about 'chronic infections' than persistent after antibiotic treatment. Can you please specify this carefully, so we avoid another layer of confusion on the topic?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a clarification of the concept of 'persistent Salmonella' is important. In this study “persistent <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection” refers to an infection wherein a portion of bacteria persists for an extended period within the host. We do not share the reviewers’ view on the fact that this should be “chronic infections”. While our zebrafish model shows Salmonella persistence for 14 days, the majority of experiments have been limited to a duration of 4 days. This limitation prevents us from categorizing our findings as indicative of a chronic infection. The &quot;persistent bacteria&quot; mentioned in the study should not be confused with &quot;Persisters&quot;, which refer to bacteria that persist despite antibiotic treatment (Fisher et al. 2017). Persistent bacteria and persisters may share common features, as growth-arrested state, but we have not yet addressed this point. We have now clarified the meaning of &quot;persistent bacteria&quot; in the “Discussion” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Please see below for my specific comments that I hope could be useful for the authors and help strengthen this manuscript:</p><p>1) The study proposes that a shift in macrophage polarization from acute to persistent infection stage supports <italic>Salmonella</italic> persistence. Model figure 8 shows M1-like, pro-inflammatory macrophages in acute infection; whereas, in persistent infection there are more macrophages and they are non-M1 like, anti-inflammatory macrophages with higher intracellular bacterial levels. However, quantitative analyses demonstrating frequencies of infected macrophages and intracellular bacterial levels of infected macrophages during persistent vs. acute infection are not shown. It is also not clear from figure 1E that the total tissue bacterial levels at persistent infection stage (4 dpi) is the same, less, or more compared to 3 dpi, 2 dpi, and 1 dpi, without or without including the infected larvae with high bacterial proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that quantitative analyses demonstrating frequencies of infected macrophages among recruited macrophage population at acute (4 hpi) and persistent (4 dpi) infection stage were missing and we provide this analysis in the revised manuscript.

Therefore, we have incorporated a new analysis of cell motility to Figure 8, new panel D. Tracking individual infected macrophages in time-lapse video sequences is challenging because macrophages strongly aggregated, preventing to differentiate the cells and their paths. To</p><p>accurately quantify cellular features of uninfected bystander macrophages and infected macrophages during infection, we developed a novel transgenic line, Tg(mfap4:Gal4/UAS:nfsb-mCh), in which the mCherry protein is strongly and mosaically expressed in macrophages. We showed distinct dynamics in macrophage behavior during acute and persistent infections. Notably, bystander macrophages</p><p>exhibited higher velocity during acute infection, while infected macrophages maintained a speed comparable to the control group. In contrast, during persistent infection, both bystander and infected macrophages exhibited reduced velocity compared to unstimulated macrophages. This observation underscores the dynamic cellular characteristics exhibited by macrophages, influenced by their infection status and the stage of the infection. This data is now included in new figure 9. Results and</p><p>Methods sections have been modified accordingly.</p><p>We agree that exploring other cellular features and spatial distribution would be highly interesting. A precise analysis of the structure of cellular aggregates and the characteristics of the cells involved is a point that deserves further exploration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Line 599-600, it appears that only larvae that had macrophage clusters in the brain at 4 dpi were used for transcriptomics analysis. What is the rationale for this inclusion/exclusion and how may this factor into the differences in macrophage transcriptional signatures between the compared samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that further explanation is needed. As shown in Figure 1, <italic>Salmonella</italic> induces different outcomes in zebrafish larvae at late time points (4 dpi), i.e. &quot;high proliferation&quot;, &quot;infected&quot; or &quot;cleared&quot;. This may result in different transcriptomic profiles of macrophages. We thus anticipated that bulk RNA sequencing would not provide meaningful biological signals and would be difficult to interpret. Therefore, we decided to focuse on the “infected” cohort that displays persistent infection at 4 dpi, and harbors macrophage clusters in the brain. The rational for inclusion/exclusion of larvae is now provided in the method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be useful to note the purity of sorted macrophage populations that underwent transcriptomics analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this information is important. Preliminary experiments were performed to set up FACS sorting procedure from dissociated Tg(mfap4:mcherry-F) larvae and RNA preparation (Begon-Pescia et al. 2022). We validated the identity of sorted zebrafish macrophage populations by monitoring mfap4 mRNA expression using RT-qPCR on mCherry positive and mCherry negative sorted cells. The results showed that mCherry positive cells expressed 1000 time more mfap4 mRNA than mCherry negative cells, demonstrating that FACS sorting protocol allowed enrichment in macrophage populations. This data is now included in new Figure 7—figure supplement 1. To further validate that the obtained transcriptomic profiles shared common features and corresponded to macrophage transcriptomic profiles, we checked the number of normalized reads corresponding to cell specific markers. We noticed that all samples expressed considerable levels of several key myeloid makers, namely, mfap4, mpeg1.2, marco, csf1ra and lygl1 but they did not express markers for other cell types (mucus secreting cells, xantophores, pronephros, endoderm, skeletal muscle, epidermis, peridermis, notochord, red blood cells, neutrophils and fibroblast). These data are consistent with the common macrophage features shared by sequenced samples and confirm the purity of sorted macrophage populations. It is now included in the “results” section and in Figure 7 and figure 7—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) in vivo macrophages are very heterogenous and functionally diverse.
