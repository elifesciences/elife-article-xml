pair and recombine, enabling balanced segregation and generating genetic diversity. In many vertebrates, double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate recombination within hotspots where PRDM9 binds, and deposits H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. However, no protein(s) recognising this unique combination of histone marks have been identified. We identified <italic>Zcwpw1</italic>, containing H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 recognition domains, as having highly correlated expression with <italic>Prdm9</italic>. Here, we show that ZCWPW1 has co-evolved with PRDM9 and, in human cells, is strongly and specifically recruited to PRDM9 binding sites, with higher affinity than sites possessing H3K4me3 alone. Surprisingly, ZCWPW1 also recognises CpG dinucleotides. Male <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> knockout mice show completely normal DSB positioning, but persistent DMC1 foci, severe DSB repair and synapsis defects, and downstream sterility. Our findings suggest ZCWPW1 recognition of PRDM9-bound sites at DSB hotspots is critical for synapsis, and hence fertility.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sexual reproduction – that is, the combination of sex cells from two different individuals to produce an embryo – is one of the many mechanisms that have evolved to maintain genetic diversity. Most human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, with each chromosome in a pair carrying either a paternal or maternal copy of the same gene. To form an embryo with the right number of chromosomes, each sex cell (the egg or sperm cell) must only contain one chromosome from each pair.</p><p>Sex cells are produced from parent cells containing two sets of paternal and maternal chromosomes: these cells then divide twice to form four sex cells which contain only one chromosome from each pair. Before the parent cell divides, a process known as ‘recombination’ takes place, which allows chromosomes in a pair to exchange bits of genetic information. This reshuffling ensures that each chromosome in a sex cell is unique. A protein called PRDM9 helps control which sections of genetic information are recombined by modifying proteins attached to the chromosomes, marking them as locations for exchange. The DNA at each of these sites is then broken and repaired using the genetic sequence of the chromosome it is paired with as a template, thus causing the two chromosomes to swap genes.</p><p>In 2019, a group of researchers found a set of genes in the testis of mice that are expressed at the same time as the gene for PRDM9. This suggested that another protein called ZCWPW1 is likely involved in recombination, but the precise role of this protein was unclear. To answer this question, Wells, Bitoun et al. – including many of the researchers involved in the 2019 study – examined human cells grown in the laboratory to determine where ZCWPW1 binds to in the chromosome.</p><p>This revealed that ZCWPW1 can be found at the same sites as PRDM9, which is responsible for bringing it there. Furthermore, cells from male mice lacking the gene for ZCWPW1 cannot complete the exchange of genetic information between chromosomes, meaning that the mice are infertile. As such, ZCWPW1 seems to connect location selection by PRDM9 to the DNA repair mechanisms needed for gene exchange between chromosomes.</p><p>Infertility is a significant issue for humans affecting as many as one in every six couples. Fertility is complex and many of the biological mechanisms involved are not fully understood. This work suggests that both PRDM9 and ZCWPW1 are key to the production of sex cells and may be worth investigating as factors that affect fertility in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>double strand break repair</kwd><kwd>ZCWPW1</kwd><kwd>PRDM9</kwd><kwd>DMC1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098387/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Myers</surname><given-names>Simon R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>212284/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Myers</surname><given-names>Simon R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109109/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>095552/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donnelly</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ZCWPW1 has co-evolved with PRDM9, in particular the PRDM9-SET domain, and although not involved in PRDM9's role in positioning recombination events, it is required for PRDM9's role in pairing chromosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis is a specialised cell division, producing haploid gametes essential for reproduction. Uniquely, during this process homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes pair and exchange DNA (recombine) before undergoing balanced independent segregation. Alongside de novo mutations, this generates all genetic diversity – providing a substrate on which natural selection can act.</p><p>In humans, mice, and likely many other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>), the locations at which recombination occur are determined by the binding locations of PRDM9, which recognises a specific sequence motif encoded by its zinc finger array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Baudat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Myers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parvanov et al., 2010</xref>). At these sites, SPO11 catalyses recombination-initiating double strand breaks (DSBs), a subset of which are repaired by recombination with the homologous chromosome. The sister chromatid can also provide a repair substrate, for example for DSBs on the X chromosome in males, and there is evidence that this also occurs at some autosomal hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Latt, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lu and Yu, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Prdm9</italic>-null mice, DSBs form at promoter regions rich in H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brick et al., 2012</xref>), and fail to repair resulting in severe asynapsis, meiotic arrest at pachytene, and sterility in both males and females on the B6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>). We previously showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2016</xref>) that across DSB sites, increased binding of PRDM9 to the homologous chromosome aids synapsis and fertility in hybrid mice, implying an impact of binding downstream of DSB positioning. Mice for which most DSBs occur at sites where PRDM9 does <italic>not</italic> bind the homologue show widespread asynapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gregorova et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Following their formation, DSB sites are processed by resection, resulting in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that becomes decorated with DMC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Neale and Keeney, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sehorn et al., 2004</xref>). In wild-type (WT) mice, DMC1 foci start to appear in early zygotene cells. From mid-zygotene to early pachytene, as part of the recombinational repair process, DMC1 dissociates from the ssDNA and counts decrease until all breaks (except those on the XY chromosomes) are repaired at late pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moens et al., 2002</xref>). At DSB sites where the homologous chromosome is not bound by PRDM9, the DMC1 signal is strongly elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting persistent DMC1 foci and consistent with delayed DSB repair at these sites. In addition, fewer homologous recombination events occur at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2019b</xref>) implying that (eventual) DSB repair may sometimes use a sister chromosome pathway. However, the underlying mechanism(s) by which PRDM9 effectively contributes to DSB repair are not yet known.</p><p>PRDM9 deposits both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 histone methylation marks at the sites it binds, and this methyltransferase activity is essential for its role in DSB positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Diagouraga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Powers et al., 2016</xref>). What factors ‘read’ this unique combination of marks at recombination sites, however, is currently unknown. Notably, outside of hotspots and the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) on sex chromosomes, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 occur at largely non-overlapping locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Powers et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting potentially highly specialised reader(s). Indeed, in somatic cells H3K4me3 is deposited mainly at promoters, in particular by the SET1 complex targeted by CXXC1/CFP1 and Wdr82 which binds Ser5 phosphorylated polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee and Skalnik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee and Skalnik, 2005</xref>). H3K36me3 is deposited by different methyltransferases, including SETD2 bound to Ser2 phosphorylated (elongating) polymerase II, and is enriched at exon-bound nucleosomes, particularly for 3’ exons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McDaniel and Strahl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagner and Carpenter, 2012</xref>). H3K36me3 has multiple important roles, including in directing DNA methylation by recruiting DNMT3B, somatic DSB repair by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aymard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carvalho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pfister et al., 2014</xref>), mismatch repair by recruiting MSH6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2013</xref>), and V(D)J recombination during lymphopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ji et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Using single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse testis, we identified a set of genes co-expressed in (pre)leptotene cells which are highly enriched for genes involved in meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jung et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Zcwpw1</italic>, which ranks 3<sup>rd</sup> in this set after <italic>Prdm9</italic> (2<sup>nd</sup>), is of unknown function but contains two recognised protein domains: CW and PWWP, shown to individually bind H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rona et al., 2016</xref>). This raises the attractive possibility that ZCWPW1 might recognise and physically associate with the same marks deposited by PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jung et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In humans, <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> is expressed in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carithers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is also one of 104 genes specifically expressed in meiotic prophase within murine fetal ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Soh et al., 2015</xref>), further suggesting a conserved meiotic function. This was confirmed by a recent study showing that ZCWPW1 is required for male fertility in mice, with ZCWPW1 hypothesised to recruit the DSB machinery to hotspot sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2019a</xref>). Here, we show that ZCWPW1 co-evolves with PRDM9 and is recruited to recombination hotspots by the combination of histone marks deposited by PRDM9. However ZCWPW1 is not in fact required for the positioning of DSBs at PRDM9-bound sites, which occurs normally in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic>-null mice. Instead, ZCWPW1 is required for proper inter-homologue interactions: synapsis and the repair of DSBs. In <italic>Zcwpw1</italic>-null mice, DMC1 dynamics are strongly perturbed, with signals at autosomal hotspots resembling those on the X-chromosome, which does not have a homologue. Thus, ZCWPW1 represents the first protein directly positioned by PRDM9’s dual histone marks, but impacting homologous DSB repair, not positioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>ZCWPW1</italic> co-evolves with <italic>PRDM9</italic></title><p>Based on publicly available databases, we identified likely ZCWPW1 orthologues in 167 species (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), aligned each to the human reference ZCWPW1 protein sequence, and compared against a previous analysis of PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>).

Additionally, there is a region of moderate conservation downstream of the PWWP domain, not overlapping any known domain.

Furthermore, with the exception of a small number of amphibians, <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> orthologues are only identified in clades previously identified to possess <italic>PRDM9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>), and the majority of species (78% of 167) possessing <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> also possess a close relative (species or family) where <italic>PRDM9</italic> is identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>We leveraged a previous analysis of <italic>PRDM9</italic> evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>) to extend this comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source datas 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">2</xref>). Among seven clades previously shown to possess <italic>PRDM9</italic> copies with all N-terminal domains (KRAB, SSXRD and PR/SET domains) intact, <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> is found in each case, typically in the same species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In some species with several <italic>PRDM9</italic> copies, including many teleost fish and two other confirmed independent events, <italic>PRDM9</italic> has lost N-terminal domain sequences in some but not all copies, while in at least three further species clades, particular N-terminal domains have been lost in <italic>all PRDM9</italic> copies, but the PR/SET domain remains intact. <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> is also found across these cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), so it is widely conserved across species possessing one or more copies of <italic>PRDM9</italic> with an intact PR/SET domain.</p><p>Previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>), three independent groups of species have been identified possessing mutations in the PR/SET domain of PRDM9, at key catalytic residues for the deposition of the H3K4me3/H3K36me3 mark(s). Complete loss of <italic>PRDM9</italic> is also identified in three groups: bird/crocodiles, canids, and (tentatively) amphibians. Given that ZCWPW1 is predicted to recognise the H3K4me3/H3K36me3 marks catalysed by the PR/SET domain of PRDM9, we would expect each of these six events to disrupt any potential interaction between the two proteins. Strikingly, we failed to identify <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> orthologues in any of the previously examined species impacted by these six events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), except in canids (and one amphibian species). Thus, at least four of the six may be completely mirrored by <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> loss. Even if <italic>PRDM9</italic> is retained, species with PR/SET domain mutations are much more likely not to possess an identified <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> orthologue within their class/phylum compared to species without such mutations (odds ratio = 285; indicative p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup> by FET, although we note that these observations are not all independent).</p><p>In conclusion, among vertebrates at least, it appears the set of species with <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> is extremely similar to those species possessing <italic>PRDM9</italic> with an intact PR/SET domain, with considerable evidence of co-evolution of gain/loss events for each protein. In some species with apparently intact PR/SET domains (for example Tasmanian Devil, Mexican Tetra, Platypus), it is hypothesised that PRDM9 does not position DSBs due to loss of other N-terminal domains and/or the PRDM9 zinc-finger array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>). These example species still possess identified <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> orthologues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), so it does not seem that PRDM9’s ability to position DSBs is essential for retention of <italic>ZCWPW1</italic>. Instead, our results are consistent with ZCWPW1’s main function involving recognition of the histone modifications catalysed by PRDM9-SET during early meiosis, in agreement with the functional evidence from ZCWPW1’s CW and PWWP domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Localisation of ZCWPW1 in meiosis and analysis of asynapsis in infertile <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male mice</title><p>We previously detected <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> transcript expression in pre-leptotene to leptotene spermatocytes of adult WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jung et al., 2019</xref>).

Notably, the strength of ZCWPW1 binding in HEK293T cells at human PRDM9-binding sites provides a better predictor of human meiotic DMC1 binding status (a proxy for DSB formation) than does human PRDM9 binding strength itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>).

While we cannot rule out a direct interaction between ZCWPW1 and PRDM9, others have shown that dual modified peptides have a greater affinity to ZCWPW1 than peptides carrying the single modifications, supporting that the marks themselves are responsible for ZCWPW1’s recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref>). We examined transcription start sites, which possess H3K4me3 at high levels, but lack H3K36me3, observing some ZCWPW1 signal at these sites, but with a uniformly lower mean ZCWPW1 enrichment compared to those with evidence of PRDM9 binding (and hence both histone marks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although it is not possible to measure H3K4me3 presence/absence in <italic>individual</italic> cells in our system, even the most weakly bound PRDM9 sites – which must therefore possess H3K4me3 in only a fraction of cells – show stronger ZCWPW1 enrichment than the strongest promoters, which are likely to have near 100% H3K4me3 marking, and possess &gt;2 fold more H3K4me3 than even the strongest PRDM9-binding sites. We conclude that H3K4me3 alone endows only relatively weak binding, while PRDM9 is therefore able to recruit ZCWPW1 with a much greater efficiency than sites marked by H3K4me3 alone, suggesting that both histone modifications might aid efficient binding. While the increase in ZCWPW1 enrichment at sites with pre-existing H3K4me3 is consistent with both marks contributing to recruitment, we have no evidence that these weaker binding sites serve a functional role, and indeed concurrent investigations did not find strong evidence of ZCWPW1-driven transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>PRDM9-bound regions (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) are a stronger recruiter of ZCWPW1 than promoters (H3K4me3 only).</title><p>For any given level of H3K4me3 (x-axis), ZCWPW1 enrichment (y-axis) is higher at PRDM9-bound regions (red) than regions with pre-existing H3K4me3 (promoters, blue). H3K4me3 and ZCWPW1 were force called in 100bp windows across all autosomes.

Alternatively, the Z<italic>cwpw1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutant phenotypes we observe might reflect a more downstream role.

This might be explained by small differences in chromatin accessibility subtly impacting SPO11 locations, DNA end resection which generates the 3’ ssDNA tail to which DMC1 binds, or downstream processing differences altering DMC1 span in the mutant mice.</p><p>Despite very similar DSB locations, we saw much greater, and systematic, differences in the strength of the DMC1 signal at individual hotspots. As previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khil et al., 2012</xref>), we note that observed average DMC1 signal strength at a hotspot reflects the product of the frequency at which DSBs occur there, and the average length of time DMC1 remains bound to the ssDNA repair intermediate, with the latter reflecting DSB processing/repair time. In contrast, available SPO11 oligo-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lange et al., 2016</xref>) reflect mainly the frequency of DSBs. We therefore compared DMC1 and SPO11 signal strength at each autosomal and X-chromosome hotspot, in WT and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male mice. In WT mice, the non-PAR X-chromosome shows a very strong elevation of DMC1 signal strength (as seen previously in other mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2016</xref>] including, albeit somewhat more weakly, even sterile hybrids). This elevation reflects the persistent DMC1 foci on this chromosome also visible using microscopy, at DSB sites that eventually repair using the sister chromatid. Moreover, in WT mice there is a sub-linear (curved) relationship between SPO11 and DMC1 at hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This is thought to reflect a wider phenomenon of faster DSB repair occurring within those hotspots whose homologue is more strongly bound by PRDM9, that is those hotspots with a stronger H3K4me3 signal in the WT mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2019b</xref>). The X-chromosome DMC1 elevation is in a sense an extreme case of slower repair of DSBs whose homologue is not PRDM9-bound, because no homologue exists in this case.</p><p>However, we see a striking departure in the <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse, where the X-chromosome behaves more similarly to the autosomes with respect to DMC1 vs WT SPO11 signal strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Moreover, we see a simple linear relationship between DMC1 and WT SPO11 binding in this mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This implies that the effect of PRDM9 binding on DMC1 removal is eliminated in this mouse (assuming SPO11 levels are not greatly affected by <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO); so PRDM9 appears unable to ‘assist’ in homologue pairing and synapsis in this mouse (whether because ZCWPW1 directly aids the process, or indirectly). Indeed, the data imply a widespread perturbation of DSB repair in this mouse, with autosomal DMC1 foci persisting as long as those on the X-chromosome. In the previously studied <italic>Hop2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khil et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Petukhova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smagulova et al., 2011</xref>), we identified a very similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>): in this mouse, DMC1 is loaded onto ssDNA, but DSBs are not repaired at all, indicating that DSB repair pathways in <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are profoundly altered.</p><p>These results are consistent with, and extend, our microscopy observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) that many DSBs persist in the <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse, and some may never repair. We are unable to say whether DSB repair involves the homologue or not in this mouse, but the partial synapsis we observe suggests some repair does likely occur. To further understand DMC1 persistence at individual hotspots, we estimated the relative DMC1 heat of autosomal hotspots in the <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse, compared to the WT mouse. The best individual predictor of this ratio among H3K4me3, DMC1, and SPO11 in WT was the level of H3K4me3 (r = 0.60 Generalised Additive Model; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>, while r = 0.63 when using all three predictors together). The average KO:WT DMC1 ratio increases around ninefold from the most weakly to the most strongly H3K4me3-marked hotspots. Therefore, if DMC1 signal changes are indeed explained by slower DSB processing in the <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse at hotspots bound strongly by PRDM9, then this implies a very strong effect of PRDM9’s ‘assistance’ in aiding repair. Whatever the cause, the overall strong correlation implies perturbation of DMC1 behaviour is widespread, rather than impacting any small subset of hotspots. Moreover, it appears to be mainly controlled by local levels of PRDM9 histone modification, in keeping with the evidence that ZCWPW1 recognises this mark at PRDM9-bound sites, on either the broken or (identical) homologous chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ZCWPW1 binds CpG dinucleotides</title><p>In addition to the strong PRDM9-dependent ZCWPW1 peaks described earlier, there are many locations in HEK293T cells at which ZCWPW1 binds, typically more weakly, and independently of PRDM9.

Alus with no CpGs were bound at a rate lower than by chance, but almost all Alus containing 10–20 CpGs are bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This dependence is not Alu-specific: even outside genomic repeats, 300bp regions with zero CpGs have negligible probability of overlapping a ZCWPW1 binding site, while the overlap probability rises to &gt;50% for regions containing 10 or more CpGs, suggesting CpGs are essential for PRDM9-independent ZCWPW1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We show that the histone methylation reader ZCWPW1, which is both highly co-expressed and co-evolving with PRDM9, is recruited by PRDM9 to its binding sites, likely mediated through the recognition of the dual H3K4me3-H3K36me3 histone mark that PRDM9 deposits.</p><p>Like Mahgoub and colleagues in a parallel analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref>), we find co-evolution of ZCWPW1 with PRDM9, consistent with proteins functioning in the same pathway. We find that this association appears to depend on particular domains. ZCWPW1 co-occurs with PRDM9 in species where PRDM9 possesses a SET domain predicted to retain catalytic activity for H3K4me3/H3K36me3, which the domains of ZCWPW1 are predicted to recognise, strongly suggesting a partnership totally dependent on this recognition. This co-occurrence can persist even in species where PRDM9 is not believed to position DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting the co-operation between these proteins does not completely depend on this aspect of PRDM9’s function. Interestingly, a predicted functional SET domain of PRDM9 mainly occurs when PRDM9 possesses a SSXRD domain, which in other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banito et al., 2018</xref>) recruits CXXC2 which binds to CpG islands – whether this connects to our observation of a potential CpG-binding domain in ZCWPW1, and CpG-binding behaviour in a human cell line, remains to be explored.</p><p>A recent study reported phenotyping of an independent <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2019a</xref>), and we observe similar complete loss of fertility in males, but not in young females. Why females deficient for ZCWPW1 are initially fertile (but lose fertility by ~8 months; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2019a</xref>) is unknown, but resembles sexual dimorphism in loss-of-function mutants for other meiotic genes involved in homologous recombination, where females exhibit a milder fertility phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cahoon and Libuda, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Morelli and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, we observe a distinct intracellular localisation of ZCWPW1 from that reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2019a</xref>): while we also detect ZCWPW1 as a diffuse nuclear signal across the nucleus (although excluding the chromocenters) and localisation to the XY body in pachytene, we see an additional signal in mid-pachytene to diplotene cells at the ends of the synaptonemal complex. This might reflect the specificity of our polyclonal antibody, which is raised against the full-length mouse protein vs a monoclonal antibody raised against a C-terminal region, hence recognising a wider spectrum of ZCWPW1. Given that the <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse arrests in early pachytene, it is not possible to test later stages, so a caveat is that we cannot completely exclude off-target antibody recognition. If accurate, the late-stage localisation of ZCWPW1 at subtelomeric regions resembles other proteins (Speedy A, CDK2, TFR1, SUN1, TERB1/2, MAJIN, and KASH), which form a complex tethering the telomeres to the nuclear envelope to facilitate chromosome movement and pairing — essential for synapsis and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Horn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shibuya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tu et al., 2017</xref>). However, no evidence of impaired telomeric attachment was reported in the other <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup> </italic>mutant, based on normal localisation of TRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>In parallel with this work, two other studies of ZCWPW1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref> have performed complementary analyses, and together with our own results allow some clear conclusions to be drawn. We mapped positions of ZCWPW1 recruitment (of the human protein) in mitotic HEK293T cells, in the presence of human or chimpanzee PRDM9 and compared to assayed peaks for PRDM9, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altemose et al., 2017</xref>). We find that in co-transfected HEK293T cells ZCWPW1 is strongly recruited to PRDM9-bound sites, in an allele-specific manner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref> also report <italic>PRDM9</italic> allele-specific recruitment of ZCWPW1, but in hybrid mice carrying <italic>Prdm9</italic><sup>Dom2</sup> and <italic>Prdm9</italic><sup>Cast</sup> alleles which encode proteins with distinct zinc finger array DNA binding specificities. Together with ZCWPW1 binding measurements from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2020</xref>, these results imply that across PRDM9 alleles and species - humans, mice, and likely chimpanzees - PRDM9 binding alone is sufficient to strongly recruit ZCWPW1 without requiring DSB formation (which does not occur in our system) or meiosis-specific co-factors (which would not be expected to be present in our cellular system).</p><p>A likely explanation of this recruitment is recognition of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 that PRDM9 deposits by the CW and PWWP domains of ZCWPW1 respectively. Previously, Li and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2019a</xref>) showed co-immunoprecipitation of H3K4me3 with ZCWPW1. In HEK293T cells we observed that ZCWPW1 recruitment correlates with the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 that PRDM9 deposits, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2020</xref> reported that in mice with a non-functional CW domain no ZCWPW1 binding peaks were observed, suggesting that H3K4me3 recognition at least might be necessary for the recruitment of ZCWPW1 at hotspots in vivo. However, H3K4me3 cannot be the only factor because we observed much stronger recruitment of ZCWPW1 to PRDM9 binding sites than to other sites possessing similar H3K4me3 levels, which might be explained by the additional presence of H3K36me3 at PRDM9 binding sites increasing ZCWPW1’s recognition and/or its stable association at these sites. Indeed in cells with PRDM9, the strongest ZCWPW1-binding sites are almost all PRDM9-bound sites. Similarly in mice, &gt;85% of ZCWPW1 peaks overlap both marks concomitantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref> additionally reported that in vitro binding affinity of recombinant mouse ZCWPW1 is at least five fold greater for dual-modified H3K4me3/K36me3 peptides compared to peptides carrying the single modifications. Together, this paints a clear picture that ZCWPW1 likely directly recognises sites possessing the dual histone marks deposited by the PRDM9-HELLS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>), the first such protein identified. Our evolutionary analyses suggest that this function might occur across almost all species where PRDM9 deposits these marks, even species where PRDM9 does not specify DSB locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although it was suggested that ZCWPW1 might recruit the DSB machinery to PRDM9 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>), we and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref> (using distinct assays) find that DSB positioning is completely unaffected by loss of ZCWPW1. However, the additional role PRDM9 plays besides DSB positioning, in enabling homologous chromosome pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2019b</xref>), apparently malfunctions in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Our DMC1 data, together with microscopy data, are most easily explained if, unlike in WT, DSBs at sites bound more strongly by PRDM9 do not repair more quickly. Instead, in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> males, all DSBs behave similarly to those on the X-chromosome — which repairs DSBs very slowly, even in WT animals, and does not synapse. This implies an unexpected role for ZCWPW1: in aiding PRDM9 in its second function, synapsis. ZCWPW1 therefore offers a (thus far) unique protein, directly recruited by PRDM9 binding and so linking PRDM9 binding with its downstream functions in aiding rapid DSB processing/repair at hotspots whose homologue is bound by PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>PRDM9 is thought to aid homology search/chromosome pairing by such binding to the homologous chromosome, and hybrids where hotspots are highly ‘asymmetric’ (i.e. the homologues are not bound at the sites where DSBs occur, due to evolutionary hotspot erosion) show multiple features identical to <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. These include asynapsis, persistent DMC1 foci (at the asymmetric hotspots), and complete sterility in males only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davies et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, unlike in WT mice, there are many persistent DMC1 foci and we observe that even strong PRDM9 binding to the homologue causes no reduction in DMC1 persistence. These mice therefore behave, in many ways, as if all hotspots are completely asymmetric. Thus, a parsimonious explanation of our findings is that ZCWPW1 functions by attaching to PRDM9-bound sites on the matching homologous chromosome, thus marking possible repair partner locations for DSB sites, to help pair homologues. This might for example lead to recruitment to the chromosomal axis (where DMC1 foci are found), for potential use as the homologous repair template of DSBs, perhaps mediated by the SCP-1-like domain identified in some (although not all) orthologous copies. Given we observe ZCWPW1 throughout the nucleus in early meiosis, such recruitment would likely be transient in nature. Alternatively, ZCWPW1’s part in mediating PRDM9’s downstream roles might also depend (or even, depend only) on it binding the chromosome on which DSBs occur.</p><p>Given that we still observe some synapsis, similar to <italic>Prdm9<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, we suggest that a ‘back-up’ mechanism, which is independent of PRDM9 binding level, is acting to attempt homology search/chromosome pairing in <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. In fact, some such mechanism is likely necessary, to repair DSBs happening within a subset of hotspots that are asymmetric due to naturally occurring variation (as seen in for example humans and heterozygous mice). If our observed &gt;9 fold changes in relative DMC1 levels for strongly vs weakly bound hotspots purely reflect increased DMC1 persistence, it might be that this mechanism is greatly slower than the PRDM9-dependent pathway for WT mice. In turn, this could explain many – or all – of the downstream phenotypes in these mice, as consequences of delayed homology search.</p><p>The simplest explanation of our observation that ZCWPW1 binds weakly to many sites in a CpG-dependent manner in HEK293T cells is that these sites might be directly bound by a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) putatively observed in the human, mouse, and coelacanth <italic>Zcwpw1</italic>, among others. Alternatively, recruitment might be indirect, with ZCWPW1 forming a complex with an MBD containing protein, for example SETDB1 which is expressed in HEK293T cells, co-expressed with ZCWPW1 and PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schultz et al., 2002</xref>), and interacts with several other identified PRDM9 partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mulligan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parvanov et al., 2017</xref>). Given the precisely regulated developmental changes in methylation status, ZCWPW1/PRDM9 protein abundance, and chromatin during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaysinskaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seisenberger et al., 2013</xref>) it is unclear whether ZCWPW1 binding will also be affected by CpGs in vivo. Although more modest, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2020</xref> did also report enrichment of ZCWPW1 at B1 elements in mice, the closest equivalent of human Alus. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2020</xref> also observed overlap of ZCWPW1 peaks with CpG islands (CGI) more frequently than expected. Given (i) they and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahgoub et al., 2020</xref> detect a much lower number of peaks (14,688 and 4,487 respectively) than we do in our HEK293T system (800,000), and (ii) we only find Alu enrichment in weaker ZCWPW1 peaks (of our top 10,000 peaks, &gt;90% would be PRDM9-bound sites), these results are not conflicting, and instead might depend on detection/behaviour of weaker peaks, and/or presence of PRDM9 in ZCWPW1-containing cells. If CpG dinucleotides do (although weakly, relative to PRDM9) affect in vivo ZCWPW1 binding affinity and given that CpG methylation is associated with transposons, it is interesting to speculate whether ZCWPW1 might play a role in germline transposon recognition, silencing, or facilitate repair of DSBs occurring within transposable elements.</p><p><italic>Zcwpw1</italic> possesses a paralogue, <italic>Zcwpw2</italic>, which is also co-expressed in testis with <italic>Prdm9</italic> (although at a lower level), contains both CW and PWWP domains, and is able to recognise H3K4me3 at least (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Further studies are required to investigate what function if any <italic>Zcwpw2</italic> has in meiosis. One interesting possibility is that ZCWPW2, rather than ZCWPW1, might act to help position DSBs – if so, its low abundance relative to ZCWPW1 would be analogous to the low number of DSBs per meiosis (~300) relative to the number of PRDM9 binding sites.</p><p>In this study, we have shown that <italic>Z</italic>CWPW1 co-evolves with PRDM9, binds to sites marked by PRDM9, and is required for the proper processing, removal of DMC1, and repair of DSBs. How exactly it mediates repair, if for example by recruitment of other proteins, remains to be determined. This study also further demonstrates that genes co-expressed with <italic>Prdm9</italic> represent a rich source of undiscovered meiotic genes, with important functional implications for recombination, meiosis progression and ultimately fertility. ZCWPW1 impacts synapsis, downstream of DSB formation. Therefore the protein(s) responsible for recognising PRDM9-marked sites for DSB formation, and for aiding synapsis, are at least partly different, and we anticipate that future studies will likely uncover additional PRDM9-recruited proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (167 species)</td><td valign="top"><italic>ZCWPW1</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper using BlastP and tBLASTn (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>), NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) and Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ens.embl.org">www.ens.embl.org</ext-link>)</td><td valign="top">Details in Materials and methods</td><td valign="top">Also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (225 species)</td><td valign="top"><italic>PRDM9</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref> (doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24133">10.7554/eLife.24133</ext-link>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Zcwpw1<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Toronto Centre for Phenogeno-mics (Canada)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_CMMR:ADVN">IMSR_CMMR:ADVN</ext-link>; <break/>Strain name C57BL/6N-Zcwpw1<sup>em1(IMPC)Tcp</sup></td><td valign="top">Constitutive knock out for Zcwpw1 carrying a 1485bp CRISPR/Cas9-induced deletion (chr5:137799545–13780101029)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Prdm9</italic><sup>-/-</sup></td><td valign="top">RIKEN BioResource Research Center (Japan)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3624989">MGI:3624989</ext-link>; Strain name B6.129P2-Prdm9 &lt; tm1Ymat&gt;, strain number RBRC05145</td><td valign="top">Originating article <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Embryonic Epithelial Kidney</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">Cat.

Secondly, we downloaded the two sets of Ensembl identified ZCWPW1 orthologues (against ENSMUSG00000037108.13; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ensembl.org">ensembl.org</ext-link>, 105 orthologues), and identified NCBI ZCWPW1 protein orthologues (146 species, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>). Initial examination of identified orthologues revealed conservation among orthologues mainly of the CW and PWWP domains; therefore, to find additional orthologous sequences we performed tBLASTn (against the nr/nt nucleotide collection 17<sup>th</sup> July 2019; top 1000 hits) to identify orthologues in the NCBI nucleotide database, to the partial sequence (amino acids 256–339 of the reference sequence NP_060454.3), corresponding to the CW and PWWP domains of ZCWPW1. Protein sequences were then aligned against full-length human ZCWPW1 (NP_060454.3) using BLASTP2.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altschul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>). We obtained taxonomy information from the NIH classification <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/new_taxdump/">https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/new_taxdump/</ext-link>, for comparisons among species and between ZCWPW1 and PRDM9.</p><p>Previous work has identified highly conserved ‘KWR’ and ‘PWWP’ patterns among CW and PWWP domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Qin and Min, 2014</xref>). We thus identified an initial set of ‘clear’ ZCWPW1 orthologues, and then used these to identify further less precise matches. ‘Clear’ orthologues are defined as proteins within set one containing perfect matches to both these sequences, and such that in the NCBI alignment, at least 39% of each sequence aligns to the human protein, and conversely. This second step is required to avoid spurious matches to, for example, ZCWPW2, which overlaps 19% of ZCWPW1, by requiring &gt;2 fold this match length; although several <italic>ZCWPW2</italic> copies are in our initial list, no gene annotated as most similar to <italic>ZCWPW2</italic> attains the 39% overlap. For proteins within the ‘clear’ set, we identified the longest alignment for each given species, resulting in 136 species with a likely ZCWPW1 orthologue. This initial screen identified three groups of fish, placental mammals, marsupials, monotremes and reptiles as likely possessing ZCWPW1, similar to our final conclusions. Moreover, it defined amino acids 247–428 in the human reference sequence as being conserved in the alignment (at most one sequence not aligning), including the annotated CW and PWWP domains.</p><p>Using this initial set, we identified additional orthologous sequences and refined our results, by identifying conserved bases within ZCWPW1. Specifically, we divided the 136 species into major clades, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>, and gave each sequence a weighting so that the overall weight for each clade was the same (so, for example, each Placental mammal sequence was downweighted as this clade was over-represented). Within the consistently aligned region 247–428, we calculated the overall weighted probability of each of the 20 amino acids, or a gap (adding 10<sup>−5</sup> to exclude zero weights). This identified 31 completely conserved amino acids, and 78 amino acids whose entropy was below 1 (equivalent to two amino acids having equal probability, so implying one amino acid present in &gt;50% of species). Finally, we defined ZCWPW1 orthologues as those sequences matching at least 90% of those 31 perfectly conserved bases which were aligned, and aligning to at least 50% of these bases (this last condition allows for inclusion of incomplete sequencing or protein assembly). We note that while this 90% condition is arbitrary, by definition all annotated orthologues exceed this threshold, while thresholds below ~70–80% are exceeded by orthologues of <italic>ZCWPW2</italic> among other genes, offering some justification. Nonetheless, it is worth pointing out that our analysis does not rule out the existence of more poorly conserved <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> copies in more distantly related species. This approach identified a final set of 167 genes, which we annotated as likely <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> orthologues and used for the majority of results. For each <italic>ZCWPW1</italic> orthologue, we also identified the taxonomic relationship of the closest species possessing such a <italic>PRDM9</italic> copy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We also reciprocally annotated each PRDM9 copy previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>) according to the closest species also possessing ZCWPW1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses revealed a relationship between ZCWPW1 predicted functional domains and PRDM9 histone modifications. Therefore, we identified additional potential conserved sites by identifying perfectly conserved bases among those species possessing <italic>both</italic> ZCWPW1 and PRDM9 orthologues, and where three key SET domain catalytic amino acids within PRDM9 are intact, meaning PRDM9 is predicted to have normal histone modification activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2017</xref>). This identified a slightly larger number of conserved amino acids (37). Only eight of these varied in any of the 167 species with a potential ZCWPW1 orthologue: 260, 404 and 411 (in two <italic>Xenopus</italic> frogs, with 411 also in white-headed capuchin), 19 and 22 (in three canines), 25 (in Ocelot gecko), 257 (in Anolis lizard and in Wombat), 325 (in elephantfish). While these changes might alter ZCWPW1 function, the true behaviour of ZCWPW1 is uncertain in these cases, although it is interesting that canids and frogs represent clades that all appear to have lost PRDM9, and possess multiple, clustered, amino acid changes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Domain search</title><p>pDomThreader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lobley et al., 2009</xref>) was used via the PSIPRED server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/">http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/</ext-link>) on the following uniProt amino acid sequences (Q9H0M4|ZCPW1_HUMAN, Q6IR42|ZCPW1_MOUSE, E2RFJ2|E2RFJ2_CANLF, M3XJ39_LATCH, A0A3S5ZP38_BOVIN, M3WDY6_FELCA, and G3ULT5|G3ULT5_LOXAF) all of which identified a match to 1ub1A00 in the C terminal section after the PWWP domain, except in LOXAF in which this match was slightly below the p-value threshold of 0.001.</p><p>SCP1 prediction used NCBI conserved domain search server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi?">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi?</ext-link>) with the uniProt amino acid sequences Q9H0M4|ZCPW1_HUMAN and Q6IR42|ZCPW1_MOUSE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mice and genotyping</title><p>KO mice for <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> (C57BL/6N-Zcwpw1<sup>em1(IMPC)Tcp</sup>) were generated by the Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics (Canada).

Motif centered coordinates were used for WT hotspots where the motif positions were inferred using the MotifFinder software and PRDM9 position weight matrices from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altemose et al., 2017</xref>. To normalise background signal, the mean signal between −5000 and −3000 was subtracted from each strand-mouse combination. Mean coverage was normalised by the sum of coverage over each strand-mouse combination across both WT and KO locations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Mapping of alu CpGs</title><p>Alu locations were downloaded from UCSC tables and filtered for Alu repeats with a width between 250 and 350bp. DNA sequence was extracted from the genome (Ensembl 95 h38 primary assembly) at these locations using the bedtools getfasta command and CpG dinucleotides were counted using ‘stringr::str_locate_all’ command in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>CpG methylation</title><p>Data is from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Libertini et al., 2015</xref> (GSE51867), non CpG methylated sites were removed, and the two strands were summed.

Human testis DMC1 sites are from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pratto et al., 2014</xref> (GSE59836) and were subsetted to ‘A or B’ autosomal peaks with a width less than 3kb. These peaks were then trimmed to a maximum of 800bp before overlapping with PRDM9 peaks to create a binary target variable. Regions with input coverage ≤5 in either predictor were removed in addition to outliers with input &gt;200 and/or ZCWPW1 enrichment &gt;10. A binomial generalised linear model with a logit link (logistic regression) was fitted using the ‘glm’ function from the ‘stats’ package in R (3.6.0). Chromosomes 1, 3, and 5 were used as the test data with the remaining autosomes being the training data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Heatmaps</title><p>Regions were extracted from bigWig using bwtool matrix-fill = 0 -decimals = 1 -tiled-averages=5, and width parameters 2000. Coverage was normalised by total coverage (scaled by 10<sup>10</sup>). A pseudocount of 1 was added to both input and sample, and the sample was then normalised by the input for each region. Values outside the quantile range 0.01–0.99 were thresholded. The profile plots are created by taking the ratio of the mean coverage of the sample and input separately. Ordering of the regions was determined by the mean coverage of a 200bp window centered on the peak center.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Software</title><p>Computational analysis was performed using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>) and snakemake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Köster and Rahmann, 2012</xref>).

publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The identification of <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> is an important step in understanding the regulation of meiotic DSB repair, and the analysis performed both in mice and in cells provide novel information and complementary to those of the two other papers published on this same topic.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;ZCWPW1 is recruited to recombination hotspots by PRDM9, and is essential for meiotic double strand break repair&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bernard de Massy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors characterise a new protein, ZCWPW1, that is co-expressed with PRDM9 in mouse, a protein that has been shown to specify meiotic SPO11-DSB hotspot locations via the zinc-finger domain, and histone-trimethylation activity. The authors demonstrate the parallel phylogeny between ZCWPW1 and PRDM9. The authors analyse ZCWPW1 KO mice and show DSB repair and synapsis defects, with a proper DSB activity and localization. By assaying ZCWPW1 chromatin binding in HEK cells, the authors also show that ZCWPW1 has binding affinity for CpG rich DNA.</p><p>This study provides novel and interesting information about meiotic DSB control in mice. Most of the conclusions are convincing, however several interpretations required additional experimental support and the presentation of the data requires revision and clarification.</p><p>Importantly, as the authors have submitted their manuscript at the same time as the ones from Mahgoub et al. and Huang et al. , the results from these two papers have to be integrated in the Discussion to provide a more coherent view or to point out discrepancies if any — i.e. what is the meaning of the ZCWPW1 enrichment detected in HEK as compared to the signal detected in spermatocytes? What are the potential implications on the role of ZCWPW1 on gene and TE expression? What is the dynamic of RPA2 in ZCWPW1 KO?</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Show the specificity of the antibody for ZCWPW1 vs ZCWPW2.</p><p>2) Revise cytology of ZCWPW1 KO: solve the discrepancy about DMC1 vs RPA2, and refer to other manuscripts for complementary data.</p><p>3) Revise interpretation about DSB repair phenotype: Conclusion should be toned down. ZCWPW1 may also affect DSB formation.</p><p>4) Clarify several points in data presentation (in particular HEK cells data, genomic data and figures). It is unfortunate that many figures are poorly prepared, difficult to understand and thus requiring a lot of time to read and evaluate.</p><p>5) Consider presenting DSB analysis by ChIP-seq DMC1 after the cytology results.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) General comment about mouse data presentation: for all data, provide age, number of mice and number of nuclei counted (complete the transparent reporting form accordingly).</p><p>2) General comment about NGS data: for all figures, make sure to label properly x and y axes with explanation of units and scales, explain color labels and how curves were calculated, explained which regions are being analysed.</p><p>3) Abstract: &quot;persistent DMC1 foci, particularly those more strongly bound by PRDM9&quot;: This sentence is a very incorrect shortcut: persistence of DMC1 at specific hotspots has not been evaluated by cytology but by ChIP, and no direct correlation with strength of PRDM9 binding is presented.</p><p>4) Introduction final paragraph. There are many proteins that are positioned in response to DSBs generated at PRDM9-binding sites (e.g. MRE11, RAD51, DMC1 etc). Please revise.</p><p>5) Results first paragraph. It would help to have a clearer description of these data and how they relate to the graph in Figure 1B. What do the values on the Y-axis indicate?</p><p>6) Results paragraph two-four are hard to follow without small summary tables and/or simple bar plots or possibly pie-charts. Pointing at the large Table S1 was not helpful.</p><p>It is not fully clear if the six independent losses are birds + crocodiles, three groups of fishes, canids, amphibians; please clarify. Then, what is defined as the first four losses? Birds + crocodiles and fishes? What are these mutations? Are they predicted to be loss of function? The succession of comparisons of groups of species is confusing. What is the group discussed and mentioned as: &quot;they mainly retain ZCWPW1&quot;?. What is the need to add this statement at this point of the presentation of the results? In addition, it is not correct that this pattern is expected. The a priori expectation depends on whether ZCWPW1 is the only reader of those marks, for instance, it could also depend on whether this reading activity is essential.</p><p>7) Figure 2: The pachytene nucleus should be defined: if it is neither early nor late, it should be mid-?</p><p>Add antigen names on figure. Provide separate channels in supplement.</p><p>8) Paragraph two subsection “Localisation of ZCWPW1 in meiosis and details of asynapsis in infertile male <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice” (with Jung reference). This is confusingly placed. I suggest opening this paragraph with this published information, then describe the new observations within the manuscript.</p><p>9) Figure 3—figure supplement 1B is referred to before Figure 3—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>10) The text mentions lack of MLH1 foci (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), yet no mention of these observations within this figure or elsewhere can be found in the manuscript. Please amend/clarify.</p><p>11) Please add relevant references to the PRDM9 phenotype/observations.</p><p>12) It is not the best definition of RAD51 to qualify it as a ssDNA binding protein. It is above all a strand exchange protein that binds to both ss and dsDNA (and three-strand DNA as well).</p><p>13) “ In contrast, there was no difference in the levels of RPA2 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).”. This statement is inappropriate without clear evidence (and in contradiction with Li et al.). Please quantify RPA2 foci as graphs in a similar way to the DMC1 and RAD51 data. If unclear, the authors could also test MEIOB foci.</p><p>14) Figure 3E. I assume it is implicit that each value is for one mouse, and data are in triplicate or duplicate for <italic>Prdm9</italic>? Please clarify.</p><p>15) Figure 4. How were the categories Early Z, Z (MidZ?), Late Z defined?</p><p>16) Please aid reader by clarifying what asynapsed chromosomes are (HORMAD2-positive). Question: Sometimes unsynapsed is used, sometimes asynapsed is used. If there is a distinction, please clarify for the reader what is meant, or instead, please consolidate and choose a single term for clarity.</p><p>17) Please define FISH.</p><p>18) Figure S9. Why do most (but not all) groups overlap? (e.g. Chr 2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 6-7, 7-8, 8.9, 16-17, 17-18, 18-19). Are observations sometimes placed in two bins, and sometimes not? This seems problematic and unnecessary to make the point.</p><p>19) Comparisons of synapsis between ZCWPW1 KO and <italic>Prdm9</italic> KO. An alternative hypothesis is for the distinct phenotype is a difference in the genetic background. ZCWPW1 is B6N and <italic>Prdm9</italic> is B6x129 hybrid probably with a certain number (?) of backcrosses. Subtle differences in checkpoint, cell cycle progression could affect the phenotype. Were mice compared at identical ages? Maybe complementary information could be available from other <italic>Prdm9</italic> deficient alleles. What about sterile hybrids?</p><p>20) Supplementary table 1 should have a legend, explain columns titles (for instance Y276, 341, 357, Max sum…)</p><p>21) Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Revise: This spread must be from WT not from <italic>ZCWPW1<sup>-/-</sup>.</italic></p><p>22) ZCWPW1 staining is only at one of the two ends and it looks as if it is the centromeric end; please provide data to solve this ambiguity by labeling centromeres for instance. Also, as mentioned above, prove that this signal is not ZCWPW2.</p><p>23) Figure 3—figure supplement 1A. Where is the wild type? Wild type nuclei that have been treated in parallel and image acquisition with identical parameters must be shown.</p><p>24) Data not shown: please show data referred to in lanes 855 (western blots), 891 (IP with pre-immune serum).</p><p>25) Supplementary Figure 9: This analysis requires more documentation: representative images of the nuclei with immuno and FISH signals, and table of raw data (values for axis lengths and synapsis). Why are 18 and 19, or 18 and 17 not distinguished?</p><p>26) Figure 5—figure supplement 3. Clarify the legend title. It is unclear where the conclusion comes from. One assumes blue hexagons (actually misleading: the shape is invisible, just look like spheres) are <italic>Prdm9</italic> bound. I also understand the X axis is data from Zcpwp1 transfected alone. So, the binding at these non-<italic>Prdm9</italic> site does not change when <italic>Prdm9</italic> is co-transfected. Please clarify.</p><p>27) Are ZCWPW1, ZCWPW2 and <italic>Prdm9</italic> expressed in HEK cells? If yes, at which level and can it have consequence on interpretation of the data? Is the HA-ZCWPW1 fully functional?</p><p>28) Figure 5A. How is &quot;Enrichment&quot; calculated? It is mentioned with vs without PRDM9. Is it a ratio? Is this a log scale? For ZCWPW1 around human PRDM9 sites, it appears that the enrichment spans much more than just the peak region where PRDM9 binds. It would be extremely helpful to be able to compare these analyses to a similar aggregation of PRDM9 and H3K4me3 around the same sites. Y axis: homogenize: 2 or 2.0.</p><p>Why is the enrichment not down to 1 with <italic>Prdm9</italic> transfection?</p><p>Provide western blots to assay whether ZCWPW1 levels are identical in different analysis (with normalization for transfection efficiency).</p><p>Analyze quantitatively the correlation between ZCWPW1 and <italic>Prdm9</italic> binding.</p><p>29) Please clarify what is meant by &quot;sequence-specific binding&quot;, and please describe how the data presented in Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 3 support this interpretation.</p><p>30) “ However, upon transfection, 91% (98%) of the strongest 10,132 (3,016) peaks are PRDM9 binding sites (cf. 7% expected overlap with randomised peaks), so PRDM9 is able to strongly reprogram ZCWPW1 binding, suggesting that non-PRDM9 peaks are bound more weakly.”. What does the value in parentheses (3,016) mean? This sentence as written is hard to follow. Please simplify.</p><p>31) Figure 5—figure supplement 5. Add labels to A and B panels.</p><p>Panel A: It seems that ZCWPW1 correlates poorly with cPRDM9. Why is this? What about transfecting chimp ZCWPW1? Do the same correlation plot with human proteins. Could there be some species-specific interactions, despite the nearly identical sequences of human and chimp proteins? Please provide the plot (heatmap/average plot) of H3K4me3 at cPRDM9 peaks.</p><p>Panel B: What is the difference with Figure 5B?</p><p>32) Paragraph three of subsection “ZCWPW1 is recruited to PRDM9 binding sites in an allele-specific manner”. Please expand this section so that the average reader can appreciate and understand the analysis that was performed. Figure 5—figure supplement 6 is hard to follow, please clarify. Where is the logistic regression methods?</p><p>33) You mean DMC1 sites in meiosis? Clarify to avoid confusion between transfected cells and meiotic cells.</p><p>34) “…although we show (see below) that ZCWPW1 is not directly involved in DSB positioning, this might suggest involvement of similar features to those it recognizes, in recruiting DSBs”. Is hard to follow. It will help if the last &quot;it&quot; was clarified to read &quot;ZCWPW1&quot;.</p><p>35) Figure 6—figure supplement 1. Please label and explain the dashed horizontal lines.</p><p>36) The casual reader may be misled into thinking that the authors have tested for recruitment of ZCWPW1 to sites that have &quot;dual&quot; modifications. Unless I am mistaken, these are independent correlations to each mark, with no evidence that the histone marks exist coincidentally at the same locus in the same cell. Please clarify this section accordingly. Also, a direct interaction of PRDM9 with ZCWPW1 would be enough to explain specificity.</p><p>37) Figure 6—figure supplement 2. Please clarify the X-axis. Is the &quot;+0.01&quot; an offset added to each value in order to present on log scale? Please describe what analysis was performed and why.</p><p>38) Figure 6. Please clarify the analysis presented here. Do the 100bp windows cover the whole genome without other filtering? The legend is unintelligible, so it is very hard to interpret what is being presented. Untransfected means what: no PRDM9 and no ZCWPW1? &quot;No untransfected H3K4me3&quot; does not make sense. Both plots (red point and blue points) show ~2.5 fold increase from left to right (from 2 to 5 vs from 0.8 to 2). As such, is there really a difference if &quot;predictive&quot; power of the H3K4me3 at the red vs blue sites? Plotting the data on a Y-log scale (since enrichment is a ratio after all isn't it?) might help demonstrate this lack of difference more clearly. i.e. the blue curve only looks different to the red because it has been flattened by the linear Y scale.</p><p>Why is the distribution of H3K4me3 shifted to lower values in the red subset?</p><p>What does input fragment coverage mean? Do we agree that Input is chromatin before IP?</p><p>39) Figure S16. Please label panels. It was unclear what these data were attempting to test/demonstrate. Perhaps some manual annotations (and clarified legend and axes labels) would help? Explaining what the subsets are (and how they were obtained) is critical.</p><p>40) Figure 7C is referred to before 7B.</p><p>41) Figure 7A. The shaded labelling of 5' and 3' strands is unclear. Please replace with a clearer presentation style (different colours or dashed perhaps?). 7B presumably merges both strands, please clarify. Please homogenize X-axis labelling in A and B to be clearer (i.e. PRDM9 motif centre). Please use same units in both graphs (bp or kb).</p><p>42) Please show some raw DMC1 SSDS data from some example loci in order to demonstrate the lack of change ±ZCWPW1.</p><p>43) Paragraph two of subsection “DSBs occur at their normal locations in <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice but show altered DMC1 persistence”. Broader? Based on what? Why is the DMC1 signal so irregular in the ZCWPW1 KO? What are the number of reads (Type I and Type II) in WT and KO?</p><p>44) Figure 7—figure supplement 1. This figure is very hard to understand. What does Heat&gt;0 mean in legend? What does &quot;Fraction of hotter hotspots&quot; on Y-axis mean?</p><p>45) Figure 7C. Like many other figures, it is unclear what is being presented here. The legend has no explanation for the different colours (blue and black curves for example). The red/orange colour scale itself means what? What are the units? Why is the H3K4me3 relevant here?</p><p>In addition, it should be made to the reader that interpretation form this figure requires one additional assumption: i.e. that SPO11 oligos levels are not affected in ZCWPW1 KO. The authors should make clear that only WT data of SPO11 oligos is available.</p><p>46) Figure 7—figure supplement 2. Please label panels A, B, C. Please revise the text in the legend. It is very hard to follow. Adding manual annotations to the plots would help greatly – something as simple as: Hotspots relative to PRDM9 binding motif: upstream (red), downstream (black), central (green).</p><p>47) The Lange data would be more accurately described as SPO11-oligo seq.</p><p>48) Please refer to Figure 7C.</p><p>49) Figure 7—figure supplement 3. Please add panel labels. Please add units for axes. Are they log-scale? Please add wild type presented in exactly the same way as the two mutants for comparison.</p><p>It seems that the DMC1 data is interpreted as indication that ZCWPW1 promotes repair at hotter hotspots preferentially (the Abstract says: persistent DMC1 foci, particularly those more strongly bound by PRDM9, see also comment about this sentence). This conclusion is not convincing, ZCWPW1 KO may have the same effect as <italic>Hop2</italic> KO on DMC1 persistence (although the conclusion that the pattern is similar is an oversimplification, Y axis value are very different in the two strains): as a result of DSB repair defect, DMC1 level is proportional to DSB activity.</p><p>In addition, the authors cannot exclude that ZCWPW1 has a role on DSB activity and that DSB activity is increased in ZCWPW1 KO: it could be a direct effect: ZCWPW1 could compete with other readers, and/or indirect: synapsis defect allowing for a prolonged window for DSB activity with effects that may not be uniform across hotspots.</p><p>Accordingly, the statement, that DSB formation and positioning are completely unaffected is too strong.</p><p>50) Figure 7—figure supplement 4. Please present the other correlation plots that are mentioned in the text (DMC1 and SPO11) for comparison. Y-axis is a ratio so should be in log scale (or Log2 values)?</p><p>51) Please explain where the 9-fold effect is shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 4. Please clarify how the authors concluded this implies a &quot;very strong effect&quot; and a very strong effect of <italic>what</italic>? Of slower repair? Of H3K4me3? Of DMC1?</p><p>52) It is worth noting that the correspondence of ZCWPW1 occupancy with Alu repeats is also readily apparent in Figure 5C. And easier to visually interpret than the data presented in Figure 8.</p><p>53) Figure 5—figure supplement 2. Like many others, this figure needs revision. The labelling and presentation are poor and confusing: What utH3K4me3 means? In the middle, cells are cotransfected with ZCWPW1 and PRDM9 but peaks in red are ZCWPW1 alone? How is this possible?</p><p>54) Subsection “ZCWPW1 binds CpG dinucleotides” paragraph one. Please explain in the main text how the Figures 8A and Figure 5—figure supplement 2 support this statement.</p><p>55) Is it possible that the apparent Alu and CpG enrichment of ZCWPW1 by ChIP is due to lack of antibody specificity?</p><p>56) Use of &quot;in vitro&quot; is misleading. Instead ex vivo could be used, or in somatic cells.</p><p>57) Figure 8. Is this CpG binding still detected in the presence of <italic>Prdm9</italic>?</p><p>58) Extract the curve of ZCWPW1 enrichment at non-<italic>Prdm9</italic> sites in the presence of <italic>Prdm9</italic>, and test whether it follows the same distribution as in Figure 8A.</p><p>59) Discussion paragraph three: present differences with the cited paper and explain.</p><p>60) Discussion paragraph four. To quote HEK293 cells as a model system is very misleading. It is in no way a model system for meiosis. The authors have to indicate that this cell nuclei have a completely different environment as compared to meiotic cells. Therefore, extrapolation of any data to meiosis is only hypothetical, even it is coherent and follows some expectations.</p><p>61) ZCWPW1 does not directly recognize <italic>Prdm9</italic> binding sites: A <italic>Prdm9</italic> binding site is a DNA sequence.</p><p>62) Since the authors cite Spruce et al. paper they cannot write that ZCWPW1 is the first protein that recognizes regions bound by PRDM9.</p><p>63) Graphical abstract: how could the authors write that the functional importance of the marks has remained unknown? They have been shown to be essential for meiotic DSB formation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53392.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Importantly, as the authors have submitted their manuscript at the same time as the ones from Mahgoub et al. and Huang et al. , the results from these two papers have to be integrated in the Discussion to provide a more coherent view or to point out discrepancies if any — i.e.: what is the meaning of the ZCWPW1 enrichment detected in HEK as compared to the signal detected in spermatocytes? What are the potential implications on the role of ZCWPW1 on gene and TE expression? What is the dynamic of RPA2 in ZCWPW1 KO?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their kind words, and we believe we have thoroughly addressed these substantive points and the specific points in our revised manuscript. All changes are tracked in the revised manuscript file.</p><p>As requested, we have now added a number of references to the related work on ZCWPW1 by Maghoub et al. and Huang et al. in the Results and Discussion sections, highlighting relevant evidence to integrate these studies into a coherent view:</p><p>i) “While we cannot rule out a direct interaction between ZCWPW1 and PRDM9, others have shown that dual modified peptides have a greater affinity to ZCWPW1 than peptides carrying the single modifications, supporting that the marks themselves are responsible for ZCWPW1’s recruitment (Mahgoub et al., 2020).”</p><p>ii) “Like Mahgoub and colleagues in a similar analysis (Mahgoub et al., 2020), we find co-evolution of ZCWPW1 with PRDM9, consistent with proteins functioning in the same pathway.”</p><p>iii) “In parallel with this work, two other studies of ZCWPW1 (Mahgoub et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) have reached complementary conclusions, and together with our own results allow some clear conclusions to be drawn.”</p><p>iv) “We find that in co-transfected HEK293T cells ZCWPW1 is strongly recruited to PRDM9-bound sites, in an allele-specific manner. Mahgoub et al., 2020, also report <italic>PRDM9</italic> allele-specific recruitment of ZCWPW1, but in hybrid mice carrying <italic>Prdm9<sup>Dom2</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm9<sup>Cast</sup></italic> alleles which encode proteins with distinct zinc finger array DNA binding specificities. Together with ZCWPW1 binding measurements from Huang et al., 2020, these results imply that across <italic>PRDM9</italic> alleles and species – humans, mice, and likely chimpanzees – PRDM9 binding alone is sufficient to strongly recruit ZCWPW1 without requiring DSB formation (which does not occur in our system) or meiosis-specific co-factors (which would not be expected to be present in our cellular system).”</p><p>v) “In HEK293T cells we observed ZCWPW1 recruitment depends on the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 that PRDM9 deposits, while Huang et al., 2020, reported that in mice with a non-functional CW domain no ZCWPW1 binding peaks were observed, suggesting that H3K4me3 recognition at least might be necessary for the recruitment of ZCWPW1 at hotspots in vivo.”</p><p>vi) “Indeed in cells with PRDM9, the strongest ZCWPW1 binding sites are almost all PRDM9-bound sites. Similarly in mice, &gt;85% of ZCWPW1 peaks overlap both marks concomitantly (Huang et al., 2020; Mahgoub et al., 2020). Mahgoub et al., 2020, additionally reported that in vitro binding affinity of recombinant mouse ZCWPW1 is at least 5 fold greater for dual-modified H3K4me3/K36me3 peptides compared to peptides carrying the single modifications.”</p><p>vii) “Although it was suggested that ZCWPW1 might recruit the DSB machinery to PRDM9 binding sites (M. Li et al., 2019; Spruce et al., 2020), we and Mahgoub et al., 2020, (using distinct assays) find that DSB positioning is completely unaffected by loss of ZCWPW1.”</p><p>viii) “Although more modest, Huang et al., 2020, did also report enrichment of ZCWPW1 at B1 elements in mice, the closest equivalent of human Alus. Unlike Mahgoub et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2020, also observed overlap of ZCWPW1 peaks with CpG islands (CGI) more frequently than expected. Given (i) they and Mahgoub et al., 2020, detect (Mahgoub et al., 2020) a much lower number of peaks (14,688 and 4,487 respectively) than we do in our HEK293T system (800,000), and (ii) we only find Alu enrichment in weaker ZCWPW1 peaks (of our top 10,000 peaks, &gt;90% would instead be PRDM9-bound sites), these results are not conflicting, and instead might depend on detection/behaviour of weaker peaks, and/or presence of PRDM9 in ZCWPW1-containing cells.”</p><p>In their published manuscript Huang et al., 2020, conclude from their RNA-seq analysis of <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice “These results strongly suggest that ZCWPW1 may not affect the transcription level of many genes sharing promoter overlap with ZCWPW1”, and so we have not commented on the implications of ZCWPW1 as a transcription co-factor as previously speculated by Huang et al. in their preprint.</p><p>See point 13 regarding the analysis of RPA2 dynamics in the <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO mouse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Show the specificity of the antibody for ZCWPW1 vs ZCWPW2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is essential to exclude any potential cross-reactivity with ZCWPW2 of our polyclonal antibody. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, we now include evidence (previously mentioned only as “data not shown”) that: (i) the pre-immune serum does not detect any signal in mid-zygotene or early pachytene cells strongly labelled by the ZCWPW1 antiserum by immunofluorescence (IF) in B6 mouse testis nuclear spreads (panel B); (ii) there is no detection of ZCWPW2 by IP and WB at the 38KDa molecular weight range predicted for mouse ZCWPW2, only a single band is observed at the expected molecular weight for ZCWPW1 (panel C). We also (iii) use HEK293T cells transfected with either FLAG-tagged mouse ZCWPW1 or ZCWPW2 to show detection of ZCWPW1 by IP and WB (panel D) and IF (panel E), but not ZCWPW2, by the antiserum (and no detection by the pre-immune serum), even at the high expression levels likely in this system.</p><p>Because we think it is likely ZCWPW2 (whose expression timing is similar to ZCWPW1) is still expressed in the <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO mouse, the complete loss of signal detected in IF staining by the ZCWPW1 antiserum in this mouse also suggests strong specificity to ZCWPW1.</p><p>The validation data are now referred to, in the relevant section, as: “To investigate the role of ZCWPW1 during meiosis in vivo, we produced and validated the specificity of an antibody against the full-length recombinant mouse protein (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), and … meiotic recombination.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Revise cytology of ZCWPW1 KO: solve the discrepancy about DMC1 vs RPA2, and refer to other manuscripts for complementary data.</p><p>3) Revise interpretation about DSB repair phenotype: Conclusion should be toned down. ZCWPW1 may also affect DSB formation</p><p>4) Clarify several points in data presentation (in particular HEK cells data, genomic data and figures). It is unfortunate that many figures are poorly prepared, difficult to understand and thus requiring a lot of time to read and evaluate.</p><p>5) Consider presenting DSB analysis by ChIP-seq DMC1 after the cytology results.</p></disp-quote><p>We address these points where they arise below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>1) General comment about mouse data presentation: for all data, provide age, number of mice and number of nuclei counted (complete the transparent reporting form accordingly).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the legend of all relevant figures (Figures 2-4, 7 and Supplements) to include this information which is also provided for each individual mouse used in the study in Figure 3—source data 1 and 2. For instance, Figure 2 legend now reads “Nuclear spreads from 9-10 weeks old B6 mice were immunostained with antibodies against ZCWPW1… These images are representative of the results obtained in 3 mice.” We have completed the transparent reporting form accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) General comment about NGS data: for all figures, make sure to label properly x and y axes with explanation of units and scales, explain color labels and how curves were calculated, explained which regions are being analysed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. The legends for Figures 1, 5 (and supplement 3 and 6), 6 (and supplements 1 and 2), 7 (and supplements 1, 2, 3 and 4), and 8 have been revised to include this information on the graphs and/or in the relevant legend. For example, we revised the legend of Figure 7C to add the sentences “Black dashed line is y=x for reference. SPO11 and DMC1 enrichment have been scaled by dividing by the mean autosomal enrichment. Large blue and dark red points show mean DMC1 signal binned into groups containing equal numbers of hotspots by WT SPO11 signal (vertical lines: corresponding 95% CIs), for X and autosomal data respectively.” in addition to revising the axis titles to specify “Scaled” and adding a legend for the (now simplified) colour scheme of the points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Abstract: &quot;persistent DMC1 foci, particularly those more strongly bound by PRDM9&quot;: This sentence is a very incorrect shortcut: persistence of DMC1 at specific hotspots has not been evaluated by cytology but by ChIP, and no direct correlation with strength of PRDM9 binding is presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree there are some caveats needed for this sentence, so due to lack of space in the Abstract we have simply deleted the phrase “particularly those more strongly bound by PRDM9”. We do think there is some evidence for this statement in the sense that we observe persistent foci by cytology but fairly normal break formation (both in the cytology and normal DMC1 ChIP-seq hotspot locations), implying an overall increase in DMC1 persistence. Then we observe a similar behaviour in DMC1 data for the X-chromosome and autosomes in the KO mouse, with a relative increase in those autosomal hotspots which are more active in DSB formation – which we would argue generally reflects stronger binding, and noting this phenomenon happens widely across all hotspots fairly similarly. It is then difficult not to conclude both (i) persistence increases overall for all hotspots, and (ii) persistent breaks occur particularly at the hotter hotspots (which will also contribute most of the breaks overall, i.e. cytologically visible signals of recombination). Indeed, many weaker hotspots become less detectable in our DMC1 ChIP-seq data in the KO mouse, so common, persistent breaks cannot be occurring at these hotspots even if the explanation is, they don’t break so often.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Introduction final paragraph. There are many proteins that are positioned in response to DSBs generated at PRDM9-binding sites (e.g. MRE11, RAD51, DMC1 etc). Please revise.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have edited this to read “directly positioned by PRDM9’s dual histone marks”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Results first paragraph. It would help to have a clearer description of these data and how they relate to the graph in Figure 1B. What do the values on the Y-axis indicate?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a note to the legend to properly define the Y-axis: “Jensen-Shanon divergence normalised to mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 is shown on the y-axis (a measure of sequence conservation, see (Capra and Singh, 2007; Johansson and Toh, 2010))”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Results paragraph two-four are hard to follow without small summary tables and/or simple bar plots or possibly pie-charts. Pointing at the large Table S1 was not helpful.</p><p>It is not fully clear if the six independent losses are birds + crocodiles, three groups of fishes, canids, amphibians; please clarify. Then, what is defined as the first four losses? Birds + crocodiles and fishes? What are these mutations? Are they predicted to be loss of function? The succession of comparisons of groups of species is confusing. What is the group discussed and mentioned as: &quot;they mainly retain ZCWPW1 &quot;?. What is the need to add this statement at this point of the presentation of the results? In addition, it is not correct that this pattern is expected. The a priori expectation depends on whether ZCWPW1 is the only reader of those marks, for instance, it could also depend on whether this reading activity is essential.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has now been reworded throughout, to clarify the points raised. We have also added two new panels to Figure 1, showing bar plots summarising overlap between different groups of species and (i) whether PRDM9 is observed, when ZCWPW1 is present (panel C), and (ii) whether ZCWPW1 is observed, when PRDM9 is present and shows various independent evolutionary events (panel D). For the last point above, we wanted to relate the co-evolution data to the various domains of the two proteins and their predicted functions, but agree that the a priori expectation was clumsily worded, and it is now stated differently.</p><p>We now state that the likely “complete” losses (of PRDM9’s ability to catalyse H3K4me3/K36me3 deposition) are in the three groups of fishes (3 distinct losses), bird/crocodiles, amphibians, canids. We also now more clearly plot comparable loss events of other PRDM9 domains. We also show the loss events on the bar plot (the evolutionary history of PRDM9 is complex, involves many duplications and complete or partial losses of the protein, and there is considerable uncertainty for individual species, but we have attempted to summarize accurately the known events and overall patterns).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 2: The pachytene nucleus should be defined: if it is neither early nor late, it should be mid-?</p><p>Add antigen names on figure. Provide separate channels in supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2 was revised as suggested, now indicating “mid-Leptotene”, “mid-Zygotene”, “mid-Pachytene” and mid-Diplotene stages, and the target proteins have been added directly to the panels. Separate channels are now provided for this staining in revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, and this is referred to in Figure 2 legend as “Images for the individual channels are provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Paragraph two subsection “Localisation of ZCWPW1 in meiosis and details of asynapsis in infertile male Zcwpw1<sup>-/-</sup> mice” (with Jung reference). This is confusingly placed.

This statement is inappropriate without clear evidence (and in contradiction with Li et al.). Please quantify RPA2 foci as graphs in a similar way to the DMC1 and RAD51 data. If unclear, the authors could also test MEIOB foci.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified RPA2 foci in the <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO mouse across the meiotic stages of prophase 1. The counts are presented as a graph in Figure 4—figure supplement 2B with the raw data in Figure 4—source data 1.

An alternative hypothesis is for the distinct phenotype is a difference in the genetic background. ZCWPW1 is B6N and Prdm9 is B6x129 hybrid probably with a certain number (?) of backcrosses. Subtle differences in checkpoint, cell cycle progression could affect the phenotype. Were mice compared at identical ages? Maybe complementary information could be available from other Prdm9 deficient alleles. What about sterile hybrids?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree differences in genetic background are a potential source of phenotypic variation, and indeed could explain partly or fully the apparent differences in meiotic defects observed between the two mutants. We have revised the paragraph to include this alternative. The mice from the 2 mutant lines were reasonably age-matched (within 2-3 weeks, see detail in Figure 3—source data 1). For the last point we agree, though time has not permitted us so far to perform a paired comparison of the meiotic phenotype of the <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO mouse with that of other <italic>Prdm9</italic> deficient strains (KRAB or SSXRD deletion mutants for instance), or mice with different combinations of alleles such as (PWDxB6) F1 hybrid infertile males where high levels of asymmetric PRDM9 binding are present.

To quantify whether foci are at one, both ends or neither, in the revisions we quantified the number of chromosomes showing ZCWPW1 foci at either, or both, ends by FISH using telomeric and centromeric probes (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 2; raw data in Figure 2—source data 1). The results show that in some stages (late pachytene-diplotene) most chromosomes exhibit ZCWPW1 foci at both ends, while if foci (at least those observable via microscopy) are at one end only, this is mainly the centromeric end. We have revised the text now reading “Using Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridisation (FISH) to label centromeric and telomeric (distal and proximal to centromeres) regions of chromosomes, we established that these discrete foci of ZCWPW1 are consistently positioned at the ends of the synaptonemal complex, with the majority at both ends simultaneously, lying close to telomeres and centromeres themselves (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).” The specificity of the antibody for ZCWPW1 versus ZCWPW2 is now demonstrated in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) SupFig4A.

To ensure this is the case in our cell line stock, we have carried out a quantitative analysis of transcript expression by RT-PCR. The results presented in Figure 5—source data 1 show extremely low (<italic>PRDM9</italic> and <italic>ZCWPW1</italic>) to no (<italic>ZCWPW2</italic>) detectable gene expression in untransfected cells. Such levels are highly unlikely to confound the interpretation of the data in cells transfected with ZCWPW1 and/or PRDM9 where the expression is on average 800-1000 or 75,000-84,000 fold higher, respectively. Similarly, in a dataset from 10X genomics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/293t">https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/293t</ext-link>) these three genes have very low, almost undetectable, expression in HEK293T cells (mean transcript count per cell of 0.036, 0.013, and 0.001, where median total transcript count per cell was 14,338). We added a statement in the relevant section of the results : “To test this, we co-transfected HEK293T cells … and then performed ChIP-seq against the ZCWPW1 tag (the endogenous levels of these proteins in HEK293T cells, and of the closely related family member ZCWPW2, are extremely low so unlikely to confound the analysis – see Figure 5—source data 1).”</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53392-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the HA-ZCWPW1 fully functional?</p></disp-quote><p>We are uncertain of all the functional properties of this protein but note that we validated the predicted function of full length (HA-tagged) human ZCWPW1 as a dual histone methyl reader by demonstrating its preferential recruitment to PRDM9-bounds sites enriched in both histone marks. These results are in line with the expected behaviour. The C-terminal 9 amino acid small HA tag is located away from the internal CW and PWWP functional domains, and so is we hope unlikely to strongly confound the normal function of the protein. We note that others have specifically demonstrated binding of recombinant (His-tagged) mouse ZCWPW1 (residues 1-440 encompassing the CW and PWWP domains) to dual-modified H3K4me3/K36me3 peptides with a greater (over 5 fold) affinity compared to peptides carrying the single modifications in histone peptide assays in vitro (Mahgoub et al., 2020).

Instead, the higher background enrichment reflects higher regional (but not fully local) background effects, for example driven by some broad regions of the genome being more generally accessible, and other low level peaks also falling in the region surrounding one peak, on average. To demonstrate this, if we instead take locations randomly between 15kb and 10kb downstream of each peak (blue line) and calculate the profile there and overlay, we find that the locally higher background is consistent with the value the peak profile reaches.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Black: Profile of peaks.</title><p>Blue: profile of locations 15 to 10kb downstream.

Why is this?</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, ZCWPW1 in cells co-transfected with cPRDM9 still exhibits a large and clear enrichment at cPRDM9 sites, so we certainly do see allele-specific co-localisation. However, there are quantitative differences, with ZCWPW1 showing weaker enrichment for cPRDM9 than hPRDM9, in co-transfected cells. Although we do not know with certainty the reasons for this effect (which might operate differently in true meiotic cells with a different background chromatin environment), we have noted that cPRDM9 binds at sites with different broad-scale properties to hPRDM9, including more heterochromatic sites. Also, for example, cPRDM9 binding is not enriched at promoter regions. These properties might impact PRDM9’s deposition of histone modifications, and through this or another mechanism slightly weaken ZCWPW1’s ability to recognize bound sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What about transfecting chimp ZCWPW1?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not been able to explore chimp ZCWPW1 in this publication for reasons of time, but we agree it would indeed be an interesting avenue of research for the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the same correlation plot with human proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer means the heatmaps for human PRDM9 locations, which are provided as Figure 5B (see also comment below about panel B in reply to 31f).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could there be some species-specific interactions, despite the nearly identical sequences of human and chimp proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>Although this is a good question, we don’t yet have data to answer it. Our working model is that the mechanism of action of ZCWPW1 is through the histone methylation marks deposited by PRDM9 rather than by directly binding PRDM9 itself – for example allowing flexibility in populations where PRDM9 is polymorphic. In this case the interaction might be expected to be quite similar for both human and chimp PRDM9. It is though possible that PRDM9 may directly bind ZCWPW1, or ZCWPW1 might have additional specificities (e.g. the CpG recognition) and/or recruit different proteins depending on human and chimp versions, but we have not explored this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please provide the plot (heatmap/average plot) of H3K4me3 at cPRDM9 peaks.</p></disp-quote><p>H3K4me3 (without any transfection) at cPRDM9 peaks is shown in column 7 “Untransfected H3K4me3”.

The parallel behaviour emphasizes that this property remains for any level of H3K4me3. The relevant variable is the presence of PRDM9 (perhaps mediated by H3K36me3 or another mark), and not H3K4me3 which is similarly present in both subsets. We have as suggested replaced the plot with a y-log version although as explained above our interpretation of the data is unchanged: the red and blue subsets are still almost completely separated by the black dotted line. We have added the following sentence to the legend which we hope will guide the reader on the interpretation of this plot “For any given level of H3K4me3 (x-axis), ZCWPW1 enrichment (y-axis) is higher at PRDM9 bound regions (red) than regions with pre-existing H3K4me3 (promoters, blue).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is the distribution of H3K4me3 shifted to lower values in the red subset?</p></disp-quote><p>The blue subset is, in effect, promoter regions – which have very high H3K4me3 levels (plausibly close to ~100% of some histones being marked at the highest levels).

Based on what?</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the broader comment here, as this is discussed with more precision in the following paragraph “slightly wider […] (Figure 7B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is the DMC1 signal so irregular in the ZCWPW1 KO? What are the number of reads (Type I and Type II) in WT and KO?</p></disp-quote><p>As guessed by the reviewer the KO DMC1 signal has more variance, due to the lower number of both read types obtained (&lt; ½), from a single infertile mouse:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>44) Figure 7—figure supplement 1. This figure is very hard to understand. What does Heat&gt;0 mean in legend?</p></disp-quote><p>As per the legend, heat refers to DMC1 signal, so Heat&gt;0 therefore refers to hotspots with a DMC1 signal above 0. We have relabeled to “DMC1&gt;0” for ease of understanding of this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What does &quot;Fraction of hotter hotspots&quot; on Y-axis mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the axis titles to be clearer as follows. Y: “Fraction of WT hotspots falling in each KO DMC1 bucket for all hotspots with WT DMC1 ≥ a given x-axis value” and X: “WT hotspot DMC1 heat relative to strongest”. We also added the following explanation to the caption to guide the reader in how to read the plot: “Y-axis values at x = 0 show the fraction of all hotspots falling into the buckets shown in the inset colour legend. […] Therefore, almost all WT hotspots with activity &gt;20% of the hottest hotspot are observed, and non-observed hotspots show only weak activity in WT, and so our power to detect them is expected to be reduced.”</p><p>What this figure shows is that although we do not detect all hotspots present in the WT mouse in the KO, we do detect many, and almost all the high-heat hotspots, suggesting those not observed are explained by being weaker and fewer reads meaning we lack power in the KO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>45) Figure 7C. Like many other figures, it is unclear what is being presented here. The legend has no explanation for the different colours (blue and black curves for example). The red/orange colour scale itself means what? What are the units? Why is the H3K4me3 relevant here?</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies: we have simplified this figure by removing H3K4me3 colouring, so the colours of the points representing the binned means are more easily pairable with the data points. We have also added a legend directly to the figure to label the autosomal vs X chromosome points. We have also added the following to the caption:</p><p>“Unlike WT mice, DMC1 signals in <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are approximately linearly associated with WT SPO11. […] Large blue and dark red points show mean DMC1 signal binned into groups containing equal numbers of hotspots by WT SPO11 signal (vertical lines: corresponding 95% CIs), for X and autosomal data respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it should be made to the reader that interpretation form this figure requires one additional assumption: i.e. that SPO11 oligos levels are not affected in ZCWPW1 KO. The authors should make clear that only WT data of SPO11 oligos is available.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added the following clarification to the main text “assuming SPO11 levels are not greatly affected by ZCWPW1 KO”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>46) Figure 7—figure supplement 2. Please label panels A, B, C. Please revise the text in the legend. It is very hard to follow. Adding manual annotations to the plots would help greatly – something as simple as: Hotspots relative to PRDM9 binding motif: upstream (red), downstream (black), central (green).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added panel labels and reworded the legend including adding the suggested phrase to Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>47) The Lange data would be more accurately described as SPO11-oligo seq.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>48) Please refer to Figure 7C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>49) Figure 7—figure supplement 3. Please add panel labels. Please add units for axes. Are they log-scale? Please add wild type presented in exactly the same way as the two mutants for comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added panel labels, explained the scaling in the legend (&quot;SPO11 and DMC1 enrichment have been scaled by dividing by the mean autosomal enrichment.”) and added a WT version as panel C to Figure 7—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that the DMC1 data is interpreted as indication that ZCWPW1 promotes repair at hotter hotspots preferentially (the Abstract says: persistent DMC1 foci, particularly those more strongly bound by PRDM9, see also comment about this sentence). This conclusion is not convincing, ZCWPW1 KO may have the same effect as Hop2 KO on DMC1 persistence (although the conclusion that the pattern is similar is an oversimplification, Y axis value are very different in the two strains): as a result of DSB repair defect, DMC1 level is proportional to DSB activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the alternative hypothesis suggested by the reviewer “ZCWPW1 KO may have the same effect as <italic>Hop2</italic> KO […] as a result of DSB repair defect, DMC1 level is proportional to DSB activity.” is exactly what we are proposing. It’s because in the <italic>absence</italic> of a DBS repair defect hotter hotspots are repaired faster (in a non-linear manner, Figure 7C) (i.e. <italic>normally</italic> there is a non-linear effect), so if interpreted as a delay or failure in repair increasing DMC1 signal (as observed via microscopy also), the difference/fold-effect of the KO is greater at the hottest hotspots. The y-axis scaling is arbitrary (based on number of ChIP-seq reads, for the previously published <italic>Hop2</italic> KO data), and so does not impact this interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors cannot exclude that ZCWPW1 has a role on DSB activity and that DSB activity is increased in ZCWPW1 KO: it could be a direct effect: ZCWPW1 could compete with other readers, and/or indirect: synapsis defect allowing for a prolonged window for DSB activity with effects that may not be uniform across hotspots.</p><p>Accordingly, the statement, that DSB formation and positioning are completely unaffected is too strong.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed “formation” so it currently reads “DSB positioning is completely unaffected”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>50) Figure 7—figure supplement 4. Please present the other correlation plots that are mentioned in the text (DMC1 and SPO11) for comparison. Y-axis is a ratio so should be in log scale (or Log2 values)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these new plots as additional panels to Figure 7—figure supplement 4. We have also used log scales for these plots (although the relationship appears no longer linear on this scale).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>51) Please explain where the 9-fold effect is shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We have scaled each axis by dividing by the median, to make the 9 fold effect more obvious. Now the mean ratio starts at 1 on the left (y-axis) and increases to around 9 on the right.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please clarify how the authors concluded this implies a &quot;very strong effect&quot; and a very strong effect of what? Of slower repair? Of H3K4me3? Of DMC1?</p></disp-quote><p>A “very strong effect” is based on the 9 fold change (almost an order of magnitude) which seems reasonably described as very strong.</p><p>We have added the clarification “of PRDM9’s “assistance” in aiding repair”, regarding the effect referred to.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>52) It is worth noting that the correspondence of ZCWPW1 occupancy with Alu repeats is also readily apparent in Figure 5C. And easier to visually interpret than the data presented in Figure 8.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer(s) for pointing this out, and we have additionally referenced 5C to aid the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>53) Figure 5—figure supplement 2. Like many others, this figure needs revision. The labelling and presentation are poor and confusing: What utH3K4me3 means?</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 5—figure supplement 2 legend by expanding all abbreviations rather than explaining them in the caption – using &quot;Pre-existing” H3K4me3 instead of “untransfected”, and visually structuring the colour categories. We have also updated the caption to provide a more explicit description of what the panels and colours within show, now reading “For example dark green peaks are those which overlap with ZCWPW1 peaks when transfected alone, but not overlapping Human PRDM9 peaks, and not overlapping pre-existing H3K4me3 peaks but do overlap with Alu repeats. Pre-existing H3K4me3 refers to peaks found without PRDM9 or ZCWPW1 transfection.” and “In cells expressing ZCWPW1 in the presence (middle plot) but not in the absence (left plot) of PRDM9, the strongest peaks are dominated by PRDM9-bound sites marked by H3K4me3 (pink), while ZCWPW1 occupancy increases occur nearly exclusively at these sites, following co-transfection with PRDM9 (right plot).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the middle, cells are cotransfected with ZCWPW1 and PRDM9 but peaks in red are ZCWPW1 alone? How is this possible?</p></disp-quote><p>The graph shows “Proportion of ZCWPW1 peaks, ordered by enrichment of ZCWPW1 binding over input, overlapping various other marks”; only the light blue category represents peaks “Not [in] ZCWPW1 Alone” i.e. the co-transfected peaks are almost completely a subset of the “ZCWPW1 Alone” peaks (to rephrase the reviewers interpretation, the peaks in red are <italic>also</italic> present in “ZCWPW1 Alone”, see also Figure 5—figure supplement 3) resolving the impossibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>54) Subsection “ZCWPW1 binds CpG dinucleotides” paragraph one. Please explain in the main text how the Figures 8A and Figure 5—figure supplement 2 support this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We looked at this – the Y-axis of Figure 8A directly shows “Fraction of ZCWPW1 peaks that overlap Alu repeats” with values of greater than 75% for weaker ZCWPW1 peaks e.g. enrichment &lt;1 (much greater than expected by chance, as stated in the following sentence). Similarly, the y-axis of Figure 5—figure supplement 2 shows the fraction of ZCWPW1 peaks overlapping various marks, including Alus (in dark green). So, we think this is clear, but would be happy to include a specific edit if preferred.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>55) Is it possible that the apparent Alu and CpG enrichment of ZCWPW1 by ChIP is due to lack of antibody specificity?</p></disp-quote><p>The anti-HA antibody from Abcam (Ab9110) used for ChIP against (HA-tagged) ZCWPW1 is a highly specific and widely used ChIP-grade antibody. The negative control ChIP anti-HA in untransfected HEK293T cells for this experiment did not yield DNA in quantifiable amounts (below the range of detection of the Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity assay), therefore we believe ZCWPW1 does indeed (often weakly) bind Alus and CpGs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>56) Use of &quot;in vitro&quot; is misleading. Instead ex vivo could be used, or in somatic cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced this with “in HEK293T cells”. (We did not opt for “ex vivo” as this is preferred by some to only be used for experiments performed on <italic>primary tissue</italic> outside of the organism.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>57) Figure 8. Is this CpG binding still detected in the presence of Prdm9?</p></disp-quote><p>In these experiments, yes. However, we note that as they represent an average of many cells, with variable transfection efficiency, some cells have PRDM9 and some don’t. It may then be that in individual cells with PRDM9, ZCWPW1 is very strongly sequestered to PRDM9 sites away from non-hotspot CpG sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>58) Extract the curve of ZCWPW1 enrichment at non-Prdm9 sites in the presence of Prdm9, and test whether it follows the same distribution as in Figure 8A.</p></disp-quote><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref> we have calculated the curve both in the presence of PRDM9 (left column) and in absence (right column), as well as at all sites (top row) and at sites not bound by PRDM9 (bottom row) [as even in the absence of PRDM9 many ZCWPW1 binding sites overlap PRDM9 binding sites]. The curves all show effectively the same thing which is expected given the large overlap of site positions.</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53392-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>59) Discussion paragraph three: present differences with the cited paper and explain.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, these differences are now discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>60) Discussion paragraph four. To quote HEK293 cells as a model system is very misleading. It is in no way a model system for meiosis. The authors have to indicate that this cell nuclei have a completely different environment as compared to meiotic cells. Therefore, extrapolation of any data to meiosis is only hypothetical, even it is coherent and follows some expectations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this paragraph to give a clearer and more accurate description of this cellular system and its intended use. Given the mitotic nature of HEK293T cells, of course we never meant to claim these could be considered a model system of <italic>meiosis</italic> (as a process). However, they provide a suitable cellular system in which to study the <italic>direct</italic> DNA and histone binding properties of ectopically-expressed meiotic proteins, which are our focus in those experiments. The absence of a large number of meiotic proteins within these cells is consistent with the idea that recruitment of ZCWPW1 might require only PRDM9 and certainly rules out their necessity, and so in that sense is advantageous. In practice we do observe a strong overlap between human meiotic recombination hotspots and binding sites of both PRDM9, and (more strongly) sites where ZCWPW1 is present, attesting that though very different, mitotic cells can nevertheless give useful insights into molecular properties of these proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>61) ZCWPW1 does not directly recognize Prdm9 binding sites: A Prdm9 binding site is a DNA sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this to “PRDM9-marked sites”, making reference to the histone marks more explicit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>62) Since the authors cite Spruce et al. paper they cannot write that ZCWPW1 is the first protein that recognizes regions bound by PRDM9.</p></disp-quote><p>We are making a distinct claim here. HELLS is required for stable PRDM9 binding and recognises PRDM9 itself, independently of whether PRDM9 is bound to DNA. Once PRDM9 has bound however, ZCWPW1 is the first protein which recognises these PRDM9 marked sites. To clarify this we have reworded to “ZCWPW1 likely directly recognises sites marked by the dual histone marks deposited by the PRDM9-HELLS complex (Spruce et al., 2020), the first such protein identified.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>63) Graphical abstract: how could the authors write that the functional importance of the marks has remained unknown? They have been shown to be essential for meiotic DSB formation.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for this slip – we have changed this to state “but the mechanistic role of these marks”, because the protein(s) recognizing the marks have remained unclear.</p></body></sub-article></article>
