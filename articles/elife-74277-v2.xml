modifications in this process has not been systematically studied. Using deep-scale quantitative analysis of the phosphoproteome in mouse neocortical neurons, we found widespread and temporally complex changes during synaptic scaling up and down. We observed 424 bidirectionally modulated phosphosites that were strongly enriched for synapse-associated proteins, including S1539 in the autism spectrum disorder-associated synaptic scaffold protein Shank3. Using a parallel proteomic analysis performed on Shank3 isolated from rat neocortical neurons by immunoaffinity, we identified two sites that were persistently hypophosphorylated during scaling up and transiently hyperphosphorylated during scaling down: one (rat S1615) that corresponded to S1539 in mouse, and a second highly conserved site, rat S1586. The phosphorylation status of these sites modified the synaptic localization of Shank3 during scaling protocols, and dephosphorylation of these sites via PP2A activity was essential for the maintenance of synaptic scaling up. Finally, phosphomimetic mutations at these sites prevented scaling up but not down, while phosphodeficient mutations prevented scaling down but not up. These mutations did not impact baseline synaptic strength, indicating that they gate, rather than drive, the induction of synaptic scaling. Thus, an activity-dependent switch between hypo- and hyperphosphorylation at S1586 and S1615 of Shank3 enables scaling up or down, respectively. Collectively, our data show that activity-dependent phosphoproteome dynamics are important for the functional reconfiguration of synaptic scaffolds and can bias synapses toward upward or downward homeostatic plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic scaling</kwd><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS111562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turrigiano</surname><given-names>Gina G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014370</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>345485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turrigiano</surname><given-names>Gina G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 HL154711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jean Beltran</surname><given-names>Pierre M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013113</institution-id><institution>Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cottrell</surname><given-names>Jeffrey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activity-dependent bidirectional changes in phosphorylation of the autism-associated scaffold protein Shank3 are essential for the expression of homeostatic synaptic plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic scaling is an important form of homeostatic plasticity that bidirectionally adjusts synaptic weights in response to prolonged perturbations in firing, in the correct direction to stabilize neuron and circuit activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>). Synaptic scaling is expressed through changes in the postsynaptic accumulation of glutamate receptors that then lead to increases or decreases in postsynaptic strength. This form of plasticity is triggered by changes in calcium influx, transcription, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dörrbaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schanzenbächer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schanzenbächer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schaukowitch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steinmetz et al., 2016</xref>) and involves a complex remodeling of the postsynaptic density that relies on a number of scaffolding and trafficking pathways within individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gainey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Louros et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steinmetz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun and Turrigiano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venkatesan et al., 2020</xref>). While synaptic scaling protocols are known to induce complex changes in the phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Desch et al., 2021</xref>), the causal roles these changes might play in homeostatic plasticity are largely unexplored. Here, we show that synaptic scaling is accompanied by widespread and dynamic changes in the phosphoproteome that are especially enriched in synapse-associated proteins, and find that activity-dependent bidirectional changes in the phosphorylation state of the synaptic scaffold protein Shank3 are essential for the induction of synaptic scaling up and down.</p><p>Shank3 is a multidomain scaffold protein highly enriched at the postsynaptic density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Naisbitt et al., 1999</xref>) and interacts with a number of other scaffold and signaling proteins known to be important for synaptic scaling, such as Homer1 and the MAGUKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabrucker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang and Ehlers, 2013</xref>). Loss of function of human Shank3 is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), Phelan–McDermid syndrome, and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betancur and Buxbaum, 2013</xref>), indicating that Shank3 plays essential roles within the central nervous system. We recently showed that a cell-autonomous reduction in Shank3 is sufficient to completely abolish synaptic scaling up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tatavarty et al., 2020</xref>), but how exactly Shank3 facilitates activity-dependent homeostatic changes in synaptic glutamate receptor abundance, and whether changes in phosphorylation state are important in this process, are unknown.</p><p>Here, we employed liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantitatively profile changes in the synaptic phosphoproteome induced by scaling. We found widespread and temporally complex changes at many phosphosites (&gt;2000 for scaling up and &gt;3000 for scaling down), with strong enrichment for cytoskeletal and synapse-associated proteins. Of these phosphosites, 424 (representing 332 distinct proteins) were bidirectionally regulated during scaling up and down, including Shank3. Further analysis revealed two highly conserved adjacent sites on Shank3 (rat S1615 and rat S1586) that were persistently dephosphorylated during scaling up and were transiently hyperphosphorylated during scaling down. Dephosphorylation of Shank3 during scaling up was maintained by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) phosphatase activity, and reversing this dephosphorylation through PP2A inhibition also reversed synaptic scaling up. Finally, we found that mutating S1615 and S1586 to mimic (DD) phosphorylation blocked synaptic scaling up but not down, while mutating these sites to prevent (AA) phosphorylation blocked scaling down but not up. Taken together, these data show that hypophosphorylation of Shank3 through a PP2A-dependent process is essential for maintaining increased postsynaptic strength during scaling up and suggest that the phosphorylation state of Shank3 can bias synapses toward upward or downward synaptic scaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synaptic scaling protocols induce widespread and dynamic changes in the phosphoproteome</title><p>While changes in phosphorylation of synaptic proteins such as glutamate receptors are thought to play a role in the expression of homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandes and Carvalho, 2016</xref>), the full range of activity-dependent phosphorylation changes induced by synaptic scaling paradigms have not been characterized. We designed an LC-MS/MS experiment to identify dynamic changes in the phosphoproteome during the prolonged increases and decreases in activity that drive homeostatic plasticity. Cultured mouse neocortical neurons were treated in biological duplicates with either tetrodotoxin (TTX, to block action potential firing) or bicuculline (BIC, to enhance firing) for 5 min, 1 hr, 7 hr, or 24 hr, in addition to a control untreated group. Following proteolytic digestion with trypsin and LysC, the peptides were labeled with isobaric mass tag reagents (Tandem Mass Tag TMT) to enable sample multiplexing and precise relative quantification. After mixing, samples were fractionated offline and enriched for phosphopeptides prior to online LC-MS/MS to increase the depth of coverage of the proteome and phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A total of 31,840 phosphosites and 9643 proteins were quantified in the TTX-treated experiment, and 32,635 phosphosites and 9512 proteins were quantified in the BIC-treated experiment, altogether showing the high quality of this proteomics resource. Although biological replicates showed significant variance, the principal component analysis showed that replicate samples clustered together and followed the temporal progression of the experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>Differential abundance analysis was performed using a moderated <italic>F</italic>-test, identifying proteins and phosphosites with a statistically significant response to BIC or TTX treatment throughout the time course (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p-value&lt;0.10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1A–D</xref>).

Cluster analysis identified populations of phosphosites that increased or decreased during TTX treatment, with a range of temporal profiles; the BIC cluster analysis revealed similar complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, top). To understand the biological processes regulated by these temporal profiles, we performed pathway enrichment analysis followed by network integration to summarize pathway enrichment results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Neurogenesis pathways were enriched in proteins hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated in response to TTX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, neurogenesis group), while neuron projection morphogenesis functions (involved in axon and dendrite formation and dynamics) were enriched in proteins hypophosphorylated in response to BIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, neuron projection morphogenesis group). Numerous pathways associated with synaptic signaling and the synaptic membrane were enriched in clusters that showed increases or decreases during both TTX and BIC treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, synaptic signaling group). Cytoskeletal pathways were enriched only in phosphosites that increased in response to TTX (cluster 3) and decreased in response to BIC (cluster 4), suggesting that synaptic upscaling involves hyperphosphorylation of cytoskeletal components, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, cytoskeleton organization group). Finally, splicing and RNA-related processes were enriched in phosphosites with an early and strong hyperphosphorylation response to BIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, splicing and RNA processing group), indicating gene expression regulation via phosphorylation during downscaling. We also observed enrichment of several developmental and morphogenesis pathways in BIC and TTX treatments.

We noticed a large overlap of synapse-associated pathways across the BIC and TTX clusters. To gain more insight into the processes underlying synaptic scaling, we identified the 424 phosphosites that were bidirectionally regulated by TTX and BIC treatment when considering the average fold change across all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1E</xref>). The majority of these (335) were downregulated by TTX and upregulated by BIC, with a smaller number upregulated by TTX and downregulated by BIC (89). We hypothesized that these phosphosites could be prioritized for mechanistic characterization as they may contribute to the bidirectional processes that underlie homeostatic changes in synaptic strength. These bidirectionally regulated phosphoproteins include the synaptic scaffold proteins Dbn1, Dlgap1, Dlgap4, Homer2, Shank2, and Shank3; a number of neurotransmitter receptors and auxiliary proteins, including Grin3A, Grm5, Gabra2, Gabra5, and Shisa9; and several kinases important in cytoskeletal and synaptic plasticity, including Camk1d and Camk2b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1E</xref>). A number of motor, trafficking, and sorting proteins were also identified, including the adaptor protein complex AP3 Beta2 subunit (Ap3b2); enhanced expression of the AP3mu subunit was previously identified as an important factor in the routing of AMPAR to the synaptic membrane during scaling up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steinmetz et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, a number of presynaptic proteins and ion channels were bidirectionally regulated during scaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1E</xref>). While several of these regulated phosphoproteins have been previously implicated in synaptic scaling, one candidate in particular stood out to us: S1539 of Shank3 – an autism-associated synaptic scaffold protein known to be essential for synaptic scaling up – exhibited bidirectional changes in phosphorylation with different temporal dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These phosphorylation changes occurred without significant changes in protein abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1A and C</xref>). We therefore prioritized Shank3 for in-depth characterization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Shank3 is bidirectionally phosphorylated in cultured rat neocortical neurons</title><p>Our phosphoproteome screen identified Shank3 as a major synaptic scaffold protein that undergoes robust and bidirectional changes in phosphorylation during synaptic scaling protocols.

We immunoprecipitated the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) from cells treated with TTX and subjected it to an in vitro PP2A activity assay to detect any changes in the activity of PP2A during scaling up.

To test this idea, we treated cells with TTX for 1 or 24 hr, and during the last hour of the regimen, we applied okadaic acid (OKA), a phosphatase inhibitor that preferentially blocks PP2A activity at a low concentration (50 nM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bialojan and Takai, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishihara et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pribiag and Stellwagen, 2013</xref>).

As expected, inhibition of PP2A did not alter Shank3 hypophosphorylation in the early phase of scaling (1 hr TTX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and H</xref>); in contrast, the hypophosphorylation was reversed to baseline when OKA was introduced during the last hour of a 24 hr treatment with TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and I</xref>). We also observed a second band of phosphorylated Shank3 after OKA treatment, suggesting that there may be other phosphosites regulated by the OKA treatment that collectively induce a shift in molecule weight. OKA treatment alone did not alter the baseline phosphorylation level of Shank3, indicating that the role of PP2A in dephosphorylating Shank3 only manifested during prolonged neuronal inactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>). We wondered whether other phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) could also be involved in Shank3 phosphorylation, so we repeated this experiment using a higher concentration of OKA known to inhibit both PP2A and PP1 (500 nM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">duBell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishihara et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pribiag and Stellwagen, 2013</xref>).

Treatment of cultures with PTX for 24 hr induced the expected reduction in mean mEPSC amplitude and a shift in the cumulative probability distribution of amplitudes toward smaller values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), indicative of synaptic scaling down. Knockdown of Shank3 completely prevented scaling down in transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), indicating that Shank3 is necessary for both directions of synaptic scaling. Because elevated neuronal activity induces transient hyperphosphorylation of S1615 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>), we next wondered if this hyperphosphorylation was necessary for scaling down.

This suggests that the phosphorylation state of Shank3 acts as a switch to enable up- or downscaling; if so, scaling up should be intact in the AA (non-phosphorylatable) mutant, and scaling down should be intact in the DD (phosphomimetic) mutant. To test this, we transfected neurons with the AA mutant and treated them with TTX, or the DD mutant and treated with BIC, and then quantified synaptic GluA2 to measure synaptic scaling. We found that scaling up was indeed preserved in the AA mutant; likewise, scaling down was preserved in the DD mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>); notably, expression of these mutants does not by itself drive scaling up or down as baseline mEPSC amplitude was unaffected by AA or DD expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Notably, scaling up and down have been reported to support the therapeutic effects of ketamine and lithium on depression and bipolar disorder, respectively; thus, a complete understanding of how bidirectional synaptic scaling is regulated could potentially help advance targeted treatments of these mood disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kavalali and Monteggia, 2020</xref>). While transcriptional and translational regulation of this process has been intensively studied, it remains unclear whether post-translational modifications also play a causal role. Here, we analyzed the temporal dynamics of the phosphoproteome during the prolonged changes in activity that drive synaptic scaling up and down and found widespread and dynamic regulation of phosphorylation that was especially enriched in pathways related to synaptic scaffolding and signaling. We then focused on Shank3, a synaptic scaffold protein known to be essential for synaptic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tatavarty et al., 2020</xref>), and which exhibited robust and bidirectional changes in phosphorylation during scaling protocols. We found that Shank3 is dephosphorylated at two sites (S1586 and S1615) during scaling up and hyperphosphorylated during scaling down. These changes in phosphorylation did not impact basal synaptic function, but were necessary for the expression of synaptic scaling. Finally, we found that dephosphorylation of these sites via PP2A activity was essential for the maintenance of synaptic scaling up. These data show that Shank3 undergoes an activity-dependent switch between hypo- and hyperphosphorylation at S1586/ S1615 that is necessary to enable scaling up or down, respectively. More broadly, widespread changes in the phosphoproteome are likely to be instrumental in reconfiguring pre- and postsynaptic scaffold and signaling pathways during homeostatic plasticity.</p><p>Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has been successful in elucidating phosphorylation signaling and adaptation mechanisms in various forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In this work, we began by exploring changes induced by homeostatic scaling protocols using a quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic methodology. The multiplexing strategy and extensive peptide fractionation provided deep coverage of proteins and phosphosites while reducing technical variability. We identified over 5200 temporally regulated phosphosites (FDR-adjusted p-value&lt;0.10), with only subtle changes in protein levels: only 27 proteins in the BIC treatment condition showed differential abundance changes with our statistical significance criteria. Dörrbaum et al. previously characterized the proteome synthesis, degradation, and turnover during homeostatic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dörrbaum et al., 2020</xref>). Their work identified hundreds of proteins with differential abundance during 7 days of treatment; the longer treatment conditions and higher number of replicates they used may be necessary to capture these relatively modest abundance changes. Nonetheless, our work shows that extensive phosphorylation events with large effect sizes occur at a point in time (24 hr) when there is robust synaptic scaling and relatively small changes in protein abundance. Importantly, 424 of these phosphosites – including Shank3 – exhibited bidirectional changes in phosphorylation during scaling up and down. The global pattern of change in the phosphoproteome during synaptic scaling up and down, and the enrichment in pathways related to synaptic scaffolding and signaling, is consistent with a recent study that used a label-free MS approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Desch et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, synaptic scaling results in widespread bidirectional regulation of the phosphoproteome, and these changes may contribute to the regulation of a wide range of cell-biological processes that contribute to the expression of homeostatic plasticity.</p><p>In addition to synaptic scaling of excitatory synapses, prolonged changes in activity produce a wide range of homeostatic network adaptations that include changes in intrinsic excitability and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turrigiano, 2011</xref>). Proteomics revealed a number of voltage-gated ion channel subunits that are differentially phosphorylated during scaling up and down protocols that are candidate contributors to these intrinsic excitability changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). These ion channels include hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (Hcn1 and Hcn2), delayed rectifier and inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits (Kcnb1 and Kcnj3), and L- and T-type calcium channel subunits (Cacna1c and Cacna1i). The function of phosphorylation at the sites identified on these channel subunits will be an interesting avenue of exploration for understanding the mechanisms of intrinsic homeostatic plasticity. Similarly, we identified changes in phosphorylation in a network of presynaptic scaffold and release proteins, including Bassoon (Bsn), Piccolo (Pclo), Synapsin 2 and 3 (Syn2 and Syn3), and Synaptotagmin 11 and 17 (Syt11 and Syt17), which may contribute to presynaptic adaptations. Coupled with the widespread changes in postsynaptic scaffolding and signaling proteins (including Dlgap1 and 4, Homer2, Shank2, Shank3, and Shisa9), these data support the notion of coordinated pre- and postsynaptic adaptations during synaptic scaling. Finally, we identified bidirectional changes in phosphorylation of a number of neurotransmitter receptors known to be important for inhibitory and excitatory homeostatic plasticity, including the GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits Gabra2 and Gabra5, the NMDAR subunit Grin3A, and the mGluR5 subunit Grm5. In contrast, although bidirectional changes in phosphorylation of GluA2 at Y876 have been reported after 48 hr of activity manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yong et al., 2020</xref>), we failed to detect such changes; this may reflect the shorter treatment times used here (24 rather than 48 hr) and underscores the dynamic nature of activity-dependent phosphorylation events. Although we have focused our attention here on sites that undergo bidirectional phosphorylation, it is important to note that the machinery that drives scaling up and down (and possibly other forms of homeostatic plasticity) are not entirely overlapping (for scaling up-specific examples, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; for scaling down examples, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun and Turrigiano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), and so some of the large number of unidirectionally affected phosphosites we identified may also prove to be mechanistically important.</p><p>Changes in the phosphorylation state of Shank3 were of particular interest to us since Shank3 is critical for synaptic scaling up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tatavarty et al., 2020</xref>), interacts with many synaptic partners also known to be important for homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gainey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2012</xref>), and is strongly associated with ASDs and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betancur and Buxbaum, 2013</xref>). We found that Shank3 is bidirectionally phosphorylated during scaling on two conserved sites in the linker region between the proline-rich and SAM domains in both mouse and rat neocortical neurons and that these phosphorylation changes showed similar dynamics between species, with immediate and prolonged dephosphorylation induced by activity deprivation, and transient early hyperphosphorylation when activity is raised. One of these sites (reported as S1511, corresponding to rat S1586 in our dataset) was also identified in Desch et al.’s report, while rat S1615 was not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Desch et al., 2021</xref>). This likely reflects more comprehensive coverage of Shank3 in our assays. These changes in phosphorylation state gate changes in the synaptic abundance of Shank3 during scaling and are essential for the expression of synaptic scaling up and down (respectively). The different time courses of Shank3 phosphorylation changes during scaling up and down are intriguing and suggest that the temporal dynamics of the synaptic scaling machinery are more complex than previously appreciated. In particular, while the transient hyperphosphorylation of Shank3 is necessary to initiate scaling down, it need not be maintained for the subsequent slow removal of synaptic AMPAR that underlies the reduction in synaptic strength. In contrast, upscaling requires the continuous and active hypophosphorylation of Shank3 as transiently reversing this hypophosphorylation after 24 hr of scaling by inhibiting PP2A rapidly reverses scaling up.</p><p>Activity-dependent changes in Shank3 phosphorylation could be achieved through the altered activity of kinases, phosphatases, or both. Several activity-dependent kinases are known to regulate Shank3: ERK2 and its downstream target ribosome S6 kinase (RSK) phosphorylate Shank3 at S1134/S1163/S1253 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang, 2020a</xref>) and S1648 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>), respectively, while CaMKII can target S782 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeong et al., 2021</xref>) and S1586 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dosemeci and Jaffe, 2010</xref>). Moreover, both CaMKII and PKA can phosphorylate S685 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perfitt et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). Similar to S685, we found that both CaMKII and PKA regulate hyperphosphorylation of S1615 during heightened neuronal activity; these effects could be direct or indirect. Further, inhibition of CAMKII and PKA did not significantly affect baseline phosphorylation of S1615, suggesting the involvement of additional kinases. Altogether, these data highlight the complexity of the kinase network that regulates Shank3 phosphorylation. In addition to being a target of multiple kinases, Shank3 dephosphorylation is actively maintained by phosphatases: we found that PP1 modulates basal levels of Shank3 phosphorylation, while PP2A undergoes a delayed increase in activity upon TTX treatment that is required to maintain the hypophosphorylated state of Shank3 during late scaling. One model that could explain these temporal dynamics during scaling up is that reduced kinase (such as CAMKII) activity may account for the early stage of Shank3 hypophosphorylation, which is then maintained by the delayed activation of PP2A.</p><p>While no pharmacological manipulation is completely specific, our finding that PP2A participates in the activity-dependent regulation of Shank3 phosphorylation is bolstered by (1) the use of two distinct inhibitors and (2) the lack of effect of these inhibitors on baseline Shank3 phosphorylation. Using a different approach, we also find that PP2A activity is enhanced by prolonged activity blockade. Nonetheless, future experiments using alternative approaches such as endogenous PP2A inhibitors (e.g., inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A [I2PPA]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanimukai et al., 2005</xref>) or genetic manipulations will be needed to further corroborate our conclusion. Moreover, given that all of our experiments were conducted using whole-cell lysates, we cannot exclude the possibility that Shank3 phosphorylation might be regulated by molecular factors downstream of PP2A through an indirect mechanism.</p><p>How does the phosphorylation state of Shank3 enable scaling up and down? Our observation that phosphorylation at S1586/ S1615 influences synaptic enrichment of Shank3 suggests that this phosphorylation contributes to the recruitment and/or stability of Shank3 at the synapse. This connection between Shank3 phosphorylation and synaptic clustering is supported by the recent observation that dephosphorylation at S782 increases the synaptic enrichment of Shank3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeong et al., 2021</xref>). S1586 and S1615 are located in the linker region between the proline-rich domain and the SAM domain. The SAM domain promotes synaptic targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boeckers et al., 2005</xref>), oligomerization, and stabilization of Shank3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Naisbitt et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation at these sites might influence synaptic Shank3 enrichment by regulating the function of the SAM domain. The proximity of S1586 and S1615 to the upstream proline-rich domain, which interacts with important cytoskeletal and signaling elements including cortactin and Homer1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Naisbitt et al., 1999</xref>), also raises the possibility that the phosphorylation state of these sites modulates the interaction of Shank3 with local signaling pathways essential for synaptic plasticity. It is likely that these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive; instead, there could be temporal and spatial coordination that facilitates each direction of synaptic scaling. For instance, during scaling up, persistent dephosphorylation of Shank3 may locally stabilize Shank3 in the synapse and modulate its interaction with other synaptic proteins that result in GluA2 accumulation. By contrast, during scaling down, the early but transient hyperphosphorylation may remove Shank3 from the synapse and then initiate molecular programs that sustain scaling down. The latter speculation is supported by reports that Shank3 undergoes activity-dependent translocation from the synapse to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grabrucker et al., 2014</xref>) and interacts with CAMKII to facilitate phosphorylation of nuclear CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perfitt et al., 2020b</xref>). More broadly, our data suggest that changes in Shank3 phosphorylation state act as a permissive switch that then enables transcription-dependent trafficking and scaffolding pathways to enhance or reduce AMPAR accumulation at the synapse.</p><p>Shank3 is a complex, multiply phosphorylated protein that is highly enriched in the postsynaptic density and interacts both directly and indirectly with cytoskeletal elements, synaptic scaffold proteins, glutamate receptors, and synaptic signaling elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabrucker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang and Ehlers, 2013</xref>). Shank3 is thus perfectly placed to act as a signaling and scaffolding hub that can coordinate the activity of the multiple cell-biological processes to gate the induction of homeostatic changes in synaptic strength. Taken together, our data show that bidirectional and temporally complex changes in Shank3 phosphorylation are necessary for synaptic scaling and suggest that the function of Shank3 within the postsynaptic density is dynamically modulated by its phosphorylation state to switch it from a configuration that enables scaling up to one that enables scaling down. This has important implications for our understanding of bidirectional synaptic plasticity, and how loss of Shank3 contributes to synaptic and circuit dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal procedures were performed according to NIH guidelines and were approved by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard IACUC (mouse cultures) or the Brandeis University IACUC (rat cultures).</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Long–Evans</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain: 006;

All the experiments were performed from 7 to 10 days in vitro (DIV), during which neurons were sparsely transfected with the following constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To exogenously express Shank3 phospho-mutants, Shank3 constructs (2500 ng per dish) were transfected. To knock down endogenous Shank3, an shRNA targeting Shank3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tatavarty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verpelli et al., 2011</xref>) was used. For better visualization of neurons during recording, an empty GFP vector was co-transfected in both conditions. In the imaging experiments that measured endogenous Shank3, an empty GFP vector (500 ng per dish) was transfected to delineate the neurons. To induce scaling up, 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) or 24 hr after transfection (the remaining experiments) neurons were treated with TTX (5 µM, Tocris) for ~16 hr.

For all experiments, acquisition settings, including laser power, gain/offset, and pinhole size, were kept consistent. During image acquisition, pyramidal neurons were identified by their typical teardrop-shaped somata and apical-like dendrite. For each neuron, ~12 stacked images (step size: 0.33 µm) were obtained to include the apical dendrites and their dendritic branches, and then subject to maximum intensity projection using ZEN Black. To quantify the colocalization of synaptic proteins and their signal intensities, images were analyzed using the MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). In all cases, GFP expression was first thresholded to create a mask that outlined the neuron. A region of interest was then manually drawn to include the dendritic branches distal to the primary branch point of apical-like dendrite. A threshold was set for the signal intensity in each channel to exclude background noise and was kept consistent across experimental groups. The granularity function in MetaMorph was then used to threshold puncta in each channel (puncta size: 0.5–5 µm). Binary images were generated to outline identified puncta in each channel, and the colocalized puncta were determined using the Logical AND operation.

If all experimental conditions passed the normality test, a <italic>t</italic>-test, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, or two-way ANOVA was used where appropriate. If one or more conditions failed the normality test, a Mann–Whitney test or Kruskal–Wallis test was used as indicated. Significant Kruskal–Wallis tests were then subject to a Dunn’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. The significance levels are marked by asterisks (*): *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001; ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-2"><title>Differential abundance analysis of proteomics data</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed in the R environment for statistical computing. Sample log2 TMT ratios were median-MAD normalized. Proteins and phosphosites with more than 50% missing values were removed. In order to identify proteins and phosphopeptides that respond to TTX or BIC treatment, a linear model with time groups as factors was fitted and a moderated <italic>F</italic>-test was performed on all coefficients using the limma package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). Multiple hypothesis testing correction was performed using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Bidirectionally regulated phosphosites across TTX and BIC treatment were those that showed significant regulation by <italic>F</italic>-test in both treatments, as well as opposite signs when calculating the mean logFC across all time points for each treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-3"><title>Pathway enrichment and network visualization</title><p>Proteins and phosphosites showing differential abundance in response to TTX or BIC treatment were clustered using the k-means methods (k = 4 for BIC and k = 3 for TTX). The optimal number of clusters was calculated using the elbow method using the total within sums of squares. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed for each cluster with the g:profiler tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raudvere et al., 2019</xref>). The background list of proteins was set to all detected in the proteomics analysis, and the databases used for annotation were Gene Ontology, KEGG, Wikipathways, and Reactome. The list of enriched pathways and genes contained in each pathway were exported to Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>). The EnrichmentMap app was used to generate a network of enriched pathways with the following parameters (min pathway p-value=0.01; overlap index = 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merico et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-4"><title>Interactive visualization of proteomic, phosphoproteomic data, and derived pathway activity scores</title><p>All proteome and phosphoproteome data can be explored as interactive R Markdown documents at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://proteomics.broadapps.org/HSP_TTX/">https://proteomics.broadapps.org/HSP_TTX/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://proteomics.broadapps.org/HSP_Bic/">https://proteomics.broadapps.org/HSP_Bic/</ext-link>. In addition to TTX/Bic-induced temporal changes in protein and phosphosite level, the apps enable the user to explore pathway-level changes across time points. To project protein and phosphosite expression matrices onto <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/">MSigDB</ext-link> canonical pathways (c2.cp v7.4), single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) was used. TMT ratios of phosphosites and proteins mapping to the same gene symbol were combined by median expression prior to ssGSEA. The resulting normalized enrichment scores (NES) can be interpreted as <italic>pathway activity scores</italic> and serve as input for the longitudinal analysis described above.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental procedures were performed according to NIH guidelines and were approved by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard IACUC (mouse cultures) or the Brandeis University IACUC (rat cultures, protocol # 21002).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74277-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

They identify 424 bidirectionally regulated phosphorylation sites and focus on the potential role of SHANK3, a key postsynaptic scaffold protein, as a primary causal target of bidirectional phosphorylation. The authors' experiments show that SHANK3 phosphomimetic mutations prevent scaling up but not down, whereas phosphodeficient mutations prevent scaling down but not up, suggesting a single reversible process regulating synaptic scaling. While the manuscript as it stands presents a critical advance in the field, given the authors' extensive work and contributions to this field, it is important that these observations are experimentally linked to earlier work.</p><p>1. Is this phosphorylation/dephosphorylation event downstream or upstream of transcriptional/translational regulation? Several groups, including earlier work from the senior author, demonstrated that synaptic scaling requires neuronal gene transcription or new protein synthesis (quite often as an instructive signal). Therefore, it is important to show if SHANK3 phosphorylation is upstream or downstream of transcription/translation. Does transcription or translation block impair SHANK3 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation?</p><p>2. The authors refer to several possible kinases, it would be great to pinpoint the identity of the kinase involved. In this way, one can address whether activity regulation can bidirectionally regulate this kinase.</p><p>3. Earlier work from the same group had suggested a critical and cell-autonomous role for MeCP2 in synaptic scaling up (Blackman et al., 2012). Within the context of comment #1 above is there a causal link between MeCP2 function and SHANK3 phosphorylation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is curious that the studies were conducted in relatively &quot;young&quot; neurons – only 7-10 days old in rat. Please clarify level of maturity and synaptic connectivity in these cultures. It would be surprising if these young neurons had dendritic spines, and this might have a big impact on the data that would be obtained. For example, Ehlers (2003) found that Shank levels were dynamically modulated by a 24 hr TTX/BIC treatment. How do levels of Shanks change in these cultures as they age? Or with TTX/BIC treatment? In addition, it is likely worth commenting on the Comment on the heterogeneity or otherwise of cell (neuron) types in the cultures used.</p><p>2. In discussing Figure 1E, I am not sure that describing the changes in Shank3 phosphorylation in response to BIC as robust and bidirectionally regulated (lines 170/171) is accurate/appropriate because this increase is only transient. The hyper-phosphorylation at rat S1615 was also transient and only observed after 10 minutes but reversed within 1 hour of BIC treatment. Has the scaling-down plasticity already started after 10 minutes of BIC treatment? If not, it may not be appropriate to say that Shank3 is hyperphosphorylated during scaling down. A more nuanced description of the findings would be preferred.</p><p>3. The change of phosphorylation of rat Ser1615, but not rat1586, during homeostatic plasticity is conserved across in mouse neurons. It leads to the question of whether rat Ser1586 phosphorylation is functionally relevant. The authors should compare the effects of Ser1615 single mutation to Ser1615/Ser1586 double mutation.</p><p>4. Comments on the PP2A studies:</p><p>A) The parallel use of okadaic acid, fostreicin and tautomycetin to probe the relative importance of PP2A vs.PP1 is strong, and the studies appear to have been carefully done. However, it would be good to show some sort of positive control to confirm that TAUT did indeed inhibit PP1 under these conditions.</p><p>B) For the PP2A assay, it appears that the lysates were prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. The authors need to define exactly what phosphatase inhibitors were used here. Since some commonly used inhibitors are generally thought to be irreversible toward PP2A, it is not clear how any phosphatase activity was detected.</p><p>C) The PP2A assay is based on immunoprecipitation of the PP2A catalytic subunit. However, it is likely that these samples contain an array of additional proteins. What did the authors do to confirm that the assay is indeed specifically measuring PP2A activity as opposed to that of other phosphatases that might be co-isolated? In addition, the authors should determine whether the levels of the PP2A catalytic subunit, or the co-precipitated regulatory/scaffolding subunits, are altered by homeostatic plasticity.</p><p>5. In Figure 6, how do the changes in EPSC amplitude induced by TTX or BIC treatment compare with those observed in neurons that are not over-expressing any Shank3? Or following the knockdown of endogenous Shank3 suppression? What were the EPSC frequencies? Were the frequencies affected by TTX or BIC?</p><p>6. The data in Figure 7 are not very compelling. First, I believe that these data should be analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA, since there are two variable factors (DMSO/FST and WT/AA). Second, some would argue that N here is the number of batches of neurons (independent transfections), rather than the number of cells. Please define the number of independent batches of neuronal cultures that were analyzed to generate the specified number of cells. Even if tighter analyses of these data continue to support the interpretation, there are several additional questions that should be addressed.</p><p>A) What about the colocalized punctae intensity in cells expressing WT or AA shank3 without TTX treatment?</p><p>B) What about the number of punctae per µm of dendrite?</p><p>C) What about the number of sGluA2 punctae in neurons that are not over-expressing exogenous Shank3? The selected images suggest that the number of sGluA2 punctae is dramatically increased in neurons expressing Shank3-AA vs Shank3-WT. Is Shank3-WT decreasing the number of punctae, or is Shank3-AA increasing the number of punctae?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a well considered discussion and excellent and thourough set of experiments which recognize the complexity of the scaling signaling pathways. As discussed above I believe the study is very strong and of broad importance. My main concern is a lack of discussion on the topic of the importance of phosphorylation vs location. Do the authors believe that dephosphorylation drives Shank 3 into the synapse and this localization is necessary for scaling, the phosphorylation state alone, or both localization and phosphorylation state. Do any of your results speak to these issues? The AA Shank 3 would be expected to go into the synapse but does not (Figure 3E) and yet it still allows for TTX upscaling (so here dephosphorylation matters more than location). Further, the hyperphoshporylation associated with down scaling is only transient expressed but is associated with a long term reduction in synaptic Shank 3 – here localization (out of the synapse) appears to be key for allowing downscaling not phosphorylation state.</p><p>In addition, it is not clear what we would expect in terms of puncta density, which might be expected to be reflected in mEPSC frequency (if I understand density), but changes in mEPSC frequency are not generally seen in these cultures treated with TTX or bicuculline. In Figure 3 you show that AA or DD Shank 3 has no change in puncta density which is fine, but in figure 5 TTX treatment leads to changes in puncta density – does this show up in mEPSC frequency?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74277.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.The relationship between immunofluorescence and mEPSC recordings should be clarified under all conditions.

First, WT Shank3 overexpression does not impact mEPSC amplitude; baseline values here (Figure 6C-H) are indistinguishable from our previously reported values (e.g., Tatavarty et al., 2020), and this is consistent with our previously published data showing that Shank3 knockout or knockdown does not affect baseline mEPSC amplitude (Tatavarty et al., 2020). Second, due to biological variation the effect size of TTX treatment varies somewhat across datasets, but again is very similar in the Shank3 WT overexpression condition (~133% of control) and in empty-vector expressing neurons (~140% of control). The same is true when using GluA2 intensity as a measure of synaptic scaling; overexpression of Shank3 WT did not impact sGluA intensity at baseline, and TTX induced a similar increase in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The effect size for the BIC/PTX condition is generally 10-20%, (Figure 6G, Figure 6 supplement 1), and is similar in the WT and control conditions. We now mention the lack of baseline effects in the Results section (lines 326-327).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Overexpressing wild-type Shank3 does not impact synaptic surface GluA2 intensity at baseline, or the magnitude of scaling up.</title><p>Quantification of average synaptic sGluA3 intensity in neurons overexpressing Shank3-WT or a control GFP vector with and without TTX treatment (EV UN, n = 40, EV TTX, n = 45, WT UN, n = 33, WT TTX, n = 34).

These issues need further clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data are consistent with a permissive role of Shank3 phosphorylation in gating upward and downward synaptic scaling, a point we now emphasize in the revised manuscript (abstract lines 39-41, lines 525-530). We did attempt to determine whether activity-dependent changes in Shank3 phosphorylation rely on transcription. We co-treated neuronal cultures with TTX and actinomycin D (ActD) for six hours; while we still saw a reduction in Shank3 phosphorylation during TTX treatment in the presence of ActD, the baseline effects of ActD were quite variable, so the experiment was inconclusive despite multiple replicates. While this is an interesting question, we feel it is not central to the main thrust of the manuscript, and note that it will require significant further study to determine how transcription-dependent and independent pathways interact to enable synaptic scaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Do the authors have any further insight into the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates Shank3.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we performed additional experiments using kinase inhibitors.</p><p>Given that Shank3 is rapidly hyperphosphorylated in an activity-dependent manner, we focused on PKA and CAMKII, both of which are known to phosphorylate Shank3 at other sites (Wang et al., 2020b, Perfitt et al., 2020a). We treated the neurons with either CAMKII inhibitors (KN62 or KN93) or a PKA inhibitor (H89) for 40 minutes, then added PTX during the last 10 minutes to increase activity. Neither PKA nor CAMKII inhibition affected baseline Shank3 phosphorylation. In contrast, inhibition of either kinase prevented the Shank3 hyperphosphorylation induced by PTX. This result has two interesting implications: first, both kinase pathways are necessary for the activity-dependent phosphorylation of S1615. This suggests that Shank3 phosphorylation lies at the intersection of several complex signaling pathways involving different kinases. Second, the fact that baseline Shank3 phosphorylation was not significantly affected by these inhibitors suggests that these kinases are not required to maintain baseline levels of Shank3 phosphorylation. These data have been included in the revised Figure 4A-C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please justify the identification of PP2A, possibly by additional molecular manipulation, or directly addressing the short comings of their pharmacological approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a molecular manipulation of PP2A activity (such as overexpression of endogenous inhibitors, Tanimukai et al., 2005) would be ideal as an independent verification of our pharmacological results. However, in our hands inhibition of PP2A for durations longer than the 1 hr used here greatly impacted neuronal morphology and health. Overexpression or knockdown experiments lack the necessary temporal control to avoid this confound. We note that two distinct PP2A inhibitors gave the same results, and the specificity is further supported by the observation that PP2A inhibition only impacted activity-dependent phosphorylation of Shank3. We now discuss the limitations of our pharmacological approach in the Discussion section (lines 485-494).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors integrate extensive data on a comprehensive analysis of a phosphor-proteome associated with homeostatic synaptic down- and up-scaling.

These young neurons have both spine and shaft excitatory synapses, and synaptic scaling is expressed at both types of synapses. We have exhaustively characterized synaptic, intrinsic, and network activity in these cultures over ~25 years of work; they exhibit robust network activity, and contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We can visually target excitatory pyramidal neurons, the cell type we (and the field) perform the great majority of synaptic scaling work on. Finally, we note that synaptic scaling remains dependent on Shank3 in older mice (P28), as we showed recently using an in vivo induction paradigm (Wen and Turrigiano, 2021).</p><p>There are two key experimental differences between our and Ehlers’ studies (Ehlers, 2003): first, the neurons they used were cultured from embryonic mice, and the experiments were performed between 14-30 days in vitro; thus “age” (developmental time plus time in vitro) is slightly older but overlapping with our study. Second, they used longer (48 hours) pharmacological treatment. Despite these technical differences, Ehlers’ finding that synaptic Shank3 intensity (as well as the concentration of Shank3 in the PSD fraction) is bidirectionally regulated during TTX and BIC treatment is consistent with our results (Figure 3A), and consistent with our conclusion that synaptic Shank3 levels are dynamically modulated by activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Our data suggest that this transient hyperphosphorylation is necessary for initiating (but not maintaining) synaptic scaling down; this is based on several pieces of evidence, including that preventing this transient hyperphosphorylation with the AA mutant blocks scaling down, and this is now discussed in more detail (lines 459-466).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Because of the time-consuming nature of these experiments, we did not collect a full dataset on the single mutant and instead focused on the double mutant, but these pilot data do suggest that phosphorylation of both sites is important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Comments on the PP2A studies:</p><p>A) The parallel use of okadaic acid, fostreicin and tautomycetin to probe the relative importance of PP2A vs.PP1 is strong, and the studies appear to have been carefully done. However, it would be good to show some sort of positive control to confirm that TAUT did indeed inhibit PP1 under these conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we do not know of a robust assay for PP1 activity, so we were not able to perform this positive control. We agree the PP1 data are not as complete as the PP2A data, and it will await further studies to establish a clearer role for PP1 in controlling basal levels of Shank3 phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) For the PPP2A assay, it appears that the lysates were prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. The authors need to define exactly what phosphatase inhibitors were used here. Since some commonly used inhibitors are generally thought to be irreversible toward PP2A, it is not clear how any phosphatase activity was detected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error in our methods section; we doubled-checked our experimental procedures and confirmed that phosphatase inhibitors were NOT included in the buffers used in the PP2A assay. This error has been corrected in the revised methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) The PP2A assay is based on immunoprecipitation of the PP2A catalytic subunit. However, it is likely that these samples contain an array of additional proteins. What did the authors do to confirm that the assay is indeed specifically measuring PP2A activity as opposed to that of other phosphatases that might be co-isolated? In addition, the authors should determine whether the levels of the PP2A catalytic subunit, or the co-precipitated regulatory/scaffolding subunits, are altered by homeostatic plasticity.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we did not detect significant changes in expression or phosphorylation of PP2A catalytic, regulatory, or scaffolding subunits. We agree that we cannot rule out some degree of cross-reactivity in this assay, and differentiating between (e.g.) PP2A and PP1 relies on the same inhibitors that are also imperfectly specific. Despite these limitations, we feel that the multiple approaches we use taken together provide strong evidence for a specific role of PP2A. We have addressed these limitations in the Discussion section (lines 485-494).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 6, how do the changes in EPSC amplitude induced by TTX or BIC treatment compare with those observed in neurons that are not over-expressing any Shank3?

The data in Figure 7 are not very compelling. First, I believe that these data should be analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA, since there are two variable factors (DMSO/FST and WT/AA). Second, some would argue that N here is the number of batches of neurons (independent transfections), rather than the number of cells. Please define the number of independent batches of neuronal cultures that were analyzed to generate the specified number of cells. Even if tighter analyses of these data continue to support the interpretation, there are several additional questions that should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was set up to explicitly test the difference between vehicle and FST for each condition, so we believe a Mann-Whitney test is appropriate for this analysis. Nonetheless a 2-way ANOVA also shows a significant interaction (p = 0.023 for sGluA2 intensity). Each data point represents a single transfected neuron, as is true for data throughout the manuscript. For each set of experiments, the data were pooled from 5 independent cultures. This (and most experiments in the manuscript) were performed after very low-efficiency transfection of cultures so that only a few pyramidal neurons were transfected per dish; in the past, we have treated the data in various ways, including performing nested statistics to account for variability across neurons, culture dishes, and dissociations, and have found that most variability arises from differences between neurons. Thus, we pool data across neurons and ensure that we include data from at least three independent dissociations for each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) What about the colocalized punctae intensity in cells expressing WT or AA shank3 without TTX treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>The colocalized puncta intensity of Shank3 and sGluA in cells expressing Shank3 WT and AA without treatments are shown in Figure 3 (Shank3) and Figure 6 —figure supplement 2 (sGluA2), respectively.

As discussed above I believe the study is very strong and of broad importance. My main concern is a lack of discussion on the topic of the importance of phosphorylation vs location. Do the authors believe that dephosphorylation drives Shank 3 into the synapse and this localization is necessary for scaling, the phosphorylation state alone, or both localization and phosphorylation state. Do any of your results speak to these issues? The AA Shank 3 would be expected to go into the synapse but does not (Figure 3E) and yet it still allows for TTX upscaling (so here dephosphorylation matters more than location). Further, the hyperphoshporylation associated with down scaling is only transient expressed but is associated with a long term reduction in synaptic Shank 3 – here localization (out of the synapse) appears to be key for allowing downscaling not phosphorylation state.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer made an excellent point that there is more than one possible mechanism by which Shank3 phosphorylation could gate synaptic scaling. We agree that the Shank3 phosphorylation state could influence its localization, and/or mediate its interaction with cellular factors in local signaling pathways. These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and their relative importance likely depends on the direction of scaling, the phosphorylation state, and the timing of phosphorylation. During scaling up, persistent dephosphorylation of Shank3 may locally stabilize Shank3 in the synapse and modulate its interaction with other synaptic proteins that result in GluA2 accumulation. During scaling down, the early but transient hyperphosphorylation may displace Shank3 and is possibly crucial for initiating molecular programs that then sustain scaling down. Future experiments to dissect differences in compartmentalized protein interactomes of Shank3 WT, DD, and AA during scaling up and down would shed light on these complex processes. The revised manuscript includes a discussion of these possibilities (lines 495-520).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it is not clear what we would expect in terms of puncta density, which might be expected to be reflected in mEPSC frequency (if I understand density), but changes in mEPSC frequency are not generally seen in these cultures treated with TTX or bicuculline. In Figure 3 you show that AA or DD Shank 3 has no change in puncta density which is fine, but in figure 5 TTX treatment leads to changes in puncta density – does this show up in mEPSC frequency?</p></disp-quote><p>We see no significant changes in mEPSC frequency across conditions <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. This is not surprising for two reasons. First, as mentioned above in response to reviewer 2, mEPSC frequency is quite variable due to many factors that are unrelated to functional synapse density, so the correlation is poor. Second, not all excitatory synapses express detectible levels of Shank3; an increase in Shank3 intensity can thus increase the colocalization rate between Shank3 and sGluA2 without signifying a change in the number of functional synapses.</p></body></sub-article></article>
