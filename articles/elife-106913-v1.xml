This switch is ‘flipped’ by the expression of genes that promote male- or female-specific development. Many lineages have evolved sex chromosomes that act as primary signals for sex determination. However, haplodiploidy (males are haploid and females are diploid), which occurs in ca. 12% of animal species, is incompatible with sex chromosomes. Haplodiploid taxa must, therefore, rely on other strategies for sex determination. One mechanism, ‘complementary sex determination’ (CSD), uses heterozygosity as a proxy for diploidy. In CSD, heterozygosity at a sex determination locus triggers female development, while hemizygosity or homozygosity permits male development. CSD loci have been mapped in honeybees and two ant species, but we know little about their evolutionary history. Here, we investigate sex determination in the clonal raider ant, <italic>Ooceraea biroi</italic>. We identified a 46 kb candidate CSD locus at which all females are heterozygous, but most diploid males are homozygous for either allele. As expected for CSD loci, the candidate locus has more alleles than most other loci, resulting in a peak of nucleotide diversity. This peak negligibly affects the amino acid sequences of protein-coding genes, suggesting that heterozygosity of a non-coding genomic sequence triggers female development. This locus is distinct from the CSD locus in honeybees but homologous to a CSD locus mapped in two distantly related ant species, implying that this molecular mechanism has been conserved since a common ancestor that lived approximately 112 million years ago.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In most animals, sex is determined at conception. The factors that determine whether an embryo becomes male or female vary across animals, one example being sex chromosomes. In humans and other mammals, a gene on the Y chromosome triggers male development, whereas its absence allows female development.</p><p>A different system occurs in haplodiploid species, including wasps, bees and ants. In these animals, haploid eggs (which inherit one set of each chromosome from their mother) develop into males, while diploid eggs (which inherit two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent) develop into females. In many haplodiploid species, inbreeding can produce diploid males, leading to the idea of a system called complementary sex determination, in which having two different versions of a certain gene produces a female while having two identical versions (homozygous diploids) or just one version produces a male.</p><p>So far, genes or candidate genes responsible for this type of development have only been identified in honeybees and two ant species. Lacy et al. studied the clonal raider ant, <italic>Ooceraea biroi</italic>, which is evolutionarily distinct from those ants. The researchers sequenced the genomes of diploid males and females to look for regions of chromosomes where males had two identical alleles, but females had two different ones. They found such a region, a nearly 50,000 DNA base pair long stretch on chromosome 4 that was evolutionarily related to a non-coding RNA region found in the other two ant species.</p><p>In this region, they also found patterns of genetic diversity consistent with a complementary sex determination locus. These patterns were not found near genes related to the gene <italic>transformer</italic>, which are complementary sex determination loci in honeybees and possibly one of the ant species. This suggests that the long non-coding RNA–based locus may have been conserved for over 100 million years of ant evolution, while the <italic>transformer</italic>-derived system may have evolved later in some species, possibly independently adopting a similar function to that in honeybees.</p><p>Understanding complementary sex determination is crucial for the conservation of species, especially for pollinators. When populations shrink and inbreeding occurs, sterile diploid males can be produced, threatening population stability. Knowing which species use complementary sex determination can help track inbreeding and guide breeding programs. The discovery that a single complementary sex determination locus appears to be conserved across ants suggests that similar conservation strategies could apply to many species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>complementary sex determination</kwd><kwd>social insects</kwd><kwd>haplodiploidy</kwd><kwd>Hymenoptera</kwd><kwd>diploid males</kwd><kwd>homozygosity mapping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM127007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kronauer</surname><given-names>Daniel JC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0420db125</institution-id><institution>The Rockefeller University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Reem/Kayden Early-Career Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kronauer</surname><given-names>Daniel JC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kronauer</surname><given-names>Daniel JC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A complementary sex determination locus is conserved in ants and dates back to approximately 112 million years ago.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Whether an animal develops as a male or a female is typically determined by a switch early in development. This switch, known as sex determination, is a multistep process beginning with primary sex determination signals triggering sex-specific splicing of downstream transcription factors that encode sexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Williams and Carroll, 2009</xref>). Although the downstream transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved, primary sex determination signals are evolutionarily labile and comprise a diverse range of environmental and genetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachtrog et al., 2014</xref>). Genetically encoded primary signals (sex-determining genes or chromosomes) are usually found in only one sex. Such systems do not work in haplodiploid taxa (an estimated 12% of animal species, including ants; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Normark, 2003</xref>), where any allele on any homologous chromosome can be transmitted from diploid females to their haploid male sons, and all alleles experience selection to be viably transmitted from both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Whiting, 1935</xref>). Haplodiploids, therefore, require alternative sex determination mechanisms, but we know little about the molecular details.</p><p>Some parasitoid wasps use a mechanism involving maternal imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verhulst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zou et al., 2020</xref>). However, in many Hymenoptera, inbred crosses produce diploid males, which led to the hypothesis that female development is triggered by heterozygosity as a proxy for diploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Whiting, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Whiting, 1943</xref>). Under this ‘complementary sex determination’ (CSD) hypothesis, different alleles at a given sex determination locus ‘complement’ one another, meaning that heterozygosity triggers female development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). By contrast, the presence of a single allele (either because the individual is haploid or because a diploid individual is homozygous at the sex determination locus) permits male development. Under CSD, diploid males produce diploid sperm and, therefore, are functionally sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Wilgenburg et al., 2006</xref>). This has several evolutionary consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cook and Crozier, 1995</xref>); at the population level, there is selection against homozygosity, often meaning obligatory avoidance of inbreeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Page, 1980</xref>). At the gene level, there is negative frequency-dependent (balancing) selection on CSD loci, resulting in the co-occurrence of many alleles at similar frequencies within populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laidlaw et al., 1956</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Theoretical expectations for complementary sex determination (CSD).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon depicting a mating between a diploid female with two different alleles at a sex determination locus and a haploid male bearing one of these two alleles.

If diploid males arise from losses of heterozygosity at sex loci, then homozygosity for either of the two alleles should trigger male development. Offspring proportions reflect empirical observations in the clonal raider ant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kronauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oxley et al., 2014</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106913-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Having been a favored hypothesis for more than half a century, CSD was demonstrated in the honeybee <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beye et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, biallelic heteromers of the protein encoded by the <italic>complementary sex determiner</italic> (<italic>csd</italic>) gene trigger female development, whereas monoallelic homomers permit male development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beye et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Otte et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seiler and Beye, 2024</xref>). Although this primary sex determination signal differs from primary signals in other insects, it nonetheless converges upon the pathway that transduces sex determination signals in holometabolous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bopp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sawanth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wexler et al., 2019</xref>). The Csd protein sex-specifically splices the closely linked splicing factor <italic>feminizer</italic> (<italic>fem</italic>) (the honeybee version of <italic>transformer</italic> [<italic>tra</italic>] in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects), which in turn leads to the production of sex-specific isoforms of <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>), a transcription factor that regulates sex-specific development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasselmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gempe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verhulst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zou et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>csd</italic> is a paralog of <italic>fem</italic>. Following the prediction that CSD loci should evolve under balancing selection, many <italic>csd</italic> alleles are held at similar frequencies, and the locus bears signatures of adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hasselmann and Beye, 2004</xref>), with amino acid-level heterozygosity in certain protein domains required for female development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Otte et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>CSD is assumed to occur in many Hymenoptera that occasionally produce diploid males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Wilgenburg et al., 2006</xref>). Until recently, however, heterozygosity-dependent female development had not been demonstrated outside of <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, which remained the only species for which a CSD locus had been genetically mapped. A recent genetic mapping study in the wasp <italic>Lysiphlebus fabarum</italic> identified at least one and as many as four candidate sex determination loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matthey-Doret et al., 2019</xref>) (the multi-locus extension of the CSD hypothesis proposes that heterozygosity at any of multiple sex determination loci is sufficient to trigger female development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crozier, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>]). However, a requirement of heterozygosity at these loci for female development was not demonstrated. In the ant <italic>Vollenhovia emeryi</italic>, a mapping study found two sex determination QTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miyakawa and Mikheyev, 2015</xref>), with follow-up work suggesting that these function as a multi-locus CSD system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyakawa and Miyakawa, 2023</xref>). One of these QTL (<italic>V.emeryiCsdQTL1</italic>) contains two closely linked <italic>tra</italic> homologs, reminiscent of the locus containing <italic>csd</italic> and <italic>fem</italic> in <italic>A. mellifera</italic>. By contrast, the other QTL (<italic>V.emeryiCsdQTL2</italic>) only contains genes without annotated functions in sexual development. Although <italic>V. emeryi</italic> sex determination is likely integrated through <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic>, the molecular basis of their primary sex determination signals remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miyakawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyakawa and Miyakawa, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a sex determination locus was identified in the Argentine ant, <italic>Linepithema humile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2024</xref>). Consistent with CSD, all pairwise heterozygous combinations of the seven identified alleles were found in females, whereas diploid males were invariably homozygous for one of the seven alleles. Moreover, these alleles occurred at roughly equal frequencies within populations, suggesting evolution under balancing selection. The mapped locus is located within a noncoding genomic region tightly linked to <italic>ant noncoding transformer splicing regulator</italic> (<italic>ANTSR</italic>), a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) with previously uncharacterized function. <italic>ANTSR</italic> knockdown in female-destined embryos leads to male-specific splicing of <italic>tra</italic>, suggesting that this lncRNA transduces the primary sex determination signal encoded by the heterozygosity (or hemi- or homozygosity) of the linked noncoding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2024</xref>). Because the synteny of this region (including the presence of a lncRNA putatively homologous to <italic>ANTSR</italic>) is conserved across the ants, bees, and vespoid wasps, it was suggested that this sex determination locus may be deeply conserved among the Aculeata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2024</xref>). However, synteny is insufficient to demonstrate functional conservation, and genetic mapping of sex determination has yet to be performed in most of these taxa.</p><p>To explore the evolution of sex determination across ants, we investigated the topic in the clonal raider ant, <italic>Ooceraea biroi</italic>. Diploid males occur sporadically in this species, suggesting that, like other ants, they might employ CSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kronauer et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>O. biroi</italic> reproduces via a mode of parthenogenesis in which two haploid nuclei from a single meiosis fuse to produce diploid offspring (central fusion automixis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oxley et al., 2014</xref>). Although heterozygosity is maintained with high fidelity despite meiotic crossover recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lacy et al., 2024</xref>), losses of heterozygosity occur occasionally, probably due to the inheritance of one recombined and one non-recombined version of a homologous chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kronauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oxley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trible et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lacy et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, if <italic>O. biroi</italic> uses CSD, diploid males might result from losses of heterozygosity at sex determination loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), similar to what is thought to occur in other asexual Hymenoptera that produce diploid males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rabeling and Kronauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matthey-Doret et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we use whole genome sequencing to map a sex determination locus, demonstrate that most diploid males carry a loss of heterozygosity at this locus, assess the homology of this locus with other sex determination loci, and explore whether balancing selection has shaped evolution at this locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a candidate sex determination locus on chromosome 4</title><p>To map sex determination loci in <italic>O. biroi</italic>, we first identified males based on sexual dimorphism and distinguished diploid from haploid males based on heterozygosity at eight genetic markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We found a peak of the CSD index on chromosome 4, which deviated significantly from the null distribution of CSD index values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Primary sex determination signals act early during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sawanth et al., 2016</xref>) and thus need not be differentially expressed later in development. However, these genes can still be expressed as late as the pupal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beye et al., 2003</xref>). Many genes were differentially expressed between males and females (24.6% of expressed genes) or had one or more differentially used exons, including four genes near the CSD index peak (LOC105285605, LOC105283850, LOC105283849, and LOC105283844) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Here, we investigated the mode of sex determination in the clonal raider ant, <italic>O. biroi</italic>. First, we mapped a candidate sex determination locus that was heterozygous in all females, but homozygous for either allele in most diploid males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Next, we showed that most diploid males bear rare losses of heterozygosity that arise during thelytokous parthenogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We then showed that this locus is homologous to a sex determination locus found in two other ant species—<italic>V. emeryi</italic> and <italic>L. humile</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that this mechanism of sex determination may be conserved among formicoid ants. By sequencing whole genomes of haploid males and diploid females from other clonal lines of <italic>O. biroi,</italic> we showed that the mapped locus corresponds to a region with high genetic diversity, following the expectation that CSD loci should evolve under balancing selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This diversity peaks in a noncoding genomic region, and we found limited evidence for functional heterozygosity in nearby protein-coding sequences, suggesting that heterozygosity in this noncoding sequence may trigger female development. Finally, we demonstrated that <italic>O. biroi</italic> CSD in clonal line A does not map to the <italic>tra</italic>-containing sex determination locus previously identified in <italic>V. emeryi</italic>, but it remains unclear whether <italic>O. biroi</italic> ancestrally has single-locus or multi-locus CSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>The presence of diploid males in many ant taxa previously led to the conclusion that most ants employ CSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Wilgenburg et al., 2006</xref>).

Our mapped locus appears to be homologous to <italic>V.emeryiCsdQTL2</italic> and to the locus identified in <italic>L. humile</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As was found in <italic>L. humile</italic>, this locus colocalizes with a peak of nucleotide diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), with seven alleles found among five clonal lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), consistent with the expectation that CSD loci should harbor many alleles due to evolution under balancing selection. This implies that the role of this locus in CSD evolved before the divergence of the Dorylinae from the other formicoid ants roughly 112 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borowiec et al., 2025</xref>). Although synteny analyses raised the possibility that this locus arose early within the evolution of the Aculeata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2024</xref>), genetic mapping studies of additional representative species of different ant subfamilies (especially in the poneroid clade and the Leptanillinae) and across other Aculeata will be required to determine when the function of this locus in CSD originated and how it is distributed across taxa.</p><p>In <italic>L. humile</italic>, a lncRNA (<italic>ANTSR</italic>) closely linked to this locus plays a role in sex determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2024</xref>).

The reason is that males in <italic>O. biroi</italic> are exceedingly rare and morphologically only identifiable at the pupal stage, well after primary sex determination signals are transduced to self-sustaining sex-specific splicing of downstream transcription factors during the early stages of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gempe and Beye, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we likely missed differential gene expression relevant to sex determination that occurs before the pupal stage.</p><p>We did not find a peak of the CSD index at the <italic>O. biroi tra</italic> homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that, as in <italic>L. humile</italic>, the mode of CSD is not homologous to the system in <italic>A. mellifera</italic> mediated by the <italic>transformer</italic> homologs <italic>csd</italic> and <italic>fem</italic>. This was previously suspected for <italic>O. biroi</italic> due to the presence of only a single <italic>tra</italic> homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oxley et al., 2014</xref>) rather than the two closely linked <italic>tra</italic> homologs found in other ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Privman et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>V. emeryi</italic>, however, one of the two Csd QTLs (<italic>V.emeryiCsdQTL1</italic>) spans the <italic>tra</italic> locus, raising the possibility that the molecular mechanism of CSD might, in part, be conserved between <italic>A. mellifera</italic> and <italic>V. emeryi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miyakawa and Mikheyev, 2015</xref>). It has not been demonstrated that either of <italic>V. emeryi</italic>’s <italic>tra</italic> homologs acts as a primary sex determination signal. Our results raise the possibility that the role of <italic>V.emeryiCsdQTL1</italic> as a primary sex determination signal evolved independently of <italic>A. mellifera csd</italic> and after <italic>V. emeryi</italic> diverged from <italic>L. humile</italic>. However, further investigations into the mechanisms of sex determination in <italic>V. emeryi</italic> and other ants are required to reconstruct the evolutionary history of <italic>V.emeryiCsdQTL1</italic>’s function in hymenopteran sex determination.</p><p>Curiously, diploid males were only produced in clonal line A, even though many males were collected from other clonal lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). One possible explanation is that <italic>O. biroi</italic> has multi-locus CSD, and clonal line A is ancestrally homozygous for all but one of the loci. Multi-locus CSD has been suggested to limit the extent of diploid male production in asexual species under some circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vorburger, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matthey-Doret et al., 2019</xref>). Clonal line A is ancestrally homozygous for a portion of the region homologous to the second <italic>V. emeryi</italic> QTL, although it retains heterozygosity in the region overlapping <italic>tra</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). However, this region lacks elevated genetic diversity and functional heterozygosity, making it a poor candidate for a second, undetected, CSD locus. Further study would be required to determine whether <italic>O. biroi</italic> has a second CSD locus. However, there may be other explanations for diploid males being found exclusively in clonal line A. For example, clonal line A could be more likely to lose heterozygosity than other clonal lines, or diploid males in clonal line A could be more likely to develop and survive. Currently, we have no data to distinguish between these hypotheses.</p><p>Another peculiarity of our study is that 5 of the 16 sequenced diploid males retained heterozygosity at the mapped CSD locus. One possible explanation for this would be that our mapped locus is, in fact, a false positive. However, this seems unlikely given that (1) those losses of heterozygosity occurred independently in multiple genetic backgrounds within clonal line A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), (2) a peak of nucleotide diversity co-occurs with the mapped locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and (3) this locus is homologous to CSD loci mapped in two other ant species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Stochastic gene expression or splicing fluctuations may have caused these individuals to develop as males despite having “female genotypes”. Certain allelic combinations of <italic>A. mellifera csd</italic> trigger female development with incomplete penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beye et al., 2013</xref>), and the allelic combination found in clonal line A might similarly be permissive to occasional male development. Alternatively, these diploid males could result from mutations in or losses of heterozygosity at different genetic loci. We note that it might be easier to find rare stochastically produced diploid males in laboratory colonies of <italic>O. biroi</italic> than in sexual species. This is because genetically encoded diploid males only result from loss of heterozygosity, which is rare in <italic>O. biroi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oxley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lacy et al., 2024</xref>). By contrast, in sexually reproducing populations, diploid males homozygous for sex determination loci will arise much more frequently due to matings between individuals that share an allele at the sex determination locus (this effect is exacerbated in invasive species like <italic>L. humile</italic> that have undergone recent genetic bottlenecks). Thus, if stochastically produced diploid males occur at very low baseline levels in ants, such males will rarely be detected in sexual species. In <italic>O. biroi</italic>, however, they could make up a substantial proportion of diploid males, simply because diploid males caused by homozygosity at the CSD locus are likewise extremely rare.</p><p>Finally, we note that heterozygosity-dependent female development, a fundamental tenet of CSD, has major implications for the evolution of breeding systems and reproductive modes. Due to the high fitness cost of producing sterile diploid males, species with CSD should obligatorily outbreed or have other mechanisms of maintaining heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Wilgenburg et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, most diploid males resulted from rare crossover-associated losses of heterozygosity that spanned the putative CSD locus (the shortest loss of heterozygosity at the mapped locus was 46 kb and, therefore, likely resulted from crossover recombination rather than gene conversion). Intriguingly, in many taxa, asexual lineages reproduce via mechanisms that lead to complete homozygosity in a single generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suomalainen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma and Schwander, 2017</xref>). However, among the social Hymenoptera (and other Vespoids), the known modes of asexual reproduction all maintain at least some heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rabeling and Kronauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma and Schwander, 2017</xref>). For formicoid ants, bees, and other taxa with CSD, asexual reproduction with high rates of heterozygosity loss would incur a steep fitness penalty due to the production of sterile diploid males. This may help explain the unusual inheritance system recently described in <italic>O. biroi</italic>, where following crossover recombination, reciprocally recombined chromatids are faithfully co-inherited so that heterozygosity is rarely lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lacy et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>How this ancient putative CSD locus triggers female development in a heterozygosity-dependent manner remains unknown. In <italic>L. humile</italic>, RNAi experiments suggested that the expression level of the lncRNA <italic>ANTSR</italic> affects sex-specific splicing of <italic>tra</italic>, even though heterozygosity in the exons of <italic>ANTSR</italic> is not required for this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pan et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, the heterozygosity-dependent function of the candidate CSD locus may depend on local regulatory interactions between homologous chromosomes, similar to a phenomenon known as transvection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duncan, 2002</xref>). To better understand how heterozygosity induces female development in ants, future studies will need to fine-map and functionally characterize this causal locus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Software versions</title><p>The versions of all software used for analyses are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Identifying male ploidy</title><p>Clonal raider ant colonies are composed of female ants that reproduce asexually via a type of thelytokous parthenogenesis termed central fusion automixis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oxley et al., 2014</xref>).

Before calculating this index, we had to identify ancestrally heterozygous sites.

RefSeq assemblies were chromosome name-mapped to GenBank chromosome names using the Bioconductor GenomeInfoDb package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora et al., 2024</xref>) and the chromosome name maps available in NCBI.</p><p>The PacBio toolset’s pbmm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pacific Biosciences, 2023</xref>), a PacBio wrapper for Minimap2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li, 2018</xref>), was used for indexing and alignment of pooled full-length, non-concatemer long reads to the GenBank reference genome using the parameters “--preset ISOSEQ -j 8”. Following the generation of aligned long reads in BAM format, Stringtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovaka et al., 2019</xref>) was used with parameters “-L” for long read transcriptome assembly, and the curated RefSeq annotation was supplied as a guide for assembly using the “-G” parameter. The resulting gene models were exported for further analysis and integration as a gzipped GTF file.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Annotation improvements: Short read transcriptome assembly</title><p>For Illumina RNA-seq data, FastQ quality control was performed using Rfastp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang and Carroll, 2024</xref>). Indexing and alignment of short reads to the GenBank genome was performed using Hisat2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) with default parameters, and samtools was used to generate sorted and indexed BAM files for further analysis. Stringtie2 was then used to assemble transcriptomes using the default parameters. Gene models were then combined across replicates using Stringtie2’s merge function with parameters “-F 0.5 -T 2 -f 0.1” and were exported for further analysis and integration as a gzipped GTF file.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Annotation improvements: Integrating short and long read transcriptomes with the RefSeq assembly</title><p>Integration of long read and short read generated gene models with the established and curated RefSeq transcriptome was performed using custom scripts in R available from GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RockefellerUniversity/Obiroi_GeneModels_2025">https://github.com/RockefellerUniversity/Obiroi_GeneModels_2025</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carroll and Wang, 2025</xref>) and described here.</p><p>First, conflicting gene models where single long read genes map to multiple RefSeq genes and vice versa were identified. As generated long read gene models are supported by multiple full-length, non-concatemer long read alignments, attention was focused on the 720 instances of multiple long read generated genes overlapping single RefSeq genes.</p><p>Single exon long read genes were removed as these are often found to be artifacts from PacBio sequencing. Following this, long read gene models that split RefSeq gene models but matched with GenBank gene models were accepted with the corresponding RefSeq models rejected.</p><p>Next, RefSeq gene models that conflicted within themselves were removed. This includes genes that were overlapping in their exons but marked as separate genes.</p><p>After tidying RefSeq gene models, long read gene models that split RefSeq gene models but matched with short read gene models were accepted, with the corresponding RefSeq models rejected. After this gene model polishing, only 132 gene models were left where multiple long read generated genes overlapped single RefSeq genes.</p><p>To potentially rescue internally primed transcripts caused by long stretches of genomic polyAs, long read transcripts were assessed for polyA nucleotide content downstream from their endpoints, and these distributions were visualized to identify cut-offs for putative internally primed transcripts. Transcripts with at least 70% as 10 bp downstream of the last exon or with a polyA stretch &gt;4 in 10 bp of the last exons were labeled as putative internally primed transcripts. For putative internally primed transcripts, which also split RefSeq genes, short read gene models were used to guide the rescued models when both short read and RefSeq agreed on a single gene model.</p><p>Finally, for the remaining long read gene models that split RefSeq gene models, gaps between long read gene models were assessed in the short read and RefSeq gene models. If agreement in exon and junction structure was found between short read and RefSeq gene models, the long read gene models were rejected. This left a final 27 genes where long read gene models split RefSeq gene models, and these were manually assessed in IGV alongside short read and long read alignments to reject or accept.</p><p>With a final set of long read gene models, all RefSeq and short read transcripts that fell within single genes were then added to the long read transcriptome to create an integrated transcriptome. Duplicate transcripts were then removed from the integrated transcriptome, and transcripts and genes were annotated for their sources (long read, short read, RefSeq) and any overlap with the established RefSeq, GenBank, and Ensembl gene models included. Following the creation of the integrated gene models, SQANTI3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pardo-Palacios et al., 2024</xref>) was used to provide a final corrected set of gene models as well as additional QC, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Assessment of annotation quality and identifying novel genes, transcripts, and exons</title><p>SQANTI3 was run with default parameters on the integrated transcriptome against the curated RefSeq and GenBank gene models to generate QC and descriptive statistics on novel and non-canonical splicing events.

All these metrics were summarized into tables using custom R scripts available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RockefellerUniversity/Obiroi_GeneModels_2025">https://github.com/RockefellerUniversity/Obiroi_GeneModels_2025</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carroll and Wang, 2025</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Annotation of CDS and functional annotation of genes</title><p>Annotation of coding regions was performed using TransDecoder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haas, 2023</xref>) to add CDS information to our integrated gene models GTF. TransDecoder was run with default parameters except for providing the “--single_best_only” to the TransDecoder.Predict function to get only one prediction per transcript. CDS information was merged with SQANTI3’s GeneMark CDS annotation for a final set of CDSs. With this coding information, gene models were read into R, translated into protein sequences using the BioStrings package, and protein per transcript sequences exported as FASTA format for use in downstream tools. For functional annotation, both eggNOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huerta-Cepas et al., 2019</xref>) and InterProScan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2014</xref>) were used using default parameters with our protein sequences FASTA to provide predictions for functional annotations of genes including their putative GO, KEGG, PFAM, and Panther categories.

As stated in my initial review, I had no major criticisms of the previous version of the manuscript, and I continue to consider this a solid and well-written study. However, the revised manuscript still largely reiterates existing findings and does not offer novel conceptual or experimental advances. It supports previous conclusions suggesting a likely conserved sex determination locus in aculeate hymenopterans, but does so without functional validation (i.e., via experimental manipulation) of the candidate locus in O. biroi. I also wish to clarify that I did not intend to imply that functional assessments in the Pan et al. study were conducted in more than one focal species; my previous review explicitly states that the locus's functional role was validated in the Argentine ant.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106913.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors have made considerable efforts to conduct functional analyses to the fullest extent possible in this study; however, it is understandable that meaningful results have not yet been obtained.

Using whole genome sequencing, the authors analyze diploid females and the rarely occurring diploid males of O. biroi, identifying a 46 kb candidate region that is consistently heterozygous in females and predominantly homozygous in diploid males. This region shows elevated genetic diversity, as expected under balancing selection. The study also reports the presence of an lncRNA near this heterozygous region, which, though only distantly related in sequence, resembles the ANTSR lncRNA involved in female development in the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Pan et al. 2024). Together, these findings suggest a potentially conserved sex determination mechanism across ant species. However, while the analyses are well conducted and the paper is clearly written, the insights are largely incremental. The central conclusion - that the sex determination locus is conserved in ants - was already proposed and experimentally supported by Pan et al. (2024), who included O. biroi among the studied species and validated the locus's functional role in the Argentine ant. The present study thus largely reiterates existing findings without providing novel conceptual or experimental advances.</p></disp-quote><p>Although it is true that Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2024 demonstrated (in Figure 4 of their paper) that the synteny of the region flanking <italic>ANTSR</italic> is conserved across aculeate Hymenoptera (including <italic>O. biroi</italic>), Reviewer 1’s claim that that paper provides experimental support for the hypothesis that the sex determination locus is conserved in ants is inaccurate. Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2024 only performed experimental work in a single ant species (<italic>Linepithema humile</italic>) and merely compared reference genomes of multiple species to show synteny of the region, rather than functionally mapping or characterizing these regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>The mapping is based on a very small sample size: 19 females and 16 diploid males, and these all derive from a single clonal line. This implies a rather high probability for false-positive inference. In combination with the fact that only 11 out of the 16 genotyped males are actually homozygous at the candidate locus, I think a more careful interpretation regarding the role of the mapped region in sex determination would be appropriate. The main argument supporting the role of the candidate region in sex determination is based on the putative homology with the lncRNA involved in sex determination in the Argentine ant, but this argument was made in a previous study (as mentioned above).</p></disp-quote><p>Our main argument supporting the role of the candidate region in sex determination is not based on putative homology with the lncRNA in <italic>L. humile.</italic> Instead, our main argument comes from our genetic mapping (in Fig. 2), and the elevated nucleotide diversity within the identified region (Fig. 4). Additionally, we highlight that multiple genes within our mapped region are homologous to those in mapped sex determining regions in both <italic>L. humile</italic> and <italic>Vollenhovia emeryi</italic>, possibly including the lncRNA.</p><p>In response to the Reviewer’s assertion that the mapping is based on a small sample size from a single clonal line, we want to highlight that we used all diploid males available to us. Although the primary shortcoming of a small sample size is to increase the probability of a false negative, small sample sizes can also produce false positives. We used two approaches to explore the statistical robustness of our conclusions. First, we generated a null distribution by randomly shuffling sex labels within colonies and calculating the probability of observing our CSD index values by chance (shown in Fig. 2). Second, we directly tested the association between homozygosity and sex using Fisher’s Exact Test (shown in Supplementary Fig. S2). In both cases, the association of the candidate locus with sex was statistically significant after multiple-testing correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate. These approaches are clearly described in the “CSD Index Mapping” section of the Methods.</p><p>We also note that, because complementary sex determination loci are expected to evolve under balancing selection, our finding that the mapped region exhibits a peak of nucleotide diversity lends orthogonal support to the notion that the mapped locus is indeed a complementary sex determination locus.</p><p>The fourth paragraph of the results and the sixth paragraph of the discussion are devoted to explaining the possible reasons why only 11/16 genotyped males are homozygous in the mapped region. The revised manuscript will include an additional sentence (in what will be lines 384-388) in this paragraph that includes the possible explanation that this locus is, in fact, a false positive, while also emphasizing that we find this possibility to be unlikely given our multiple lines of evidence.</p><p>In response to Reviewer 1’s suggestion that we carefully interpret the role of the mapped region in sex determination, we highlight our careful wording choices, nearly always referring to the mapped locus as a “candidate sex determination locus” in the title and throughout the manuscript. For consistency, the revised manuscript version will change the second results subheading from “The <italic>O. biroi</italic> CSD locus is homologous to another ant sex determination locus but not to honeybee <italic>csd</italic>” to “<italic>O. biroi</italic>’s candidate CSD locus is homologous to another ant sex determination locus but not to honeybee <italic>csd</italic>,” and will add the word “candidate” in what will be line 320 at the beginning of the Discussion, and will change “putative” to “candidate” in what will be line 426 at the end of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the abstract, it is stated that CSD loci have been mapped in honeybees and two ant species, but we know little about their evolutionary history. But CSD candidate loci were also mapped in a wasp with multi-locus CSD (study cited in the introduction). This wasp is also parthenogenetic via central fusion automixis and produces diploid males. This is a very similar situation to the present study and should be referenced and discussed accordingly, particularly since the authors make the interesting suggestion that their ant also has multi-locus CSD and neither the wasp nor the ant has tra homologs in the CSD candidate regions. Also, is there any homology to the CSD candidate regions in the wasp species and the studied ant?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to Reviewer 1’s suggestion that we reference the (Matthey-Doret et al. 2019) study in the context of diploid males being produced via losses of heterozygosity during asexual reproduction, the revised manuscript will include (in what will be lines 123-126) the highlighted portion of the following sentence: “Therefore, if <italic>O. biroi</italic> uses CSD, diploid males might result from losses of heterozygosity at sex determination loci (Fig. 1C), similar to what is thought to occur in other asexual Hymenoptera that produce diploid males (Rabeling and Kronauer 2012; Matthey-Doret et al. 2019).”</p><p>We note, however, that in their 2019 study, Matthey-Doret <italic>et al</italic>. did not directly test the hypothesis that diploid males result from losses of heterozygosity at CSD loci during asexual reproduction, because the diploid males they used for their mapping study came from inbred crosses in a sexual population of that species.</p><p>We address this further below, but we want to emphasize that we do not intend to argue that <italic>O. biroi</italic> has multiple CSD loci. Instead, we suggest that additional, undetected CSD loci is one possible explanation for the absence of diploid males from any clonal line other than clonal line A. In response to Reviewer 1’s suggestion that we reference the (Matthey-Doret et al. 2019) study in the context of multilocus CSD, the revised manuscript version will include the following additional sentence in the fifth paragraph of the discussion (in what will be lines 372-374): “Multi-locus CSD has been suggested to limit the extent of diploid male production in asexual species under some circumstances (Vorburger 2013; Matthey-Doret et al. 2019).”</p><p>Regarding Reviewer 2’s question about homology between the putative CSD loci from the (Matthey-Doret et al. 2019) study and <italic>O. biroi</italic>, we note that there is no homology. The revised manuscript version will have an additional Supplementary Table (which will be the new Supplementary Table S3) that will report the results of this homology search. The revised manuscript will also include the following additional sentence in the Results, in what will be lines 172-174: “We found no homology between the genes within the <italic>O. biroi</italic> CSD index peak and any of the genes within the putative <italic>L. fabarum</italic> CSD loci (Supplementary Table S3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors used different clonal lines of O. biroi to investigate whether heterozygosity at the mapped CSD locus is required for female development in all clonal lines of O. biroi (L187-196). However, given the described parthenogenesis mechanism in this species conserves heterozygosity, additional females that are heterozygous are not very informative here. Indeed, one would need diploid males in these other clonal lines as well (but such males have not yet been found) to make any inference regarding this locus in other lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a full mapping study including diploid males from all clonal lines would be preferable, but as stated earlier in that same paragraph, we have only found diploid males from clonal line A. We stand behind our modest claim that “Females from all six clonal lines were heterozygous at the CSD index peak, consistent with its putative role as a CSD locus in all <italic>O. biroi.”</italic> In the revised manuscript version, this sentence (in what will be lines 199-201) will be changed slightly in response to a reviewer comment below: “All females from all six clonal lines (including 26 diploid females from clonal line B) were heterozygous at the CSD index peak, consistent with its putative role as a CSD locus in all <italic>O. biroi</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Lacy et al. is well written, with a clear and compelling introduction that effectively conveys the significance of the study. The methods are appropriate and well-executed, and the results, both in the main text and supplementary materials, are presented in a clear and detailed manner. The authors interpret their findings with appropriate caution.</p><p>This work makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the evolution of complementary sex determination (CSD) in ants. In particular, it provides important evidence for the ancient origin of a non-coding locus implicated in sex determination, and shows that, remarkably, this sex locus is conserved even in an ant species with a non-canonical reproductive system that typically does not produce males. I found this to be an excellent and well-rounded study, carefully analyzed and well contextualized.</p><p>That said, I do have a few minor comments, primarily concerning the discussion of the potential 'ghost' CSD locus. While the authors acknowledge (line 367) that they currently have no data to distinguish among the alternative hypotheses, I found the evidence for an additional CSD locus presented in the results (lines 261-302) somewhat limited and at times a bit difficult to follow. I wonder whether further clarification or supporting evidence could already be extracted from the existing data. Specifically:</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 2 that the evidence for a second CSD locus is limited. In fact, we do not intend to advocate for there being a second locus, but we suggest that a second CSD locus is one possible explanation for the absence of diploid males outside of clonal line A. In our initial version, we intentionally conveyed this ambiguity by titling this section “<italic>O. biroi</italic> may have one or multiple sex determination loci.” However, we now see that this leads to undue emphasis on the possibility of a second locus. In the revised manuscript, we will split this into two separate sections: “Diploid male production differs across <italic>O. biroi</italic> clonal lines” and “<italic>O. biroi</italic> lacks a <italic>tra</italic>-containing CSD locus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Line 268: I doubt the relevance of comparing the proportion of diploid males among all males between lines A and B to infer the presence of additional CSD loci. Since the mechanisms producing these two types of males differ, it might be more appropriate to compare the proportion of diploid males among all diploid offspring. This ratio has been used in previous studies on CSD in Hymenoptera to estimate the number of sex loci (see, for example, Cook 1993, de Boer et al. 2008, 2012, Ma et al. 2013, and Chen et al., 2021). The exact method might not be applicable to clonal raider ants, but I think comparing the percentage of diploid males among the total number of (diploid) offspring produced between the two lineages might be a better argument for a difference in CSD loci number.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to re-emphasize here that we do not wish to advocate for there being two CSD loci in <italic>O. biroi</italic>. Rather, we want to explain that this is one possible explanation for the apparent absence of diploid males outside of clonal line A. We hope that the modifications to the manuscript described in the previous response help to clarify this.</p><p>Reviewer 2 is correct that comparing the number of diploid males to diploid females does not apply to clonal raider ants. This is because males are vanishingly rare among the vast numbers of females produced. We do not count how many females are produced in laboratory stock colonies, and males are sampled opportunistically. Therefore, we cannot report exact numbers. However, we will add the highlighted portion of the following sentence (in what will be lines 268-270) to the revised manuscript: “Despite the fact that we maintain more colonies of clonal line B than of clonal line A in the lab, all the diploid males we detected came from clonal line A.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) If line B indeed carries an additional CSD locus, one would expect that some females could be homozygous at the ANTSR locus but still viable, being heterozygous only at the other locus. Do the authors detect any females in line B that are homozygous at the ANTSR locus? If so, this would support the existence of an additional, functionally independent CSD locus.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and again we emphasize that we do not want to argue in favor of multiple CSD loci. We just want to introduce it as one possible explanation for the absence of diploid males outside of clonal line A.</p><p>The 26 sequenced diploid females from clonal line B are all heterozygous at the mapped locus, and the revised manuscript will clarify this in what will be lines 199-201. Previously, only six of those diploid females were included in Supplementary Table S2, and that will be modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 281: The description of the two tra-containing CSD loci as &quot;conserved&quot; between Vollenhovia and the honey bee may be misleading. It suggests shared ancestry, whereas the honey bee csd gene is known to have arisen via a relatively recent gene duplication from fem/tra (10.1038/nature07052). It would be more accurate to refer to this similarity as a case of convergent evolution rather than conservation.</p></disp-quote><p>In the sentence that Reviewer 2 refers to, we are representing the assertion made in the (Miyakawa and Mikheyev 2015) paper in which, regarding their mapping of a candidate CSD locus that contains two linked <italic>tra</italic> homologs, they write in the abstract: “these data support the prediction that the same CSD mechanism has indeed been conserved for over 100 million years.” In that same paper, Miyakawa and Mikheyev write in the discussion section: “As ants and bees diverged more than 100 million years ago, sex determination in honey bees and V. emeryi is probably homologous and has been conserved for at least this long.”</p><p>As noted by Reviewer 2, this appears to conflict with a previously advanced hypothesis: that because <italic>fem</italic> and <italic>csd</italic> were found in <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, <italic>Apis cerana</italic>, and <italic>Apis dorsata</italic>, but only <italic>fem</italic> was found in <italic>Mellipona compressipes</italic>, <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic>, and <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>, that the <italic>csd</italic> gene evolved after the honeybee (<italic>Apis</italic>) lineage diverged from other bees (Hasselmann et al. 2008). However, it remains possible that the <italic>csd</italic> gene evolved after ants and bees diverged from <italic>N. vitripennis</italic>, but before the divergence of ants and bees, and then was subsequently lost in <italic>B. terrestris</italic> and <italic>M. compressipes</italic>. This view was previously put forward based on bioinformatic identification of putative orthologs of <italic>csd</italic> and <italic>fem</italic> in bumblebees and in ants [(Schmieder et al. 2012), see also (Privman et al. 2013)]. However, subsequent work disagreed and argued that the duplications of <italic>tra</italic> found in ants and in bumblebees represented convergent evolution rather than homology (Koch et al. 2014). Distinguishing between these possibilities will be aided by additional sex determination locus mapping studies and functional dissection of the underlying molecular mechanisms in diverse Aculeata.</p><p>Distinguishing between these competing hypotheses is beyond the scope of our paper, but the revised manuscript will include additional text to incorporate some of this nuance. We will include these modified lines below (in what will be lines 287-295), with the additions highlighted:</p><p>“A second QTL region identified in <italic>V. emeryi</italic> (<italic>V.emeryiCsdQTL1</italic>) contains two closely linked <italic>tra</italic> homologs, similar to the closely linked honeybee <italic>tra</italic> homologs, <italic>csd</italic> and <italic>fem</italic> (Miyakawa and Mikheyev 2015). This, along with the discovery of duplicated <italic>tra</italic> homologs that undergo concerted evolution in bumblebees and ants (Schmieder et al. 2012; Privman et al. 2013) has led to the hypothesis that the function of <italic>tra</italic> homologs as CSD loci is conserved with the <italic>csd</italic>-containing region of honeybees (Schmieder et al. 2012; Miyakawa and Mikheyev 2015). However, other work has suggested that <italic>tra</italic> duplications occurred independently in honeybees, bumblebees, and ants (Hasselmann et al. 2008; Koch et al. 2014), and it remains to be demonstrated that either of these <italic>tra</italic> homologs acts as a primary CSD signal in <italic>V. emeryi</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Finally, since the authors successfully identified multiple alleles of the first CSD locus using previously sequenced haploid males, I wonder whether they also observed comparable allelic diversity at the candidate second CSD locus. This would provide useful supporting evidence for its functional relevance.</p><p>Overall, these are relatively minor points in the context of a strong manuscript, but I believe addressing them would improve the clarity and robustness of the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As is already addressed in the final paragraph of the results and in Supplementary Fig. S4, there is no peak of nucleotide diversity in any of the regions homologous to <italic>V.emeryiQTL1</italic>, which is the <italic>tra</italic>-containing candidate sex determination locus (Miyakawa and Mikheyev 2015). In the revised manuscript, the relevant lines will be 307-310. We want to restate that we do not propose that there is a second candidate CSD locus in <italic>O. biroi</italic>, but we simply raise the possibility that multi-locus CSD *might* explain the absence of diploid males from clonal lines other than clonal line A (as one of several alternative possibilities).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The sex determination mechanism governed by the complementary sex determination (CSD) locus is one of the mechanisms that support the haplodiploid sex determination system evolved in hymenopteran insects. While many ant species are believed to possess a CSD locus, it has only been specifically identified in two species. The authors analyzed diploid females and the rarely occurring diploid males of the clonal ant Ooceraea biroi and identified a 46 kb CSD candidate region that is consistently heterozygous in females and predominantly homozygous in males. This region was found to be homologous to the CSD locus reported in distantly related ants. In the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, the CSD locus overlaps with an lncRNA (ANTSR) that is essential for female development and is associated with the heterozygous region (Pan et al. 2024). Similarly, an lncRNA is encoded near the heterozygous region within the CSD candidate region of O. biroi. Although this lncRNA shares low sequence similarity with ANTSR, its potential functional involvement in sex determination is suggested. Based on these findings, the authors propose that the heterozygous region and the adjacent lncRNA in O. biroi may trigger female development via a mechanism similar to that of L. humile. They further suggest that the molecular mechanisms of sex determination involving the CSD locus in ants have been highly conserved for approximately 112 million years. This study is one of the few to identify a CSD candidate region in ants and is particularly noteworthy as the first to do so in a parthenogenetic species.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The CSD candidate region was found to be homologous to the CSD locus reported in distantly related ant species, enhancing the significance of the findings.</p><p>(2) Identifying the CSD candidate region in a parthenogenetic species like O. biroi is a notable achievement and adds novelty to the research.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>(1) Functional validation of the lncRNA's role is lacking, and further investigation through knockout or knockdown experiments is necessary to confirm its involvement in sex determination.</p></disp-quote><p>See response below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The claim that the lncRNA is essential for female development appears to reiterate findings already proposed by Pan et al. (2024), which may reduce the novelty of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not claim that the lncRNA is essential for female development in <italic>O. biroi</italic>, but simply mention the possibility that, as in <italic>L. humile</italic>, it is somehow involved in sex determination. We do not have any functional evidence for this, so this is purely based on its genomic position immediately adjacent to our mapped candidate region. We agree with the reviewer that the study by Pan et al. (2024) decreases the novelty of our findings. Another way of looking at this is that our study supports and bolsters previous findings by partially replicating the results in a different species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>L307-308 should state homozygous for either allele in THE MAJORITY of diploid males.</p></disp-quote><p>This will be fixed in the revised manuscript, in what will be line 321.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The association between heterozygosity in the CSD candidate region and female development in O. biroi, along with the high sequence homology of this region to CSD loci identified in two distantly related ant species, is not sufficient to fully address the evolution of the CSD locus and the mechanisms of sex determination.</p><p>Given that functional genetic tools, such as genome editing, have already been established in O. biroi, I strongly recommend that the authors investigate the role of the lncRNA through knockout or knockdown experiments and assess its impact on the sex-specific splicing pattern of the downstream tra gene.</p></disp-quote><p>Although knockout experiments of the lncRNA would be illuminating, the primary signal of complementary sex determination is heterozygosity. As is clearly stated in our manuscript and that of (Pan et al. 2024), it does not appear to be heterozygosity within the lncRNA that induces female development, but rather heterozygosity in non-transcribed regions linked to the lncRNA. Therefore, future mechanistic studies of sex determination in <italic>O. biroi</italic>, <italic>L. humile</italic>, and other ants should explore how homozygosity or heterozygosity of this region impacts the sex determination cascade, rather than focusing (exclusively) on the lncRNA.</p><p>With this in mind, we developed three sets of guide RNAs that cut only one allele within the mapped CSD locus, with the goal of producing deletions within the highly variable region within the mapped locus. This would lead to functional hemizygosity or homozygosity within this region, depending on how the cuts were repaired. We also developed several sets of PCR primers to assess the heterozygosity of the resultant animals. After injecting 1,162 eggs over several weeks and genotyping the hundreds of resultant animals with PCR, we confirmed that we could induce hemizygosity or homozygosity within this region, at least in ~1/20 of the injected embryos. Although it is possible to assess the sex-specificity of the splice isoform of <italic>tra</italic> as a proxy for sex determination phenotypes (as done by (Pan et al. 2024)), the ideal experiment would assess male phenotypic development at the pupal stage. Therefore, over several more weeks, we injected hundreds more eggs with these reagents and reared the injected embryos to the pupal stage. However, substantial mortality was observed, with only 12 injected eggs developing to the pupal stage. All of these were female, and none of them had been successfully mutated.</p><p>In conclusion, we agree with the reviewer that functional experiments would be useful, and we made extensive attempts to conduct such experiments. However, these experiments turned out to be extremely challenging with the currently available protocols. Ultimately, we therefore decided to abandon these attempts.</p><p>We opted not to include these experiments in the paper itself because we cannot meaningfully interpret their results. However, we are pleased that, in this response letter, we can include a brief description for readers interested in attempting similar experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since O. biroi reproduces parthenogenetically and most offspring develop into females, observing a shift from female- to male-specific splicing of tra upon early embryonic knockout of the lncRNA would provide much stronger evidence that this lncRNA is essential for female development. Without such functional validation, the authors' claim (lines 36-38) seems to reiterate findings already proposed by Pan et al. (2024) and, as such, lacks sufficient novelty.</p></disp-quote><p>We have responded to the issue of “lack of novelty” above. But again, the actual CSD locus in both <italic>O. biroi</italic> and <italic>L. humile</italic> appears to be distinct from (but genetically linked to) the lncRNA, and we have no experimental evidence that the putative lncRNA in <italic>O. biroi</italic> is involved in sex determination at all. Because of this, and given the experimental challenges described above, we do not currently intend to pursue functional studies of the lncRNA.</p><p>References</p><p>Hasselmann M, Gempe T, Schiøtt M, Nunes-Silva CG, Otte M, Beye M. 2008.
