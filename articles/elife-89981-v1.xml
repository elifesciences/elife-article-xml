Disruption of R-loop homeostasis can lead to genomic instability and replication impairment, contributing to several human diseases, including cancer. Although the molecular mechanisms that protect cells against such events are not fully understood, recent research has identified fork protection factors and DNA damage response proteins as regulators of R-loop dynamics. In this study, we identify the Werner helicase-interacting protein 1 (WRNIP1) as a novel factor that counteracts transcription-associated DNA damage upon replication perturbation. Loss of WRNIP1 leads to R-loop accumulation, resulting in collisions between the replisome and transcription machinery. We observe co-localization of WRNIP1 with transcription/replication complexes and R-loops after replication perturbation, suggesting its involvement in resolving transcription-replication conflicts. Moreover, WRNIP1-deficient cells show impaired replication restart from transcription-induced fork stalling. Notably, transcription inhibition and RNase H1 overexpression rescue all the defects caused by loss of WRNIP1. Importantly, our findings highlight the critical role of WRNIP1 ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain in preventing pathological persistence of R-loops and limiting DNA damage, thereby safeguarding genome integrity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genomic instability</kwd><kwd>replication stress</kwd><kwd>R-loops</kwd><kwd>werner helicase-interacting protein 1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020581</institution-id><institution>Fondazione AIRC per la ricerca sul cancro ETS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator grant 19971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franchitto</surname><given-names>Annapaola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020581</institution-id><institution>Fondazione AIRC per la ricerca sul cancro ETS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator grant 17383</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pichierri</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>WRNIP1 has been identified as a pivotal factor in preventing the pathological persistence of R-loop-induced transcription-replication conflicts and the accumulation of DNA damage, thereby ensuring genome integrity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The maintenance of genome integrity is essential for cell viability, relying on complete and accurate DNA replication. However, the genome is continuously threatened by several types of DNA lesions that impede replication fork progression, leading to fork stalling, replication stress and ultimately to genomic instability – a hallmark of cancer cells. Different molecular mechanisms underlie replication stress, and understanding their occurrence has been of interest for cancer therapy. Among these mechanisms, the transcription process plays a crucial role in inducing replication fork stalling. Transcription not only hampers replication fork progression but also acts as an enhancer of replication impediments, including protein-DNA complexes, DNA damage, and non-B-form DNA secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gómez-González and Aguilera, 2019</xref>).</p><p>R-loops have emerged as critical determinants of transcription-associated replication stress, capable of causing genomic instability and promoting cancer and other human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gómez-González and Aguilera, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>). R-loops are three-stranded structures that consist of an DNA/RNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA. They are involved in various physiological processes, including transcription termination, regulation of gene expression, and DNA repair. Under normal conditions, R-loops are transient structures resolved by enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wahba et al., 2011</xref>). However, persistent R-loops can become pathological, leading to the formation of transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs). Given the high frequency of replication and transcription processes in cells, TRCs are particularly likely to occur. The interference between transcription and replication at very large human genes, whose transcription continues into S-phase, may contribute to the instability of common fragile sites (CFS), the most replication stress-sensitive regions in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Helmrich et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The idea that R-loops cause fork stalling, promoting TRCs and leading to transcription-associated DNA damage is supported by the fact that many strategies, aimed at minimizing collisions and facilitating replication fork progression following unscheduled R-loop accumulation, rely on replication fork protection factors and DNA damage response (DDR) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shivji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwab et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-Rubio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Urban et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marabitti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tresini et al., 2015</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms by which cells cope with TRCs resulting from persistent R-loops are still largely unknown.</p><p>Human WRN-interacting protein 1 (WRNIP1) is a genome maintenance factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshimura et al., 2017</xref>). WRNIP1 binds to forked DNA that resembles stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshimura et al., 2009</xref>) with its foci overlapping with replication factories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crosetto et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting a role at replication forks. Consistent with this, WRNIP1 protects stalled forks from MRE11-mediated degradation and promotes fork restart upon replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leuzzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Porebski et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, WRNIP1 is implicated in ATM-dependent checkpoint activation in response to mild replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marabitti et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, in cells with defective ATR-dependent checkpoint activation, such as Werner syndrome cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basile et al., 2014</xref>), WRNIP1 mediates ATM-dependent CHK1 phosphorylation to counteract pathological R-loop accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marabitti et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, WRNIP1 is found to be enriched at CFS, suggesting a role in maintaining their stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pladevall-Morera et al., 2019</xref>). However, data regarding a role of WRNIP1 in restricting transcription-associated genomic instability are not available.</p><p>Here, we reveal that loss of WRNIP1 and the activity of WRNIP1 ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain are necessary to limit unscheduled R-loops leading to TRCs. Additionally, we establish that loss of WRNIP1 functions is responsible for the increased genomic instability observed in WRNIP1-deficient and UBZ mutant cells upon mild replication perturbation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcription-dependent DNA damage occurs in WRNIP1-deficient and UBZ mutant cells upon MRS</title><p>To investigate the contribution of WRNIP1 in maintaining genome integrity, we evaluated DNA damage accumulation in response to mild replication stress (MRS) induced by nanomolar dose of the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin (Aph). In addition to its ATPase activity, which is involved in fork restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leuzzi et al., 2016</xref>), WRNIP1 also contains a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain. Although this domain has been implicated in fork-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshimura et al., 2017</xref>), its function is still poorly defined.</p><p>In our experiments, we used the SV40-transformed MRC5 fibroblast cell line (MRC5SV), MRC5SV cells stably expressing WRNIP1-targeting shRNA (shWRNIP1), and isogenic cell lines stably expressing the RNAi-resistant full-length wild-type WRNIP1 (shWRNIP1<sup>WT</sup>), its ATPase-dead mutant form (shWRNIP1<sup>T294A</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leuzzi et al., 2016</xref>), or the UBZ-dead mutant form of WRNIP1 (shWRNIP1<sup>D37A</sup>) that abolishes the ubiquitin-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bish and Myers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Initially, we measured DNA damage by alkaline Comet assay in WRNIP1-deficient and WRNIP1 mutant cells. Consistent with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marabitti et al., 2020</xref>), we found that loss of WRNIP1 resulted in higher spontaneous levels of DNA damage compared to wild-type cells (MRC5SV), and that Aph exacerbated this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, in WRNIP1 mutant cells, spontaneous genomic damage was similar to that observed in WRNIP1-deficient cells but, after MRS, it was significantly enhanced only in UBZ mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of WRNIP1 or its UBZ domain results in DNA damage accumulation and enhanced chromosomal instability upon MRS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of human WRNIP1 protein structure.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, shWRNIP1 and WRNIP1 mutant cells exhibited a greater number of chromosomal aberrations under unperturbed conditions compared to their corrected isogenic counterparts (shWRNIP1<sup>WT</sup>). However, while loss of WRNIP1 or mutation of its UBZ domain heightened the average number of gaps and breaks after Aph than their corrected counterparts (shWRNIP1<sup>WT</sup>), that of ATPase activity did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, loss of WRNIP1 or its ubiquitin-binding function renders cells highly sensitive to Aph-induced MRS, affecting genomic integrity.</p><p>We next wondered whether DNA damage accumulated in a transcription-dependent manner. To test this possibility, we performed a alkaline Comet assay using MRC5SV, shWRNIP1, shWRNIP1<sup>D37A</sup> and shWRNIP1<sup>T294A</sup> cells incubated with Aph and/or the 5,6-dichloro-1-ß-D-ribofurosylbenzimidazole (DRB), a strong inhibitor of RNA synthesis, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marabitti et al., 2019</xref>). Our analysis showed that DNA damage was not sensitive to transcription inhibition at any of the tested conditions in wild-type and WRNIP1 ATPase mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, DRB significantly suppressed the amount of DNA damage in both shWRNIP1 and shWRNIP1<sup>D37A</sup> cells that were either untreated or treated with Aph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar results were obtained using another transcription inhibitor, Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, anti-phospho-H2AX immunostaining, considered an early sign of DNA damage caused by replication fork stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ward and Chen, 2001</xref>), confirmed a transcription-dependent DNA damage accumulation in shWRNIP1 and shWRNIP1<sup>D37A</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Altogether these findings suggest that WRNIP1 and the activity of its UBZ domain are required to prevent transcription-dependent DNA damage.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Enhanced R-loop accumulation is observed in WRNIP1-deficient cells</title><p>The main structures associated with transcription that can impede fork movement and result in transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) are R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison and Wang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaillard and Aguilera, 2016</xref>). As WRNIP1 may counteract R-loop-mediated TRCs by reducing transcription-dependent DNA damage accumulation, we first assessed R-loops levels in our cells using the well-established anti-RNA-DNA hybrid S9.6 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boguslawski et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamperl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marabitti et al., 2019</xref>).

Importantly, the S9.6 staining was strongly suppressed upon overexpression of RNase H1 that removes R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerritelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Loss of WRNIP1 or its UBZ domain results in R-loop accumulation upon MRS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Evaluation of R-loop accumulation by immunofluorescence analysis in shWRNIP1<sup>WT</sup> and shWRNIP1 cells, following treatment as reported in the experimental design post-transfection with GFP-tagged RNase H1 or empty vector.

Previous results from our lab and others have revealed that WRNIP1 is crucial for the protection of HU-stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leuzzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Porebski et al., 2019</xref>). More recently, it has been demonstrated that checkpoint defects trigger a WRNIP1-mediated response to limit R-loop-associated genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marabitti et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, whether WRNIP1 is directly involved in the mechanisms of R-loop removal/resolution remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we establish a function for WRNIP1 and its ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain in counteracting DNA damage and genome instability resulting from transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs).</p><p>We have demonstrated that WRNIP1 plays a crucial role in facilitating fork restart, and this function specifically relies on its ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leuzzi et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, while the ATPase activity of WRNIP1 is essential for the restart of stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leuzzi et al., 2016</xref>), it is dispensable for dealing with TRCs. In sharp contrast, a mutation disrupting the WRNIP1 UBZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bish and Myers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>) is sufficient to induce TRCs and DNA damage at levels comparable to, if not higher than, those observed in WRNIP1-deficient cells.</p><p>The persistence of R-loops is detrimental as they can interfere with DNA replication, and R-loop-mediated fork stalling is a major feature of TRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boubakri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wellinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tuduri et al., 2009</xref>). In cells lacking WRNIP1 or expressing the WRNIP1 UBZ mutant, the elevated DNA damage and reduced fork speed are restored by RNase H1-GFP overexpression, which degrades RNA/DNA hybrids and eliminates R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerritelli et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with this, many more R-loops are detected in WRNIP1-deficient or UBZ mutant cells. This strongly suggests that unscheduled R-loops likely contribute to the increased levels of TRCs, the marked replication defects, and genomic instability observed in the absence of WRNIP1.</p><p>R-loops are the main DNA secondary structures formed during transcription and, although they regulate several physiological processes, they can also act as potent replication fork barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gómez-González and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). Consequently, the unscheduled accumulation of R-loops results in TRCs, leading to transcription-associated DNA damage in both yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huertas and Aguilera, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Manley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santos-Pereira and Aguilera, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paulsen et al., 2009</xref>). To prevent TRCs, several replication fork protection factors are essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Stirling, 2017</xref>). Disrupting of these proteins can compromise the ability of cells to overcome or resolve R-loops, leading to DNA damage. Our previous research has demonstrated that WRNIP1, not relying on its ATPase activity, protects stalled forks from nucleolytic degradation upon replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leuzzi et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, WRNIP1 has been found to immunoprecipitate with BRCA2 and RAD51, and its loss destabilizes RAD51 on ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leuzzi et al., 2016</xref>) Notably, R-loop formation exposes a potentially vulnerable ssDNA region on the non-template strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012</xref>). Since BRCA2 is known to mitigate R-loop-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shivji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), it is conceivable that WRNIP1, through its association with the BRCA2/RAD51 complex, could facilitate RAD51 recruitment or stabilization to protect the ssDNA of R-loops. Supporting this, RAD51 co-localizes with R-loops after MRS, and this co-localization depends on the WRNIP1 UBZ domain. Therefore, WRNIP1 may protect R-loops to ensure their safe handling and promote the successful restart of stalled forks. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe WRNIP1 co-localizing with transcription/replication complexes and R-loops after MRS. It has been suggested that the incision of R-loops, a process promoting fork progression and restart at TRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chappidi et al., 2020</xref>), requires high accuracy to prevent fork collapse and chromosomal damage, posing a risk to genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Promonet et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings indicate that the R-loop-dependent accumulation of DNA damage and genome instability may suggest a preference for engaging error-prone mechanisms when WRNIP1 is depleted. Alternatively, WRNIP1 may play a role in stabilizing RAD51 on the ssDNA of DNA/RNA hybrids, facilitating fork restart through fork reversal. Indeed, one proposed mechanism for processing DNA/RNA hybrids involves the exposure of ssDNA and the loading of RAD51, which mediates fork reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stoy et al., 2023</xref>). While these hybrids are typically resolved under physiological conditions, allowing stalled fork restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stoy et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chappidi et al., 2020</xref>), post-replicative DNA/RNA hybrids could represent pathological TRC intermediates capable of impairing replication fork progression and stimulating fork reversal.</p><p>The phenotype observed in WRNIP1 UBZ mutant cells is similar to that of WRNIP1-deficient cells, suggesting that the ubiquitin-binding function of WRNIP1 could play a role in mitigating R-loop-induced TRCs. Despite the UBZ domain of WRNIP1 having an undefined function after replication perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshimura et al., 2017</xref>), human WRNIP1 in known to bind both forked DNA, resembling stalled replication forks, and template/primer DNA in an ATP-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshimura et al., 2009</xref>). However, our findings indicate that WRNIP1 does not use its ATPase activity to counteract TRC-induced R-loop accumulation. Nevertheless, WRNIP1’s ability to bind ubiquitin suggests its potential involvement in the metabolic processes of ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bish and Myers, 2007</xref>). The UBZ domain of WRNIP1 is implicated in the physical association with RAD18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanu et al., 2016</xref>). RAD18-deficient cells exhibit high levels of TRCs and accumulate DNA/RNA hybrids, leading to DNA double strand breaks and replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wells et al., 2022</xref>). These effects are partially dependent on the failure to recruit the Fanconi anemia protein FANCD2 to R-loop-prone genomic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wells et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, in our context, FANCD2 localizes with R-loops after MRS, and this localization is more pronounced in cells lacking WRNIP1 and its UBZ domain. Additionally, in our cell lines, although R-loop levels are more elevated in FANCD2-depleted cells, DNA damage is more pronounced in WRNIP1-deficient cells, suggesting that the FA pathway may act as a backup system to counteract TRCs. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the UBZ domain might contribute to directing WRNIP1 to DNA at TRC sites through RAD18, and that the elevated levels of TRCs observed in RAD18-deficient cells are due to the loss of both WRNIP1 and FANCD2 functions. This intriguing point deserves further and detailed investigation.</p><p>Altogether our findings unveil a previously unappreciated role for WRNIP1 in counteracting the pathological accumulation of transcription-associated R-loops, thereby preventing heightened genomic instability following MRS in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). A growing body of evidence suggests that R-loops may be implicated in the genomic instability observed in human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). Notably, considering the observed overexpression of WRNIP1 in the most common human cancer types, such as lung and breast cancers, our discoveries contribute to a deeper understanding of mechanisms cells employ to counteract TRCs. These results open avenues for exploring novel pathways that may contribute to genomic instability in cancer.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Working model for the potential role of WRNIP1 in R-loop accumulation.</title><p>Upon replication fork stalling, WRNIP1 binds to R-loops and protects stalled forks, promoting genomic integrity.

The authors used human MRC5 fibroblasts investigated with standard methods in the field. The results clearly showed that WRNIP1 silencing and UBZ-mutation (D37A) increased DNA damage, chromosome aberrations, and transcription-replication conflicts caused by aphidicolin.</p><p>The conclusions of the paper are overall well supported by results, however, aspects of some data analyses would need to be clarified and/or extended.</p><p>(1) The methods (immunofluorescence microscopy and dot-blots) to determine R-loop levels can lack sensitivity and specificity. In particular, since the S9.6 antibody can bind to other structures besides heteroduplex, dot-blot analyses only grossly assess R-loop levels in cellular samples of purified nucleic acids, which are constituted by many different types of DNA/RNA structures.</p><p>(2) Experimental plan has analyzed the impact of WRNIP1 lack or mutations at steady-state conditions. Thus, the possible role of WRNIP1 at an early step of the mechanism would require some sort of kinetics analysis of the molecular process, therefore not at steady-state conditions. The findings of a co-localization of R-loops and WRNIP1 have been obtained with the S9.6 antibody, which recognizes DNA-RNA heteroduplexes. Since WRNIP1 is known to be recruited at stalled forks and DNA cleavage sites, it is not surprising that WRNIP1 is very close to heteroduplexes, abundant structures at replication forks and cleavage sites. Similar interpretations may also be valid for Rad51/S9.6 co-localization findings.</p><p>(3) Determination of DNA damage, chromosome aberration, and co-localization data are reported as means of measurements with appropriate statistics. However, the fold-change values relative to corresponding untreated samples are not reported. In some instances, it seems that WRNIP1 silencing or mutations actually reduce or do not affect aphidicolin effects. That leaves open the interpretation of specific results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89981.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript by Valenzisi et al., the authors report on the role of WRNIP1 to prevent R-loop and TRC-associated DNA damage. The authors claim WRNIP1 localizes to TRCs in response to replication stress and prevents R-loop accumulation, TRC formation, replication fork stalling, and subsequent DNA damage. While the findings are of potential significance to the field, the strength of evidence in support of the conclusions is lacking.</p><p>In the revised submission by Velenzisi et al., the manuscript is still missing the controls that were requested in the original review. One cannot conclude the D37A mutant is unable to rescue DNA damage unless it is shown in the same experiment that the WT is able to rescue it. This is also true for the fork speed, stalled forks, and restarting forks experiments. Below is a list of Figures missing key controls.</p><p>Figure 1B -missing the shWRNIP1WT control</p><p>Figure 1C - missing the MRC5SV control</p><p>Figure 1D - missing the shWRNIP1WT control</p><p>Figure 3C - missing the shWRNIP1WT control</p><p>Figure 5A - missing the shWRNIP1WT control</p><p>Figure 5B - missing the shWRNIP1WT control</p><p>Figure 5C - missing the shWRNIP1WT control</p><p>Figure 5D - missing the shWRNIP1WT control</p><p>Figure 6C - missing the shWRNIP1WT control</p><p>Also, the authors did not explain the result showing shWRNIP1 decreases DNA damage compared to MRC5SV in Figure 1D (compare lanes 4 and 8). Again, this suggests WRNIP1 actually increases DNA damage in response to Aph and DRB. This concern was raised in the original peer review, and it remains unaddressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The use of RNaseHIII increases the specificity of the S9.6 antibody and improves confidence in the DNA-RNA hybrid data throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89981.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Valenzisi</surname><given-names>Pasquale</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02hssy432</institution-id><institution>Istituto Superiore di Sanità</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rome</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marabitti</surname><given-names>Veronica</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02hssy432</institution-id><institution>Istituto Superiore di Sanità</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rome</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pichierri</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02hssy432</institution-id><institution>Istituto Superiore di Sanità</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rome</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Franchitto</surname><given-names>Annapaola</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02hssy432</institution-id><institution>Istituto Superiore di Sanità</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rome</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>This paper describes the role of WRNIP1 AAA+ ATPase, particularly its UBZ domain for ubiquitinbinding, but not ATPase, to prevent the formation of the R-loop when DNA replication is mildly perturbated. By combining cytological analysis for DNA damage, R-loop, and chromosome aberration with the proximity ligation assay for colocalization of various proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription, the authors provide solid evidence to support the claim. The authors also revealed a distinct role of WRNIP1 in the prevention of R-loop-induced DNA damage from FANCD2, which is inconsistent with the known relationship between WRNIP1 and FANCD2 in the repair of crosslinks.</p><p>One concern is the relationship between WRNIP1 and FANCD2 (Figure 6) in the suppression of Rloop-induced DNA damage. This is different from the relationship in inter-crosslink (ICL) repair (Socha et al. 2020), which shows the epistatic relationship between WRNIP1 as well as its UBZ domain and FANCD2 in the ICL repair. The authors need to re-evaluate the role of FNACD2 in Rloop suppression under mild replication stress (MRS) by analyzing R-loop formation in the FANCD2 knockdown (KD) cells as well as colocalization of FANCD2 with PCNA and RNA polymerase II by the PLA method and restarting the forks by the DNA coming.</p><p>In this line, it is important to show PLA signal between FANCD2 and R-loop depends on WRNIP1 since WRINP1 recruits FANCD2 in ICL repair (Socha et al. 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>In the study referenced by the reviewer, the authors implicated WRNIP1 in repairing interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by agents, such as TMP/UVA, MMC, and Cisplatin (Socha et al., 2020). For the repair of ICLs, the FANCD2/FANCI complex, the central component of the FA pathway, must be recruited to DNA. The study suggests a potential role for WRNIP1 in loading the FANCD2/FANCI complex onto DNA immediately after ICL formation. However, even in the absence of WRNIP1, a residual recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex to DNA was observed, possibly due to alternative mechanisms, as proposed by the authors. Interestingly, the study did not establish a similar relationship between WRNIP1 and FANCD2 after treatments that does not induce ICLs, demonstrating that WRNIP1 and FANCD2 may also play independent roles. Hence, our data demonstrating a distinct role of WRNIP1 from the FA pathway in response to R-loop-associated replication stress are not inconsistent with prior findings. Additionally, considering the UBZ domain ability to interact with ubiquitin in both its free form and when conjugated to other proteins, thereby regulating protein functions, it is not surprising that the UBZ domain of WRNIP1 may also play a role in the response to R-loop accumulation.</p><p>Therefore, to address the reviewer's request for a more in-depth exploration of the role of FANCD2 in the regulation of R-loops, we chose to examine the impact of FANCD2 loss on the accumulation of R-loops in WRNIP1-deficient and WRNIP1 UBZ mutant cells, as well as on the dynamics of stalled forks following aphidicolin-induced MRS. Additionally, we investigated the colocalization between FANCD2 and R-loops in shWRNIP1WT, shWRNIP1 and shWRNIP1D37A cells. Details are provided below.</p><p>In agreement with our observations, the analysis of R-loop formation upon MRS, in WRNIP1deficient cells depleted of FANCD2, revealed a significantly higher accumulation of R-loops in cells with a concomitant loss of both WRNIP1 and FANCD2 compared to those with a single deficiency (see Fig. 6D of the revised manuscript). Similar results were observed in the WRNIP1 UBZ mutant cells in which FANCD2 was abrogated (see Fig. 6D of the revised manuscript). It is important to note that, to eliminate contaminant-free RNA, particularly dsRNA, which could interfere with the binding of RNA-DNA hybrids by the S9.6 antibody (Hartono et al., 2018), and to determine the proximity between FANCD2 and R-loops more accurately, cells were treated with RNase III, following established protocols (Crossley et al., 2020).</p><p>Furthermore, we examined the interaction of FANCD2 with R-loops using a proximity ligation assay (PLA). Our findings revealed significant colocalization between FANCD2 and R-loops in the absence of WRNIP1 and in WRNIP1 UBZ mutant cells following low-dose aphidicolin treatment and RNase III exposure, showing a significant increase compared to the control counterpart (shWRNIP1WT cells; see Fig. 6B of the revised manuscript). Consequently, we conclude that neither WRNIP1 nor its UBZ domain is necessary for FANCD2 recruitment under conditions of MRS.</p><p>We also performed a DNA fiber assay to evaluate restarting replication forks in shWRNIP1WT, shWRNIP1 and shWRNIP1D37A cells in which FANCD2 was abrogated. Our results show that FANCD2 depletion slightly decreased the ability of the cells to restart forks from MRS (see Fig. 6E of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given a low number (2-4) of PLA foci for WRNIP1-RNA polymerase II or WRNIP1 and R-loop (Figure 4B and 4D), how does this colocalization reflect the functional significance?</p></disp-quote><p>The data from the PLA of Figures 4B and 4D are reported as the mean of three independent experiments. It is important to note that we have introduced a new Figure 4D. To selectively assess R-loop structures, cells were treated with RNase III, a double-stranded RNA-specific endoribonuclease, following established protocols (Crossley et al., 2020). Our PLA analysis confirms the localization of WRNIP1 at/near R-loops in shWRNIP1 and shWRNIP1D37A cells, and this phenomenon is more evident in WRNIP1 UBZ mutant cells (see Fig. 4D of the revised manuscript). Specifically, the new protocol allows us to visualize a higher number of PLA foci, and we observed that Aph increased the spots per nucleus in shWRNIP1D37A cells compared to the previous experiment.</p><p>Regarding the Fig. 4B, it is not uncommon for a low number of PLA spots per nucleus to correspond to a phenotypic effect. For instance, a similar low average in the colocalization of PCNA or RNA pol II with FANCD2 has been observed in a prior paper as well, suggesting that transcription-replication collisions occur upon Aph-induced MRS (Okamoto et al., 2019). Also, not all R-loops could be “targeted” by WRNIP1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful to readers if the authors were to provide a summary figure of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have developed a model to summarize the findings obtained in our study (see Fig. 6F of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) Most of the cytological images in the paper show only colocalized ones, which makes it hard to see a signal.

We treated the samples with RNase H to degrade RNA-DNA hybrids and hybridized the membrane with an anti-dsDNA to quantify R-loop levels more accurately.

Consequently, the observed increase in TRCs upon RNase H1 overexpression in wild-type cells may be attributed to the disruption of proteins that, by impairing the repair process, can potentially cause more fork stalling and, consequently, more conflicts. We have introduced a comment in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>This paper aims at establishing the role of WRN-interacting protein 1 (WRNIP1) and its UBZ domain (an N-terminal ubiquitin-binding zinc finger domain) on genome instability caused by mild inhibition of DNA synthesis by aphidicolin. The authors used human MRC5 fibroblasts investigated with standard methods in the field. The results clearly showed that WRNIP1 silencing and UBZ-mutation (D37A) increased DNA damage, chromosome aberrations, and transcription-replication conflicts caused by aphidicolin. The conclusions of the paper are overall well supported by results, however, aspects of some data analyses would need to be clarified and/or extended.</p><p>(1) The methods (immunofluorescence microscopy and dot-blots) to determine R-loop levels can lack sensitivity and specificity. In particular, since the S9.6 antibody can bind to other structures besides heteroduplex, dot-blot analyses only grossly assess R-loop levels in cellular samples of purified nucleic acids, which are constituted by many different types of DNA/RNA structures.</p></disp-quote><p>To eliminate contaminant-free RNA, particularly dsRNA, which could interfere with the capture of RNA-DNA hybrids by the S9.6 antibody (Hartono et al., 2018), and to determine R-loop levels more accurately, we treated cells with RNase III, following established protocols (Crossley et al., 2020). Under our experimental conditions, RNase III treatment significantly reduced the amount of dsRNA, nearly eliminating it, as evaluated using a specific antibody against dsRNA (see Suppl Fig 2 of the revised manuscript). To better appreciate the effect of the loss of WRNIP1 or its UBZ domain on Rloop accumulation and the amount of DNA damage, we have reproduced key data (see Figs 2B; 3B; 4D and E; 6B of the revised manuscript). Our analysis from immunofluorescence experiments, performed using a dsRNA ribonuclease (RNase III), confirms higher R-loop accumulation in WRNIP1-deficient or WRNIP1 UBZ mutant cells compared to control cells (Fig 3B). Additionally, proximity ligation assay (PLA) data are consistent with those previously presented and, in some cases, are more readily interpretable (see Figs 4D and E; 6B of the revised manuscript). Finally, we performed a new dot-blot experiment (see Fig. 2B of the revised manuscript). We treated with RNase H to degrade RNA-DNA hybrids and hybridized the membrane with an anti-dsDNA antibody to quantify R-loop levels more accurately. Our analysis confirms a significant accumulation of the S9.6 signal in shWRNIP1 cells compared to shWRNIP1WT cells. Additionally, a graph illustrating the foldchange values of the S9.6/dsDNA signal relative to wild-type untreated cells is provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Experimental plan has analyzed the impact of WRNIP1 lack or mutations at steady-state conditions. Thus, the possible role of WRNIP1 at an early step of the mechanism would require some sort of kinetics analysis of the molecular process, therefore not at steady-state conditions. The findings of a co-localization of R-loops and WRNIP1 have been obtained with the S9.6 antibody, which recognizes DNA-RNA heteroduplexes. Since WRNIP1 is known to be recruited at stalled forks and DNA cleavage sites, it is not surprising that WRNIP1 is very close to heteroduplexes, abundant structures at replication forks and cleavage sites. Similar interpretations may also be valid for Rad51/S9.6 co-localization findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Investigating the potential role of WRNIP1 at an early step in the mechanism is undoubtedly very interesting and requires separate investigation. Our decision to explore the relevance of the loss of WRNIP1 or WRNIP1 mutations under steady-state conditions is based on a preliminary alkaline comet assay (provided below). The comet assay, performed at various exposure times of aphidicolin at a concentration of 0.4 micromolar, clearly indicates that the most significant effect on DNA damage accumulation in WRNIP1-deficient cells occurs after 24 hours of treatment. Therefore, we have chosen to study the transcription-associated genomic instability in our cells by treating them with a low-dose of aphidicolin for 24 hours to maximize the effect.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89981-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We agree that the presence of WRNIP1 or RAD51 in proximity to R-loops is consistent with their roles and may not be surprising. However, these experiments formally demonstrate their proximity to R-loops under our conditions. Notably, the new graphs, obtained from experiments repeated by treating with RNase III to reduce the amount of dsRNA and improve the specificity of the S9.6 antibody, show increased interaction of the mutated form of WRNIP1 in the UBZ domain with Rloops when compared to the wild-type form.

That leaves open the interpretation of specific results.</p></disp-quote><p>To better evaluate the significance of the data presented in the study, we have introduced the foldchange values calculated with respect to the untreated samples, as requested by the reviewer.

This result is consistent with the findings from the comet assay, confirming transcription-dependent DNA accumulation in shWRNIP1 and shWRNIP1D37A cells. Regarding the 53BP1 marker, we believe that the existing data sufficiently demonstrate DNA damage accumulation in the absence of WRNIP1 or when its UBZ domain is mutated, providing comprehensive support to the study without necessitating additional results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Repair foci may also be detected with Rad51 foci.

We treated the samples with RNase H to degrade RNA-DNA hybrids and hybridized the membrane with an anti-dsDNA antibody to quantify R-loop levels more accurately.

This is a key control for (i) the use of only a single shRNA (most studies will use at least 2 different shRNAs) and (ii) the use of the mutant WRNIP1 lines. In several figures, the authors only show the effect of the UBZ mutant, but don't include the ATPase mutant or WT for comparison.

Another result is seen in Figure 4a, where the number of PLA spots (presumably TRCs) increases in the shWRNIP1WT cells with Aph+RNH1 compared to Aph alone. If R-loops are required for TRC accumulation, then the RNH1 should decrease the PLA foci.
