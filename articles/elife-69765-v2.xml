gonadotropin-releasing hormone release through the secretion of kisspeptin. Kiss1 neurons serve as a nodal center that conveys essential regulatory cues for the attainment and maintenance of reproductive function. Despite this critical role, the mechanisms that control kisspeptin synthesis and release remain largely unknown. Using Drop-Seq data from the arcuate nucleus of adult mice and in situ hybridization, we identified Nescient Helix-Loop-Helix 2 (<italic>Nhlh2</italic>), a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix family, to be enriched in Kiss1 neurons. JASPAR analysis revealed several binding sites for NHLH2 in the <italic>Kiss1</italic> and <italic>Tac2</italic> (neurokinin B) 5′ regulatory regions. In vitro luciferase assays evidenced a robust stimulatory action of NHLH2 on human <italic>KISS1</italic> and <italic>TAC3</italic> promoters. The recruitment of NHLH2 to the <italic>KISS1</italic> and <italic>TAC3</italic> promoters was further confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation. In vivo conditional ablation of <italic>Nhlh2</italic> from Kiss1 neurons using <italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>:<italic>Nhlh2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice induced a male-specific delay in puberty onset, in line with a decrease in arcuate <italic>Kiss1</italic> expression. Females retained normal reproductive function albeit with irregular estrous cycles. Further analysis of male <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice revealed higher susceptibility to metabolic challenges in the release of luteinizing hormone and impaired response to leptin. Overall, in Kiss1 neurons, Nhlh2 contributes to the metabolic regulation of kisspeptin and NKB synthesis and release, with implications for the timing of puberty onset and regulation of fertility in male mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kisspeptin</kwd><kwd>Nhlh2</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>puberty</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD090151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro</surname><given-names>Víctor M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD099084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro</surname><given-names>Víctor M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21HD095383</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro</surname><given-names>Víctor M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32HD097963</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCarthy</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD084542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomniczi</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37HD019938</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaiser</surname><given-names>Ursula B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD082314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaiser</surname><given-names>Ursula B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcription factor Nhlh2 is a marker of arcuate Kiss1 neurons in adulthood that activates the promotor activity of Kiss1 and Tac3 genes and controls puberty onset and the response of KNDy neurons to leptin in male mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypothalamic Kiss1 neurons secrete kisspeptins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pinilla et al., 2012</xref>), which act directly on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Irwig et al., 2004</xref>) to stimulate GnRH release. GnRH then induces gonadotropin release from pituitary gonadotropes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herbison, 2006</xref>). The absence of proper kisspeptin signaling leads to absent or delayed puberty, hypogonadism, and infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Roux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seminara et al., 2003</xref>). Kiss1 neurons are mainly found in two distinct hypothalamic nuclei, the arcuate nucleus (ARH) and the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV/PeN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pinilla et al., 2012</xref>). Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons mediate the pulsatile release of GnRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wakabayashi et al., 2010</xref>), while Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> are almost exclusive to the female brain and control the surge-like release of GnRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caraty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sébert et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Pulsatile GnRH release increases at the end of the juvenile period, determining the onset of puberty and the transition into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ojeda et al., 2010</xref>). This process is largely dependent on the activation of Kiss1 neurons, in part, through the autosynaptic excitatory action of neurokinin B (NKB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Navarro et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruiz-Pino et al., 2012</xref>) and the inhibitory action of dynorphin through an autosynaptic alternation process that creates the <italic>kisspeptin pulse generator</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Plant, 2019</xref>). However, the mechanisms that determine the initiation of the cascade of events that lead to activation of the kisspeptin pulse generator at the time of puberty onset, remain largely unknown.</p><p>Energy balance is a critical component in the control of puberty onset and maintenance of reproductive function in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Navarro, 2020</xref>). Deficient energy reserves are often associated with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laughlin et al., 1998</xref>). A number of central and peripheral factors mediate the inhibition of the reproductive axis in conditions of negative energy balance. For example, the hunger signals agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y, produced in hypothalamic AgRP neurons, directly inhibit Kiss1 neurons under energetic deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Padilla et al., 2017</xref>). AgRP neurons, as well as Kiss1 neurons themselves, express the leptin receptor (Lepr) and are therefore direct targets of leptin, which is produced in the adipose tissue as a direct measure of the level of fat reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backholer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cravo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">True et al., 2011</xref>). Deficient leptin signaling, as occurs in <italic>ob/ob</italic> or <italic>db/db</italic> mice, leads to obesity and infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donato et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leshan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Navarro and Kaiser, 2013</xref>). However, the central pathways that mediate the metabolic and reproductive roles of leptin remain largely unknown. Evidence from our lab and others indicate that the main control of both functions by leptin requires GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zuure et al., 2013</xref>), while the deletion of Lepr from glutamatergic neurons leads to a subtle metabolic and reproductive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vong et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, Kiss1 neurons of the ARH are mostly glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>) and the deletion of <italic>Lepr</italic> from Kiss1 neurons does not prevent fertility in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cravo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donato et al., 2011a</xref>). These data suggest that leptin plays its primary reproductive role upstream of Kiss1 neurons and that the expression of Lepr in these neurons is limited to a modulatory role, likely in the acute regulation of kisspeptin release under specific metabolic conditions.</p><p>In addition to leptin, other peripheral factors that signal energetic state can directly act on Kiss1 neurons as well, such as insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qiu et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that Kiss1 neurons are a nodal target for metabolic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Navarro, 2020</xref>). Thus, the combined action of the metabolic signals that inform the brain of sufficient fuel reserves ultimately control the expression of the genes critical for kisspeptin release, that is, <italic>Tac2</italic> and <italic>Pdyn</italic> (which encode NKB and dynorphin A, respectively), and therefore the pulsatile release of kisspeptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Plant, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro, 2012b</xref>). Conditions of negative energy balance rapidly and potently inhibit the reproductive axis, preventing or delaying puberty onset and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Navarro, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castellano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luque et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roa et al., 2008</xref>). Upon restoration of energy reserves, kisspeptin pulses resume and the reproductive axis becomes reactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Navarro, 2020</xref>). Still, despite the significant burden that metabolic imbalances impose on Kiss1 neurons, the intracellular mechanisms, for example, transcription factors (TFs), that translate this metabolic information have not yet been fully characterized. In vitro studies in cancer cell lines have identified SP-1 and AP-2α as activators of the <italic>Kiss1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>), while in vivo only TTF1 and CUX1-p200 in the human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mueller et al., 2011</xref>), and Tbx3 and Crtc1 in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sanz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altarejos et al., 2008</xref>), have been identified as potential enhancers of <italic>Kiss1</italic> transcription despite the large number of potential TF binding sites that have been described in the <italic>Kiss1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goto et al., 2015</xref>). Of these TFs, only Crtc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altarejos et al., 2008</xref>) has been involved in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Kiss1</italic> by metabolic cues, which suggests that most of the regulatory mechanisms at the <italic>Kiss1</italic> promoter level remain unknown.</p><p>In this study, through a series of in vitro and in vivo genetic and functional studies in male and female mice we identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones, 2004</xref>), Nhlh2, as a highly specific TF of Kiss1 neurons of the adult mouse brain that controls puberty onset in males, but not females, and conveys the information of the metabolic state to the reproductive axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nhlh2 is enriched in Kiss1 neurons of adult mice</title><p>Using a previously described database of ARH transcripts from 20,921 cells from adult wild-type (WT) male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>), we identified the bHLH TF <italic>Nhlh2</italic>, as a highly enriched transcript in arcuate Kiss1 neurons.

Nhlh2 is highly expressed in Kiss1 neurons from the time of their initial development during the embryonic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huisman et al., 2019</xref>), and our data indicate that this co-expression is retained into adulthood. Moreover, we demonstrate that Nhlh2 potently enhances the activity of <italic>KISS1</italic> and <italic>TAC3</italic> promoters, suggesting a potential role in the central activation of the reproductive axis by controlling kisspeptin output.</p><p>Nhlh2 has been shown to be involved in the development of the brain, including GnRH and POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cogliati et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vella et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Good et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krüger et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Nhlh2</italic> KO male mice are infertile, presenting small penises at weaning, cryptorchidism, and no signs of puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Good et al., 1997</xref>). In the same vein, <italic>Nhlh2</italic> KO females are hypogonadal, displaying small ovaries, thread-like uteri, delayed puberty onset (first estrus), and irregular cycles when reared alone, but they are fertile when reared in the presence of males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cogliati et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Good et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, while Nhlh2 has been implicated in the migratory process of a fraction of GnRH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cogliati et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Nhlh2</italic> KO mice still show large amounts of GnRH neurons in the preoptic area (well above the 12% of GnRH neurons that is required for normal reproductive function; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herbison et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, specific ablation of <italic>Nhlh2</italic> from GnRH neurons using <italic>Gnrh1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>:<italic>Nhlh2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice displayed normal reproductive function despite a 20% reduction in the number of GnRH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, GnRH neurons do not express <italic>Nhlh2</italic> beyond embryonic day 18.5E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cogliati et al., 2007</xref>), supporting a likely role in the development (migration) of a small fraction of GnRH neurons but not in their function during adulthood. These data, along with the absence of <italic>Nhlh2</italic> in most of the adult mouse brain, with the exception of the ARH, and within this nucleus, mostly in Kiss1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cogliati et al., 2007</xref>; and <italic>present data</italic>), suggests a likely developmental and functional role of Nhlh2 in Kiss1 neurons that may contribute to the hypogonadal phenotype observed in <italic>Nhlh2</italic> KO mice. The developmental restriction of the expression of Nhlh2 in the hypothalamus is further evidenced by the decline in expression in the ARH from the infantile to prepubertal age, likely as a consequence of the regulation of circulating sex steroid levels on Nhlh2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Good and Braun, 2013</xref>). It is plausible that Nhlh2 be a part of the machinery that regulates KNDy neurons during the negative feedback of sex steroids, although this hypothesis remains to be investigated.</p><p>In line with the data observed in whole-body <italic>Nhlh2</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice showed a sexual dimorphism in their reproductive phenotype, which was more severe in males than in females. Males presented delayed puberty onset and different degrees of subfertility. This indicates that the role of Nhlh2 within Kiss1 neurons might be frequently compensated by other, yet unknown, TFs that lead to the gaining of reproductive function in females and in the majority of males. It has been demonstrated that 5% of kisspeptin production is sufficient to maintain reproductive capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Popa et al., 2013</xref>), which may explain the overall fertile phenotype of <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice despite the reduction in <italic>Kiss1</italic> expression observed in <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> females displayed normal timing of puberty onset and fertility although their estrous cycles were disrupted under normal chow diet, resembling the phenotype of whole-body <italic>Nhlh2</italic> KO females reared with males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Good et al., 1997</xref>). Of note, females in our study were reared with their male counterparts until weaning, which may have contributed to their normal reproductive phenotype as suggested in these earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Good et al., 1997</xref>). Whether <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> females present reduced reproductive longevity, as also documented for whole-body <italic>Nhlh2</italic> KO females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>), was not assessed in this study.</p><p>The origin of the sexual dimorphism in the impact of Nhlh2 action in Kiss1 neurons is unclear. All mice respond normally to the stimulation of Kiss1 neurons after a senktide challenge and the post-gonadectomy raise of LH is preserved, indicating sufficient output of kisspeptin to elicit full gonadotropin responses under normal fed ad libitum conditions. However, the hypothalamic Kiss1 system is sexually differentiated, and the population of Kiss1 neurons in the preoptic area (Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>), which is virtually absent in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 2005</xref>), minimally expresses Nhlh2 in females. Thus, the maintenance of an intact population of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons in females may account for the preservation of the timing of puberty onset and fertility—as further evidenced by their ability to mount a normal preovulatory LH surge.</p><p>Previous studies have also described metabolic impairments (obesity) in <italic>Nhlh2</italic> KO mice due to the decrease in the number of POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vella et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the percentage of co-expression of <italic>Pomc</italic> and <italic>Nhlh2</italic> in adulthood is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vella et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Good et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting that this metabolic phenotype may be a developmental process that leads to the loss of POMC neurons rather than an effect during adulthood. The removal of Nhlh2 from Kiss1 neurons did not induce any metabolic phenotype in <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice under regular or HFD chow, which supports a role for Nhlh2 in POMC neurons in the obesity phenotype of whole-body KOs. Interestingly, Kiss1 neurons have been implicated in the control of energy balance and BW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tolson et al., 2014</xref>). However, the present data suggest that Nhlh2 is not involved in any potential metabolic role of Kiss1 neurons.</p><p>Nhlh2 interacts with STAT3 in the downstream mechanism of leptin’s action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AL_Rayyan et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that if Nhlh2 mediates the action of leptin to control the expression of <italic>Kiss1</italic> (and <italic>Tac2</italic>) directly in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice would be more sensitive than controls to decrease circulating leptin levels, which occurs quickly during a fasting paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luque et al., 2007</xref>). This was indeed the case during a 24 hr fasting protocol in mice with high circulating LH levels (gonadectomized) and suggests that Nhlh2 is part of the intracellular machinery of Kiss1 neurons that serves as a rapid sensor of circulating metabolites—at least for leptin. Refeeding increased circulating LH levels in both mouse groups, that is, controls and <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, equally within 6 hr. This increase in LH release depends on the increase in kisspeptin and GnRH release in <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, and therefore highlights the multi-level action of metabolic factors acting on different hypothalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lowell, 2019</xref>), which eventually activate Kiss1 neurons quickly after the restoration of energetic resources. The exogenous administration of leptin after overnight fasting, without the influence of other metabolic cues, for example, insulin, uncovered an impaired response in LH release of <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice to leptin. This finding supports the potential direct action of leptin on Kiss1 neurons and, therefore, the likely participation of Nhlh2 in the second messenger cascade of Lepr to activate kisspeptin (and potentially NKB) expression and release.</p><p>These data further contribute to the elucidation of the complex network of leptin action to control reproductive function and uncovers a potential effect of leptin directly on Kiss1 neurons for the fast adaptation to changing energy levels. Nonetheless, the main regulatory centers of leptin action must lie upstream of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons because, as mentioned previously, the removal of Lepr from Kiss1 neurons does not lead to an evident reproductive phenotype in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cravo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donato et al., 2011a</xref>)—although specific metabolic challenges have not been performed in mice lacking Lepr from Kiss1 neurons. Moreover, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are largely glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nestor et al., 2016</xref>) while the main action of leptin to regulate reproduction (and metabolism) occurs through GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zuure et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the reproductive phenotype observed in male <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice suggests that in addition to the action of leptin, Nhlh2 must relay additional information from other unknown factor/s that add a strong regulatory component in the activation of <italic>Kiss1</italic> and <italic>Tac2</italic> genes in males.</p><p>Overall, this study identified a TF (Nhlh2) that highly marks KNDy neurons in the adult mouse brain with strong enhancement capability of the <italic>KISS1</italic> and <italic>TAC3</italic> promoter activity. The action of Nhlh2 appears to partially explain the reproductive (but not metabolic) phenotype observed in whole-body Nhlh2 KO mice and constitutes a novel metabolic pathway for the central regulation of reproductive function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Kiss1-Nhlh2</italic> conditional knockout mice were generated by crossing <italic>Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and Kiss1<sup>Cre:GFP</sup> knock-in mice. <italic>Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5524018">MGI:5524018</ext-link>) were obtained from Dr. Thomas Braun (Max Planck Institute, Germany) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>) and Kiss1<sup>Cre:GFP</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:6278139">MGI:6278139</ext-link>) were obtained from Dr. Richard Palmiter (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Padilla et al., 2018</xref>).

The hypothalamus was dissected taking as limits the posterior margin of the optic chiasm (rostrally) and the anterior margin of the mammillary bodies (caudally), with a dissection depth of approximately 2 mm. Each hypothalamic sample was dissected and divided into two, the suprachiasmatic region (the preoptic area, POA) or the MBH, and fragments were stored at −80°C until further processing. Total RNA from the MBH was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by chloroform/isopropanol extraction. RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1 μm of RNA was reverse transcribed using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system and analyzed using ABI Prism 7000 SDS software (Applied Biosystems). The cycling conditions were the following: 2 min incubation at 95°C (hot start), 45 amplification cycles (95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 45 s at 75°C, with fluorescence detection at the end of each cycle), followed by a melting curve of the amplified products obtained by a ramped increase in temperature from 55°C to 95°C to confirm the presence of a single amplification product per reaction.

Using a previously published dataset on gene expression in the arcuate nucleus, the authors identified the transcription factor Nhlh2 as a potential candidate for mediating the metabolic effects on reproduction. The authors find that Nhlh2 expression decreases prior to puberty, at least in females, and is co-expressed in ~72% of arcuate kisspeptin cells in adult males. A transgenic mouse was created to knockout Nhlh2 in kisspeptin cells (Kiss1Nhlh2 mice) and reproductive and metabolic outcomes were assessed. Puberty onset was delayed in male, but not female, Kiss1Nhlh2 mice. Adult female Kiss1Nhlh2 mice had longer estrous cycles, but were otherwise fertile. Adult male Kiss1Nhlh2 mice had a varying degree of fertility deficits, as well as a 50% reduction in Kiss1 and 25% reduction in Tacr3 expression in the arcuate. The administration of Kp-10 or senktide, a Tacr3 agonist, produced normal responses in LH release, indicating there are no deficits downstream of ARC kisspeptin neurons in Kiss1Nhlh2 mice. Lastly, male Kiss1Nhlh2 mice had a more severe decrease in LH levels in response to metabolic fasting, but Kiss1Nhlh2 mice and control had a comparable increase in LH following feeding. Leptin treatment resulted in an increase in LH in control and Kiss1Nhlh2 mice, but to a lesser extent in Kiss1Nhlh2 mice. These data indicate that in males, Nhlh2 may play a role in puberty onset and fertility, as well as a role in mediating the effects of leptin on arcuate kisspeptin neurons.</p><p>Strengths: Nhlh2 is identified as a novel candidate regulating kisspeptin neurons and Kiss1 expression. The role of Nhlh2 in kisspeptin cells on both puberty onset and adult fertility were examined in both sexes, with metabolism effects studied in males. The differential effects of Nhlh2 deletion in kisspeptin cells suggest that Nhlh2 is a novel prime candidate in understanding how the regulation of reproduction and metabolism differ between male and females.</p><p>Weaknesses: The normal expression levels of Nhlh2 prior to puberty and in adulthood are only presented in one sex, prepubertal females and adult males. Thus, it is difficult to understand how the loss of Nhlh2 in Kiss1 cells at a certain age might impact the outcomes. It also makes it difficult to fully interpret the sex differences in reproductive outcomes. In addition, it is unclear if Nhlh2 is expressed in other parts of the body where Kiss1 is also expressed, such as the gonads, and thus, the deletion of Nhlh2 may not be specific to Kiss1 cells in the arcuate nucleus.</p><p>The manuscript by Leon et al., examines the role of Nhlh2 in Kiss1 cells in puberty onset, fertility, and metabolic regulation. The data show that a knockdown of Nhlh2 in Kiss1 cells altered male puberty and fertility (in some males), while females had fewer, less severe deficits. Nhlh2 in Kiss1 cells does not appear to play a role in metabolic regulation of Kiss1 cells in males. The manuscript is well written, the experiments are interesting, and the results indicate a new candidate for moderating male puberty onset. The results and the conclusions could be strengthened by providing expression data for both males and females prepubertally and in adulthood. Here are a few comments for the authors to consider:</p><p>1. Figure 1 demonstrates the co-expression of Kiss1 and Nhlh2 in males, but were similar studies performed in females? Is it possible the less severe effects in female Kiss1/Nhlh2 KOs are due to less co-expression of Nhlh2 and Kiss1 in the ARC of females? Knowing the degree of co-expression in both sexes would be important to understanding and interpreting any effects in females and the potential sex differences found.</p><p>2. Is Nhlh2 present in ARC Kiss1 neurons prior to puberty in males? Figure 3 provides this data for females, but not males. It would be helpful to also see this qPCR data in males to understand how Nhlh2 levels prior to development (and any sex differences) relate to the puberty and fertility data and the sex differences in the effects.</p><p>3. The authors suggest there is a possible downregulation of Nhlh2 expression due to sex steroid levels in prepubertal mice (Figure 3 female qPCR data). Is it known if Nhlh2 expression is regulated by sex steroids in prepubertal, pubertal, and/or adult mice? Considering that Kiss1 expression in the hypothalamus is regulated by sex steroids, at least in part, is it likely Nhlh2 is also regulated by sex steroids? A brief discussion on these points and how they relate to the current data would be beneficial to the reader.</p><p>4. Is Nhlh2 co-expressed in other parts of the body that also express Kiss1, like the testes or ovaries? Data from humans indicates there is minimal expression of Nhlh2 in the testes. Is this similar in mice and how might that impact the data and the sex differences found? It would be helpful to address if the knockout was specific to ARC Kiss1 cells.</p><p>5. Males showed an approximately 50% reduction in Kiss1 expression in the ARC (Figure 6). How does the degree of reduction in Kiss1 expression vary between males and does that relate to the somewhat bimodal fertility phenotype in males? It is unclear if this reduction is Kiss1 is potentially a cause of male fertility issues in some males or if all males have this reduction and thus, the fertility deficits are likely due to something else.</p><p>6. There seem to be a few cases where one data point appears to be driving an effect (e.g. fertility data and Figure 7E). Is there any concern that one individual is driving significant effects here or have the authors considered a nonparametric test here?</p><p>7. Relatedly, the statistical analysis section states all data are presented as means and range/SEM, but there are violin plots presenting the median. A description of these plots should be added to the analysis section.</p><p>8. Line 137-142: refers to figure 3, but it seems it should be Figure 2.</p><p>9. In Figure 5, the figure legends state that (B) is the number of litters in 3 months and (C) is total number of pups, but that is reversed in the actual Figure.</p><p>10. In Figure 5 legend, it states groups with different letters are significantly different, but there are no letters in this Figure, presumably because there are no statistical differences. Can the authors please clarify?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Based on previous evidence that Nhlh2-/- mice present disrupted pubertal transition and fertility, and that Nhlh2 expression is enriched in the arcuate hypothalamus, this study evaluates whether Nhlh2 action within kisspeptin neurons of the reproductive axis are responsible for the phenotype. The authors demonstrate the NHLH2 can influence of expression of both Kiss1 and Tac2/3. Conditional removal of Nhlh2 from Kiss1-expressing cells did not phenocopy the global knockout, but did induce delayed puberty, in males. Furthermore, the authors show that Kiss1 Nhlh2 KO mice are more sensitive to metabolic gating of LH, compared to controls. However, because Kiss1 is also expressed in the gonads, it is unclear if the reported phenotypes are central, as argued by the authors. The manuscript lacks detail of the functional and molecular phenotype of the gonads in either males or females, which is important to substantiate the claims.</p><p>In figure 3 the authors &quot;hypothesize that the overall expression of Nhlh2 throughout development would decrease prior to puberty onset as it becomes restricted to Kiss1 neurons.&quot; I believe to test this hypothesis you would need to do the anatomy to see if Nhlh2 transcript is more broadly expressed early and then becomes restricted. Instead, the authors only assess Nhlh2 expression from a punch of ARH tissue. Based on this evidence alone, it is possible that the gene is downregulated over postnatal development, as opposed to more &quot;restricted.&quot;</p><p>Figure 4: Kiss1 is also expressed in the periphery, and in particular in the gonadal organs. Does NHLH2 regulate Kiss1 expression in the testes or ovaries?</p><p>Figures4 and 5. Males show delayed puberty and mover variable fertility. Were the gonads and T assessed? This seems important to the story and should be compared to the global KO.</p><p>Figure 6. It seems important to also include females here. Is female gene expression profile similar to males? Was the data in Figure 2 specific to males?</p><p>Figure 7. The data here seem to support that the observed phenotype may not be central.</p><p>Fig7d. The KOs are more sensitive to metabolic gating. Was this expected, why? The finding seems inconsistent with the gene expression profile presented in Figure 2.</p><p>Figure 1B, middle panel: is this just the red channel alone? The staining looks yellow in the densest areas, as if green is present in the image. Can you comment on this? Also, based on the expression profile in A (from Campbell et al.,), wouldn't you expect to see Nhlh2 expression in POMC neurons. In B, a region of the ARH that should also contain POMC neurons, Nhlh2 expression appears exclusive to Kiss1 neurons. Also, how was the 71% co-expression determined, is the data not shown? Aside from the ISH stain, the rest of this figure has been previously published. If you exclude part B, the figure should be reported as supplementary info.</p><p>Lines 137-142: I believe this should reference Figure 2, not Figure 3.</p><p>Figure 7e.

A brief discussion on these points and how they relate to the current data would be beneficial to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up the possible regulation of Nhlh2 by sex steroids. Unfortunately, we do not have direct evidence of Nhlh2 expression comparing GDX vs GDX+T/E2 mice. Nonetheless, we concur that it is likely that Nhlh2 is regulated by sex steroids as part of the machinery that regulates KNDy neurons during the negative feedback of sex steroids. This has been added to the discussion (lines 265-267).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Is Nhlh2 co-expressed in other parts of the body that also express Kiss1, like the testes or ovaries? Data from humans indicates there is minimal expression of Nhlh2 in the testes. Is this similar in mice and how might that impact the data and the sex differences found? It would be helpful to address if the knockout was specific to ARC Kiss1 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this very important concern. New analysis of Nhlh2 expression in the gonads of male and female Kiss1-Nhlh2KO and controls clearly show no difference in Nhlh2 transcript (new supplemental figure 2), which supports the central effect described in the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Males showed an approximately 50% reduction in Kiss1 expression in the ARC (Figure 6). How does the degree of reduction in Kiss1 expression vary between males and does that relate to the somewhat bimodal fertility phenotype in males? It is unclear if this reduction is Kiss1 is potentially a cause of male fertility issues in some males or if all males have this reduction and thus, the fertility deficits are likely due to something else.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer’s rationale is a possibility. However, the fertility was performed on different males of which we unfortunately could not collect brains from, thus a direct comparison of fertility and Kiss1 expression cannot be made in these specific experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. There seem to be a few cases where one data point appears to be driving an effect (e.g. fertility data and Figure 7E). Is there any concern that one individual is driving significant effects here or have the authors considered a nonparametric test here?</p></disp-quote><p>These data follow a Gaussian distribution and, therefore, we believe they must be assessed using ANOVA. However, to assess whether a single value in figure 7 was driving the significance, we removed it and performed the same statistics. We still obtained a significant difference. Because we do not have any reason to consider that value as an outlier (it is within 2 SD from the mean), we kept it in the figure as it was.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Relatedly, the statistical analysis section states all data are presented as means and range/SEM, but there are violin plots presenting the median. A description of these plots should be added to the analysis section.</p></disp-quote><p>This error has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 137-142: refers to figure 3, but it seems it should be Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>This error has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In Figure 5, the figure legends state that (B) is the number of litters in 3 months and (C) is total number of pups, but that is reversed in the actual Figure.</p></disp-quote><p>This error has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. In Figure 5 legend, it states groups with different letters are significantly different, but there are no letters in this Figure, presumably because there are no statistical differences. Can the authors please clarify?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, the reason for the absence of letters is because there are no statistical differences. This error has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Based on previous evidence that Nhlh2-/- mice present disrupted pubertal transition and fertility, and that Nhlh2 expression is enriched in the arcuate hypothalamus, this study evaluates whether Nhlh2 action within kisspeptin neurons of the reproductive axis are responsible for the phenotype. The authors demonstrate the NHLH2 can influence of expression of both Kiss1 and Tac2/3. Conditional removal of Nhlh2 from Kiss1-expressing cells did not phenocopy the global knockout, but did induce delayed puberty, in males. Furthermore, the authors show that Kiss1 Nhlh2 KO mice are more sensitive to metabolic gating of LH, compared to controls. However, because Kiss1 is also expressed in the gonads, it is unclear if the reported phenotypes are central, as argued by the authors. The manuscript lacks detail of the functional and molecular phenotype of the gonads in either males or females, which is important to substantiate the claims.</p><p>In figure 3 the authors &quot;hypothesize that the overall expression of Nhlh2 throughout development would decrease prior to puberty onset as it becomes restricted to Kiss1 neurons.&quot; I believe to test this hypothesis you would need to do the anatomy to see if Nhlh2 transcript is more broadly expressed early and then becomes restricted. Instead, the authors only assess Nhlh2 expression from a punch of ARH tissue. Based on this evidence alone, it is possible that the gene is downregulated over postnatal development, as opposed to more &quot;restricted.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this assessment and valid concern. We have revised the discussion of this data in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: Kiss1 is also expressed in the periphery, and in particular in the gonadal organs. Does NHLH2 regulate Kiss1 expression in the testes or ovaries?</p></disp-quote><p>New analysis of Nhlh2 expression in the gonads of male and female Kiss1-Nhlh2KO and controls clearly show no difference in Nhlh2 transcript (new supplemental figure 2), which supports the central effect described in the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 4 and 5. Males show delayed puberty and mover variable fertility. Were the gonads and T assessed? This seems important to the story and should be compared to the global KO.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we didn´t measure T levels in these animals, however, the normal basal levels of LH, and in response to kisspeptin, in addition to the normal testicular histology and mature sperm (new supplemental figure 4) support an overall normal function of the HPG axis in most adult males.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6. It seems important to also include females here. Is female gene expression profile similar to males? Was the data in Figure 2 specific to males?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this concern and, as indicated above to the other reviewers, Figures 3 and 6 have been revised to include both sexes. Thus, we have found that both sexes show the same expression profile of Nhlh2 postnatally (new figure 3) and during adulthood, Kiss1-Nhlh2KO mice of both sexes show decreased Kiss1 levels compared to controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7. The data here seem to support that the observed phenotype may not be central.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree. First the gonads of these KO mice are normal (i.e. normal signs of gametogenesis) and express the same amount of Nhlh2 as controls. Second, it has been shown that just 5% of Kiss1 expression is sufficient in males to maintain reproductive competence. Thus, it is likely that even with a &gt;50% decrease in kisspeptin expression in adulthood in KO mice, reproduction is maintained. This indicates that puberty onset, which is delayed in KO males, might be more sensitive to metabolic cues and the action of Nhlh2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig7d. The KOs are more sensitive to metabolic gating. Was this expected, why? The finding seems inconsistent with the gene expression profile presented in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>It is expected that in the absence of a factor that relays the stimulatory action of a metabolic factor, e.g. leptin, in its absence, the expression of Kiss1 and Tac3 be decreased faster as stimulatory factors such as leptin decrease. This is the same reason why mice respond with a diminished LH release after exogenous leptin treatment (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1B, middle panel: is this just the red channel alone? The staining looks yellow in the densest areas, as if green is present in the image. Can you comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>The quality of the images has been improved to prevent that areas of high intensity staining appeared yellow before merging them due to saturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, based on the expression profile in A (from Campbell et al.), wouldn't you expect to see Nhlh2 expression in POMC neurons. In B, a region of the ARH that should also contain POMC neurons, Nhlh2 expression appears exclusive to Kiss1 neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent observation and as the reviewer can appreciate in the tSNE plot, the expression of Nhlh2 in POMC neurons is less than that in Kiss1 neurons. Therefore, it is likely that the amount of Nhlh2 transcript in POMC neurons is not sufficient to be detected in all of the animals. However, in supplemental figure 2A, where we show the validation of the Kiss1-Nhlh2KO model, non Kiss1 neurons that express Nhlh2 are detected, which are likely POMC neurons based on their location.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, how was the 71% co-expression determined, is the data not shown?</p></disp-quote><p>This description has been expanded in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Aside from the ISH stain, the rest of this figure has been previously published. If you exclude part B, the figure should be reported as supplementary info.</p></disp-quote><p>The tSNE plot analysis of was assessed specifically for Nhlh2, which was not included in the original manuscript (Campbell et al). However, because the raw data used was indeed previously published, we have moved that figure to the supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 137-142: I believe this should reference Figure 2, not Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>This error has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7e. Are basal levels, fasted?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, basal LH levels were collected after overnight fasting as indicated in the methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
