Sampling was initiated with 10 indexes who recruited named injection partners (people who they injected with in the prior month).

These networks are particularly relevant to combat epidemics among populations that are hard to reach with public health interventions. Network-based approaches, for example, can help to stop HIV or hepatitis C from spreading amongst populations that use injectable drugs. Yet how social and geographic connections such as acquaintances, injection partners, or preferred drug use places impact the risk of infection is still poorly mapped out.</p><p>To address this question, Clipman et al. focused on people who inject drugs in New Delhi, India, a population heavily impacted by HIV and hepatitis C. Over 2500 people were recruited, each participant inviting their injection partners to also take part. The volunteers answered survey questions, including where they used drugs, and provided a blood sample to be tested.</p><p>The results showed that, even after adjusting for individual risk factors, where people used drugs and with whom affected their risk of becoming infected with HIV and hepatitis C. In terms of social ties, the likelihood of HIV and hepatitis C infection decreased by about 13% for each person separating a given individual from an infected person. However, geographical networks also had a major impact. Injecting at a popular location respectively increased the odds of HIV and hepatitis C infection by 50% and 69%. In fact, even if the participant was not using drugs at these specific places, having an injection partner who did was enough to increase the risk for disease: for each person separating an individual from the location, the likelihood of being infected with HIV and hepatitis C decreased by respectively 14% and 10%.</p><p>The results by Clipman et al. highlight how the relationships between physical spaces and social networks contribute to the spread of dangerous diseases amongst people who inject drugs. Ultimately, this knowledge may help to shape better public health interventions that would take into account the importance of geographical locations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>people who inject drugs</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>hepatitis C</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd><kwd>networks</kwd><kwd>India</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA041736</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Solomon</surname><given-names>Sunil S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2DA040244</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Solomon</surname><given-names>Sunil S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA041034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mehta</surname><given-names>Shruti H</given-names></name><name><surname>Lucas</surname><given-names>Gregory M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K24DA035684</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lucas</surname><given-names>Gregory M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Beyond well-recognized individual-level risk factors, HIV and hepatitis C transmission among people who inject drugs are further impacted by social and spatial network composition, and spaces in particular may represent efficient means for disseminating interventions that diffuse through the network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>People who inject drugs (PWID) bear a disproportionate burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and account for some of the fastest-growing epidemics globally. While there has been substantial progress in combating these epidemics, HIV and HCV prevalence and incidence among PWID remain high, especially in South, Southeast and Central Asia, and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">DeHovitz et al., 2014</xref>). Individual-level factors for infection are well established, but less is known about network and spatial drivers of HIV and HCV among PWID, especially from low- and middle-income settings.</p><p>Network-based interventions for HIV and HCV are increasingly being implemented; however, they are seldom informed by empirical sociometric network data and more often informed by models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zelenev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hellard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rolls et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hellard et al., 2014</xref>).

Incorporating spatial data, specifically in the form of injection venues, can further inform whether independent sociometric injection networks overlap spatially to more comprehensively examine the distribution of HIV/HCV and assess the role of space in the diffusion of disease.</p><p>This manuscript aims to characterize egocentric, sociometric, and spatial network structures in a community-based sample of 2512 PWID in New Delhi, India and examine the role of individual- and network-level correlates of HIV and HCV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study overview</title><p>The ‘Spatial Network Study’ is an ongoing dynamic longitudinal cohort of PWID in New Delhi, India established to understand the role of networks in transmission of HIV and HCV among PWID. New Delhi, the capital city of India, is estimated to be home to ~86,000 PWID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambekar et al., 2019</xref>) with HIV prevalence ranging from 13.5% to 35.8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mehta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lucas et al., 2015</xref>) and HCV prevalence ranging from 42.4% to 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Solomon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Solomon et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Solomon et al., 2019b</xref>). With the exception of index participants, all participants were recruited via a name generator network referral methodology.

This manuscript presents baseline data from this cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Recruitment of the cohort was initiated with two indexes in November 2017—eight more indexes were included later to account for variability in type of drug injected, marital status, and zip code of residence/injection. All 10 indexes were selected from a cross-sectional sample of PWID in New Delhi accrued for an evaluation assessment of a cluster-randomized trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01686750">NCT01686750</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Solomon et al., 2019b</xref>). When a participant enrolled in the Spatial Network Study, whether the initial 10 indexes or subsequent recruits, they were asked to recall the names of people with whom they injected in the prior month (regardless of whether they shared injection paraphernalia). In addition, they were asked to provide identifying information about each named network member (e.g., scar on left hand, one finger missing on right hand) and a factoid about each named partner (e.g., ‘his wife’s name is Priyanka’). Each participant was then provided with a referral card for each named injection partner and was asked to invite them to participate in the study. When these recruits visited the study site, their name and identifying information were compared against the information previously provided. If the information matched, they were enrolled and asked to name, describe, and recruit people with whom they injected in the prior month (recruit’s egocentric network and the index’s sociometric network). Recruitment continued until the desired sample size (~2500) was reached. Biometric data (fingerprint scans) was used to identify duplicates and establish cross-network linkages (if the same participant was recruited by two different participants). The fingerprint scans were converted to unique hexadecimal codes and stored as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Solomon et al., 2019b</xref>)—no images were stored.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Study population</title><p>The eligibility criteria varied depending on if the participant was an index or a recruit. Index participants had to (1) be ≥18 years of age, (2) provide written informed consent, (3) report a history of injecting drugs for non-medicinal purposes in the prior 24 months; and (4) have consented to be recontacted from the prior cross-sectional sample in 2016. The eligibility criteria for recruits were (1) ≥18 years of age, (2) provide written informed consent, (3) recruited to participate in the study via a network referral card, (4) match description provided by their recruiter, and (5) not identified as a duplicate participant by biometric (fingerprint) match. Participants under the age of 18 were excluded since the legal age of consent in India is 18 years. There were no exclusions based on gender or sexual identity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Baseline study visits began with informed consent and referral card validation that included matching the factoid/identifying characteristic provided by the recruiter, followed by biometric registration and identification of duplicates. Participants that were identified as duplicates, that is, previously enrolled in the cohort, were not enrolled again; however, these data were used to add additional edges (injection partner connections) to the network. Participants then completed the survey and blood draw, followed by rapid HIV and HCV antibody testing on-site with appropriate pre-test counseling and referrals, as applicable. Participants were provided with referral cards to recruit each of their named injection partners into the study. Participants received INR 300 (USD 3.94) as compensation and could earn an incentive of INR 50 (USD 0. 66) per named network partner they referred who was eligible and completed study procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Data collection</title><p>At baseline, participants completed an interviewer-administered electronic survey that captured information on sociodemographics, substance use and risk behavior, sexual risk behaviors and characteristics, social support, quality of life, and access to HIV and HCV services, among others. The survey also captured detailed information about their egocentric injection network and this data was used to generate referral cards. In addition to injection network data, participants were also asked to list venues where they had injected in the prior 6 months. A list of common injection venues (latitude/longitude) was pre-populated and available on maps of Delhi to select from—participants also had the option to add a new venue if they injected at a venue that was not listed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Laboratory procedures</title><p>On-site rapid HIV antibody testing was performed in line with the current standard of care for HIV diagnosis in India using three different kits: Determine HIV-1/2 (Alere Medical, USA) (Sensitivity: 99.9%; Specificity: 99.8%), First Response HIV card test 1-2-O (Premier Medical, India) (Sensitivity: 100%; Specificity: 99.9%), and Signal HIV-1/2 (Arkray Healthcare, India) (Sensitivity: 100%; Specificity: 100%). Rapid HCV antibody testing was performed using the Aspen HCV One Step Test Device (Aspen Diagnostics, India) (Sensitivity: 99.8%; Specificity: 99.9%). All residual samples were shipped to the central lab in Chennai for RNA quantification and storage. HIV RNA was quantified in all HIV antibody-positive samples using the Abbott HIV-1 RNA Real-Time PCR (Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, IL, USA) with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 150 copies/mL. All HCV antibody-positive samples were tested for the presence of HCV RNA with the Real-Time HCV assay (Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, IL, USA) with an LLOQ of 30 IU/mL.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Statistical and computational methods</title><p>Statistical analyses were carried out in Python (v3.7.3) and R (v3.5.1).

Network distance from an infected alter was calculated such that a distance of zero signifies a direct connection, a distance of one signifies one uninfected person along the shortest path between a given participant and infected alter. Similarly, for network distance from an injection venue, a distance of zero signifies a direct connection to the venue and a distance greater than zero signifies the number of person nodes along the shortest path between a participant and venue.</p><p>Networks were visualized using Gephi (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gephi.org">https://gephi.org</ext-link>) and interactive networks were created using Sigma.js (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sigmajs.org">http://sigmajs.org</ext-link>).

These data are among the first to elucidate sociometric and spatial injection networks of PWID from a low- and middle-income country and provide critical insights into the design of HIV and HCV programming.</p><p>Empirical network data among PWID have often been limited to egocentric network data, which only capture information on individuals and direct contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Costenbader et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Latkin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Latkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Latkin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Latkin et al., 2010</xref>). These studies have shown that network instability or turnover in PWID’s injection partners promote HIV transmission. Limited sociometric data that exist come primarily from non-PWID populations in developed country settings and support the importance of understanding network connections beyond direct ties. For example, a seminal study assessing HIV and STI transmission in Colorado Springs found that HIV risk appeared low based on individual-level or egocentric network data, but sociometric data revealed risk to be higher than anticipated, with most individuals being within a few steps of an HIV infected person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klovdahl et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rothenberg et al., 1995</xref>). Other studies in the United States have shown that sociometric networks can propagate HIV, with core individuals of large network components serving as centers of high-risk behavior and pockets of infection that could be targeted by network-based interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Friedman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Young et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The sociometric network presented here provides further support for transmission within large network components in a low- and middle-income country setting. For both prevalent HIV and active HCV infection, we found that while having direct ties with HIV/HCV infection was associated with prevalent HIV/HCV, sociometric factors such as network distance to an infected alter were also independently associated even after accounting for direct ties. Among HCV RNA positive persons, the average sociometric network distance to another HCV RNA positive participant was significantly shorter compared to those of anti-HCV positive persons with undetectable HCV RNA or anti-HCV negative persons, supporting that network proximity to PWID with HCV RNA infection indicates higher likelihood of reinfection.</p><p>These analyses further contribute to available network data by overlaying sociometric network data with information on injection venues. Prior studies, including some among PWID, have shown that physical spaces play an important role in the spread of disease, but have not examined spread through sociometric injection networks or associations with indirect connections to spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zelenev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gesink et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rudolph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Logan et al., 2016</xref>). The incorporation of space accounts for undocumented connections between participants in a space as well as spatial factors themselves (e.g., access to harm reduction services). Logan et al. demonstrated this in a sample of 600 participants (including 303 PWID) from Winnipeg, Canada, defining a geographically and socially cohesive community through which infections spread and identifying key venues driving such spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Logan et al., 2016</xref>). This is one of the few studies that integrated space with injection network data but represents a small sample from a developed country setting where HIV burden was significantly lower and the social context of drug use is very different.</p><p>The idea that the sociospatial risk network may be the most relevant for transmission of disease is particularly salient with the increased focus on network-based interventions to reduce HIV and HCV transmission and optimize care outcomes while conserving resources. These findings suggest that in some settings, the sociospatial network may explain the majority of disease spread and interventions targeted at key spaces have the potential to interrupt transmission across a network and impact an entire city. For example, in this sample, it could be hypothesized that blanket coverage of venue #40 with treatment and pre-risk exposure prophylaxis, could impact transmission across New Delhi given the strong association of venue #40 with prevalent HIV among PWID in New Delhi.</p><p>Traditionally network-based interventions have relied heavily on social diffusion. For example, for HIV, network members are used to improve retention to antiretroviral therapy and improve viral suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klovdahl et al., 1994</xref>), and ‘deep chain’ respondent-driven sampling is being used to identify undiagnosed or out-of-care HIV-positive men who have sex with men in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rothenberg et al., 1995</xref>). For HCV, egocentric network-based treatment approaches have been identified as the optimal approach to deliver therapy while minimizing reinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rolls et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hellard et al., 2014</xref>). However, if networks are highly interconnected especially within other PWID at a venue as observed in New Delhi, failure to incorporate space in the consideration of a network could result in high rates of HCV reinfection.</p><p>In addition to network-level factors, these findings further reinforce the importance of well-established individual-level factors such as needle sharing, injection frequency, and experiencing homelessness. These associations and the limited uptake of harm reduction in this sample support continued efforts to expand harm reduction in this population. A key challenge in delivering services to this population is the high prevalence persons experiencing of homelessness which has not been previously demonstrated among PWID in India. PWID reporting homelessness, unstable housing, and migration may experience unmet needs for services and further disease transmission through socially and spatially dynamic networks.</p><p>A limitation of this cross-sectional analysis is that the reported networks and injection venues may not necessarily represent network members or venues where participants acquired HIV and/or HCV infection; however, this would likely bias observed associations toward the null and attenuated associations of sociometric and spatial factors. Further, the cross-sectional nature limits the ability to examine temporal associations, but the consistency of associations with active HCV infection suggests that these network factors may impact onward transmission. All responses related to drug use, network members, and spaces were self-reported and subject to social desirability and recall bias; to minimize bias, all interviewers were trained on optimal interviewing techniques. About 25% of referral coupons were not returned suggesting that the networks presented in these data may be incomplete; however, the response rate of 75% is higher than what has been seen in other network studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kimani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>). PWID under the age of 18 were excluded from the study due to the legal age of consent in India; therefore, these individuals are not represented by the network topology. Statistical analyses assumed that observations are independent conditional on individual-level covariates. This assumption is likely to be violated to some extent, but violations are not expected to bias point estimates (they would result in underestimated standard errors).</p><p>Limitations notwithstanding, these data highlight the importance of networks on HIV and HCV burden in a community of PWID in New Delhi, India. Integrating strategies to intervene at sociometric- and spatial-levels in addition to individual-level interventions could improve the efficiency of prevention and treatment programming and may be critical to achieving epidemic control and elimination of HIV and HCV, respectively, while conserving resources.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health (R01DA041736, DP2DA040244, R01DA041034, and K24DA035684), the Johns Hopkins University Center for AIDS Research (P30AI094189).

on the risk of hepatitis C virus and HIV transmission. The study concludes that social and spatial networks of injecting drug users have a significant influence on their risk of becoming hepatitis C virus or HIV positive, on top of their individual risk factors. This paper is of interest for epidemiologists and those who are working for people who inject drugs and people living with HIV.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Role of direct and indirect social and spatial ties in the diffusion of HIV and HCV among people who inject drugs: A cross-sectional community-based network analysis in New Delhi, India&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In egocentric network, the connection between first degree alters is referred by an index, but such information may not accurate (alters may or may not connected regardless of the information from the index). Were these connections confirmed by the first degree alters? This is not just the issue in the information provided by indexes. It is generally challenging to confirm connections. Some may not share their names nor background because of various reasons beyond those described by the authors: 1. they do not need such information to share syringes, and 2. they are afraid that the information is transferred to law enforcement agencies, or 3. simply there are too many to refer (I do not think it is realistic to ask each person whether all 2511 participants are connected to him/her). The diameter and average path length were dramatically reduced by incorporating injection location, which might be explained by the incompleteness of the network, because undocumented connections could be explained by locations as the authors described.</p><p>2.

To rigorously investigate the network structure, they employed biometric data (fingerprint) along with identifying information of referred persons. They further coupled the network data with the information of where the participants inject drugs, which is to complement the network structure as well as to investigate the unique contribution of the special information to the infection risk. They found both network structure and spatial information explain infection risk even after controlling for individual-level risk factors. There are some studies investigated the network structure and its contribution to the infection risk of HIV/HCV, however, this study is unique as they used rigorous approach to reconstruct the network structure beyond egocentric network with substantial effort. This study gives insights to the network-based intervention to control HIV/HCV epidemics implemented around the world.</p><p>The strength of this study is that they recruited large number of participants and the effort to complete the network: they collected the information of network carefully avoiding duplicates using not just identifying information but also biometric data (fingerprint). Meanwhile, the limitation of this study is, as is described by the authors, incompleteness of the network.<italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study was well designed to achieve its objective of uncovering a broader social and spatial network of injecting drug users in New Delhi, India. The extent of the network uncovered is impressive starting with just 10 index cases. The reliability of data is high given that 75% of referrals distributed through this network was returned to investigators. The authors have maintained rigorous standards in methodology as far as practically possible for a study of this scale conducted in one of the most densely populated places on earth.</p><p>The methods explained here in my opinion, will set a new standard in research that explores a person's risk of blood borne viral infections (HCV/HBV and HIV). The results show that in addition to typically reported individual risk factors such as age and education etc, the social and spatial network of an injecting drug user also significantly influences their risk of HIV/HCV infection. This finding will be a boost to community-based prevention methods by providing evidence to back their existence and relevance.</p><p>The study has some limitations – findings are not generalisable outside the geography studied but these methods can be employed to study other areas of interest. The study has excluded persons under the age of 18, which can have a significant impact on the topology of the network in the form of missing links.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69174.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In this study network connections were only established by return of a referral card. Sampling was initiated with 10 indexes. The indexes were asked to name individuals who they injected with in the prior month (regardless of whether they shared injection paraphernalia) as well as provide a factoid about each individual (e.g., “he is originally from Bihar” or “she has a scar under the left eye”). They were then provided unique barcoded referral cards for each of the injection partners they named (there was no limit on the number of partners one could name), and they were asked to provide the card(s) to their partner(s). When an individual returned a referral card, a biometric fingerprint scan was used to determine if they had been previously enrolled in the study. If previously enrolled, the referral card was used to establish an additional cross-network link between the individual and person who referred them. If the individual was not previously enrolled, the factoid previously provided was used to confirm they were indeed the partner described and the referral card was used to establish a network connection with the participant that referred them. This recruited participant was next considered an “index” and in turn asked to name and provide a factoid about the persons they injected with in the prior month and was provided referral cards for each of these partners. They were then asked to distribute the cards to their partners and when the cards were returned, network connections were established and the process was repeated. Therefore, for a network connection (edge) to be created between two participants (nodes) there had to be a direct barcoded referral card linking the two participants; connections were not inferred by asking an index if his/her alters injected with each other. Moreover, cross-network linkages between individuals referred by different indexes were established via biometric linkage. Although 75% of all referral cards distributed were returned, we agree with the reviewer that additional undocumented connections may exist for a multitude of reasons. The key reasons raised by the reviewer include:</p><p>1) they do not need such information to share syringes and (2) they are afraid that the information is transferred to law enforcement agencies, or (3) simply there are too many to refer (I do not think it is realistic to ask each person whether all 2511 participants are connected to him/her).</p><p>Participants were asked to provide referral cards to individuals regardless of whether they share syringes and did not need to provide real names in the case they did not know the person well or were afraid that information would be transferred to law enforcement agencies. Our research group has spent over 10 years developing trust and rapport with this PWID community. We conducted thorough ethnographic research and met with community leaders and PWID across the city, and this was not a concern expressed by participants. Individuals may not recall all their injection partners; however, we asked several additional questions to get estimates of the number of PWID individuals know and have injected with and trained interviewers to clarify and revisit questions in the case of inconsistencies. Moreover, prior work across India has supported that the number of injection partners within the prior month is relatively small- a median of 2 partners. This is fairly consistent across cities where we have worked in India. Moreover, we were asking participants to recall people they specifically injected with not just had passing contact with. We used the past month to minimize these recall issues.</p><p>Additionally, 75% network completeness is high for network studies among PWID, and we believe that the addition of spaces individuals inject allow us to further model undocumented connections. The network diameter and average path length were reduced by incorporating injection location, demonstrating the utility of spaces in reaching network participants, and we agree with the reviewer that this might be explained by the incompleteness of the network, but it also does not strictly signify incompleteness. Given a toy example where all injection partner connections are known, creating a bi-partite network with spaces can still result in reduced pathlength and diameter, irrespective of completeness. For example, in Author response image, 1 of a hypothetical example of a complete network, the diameter of (a) is 3 since the longest shortest paths have length of 3 edges (e.g., between 6-1 and 6-2); however, if we create a bi-partite network with a common space depicted as a blue square in (b), the diameter is reduced to 2.</p><fig id="sa1fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69174-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Both the number of infected partners and network distance to an infected partner had significant variable importance scores from random forest (p&lt;0.05) and are epidemiologically meaningful since an increase in these variables represents an increased number of pathways through which transmission could occur, as demonstrated in several treatment as prevention studies for HIV. While existing studies have reported associations with HIV/HCV infection and the number of infected partners, network distance to an infected partner may help to explain the increased risk of transmission even before a direct connection (injection partner) is diagnosed or represent viremia in the extended partner network, further approximating the chance that an unreported or future injection partner is infected, which to our knowledge is novel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
