Type I PRMT enzymes catalyze mono- and asymmetric dimethylation; Type II enzymes catalyze mono- and symmetric dimethylation. To understand the specific mechanisms of PRMT activity in splicing regulation, we inhibited Type I and II PRMTs and probed their transcriptomic consequences. Using the newly developed Splicing Kinetics and Transcript Elongation Rates by Sequencing (SKaTER-seq) method, analysis of co-transcriptional splicing demonstrated that PRMT inhibition resulted in altered splicing rates. Surprisingly, co-transcriptional splicing kinetics did not correlate with final changes in splicing of polyadenylated RNA. This was particularly true for retained introns (RI). By using actinomycin D to inhibit ongoing transcription, we determined that PRMTs post-transcriptionally regulate RI. Subsequent proteomic analysis of both PRMT-inhibited chromatin and chromatin-associated polyadenylated RNA identified altered binding of many proteins, including the Type I substrate, CHTOP, and the Type II substrate, SmB. Targeted mutagenesis of all methylarginine sites in SmD3, SmB, and SmD1 recapitulated splicing changes seen with Type II PRMT inhibition, without disrupting snRNP assembly. Similarly, mutagenesis of all methylarginine sites in CHTOP recapitulated the splicing changes seen with Type I PRMT inhibition. Examination of subcellular fractions further revealed that RI were enriched in the nucleoplasm and chromatin. Taken together, these data demonstrate that, through Sm and CHTOP arginine methylation, PRMTs regulate the post-transcriptional processing of nuclear, detained introns.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PRMT5</kwd><kwd>PRMT1</kwd><kwd>retained detained introns</kwd><kwd>RNA processing</kwd><kwd>snRNP</kwd><kwd>A549</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Detained introns</kwd><kwd>DI</kwd><kwd>Mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>PTMs</kwd><kwd>Post-translational modifications</kwd><kwd>Transcription</kwd><kwd>SDMA</kwd><kwd>MMA</kwd><kwd>ADMA</kwd><kwd>Rme2s</kwd><kwd>Rme2a</kwd><kwd>Rme1</kwd><kwd>PRMTs</kwd><kwd>PRMT1</kwd><kwd>PRMT5</kwd><kwd>CARM1</kwd><kwd>PRMT4</kwd><kwd>Protein Arginine Methyltransferases</kwd><kwd>Splicing</kwd><kwd>Post-transcriptional processing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM108646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shechter</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM57829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Query</surname><given-names>Charles C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM134379</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gamble</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002590</institution-id><institution>American Lung Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LCD-564723</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shechter</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006984</institution-id><institution>Irma T.

Arginine methylation is critical in regulating signal transduction, gene expression, and splicing (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guccione and Richard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lorton and Shechter, 2019</xref>). For instance, an important function of PRMT5 and its cofactors pICln and MEP50 (also known as WDR77) is assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs)âcore components of the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neuenkirchen et al., 2015</xref>). This includes both non-enzymatic chaperoning of Sm proteins via PRMT5/pICln following their translation and post-translational methylation of SmD1 (SNRPD1), SmD3 (SNRPD3), and SmB/Bâ² (SNRPB), by PRMT5-MEP50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Friesen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paknia et al., 2016</xref>). Following their methylation, these Sm proteins are delivered to the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) assembly factor, by which they are bound to small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in preparation for further processing and eventual nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boisvert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meister and Fischer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pellizzoni et al., 2002</xref>). Disruption of PRMT5 leads to numerous splicing defects, primarily exon skipping (SE) and intron retention (RI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boisvert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fedoriw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Radzisheuskaya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sachamitr et al., 2021</xref>). Intron retention is a highly prevalent alternative splicing event in tumors and is ubiquitous across cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dvinge and Bradley, 2015</xref>). Therefore, determining how PRMT activity governs intron retention is of great interest.</p><p>RNA splicing occurs either during transcriptional elongation or after the transcript has been cleaved and released from polymerase (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Neugebauer, 2019</xref>). Although the importance of PRMT5 in preserving splicing integrity is clear, whether PRMT5 exerts its influence over co- or post-transcriptional splicing is still unknown. Previous work has indirectly implicated PRMT5 in the regulation of post-transcriptional splicing in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and also as a regulator of detained introns (DI)âa class of retained, unspliced introns in poly(A) RNA that remain nuclear and are removed prior to cytoplasmic export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jia et al., 2020</xref>). DI are highly conserved and enriched in RNA processing factor transcripts; their removal has been proposed as part of a feedback mechanism to control protein expression during differentiation and cell stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yap et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braunschweig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>). As PRMT5 inhibition leads to loss of Sm methylation and a simultaneous increase in DI, Sm proteins have been implicated in regulating DI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2017</xref>). However, a direct connection of DI or RI levels to Sm arginine methylation has not been established.</p><p>The mechanistic role of Type I PRMTs (PRMT1â4, 6, and 8) in splicing is still poorly understood. Recent reports demonstrate that Type I PRMT inhibition leads to SE consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fedoriw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fong et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, many of the Type I-methylated proteins have a potential role in RNA post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fedoriw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fong et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with a role in post-transcriptional processing, the primary Type I methyltransferase, PRMT1, has been implicated in the regulation of RNA export; this regulation occurs through methylation of the Transcription and Export (TREX) componentsâAly and REF export factor (ALYREF) and chromatin target of PRMT1 (CHTOP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Dijk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of CHTOP leads to an accumulation of nuclear polyadenylated transcripts, consistent with a block in RNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, ALYREF and CHTOP are both deposited along nascent RNA and are also bound to RI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viphakone et al., 2019</xref>). As the nuclear export of RNA is intimately linked to splicingâdissociation of splicing factors is a prerequisite for successful exportâregulation of this process is a potential means to control RI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luo and Reed, 1999</xref>). Despite this, the role of nuclear export factors and the impact of Type I PRMTs on regulating RI remains unexplored.</p><p>Here, we test both the co- and post-transcriptional consequences of inhibiting Type I and II PRMTs. We also probe which proteins mediate the transcriptional consequences of PRMT inhibition. As both Type I and II PRMTs have been extensively reported to be required for the pathogenicity of lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>)âyet their role in the transcription and splicing of this disease remains largely unstudiedâwe used A549 human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells as our model. Using GSK591 (also known as EPZ015866 or GSK3203591), a potent and selective inhibitor of PRMT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duncan et al., 2016</xref>), and MS023, a potent pan-Type I inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eram et al., 2016</xref>), we demonstrate that PRMTs inversely regulate RI post-transcriptionally through either Sm or CHTOP arginine methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Type I and II PRMT inhibition promotes changes in alternative splicing</title><p>PRMTs consume S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and produce S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) to catalyze the post-translational methylation of either one or both terminal nitrogen atoms of the guanidino group of arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gary and Clarke, 1998</xref>). All PRMTs can generate monomethyl arginine (Rme1). Type I PRMTs further catalyze the formation of asymmetric N<sup>G</sup>,N<sup>G</sup>-dimethylarginine (Rme2a); Type II PRMTs (PRMT5 and 9) form symmetric N<sup>G</sup>,N<sup>âG</sup>-dimethylarginine (Rme2s). PRMT5 is the primary Type II methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). As previous reports indicated that lengthy treatment with PRMT inhibitors promotes aberrant RNA splicing, we wanted to determine whether alternative splicing differences occurred as early as day 2 and, if so, how they changed over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Radzisheuskaya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sachamitr et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we performed poly(A)-RNA sequencing on A549 cells treated with DMSO, GSK591, MS023, or both inhibitors in combination for 2, 4, and 7 days. As 7 days of co-treatment resulted in significant cell death, these cells were not sequenced (not shown). Using replicate Multivariate Analysis of Transcript Splicing (rMATS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) to identify alternative splicing events, we observed significant differences in RI with GSK591, MS023, and co-treatment with both inhibitors (FDR &lt; 0.05) relative to DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Furthermore, whereas RI were increased with GSK591 and co-treatmentâsignified by a positive difference in percent spliced in (+ÎPSI or +ÎÎ¨)âRI were decreased with MS023 treatment (âÎÎ¨) relative to DMSO.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Type I PRMTs and PRMT5 inversely regulate intron retention.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview of protein arginine methyltransferases and their catalyzed reactions.

Strikingly, whereas GSK591 and co-treatment with both inhibitors had increased inclusion, for the same introns, MS023 treatment resulted in decreased inclusion relative to DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). When analyzing the distribution of ÎÎ¨ for this subset of common introns (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), the median ÎÎ¨ did not significantly differ from the parent population (<italic>not shown</italic>).

Independent transduction of two unique guide RNAs (gRNA) for 4 days targeting either the major Type I methyltransferasesâPRMT1 and PRMT4âor the Type II methyltransferase, PRMT5, resulted in a robust reduction of their RNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). Furthermore, we recapitulated increased RI in <italic>GAS5</italic> intron 9, <italic>ANKZF1</italic> intron 9, and <italic>NOP2</italic> intron 14 by RT-qPCR following knockdown of PRMT5 with both unique gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>).

Consistently, treatment with GSK591 or MS023 resulted in a stronger decrease in total cellular dimethylarginine levels, while PRMT knockdown only modestly decreased dimethylarginine, likely owing to incomplete depletion of the enzymes through this approach.</p><p>We recently published an extensive proteomic and transcriptomic characterization of the A549 arginine methylome in response to GSK591 and MS023 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maron et al., 2021</xref>). In that work, we identified 2444 unique methylations across 585 proteins, the majority of which were involved in nuclear and chromatin regulation.

In these experimentsâconducted in a variety of cell lines from diseases including acute myeloid leukemia (THP-1), chronic myeloid leukemia (K562), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PANC03.27), and glioblastoma (U87)âarginine methylation was inhibited via PRMT knockdown using CRISPRi or with chemical inhibition using GSK591 or MS023. As demonstrated by the high odds ratio (log<sub>2</sub>(OR)&gt;6) between all the data sets, we showed that there was a highly significant overlap in RI (Fisherâs exact adjusted p&lt;1eâ05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). This high level of overlap between cell models and inhibition approaches further establishes the importance of PRMTs in regulating RI and also supports that the observed changes in RI are on-target effects of the inhibitors.</p><p>RI have previously been reported to have common characteristics such as being shorter in length, closer to transcription end site (TES), and having reduced splice site strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braunschweig et al., 2014</xref>). To determine the common characteristics of the PRMT-regulated RI, we analyzed their length, distances to the TES, and sequences. We found that the RI were significantly closer to the TES and shorter when compared to the genomic distribution of A549 expressed introns (p<italic>&lt;</italic>2.2eâ16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>). Moreover, in analyzing the probability of nucleotide distribution at the 5â² and 3â² splice sites, we noted both a preference for guanine three nucleotides downstream of the 5â² splice site and increased frequency of cytosine in the polypyrimidine tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2b</xref>). This is consistent with previous literature demonstrating that RI have common features contributing to their persistence in poly(A) RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braunschweig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). Despite GSK591 and MS023 treatmentsâ inverse effect on RI, these characteristics did not differ between the observed retained or removed introns. Therefore, to uncover the mechanisms behind our observed splicing changes, we sought to characterize their co-transcriptional consequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PRMT-dependent changes in co-transcriptional splicing do not reflect changes in poly(A) RNA</title><p>The inverse relationship on RI by Type I or II inhibition in addition to their TES-proximal location, shorter length, and non-canonical splice sites led us to specifically investigate the kinetics of co-transcriptional splicing. To accomplish this, we used Splicing Kinetics and Transcript Elongation Rates by Sequencing (SKaTER seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casill et al., 2021</xref>). A brief overview of the method follows. To synchronize transcription, SKaTER seq uses a 3-hr 5,6-dichloro-1-Î²-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) treatment, followed by a rapid washout to allow productive elongation to commence. Once RNA pol II begins elongating, nascent RNA is collected every 5 min until 35 min post-DRB washout. Nascent RNA is isolated via a 1 M urea wash of chromatin and an additional poly(A)-RNA depletion. Following sequencing, the rate of nascent RNA formationâincluding: (1) RNA pol II initiation and pause-release (spawn) rate, (2) elongation rate, (3) splicing rate, and (4) transcript cleavage rateâis calculated using a comprehensive model that determines the rates that best fit the sequencing coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casill et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>As splicing changes are present 2 days following GSK591 or MS023 treatment, we performed SKaTER seq at this treatment time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). To assess the accuracy of the rates determined by the SKaTER model, we used the spawn, elongation, splicing, and cleavage rates to simulate a predicted poly(A)-RNA cassette exon Î¨ and compared these results with our poly(A)-RNA sequencing. We successfully predicted cassette exon Î¨ detected in poly(A) RNA in DMSO (Spearmanâs correlation coefficient Ï=0.54), GSK591 (Ï=0.61), and MS023 (Ï=0.55) (p<italic>&lt;</italic>2.2eâ16) treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). Next, we compared spawn rate to poly(A)-RNA sequencing transcripts per million (TPM).

To determine if this was a direct result of altered splicing rates, we used the SKaTER-seq data to ask how inhibiting PRMTs affected the genome-wide distribution of splicing rates. Surprisingly, compared to the DMSO control, GSK591 treatment did not significantly change the median of this distribution (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p&gt;0.05), while MS023 treatment resulted in significantly slower global splicing rates (p<italic>&lt;</italic>2.2eâ16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

As we initially hypothesized that a slower splicing rate should increase RI, this result was surprisingly inconsistent with the PRMT-inhibited changes seen in poly(A) RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). These observations therefore suggested that changes in intron retention following PRMT inhibition were not entirely due to co-transcriptional splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>RI share unique characteristics that limit their co-transcriptional removal</title><p>We next asked how RI splicing rates compared to non-RI. We observed that, when compared to all introns, introns that were retained in GSK591- or MS023-treated cells were slower to splice (p<italic>=</italic>0.01 and p<italic>=</italic>0.17, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). However, consistent with slower splicing as a general feature of RI, analysis of these same RI in DMSO-treated cells similarly revealed a significantly slower splicing rate (p=3.6eâ6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, left violin plots). As we previously found that RI were more likely to be closer to the TES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), we asked whether intron position correlated with splicing rate. Indeed, we determined that introns located closer to the TES had slower splicing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). Importantly, we had also previously found that RI were significantly shorter than non-RI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). The time required to transcribe an intron is a determining factor of splice site availability and co-transcriptional splicing outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fong et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we next analyzed the time required to transcribe RI in comparison to non-RI. We found that RI transcription was completed significantly faster in DMSO-, GSK591-, and MS023-treated cells (p=1.03eâ24, 1.94eâ15, and 3.00eâ7, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). This observation, together with the proximity of RI to the TES and their slower splicing rate, suggests that RI in all conditions have a decreased window of opportunity for splicing to occur co-transcriptionally. Moreover, the lack of specific co-transcriptional splicing changes in RI following PRMT inhibition further supports that a post-transcriptional mechanism underlies the observed PRMT-dependent changes in poly(A) RNA.</p><p>The paradox thatâdespite their slower co-transcriptional splicing rateâRI are decreased with Type I PRMT inhibition led us to hypothesize that PRMTs exert their control over splicing post-transcriptionally. To test this hypothesis, we used the elongation, splicing, and cleavage rates determined by SKaTER seq to calculate the probability that a transcript will be cleaved from RNA pol II prior to a given intron being spliced co-transcriptionally. Consistent with most splicing being co-transcriptional, we found that the median probability of cleavage prior to splicing genome-wide was 9.7% in DMSO-, 8.7% in GSK591-, and 18.1% in MS023-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2b</xref>). The global distribution was significantly reduced with GSK591 treatment (p<italic>=</italic>0.002) and increased with MS023 treatment (p<italic>&lt;</italic>2.2eâ16) when compared to DMSO treatment. We next analyzed the probability of cleavage prior to splicing for RI compared to non-RI. Consistent with the hypothesis that PRMTs regulate RI post-transcriptionally, the median probability of transcript cleavage prior to co-transcriptional splicing was significantly higher for RI in DMSO- (p=2.65e-14), GSK591- (p=2.70e-9), and MS023-treated (p=0.004) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Furthermore, intron position was strongly predictive of whether transcript cleavage was likely to occur prior to splicing: TES proximal introns had a higher probability of cleavage prior to their being spliced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2c</xref>).

To test this model, we pre-treated A549 cells for 2 days with GSK591 or MS023 and then blocked transcription using actinomycin D (ActD) for 60 min. We then performed poly(A)-RNA sequencing to determine the post-transcriptional consequences of PRMT inhibition on RI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

To accomplish this, we took into consideration the enriched gene ontology categories described above and highlighted the most significant factors involved in RNA splicing, transport, and degradation relative to their log<sub>2</sub> fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). In the input chromatin of GSK591-treated cells, we observed increased signal in the snRNP assembly factor SMN, as well as the snRNP component SNRPB (SmB/Bâ²) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). We also observed enrichment of SNRPB in the poly(A)-enriched fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Previous reports have documented changes in exon skipping following SNRPB knockdownâincluding within its own transcriptâthat resemble changes seen with PRMT5 knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saltzman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bezzi et al., 2013</xref>).

ALYREF and DDX39B are recruited to pre-mRNA co-transcriptionally and are crucial for the eventual hand-over of the mRNA to the nuclear export receptor, nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heath et al., 2016</xref>). When looking specifically at the poly(A)-RNA fraction of MS023-treated cells, we noted an increase in CHTOP, also a component of the TREX complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heath et al., 2016</xref>). Both CHTOP and ALYREF have been shown to be direct targets of the major Type I methyltransferase PRMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Dijk et al., 2010</xref>).

This is consistent with their increase in both the chromatin and poly(A)-RNA fractions following MS023-mediated inhibition of Type I PRMT activity.</p><p>To further refine the PRMT targets that regulate RI, we compared these data with the proteins that contained methylarginine identified in our recently published study of the A549 arginine methylome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maron et al., 2021</xref>). In that work, we compiled our proteomic data with previously published arginine methylome data to establish a comprehensive database of methylarginine-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maron et al., 2021</xref>). When we intersected the arginine methylome with the differentially enriched proteins in our input and poly(A) enriched fractions (p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.1), there were 88 and 23 unique methylarginine-containing proteins, respectively. We then analyzed the top 15 differentially enriched proteins in each fraction. In the input, we noted that ALYREF and SNRPB were both modified with methylarginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Furthermore, when looking at the poly(A) fraction, we again observed SNRPB as well as CHTOP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). The prior identification of ALYREF, CHTOP, and SNRPB as methylarginine-containing proteins suggested that these bonafide PRMT substrates may be potential mediators of PRMT-dependent RI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brahms et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Dijk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maron et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To validate changes in CHTOP and SNRPB chromatin-association following PRMT inhibition, we isolated the chromatin fraction and probed for CHTOP and SNRPB. In MS023-treated cells, we observed faster CHTOP gel migration; this is consistent with its hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). In GSK591-treated cells, there was increased chromatin-bound SNRPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). To further confirm that the changes in methylarginine were specific to CHTOP and SNRPB, we performed an immunoprecipitation for these proteins following PRMT inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Subsequent analysis of methylarginine confirmed loss of CHTOP Rme2a with MS023 treatment and SNRPB Rme2s with GSK591 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Taken together, the differential enrichment of ALYREF, DDX39B, and POLDIP3 on chromatin, along with CHTOP on poly(A) RNA following treatment with MS023âin addition to their dependence on Rme2aâpresented the possibility that the TREX complex may have an important role in the post-transcriptional consequences of Type I PRMTs on RI. Moreover, as snRNPs are fundamental in splicing, increased SNRPB in both the input and poly(A) fractions following treatment with GSK591âas well as the loss of Rme2sâprompted us to further evaluate the role of SNRPB in the regulation of RI.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Knockdown of CHTOP and SNRPB recapitulates changes in RI seen following PRMT inhibition</title><p>To address the question of whether CHTOP, ALYREF, or SNRPB were involved in regulation of RI, we first checked whether there was any publicly available RNA-seq data in which these proteins were perturbed. We found two independent data sets where SNRPB was knocked down in U251 glioblastoma cells or in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saltzman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Correa et al., 2016</xref>). We also identified two independent data sets where CHTOP or ALYREF were knocked down in HEK293T cells or HeLa cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viphakone et al., 2019</xref>). Strikingly, after performing rMATS on these data sets, we observed that both SNRPB knockdown (SNRPBkd) experiments strongly recapitulated the increase in RI seen with GSK591 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Likewise, although ALYREF knockdown did not significantly affect RI levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1a</xref>), CHTOP knockdown (CHTOPkd) resulted in a global decrease in RI inclusion, paralleling that seen with MS023 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). To understand if the RI were common across data sets, we intersected either the SNRPBkd or CHTOPkd RI with the RI seen following GSK591 or MS023 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b and c</xref>). There were 535 mutual RI between GSK591 and both the SNRPBkd data sets, most of which had the same effect on ÎÎ¨ (log<sub>2</sub> OR 7.84 for GBM and 7.56 for HeLa, p<italic>&lt;</italic>1eâ300) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The opposite was true when comparing GSK591 to CHTOPkdâwe observed 620 shared RI (log<sub>2</sub> OR 7.49, p<italic>&lt;</italic>1eâ300) that largely contrasted in their ÎÎ¨ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). When compared to SNRPBkd and CHTOPkd, MS023 treatment had the inverse effect to GSK591 treatment. There were 164 overlapping RI between both SNRPBkd data sets (log<sub>2</sub> OR 6.68 for GBM and 6.38 for HeLa, p<italic>&lt;</italic>7eâ290) with the majority having opposite ÎÎ¨ values; CHTOPkd and MS023 treatment shared 201 RI (log<sub>2</sub> OR 6.46, p<italic>&lt;</italic>2eâ279), with the majority having coincident ÎÎ¨ values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Consistent with PRMTs regulating a common group of RI, SNRPBkd and CHTOPkd were significantly correlated with either GSK591 or MS023 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Remarkably, the correlations that were positive for GSK591 treatment were negative for MS023 treatment, reflecting the changes seen in poly(A)-RNA seq and consistent with SNRPB and CHTOP mediating the effects of PRMT inhibition on RI.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sm and CHTOP methylarginine mediates PRMT-dependent RI.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Comparison of ÎÎ¨ for RI following SNRPB knockdown (kd), GSK591 treatment, MS023 treatment, and CHTOPkd where ÎÎ¨=Î¨ (Treatment)âÎ¨ (Control).

To identify the appropriate arginines to mutate, we utilized our proteomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maron et al., 2021</xref>) as well as a previously published high-resolution crystal structure of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Charenton et al., 2019</xref>). As we showed that PRMTs prefer to methylate intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), we mutated all 29 arginines within Sm IDRs and within GR repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maron et al., 2021</xref>). We then transduced A549 cells with the constructs. We achieved similar expression of the exogenous Sm proteins relative to the endogenous between WT and mutant constructs at the level of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). However, likely owing to the tight cellular control of total Sm levels, we were unable to achieve ample overexpression with the WT vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prusty et al., 2017</xref>). We observed a migratory shift toward a lower molecular weight in the R-to-A mutants when compared to the WT or R-to-K mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). We also observed a strong Rme2s signal on the FLAG-SmB WT protein that was absent on the R-to-A and R-to-K mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><p>As the Sm proteins exist in a heptameric ring bound to snRNAâtogether forming snRNPsâwe tested whether mutating the arginines of the C-terminal tail compromised snRNP assembly. To accomplish this, we transduced A549 cells with the Sm WT, R-to-A, or R-to-K mutants and performed a co-immunoprecipitation targeting the N-terminal FLAG tag. We then used western and northern blotting to probe for snRNP-associated proteins and snRNAs, respectively. When analyzing binding to the snRNP assembly factor, SMN, we did not observe any differences between the WT, R-to-A, or R-to-K constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). Furthermore, we enriched the U1 snRNP specific factor, U1-70k, and confirmed a complete absence of Rme2s with R-to-A and R-to-K mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). The ability of the Sm mutants to bind snRNA was also unperturbed: we observed an enrichment of all the major snRNAsâU1, U2, U4, U5, and U6âwith the WT, R-to-A, and R-to-K constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2b</xref>). To confirm that the total cellular pool of snRNPs was not compromised, we also immunoprecipitated SNRPB; this should enrich both endogenous and exogenous Sm proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2b</xref>). We did not observe any differences in snRNA binding to SNRPB. This supports the conclusion that cellular snRNP assembly is not dependent on methylarginine or compromised by the expression of the exogenous Sm proteins. Furthermore, and consistent with the dispensability of Sm methylarginine for snRNP assembly, extensive treatment of A549 cells with GSK591 similarly did not disrupt binding of Sm proteins to snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2c</xref>). Importantly, these results are in line with prior published reports where deletion of <italic>dart5â</italic>the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PRMT5 orthologueâor deletion of the Sm tails did not affect binding of Sm proteins to SMN and snRNP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gonsalvez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chari et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In addition to accounting for snRNP assembly, we also tested whether the mutagenesis of the Sm C-terminal domain altered snRNP nuclear import by performing indirect immunofluorescence for either FLAG or SNRPB following transduction of the Sm mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2d</xref>). Using this approach, we observed both cytoplasmic and nuclear signal with FLAG and SNRPB antibodies in the WT, R-to-A, and R-to-K Sm-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2d</xref>).

Interestingly, when transducing cells with the WT CHTOP, we noted a gross downregulation of the endogenous transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1e</xref>). CHTOP has been previously reported to control its own expression as part of an autoregulatory loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Izumikawa et al., 2016</xref>). We did not observe this compensation with either the R-to-A or R-to-K mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1e</xref>). Consistent with the gel shift in CHTOP seen following MS023 treatment, we observed a similar change in the R-to-A mutant when compared to the WT or R-to-K mutants. Moreover, supporting a role for CHTOP methylarginine in Type I PRMT-dependent RI inclusion, in both R-to-A and R-to-K mutants, we observed decreased inclusion in <italic>GAS5</italic> intron 9 (p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). We also saw a trend toward decreased inclusion of <italic>ANKZF1</italic> intron 9 (p<italic>=</italic>0.23 and 0.26) and significantly decreased inclusion of <italic>NOP2</italic> intron 14 (p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.0001) in the R-to-K mutant, but not the R-to-A mutant. Taken together, these experiments support that CHTOP methylarginine is involved in regulating RI levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>PRMT-regulated RI are detained within the nucleoplasm and chromatin</title><p>PRMT5 has been proposed to specifically regulate DIâintrons that persist in poly(A) RNA but remain nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2017</xref>). However, direct experimental evidenceânamely fractionation of subcellular compartments to identify the location of RIâhas been lacking. To address the question of whether the RI in our data are nuclear and therefore DI, we first ran rMATS on publicly available ENCODE poly(A)-RNA seq from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of A549 cells (ENCSR000CTL and ENCSR000CTM, respectively). We observed an enrichment of RI within the nuclear fraction: 97% of significant RI events (FDR&lt;0.05) had a +ÎÎ¨, where ÎÎ¨ is the difference in Î¨ between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. We then intersected these data with the PRMT-dependent RI and noted that there was a significant overlap with both GSK591 (log<sub>2</sub> OR 8.89, p<italic>&lt;</italic>1eâ300) and MS023 treatment (log<sub>2</sub> OR 7.75, p<italic>&lt;</italic>1eâ300) when compared to all A549 expressed introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

We first confirmed the integrity of our fractionation approach by comparing the distribution of GAPDH, LaminB2, U1-70k, and H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Whereas GAPDH was strongly enriched in the cytoplasm, LaminB2 was completely nuclear and distributed between the chromatin and nucleoplasm. Furthermore, U1-70k was nucleoplasmic, while H3 was only found on chromatin. This is consistent with results from previously published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yeom et al., 2021</xref>). We next analyzed the cellular distribution of SNRPB, SNRPD3, and CHTOP as well as Rme2s and Rme2a. Interestingly, we observed an increase in nucleoplasmic and chromatin-bound SNRPB in cells treated with GSK591, with the majority of SNRPB located in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). A similar distribution was also seen for SNRPD3. When analyzing Rme2s across cellular fractions, there was a significant decrease in the cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, and chromatin fractions with GSK591 treatment and a slight increase in Rme2s signal with MS023 treatment that was most apparent in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). When analyzing the distribution of CHTOP across cellular fractions, we observed an enrichment in the nucleoplasm and chromatin; a migration shift toward a lower molecular weight with MS023 treatment was also seen in both fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Furthermore, MS023 resulted in a strong decrease in Rme2a across all cellular fractions, while GSK591 treatment slightly increased Rme2a levels in the nucleoplasm and chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).</p><p>We then quantified levels of <italic>GAS5</italic> intron 9, <italic>ANKZF1</italic> intron 9, <italic>NOP2</italic> intron 14, and <italic>HNRNPH1</italic> intron 14 or non-RI within the same poly(A) transcripts in the cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, and chromatin fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). In accordance with the RI being localized to the nucleus, in all conditions we observed a significant increase in nucleoplasmic and chromatin RI signal compared to the cytoplasm (p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Importantly, for the non-RI, there was no significant difference between cytoplasmic or nuclear enrichment. Taken together, these data support that these RI are indeed localized to the nucleoplasm and chromatin fractions and are thus detained introns.</p><p>We next wanted to understand which cellular fraction had the greatest changes in post-transcriptional intron decay following PRMT inhibition. To accomplish this, we pre-treated cells with DMSO, GSK591, or MS023 for 2 days and then blocked transcription with ActD for 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We then fractionated the cells into cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, and chromatin components and analyzed RI levels. When compared to DMSO treatment, we observed that the changes in intron decay with GSK591 or MS023 treatment were isolated to the nucleoplasmic and chromatin fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Specifically, GSK591 treatment resulted in decreased chromatin-associated intron decay in <italic>GAS5</italic> intron 9, <italic>NOP2</italic> intron 14, and <italic>HNRNPH1</italic> intron 14 (p&lt;0.05), while a slight increase was observed for <italic>ANKZF1</italic> intron 9 (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). In the nucleoplasm, <italic>NOP2</italic> intron 12 (p&lt;0.0001) and <italic>HNRNPH1</italic> intron 14 (p=0.06) also demonstrated less intron decay, while there was no significant difference in <italic>GAS5</italic> intron 9 and <italic>ANKZF1</italic> intron 9 (p&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). MS023 treatment promoted increased intron decay in chromatin-associated <italic>GAS5</italic> intron 9 (p&lt;0.001), <italic>ANKZF1</italic> intron 9 (p&lt;0.05), <italic>NOP2</italic> intron 14 (p=0.11), and <italic>HNRNPH1</italic> intron 14 (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). These changes were less pronounced in the nucleoplasm, where only <italic>GAS5</italic> intron 9 (p&lt;0.05) had significantly greater decay relative to DMSO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Taken together, these results recapitulate the changes in RI decay seen with whole-cell ActD poly(A) RNA sequencingâdecreased intron decay with GSK591 treatment and increased decay with MS023 treatmentâwith enhanced resolution of the cellular compartments in which they occur: the nucleoplasm and chromatin.</p><p>In summary, we conclude that Type I and II PRMTs regulate post-transcriptional DI through modulation of snRNP and CHTOP arginine methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). We also propose the following model for PRMT-dependent DI regulation: (1) snRNP Rme2s is required for post-transcriptional maturation of DI-containing transcriptsâin the absence of Rme2s these snRNPs are bound to transcript but the DI are sequestered from splicing or degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), (2) CHTOP Rme2a is necessary for DI-containing transcripts to progress through the TREX-mediated nuclear export pathway; CHTOP lacking Rme2a inhibits this progression but does not protect the poly(A) RNA, which together with the consequent increase in nuclear residence time promotes splicing or degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Type I and II PRMTs regulate post-transcriptional intron detention through Sm and CHTOP methylation.</title><p>(<bold>aâc</bold>) Model figures representing an overview of Type I- and Type II-dependent regulation of detained introns (DI) (<bold>a</bold>). Sm Rme2s is necessary for productive splicing and maturation of DI; absence of Rme2s results in detention of the parent transcript (<bold>b</bold>).

Many reports have documented that Type II PRMTs have a crucial role in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boisvert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fedoriw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Radzisheuskaya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sachamitr et al., 2021</xref>). However, the role of Type I PRMTs in splicing has only recently been appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fedoriw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fong et al., 2019</xref>). This is the first study to report that Type I PRMT inhibition decreases DI. Interestingly, simultaneous Type I and II PRMT inhibition increased DI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), suggesting that Type II catalyzed Rme2s is dominant in DI regulation. This observation is consistent with our model, whereby snRNP binding occurs upstream of CHTOP-mediated intron detention and protects RNA from post-transcriptional splicing or degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>).</p><p>Whether PRMTs regulate splicing co- or post-transcriptionally has not previously been explored. We found that Type I PRMT inhibition promoted slower co-transcriptional splicing, while paradoxically resulting in fewer DI. Given that arginine methylation has been shown to disrupt protein-RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackwell and Ceman, 2012</xref>), one possible mechanism for this observation may be that the absence of Rme2a inhibits or delays the dissociation of RNA processing factors from nascent RNA thereby leading to slower splicing. We and others found that PRMT-dependent DI share characteristics such as non-canonical splice sites, shorter length, and location closer to the TES that makes their co-transcriptional removal less likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braunschweig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2017</xref>). As has been proposed by others, DI are likely an evolutionarily conserved class of introns used for fine tuning the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braunschweig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>). This is further supported by our comparison of DI in publicly available data sets, whichâdespite using diverse cell models and methods of inhibiting PRMTsâhad a strong overlap with the DI present in our data. The same characteristics that lead these introns to become detained are likely what make them more sensitive to perturbation of splicing components. Consistent with this model, DI had slower splicing rates relative to non-DI and were transcribed significantly faster. Together with their TES-proximal location, this combination is likely to decrease the window of opportunity for splicing to be completed co-transcriptionally and increase their reliance on post-transcriptional processing. Indeed, when using actinomycin D to study post-transcriptional DI processing, Type II PRMT inhibition resulted in decreased DI loss compared to DMSO or Type I PRMT inhibition, whereas Type I PRMT inhibition increased DI loss relative to DMSO and Type II PRMT inhibition. Thus, the post-transcriptionalârather than co-transcriptionalâconsequences reflect those seen in poly(A) RNA.</p><p>Although little is known about how post-transcriptional splicing is accomplished, previous work has demonstrated that post-transcriptional spliceosomes are retained in nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Girard et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, CHTOP and the TREX complex have also been found to localize within nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dias et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Perturbation of either splicing factors or TREX components resulted in accumulation of poly(A) RNA in nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dias et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore possible that the two types of PRMTs coalesce at the level of this membraneless organelle. Consistently, we observed that SRRM1 was enriched in the poly(A) fraction in Type II inhibited cells, whereas SRRM2 was enriched in the poly(A) fraction in Type I inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Many SR-repeat proteinsâincluding SRRM1 and SRRM2âare localized to nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>). Given the importance of arginine methylation in regulating liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and the role of LLPS in maintaining nuclear speckle integrityâas well as other membraneless organelles such as Cajal bodiesâPRMT inhibition may result in failed coordination and spatial localization of RNA processing factors leading to aberrant post-transcriptional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Courchaine et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liao and Regev, 2021</xref>).</p><p>As delayed splicing has been shown to result in chromatin retention of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brody et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pandya-Jones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yeom et al., 2021</xref>), we assayed chromatin-associated poly(A) RNA to identify factors that regulate PRMT-dependent DI. By interrogating changes in proteins bound to chromatin-associated poly(A) RNAâand their methylarginine levelsâwe identified snRNPs as key-mediators of DI regulation. Sm arginine methylation occurs on their intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahms et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brahms et al., 2001</xref>). Consistently, mutagenesis of arginine within the Sm C-terminal tails to either alanine or lysine abrogated Rme2s. Interestingly, loss of Sm Rme2s did not affect snRNP assembly. As the Sm-protein tails have previously been shown to be dispensable for snRNP assembly, and knockout of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PRMT5 orthologue had no effect on snRNP biogenesis, our data strongly suggest that the Sm C-terminal tails and their modification with methylarginine are important for post-transcriptional RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gonsalvez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chari et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, because the Sm C-terminal domains are intrinsically disordered and intrinsically disordered proteins are known to be heavily involved in LLPS, it is possible that methylarginine on the Sm tails regulates incorporation into membraneless organelles required for post-transcriptional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Courchaine et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>When analyzing proteins differentially bound to chromatin-associated poly(A) RNA following PRMT inhibition, we also identified the TREX complex component, CHTOP. Importantly, CHTOP contains a RI within its own transcript that is used to autoregulate its expression by nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Izumikawa et al., 2016</xref>). This is accomplished by antagonizing intron excision by HNRNPH when CHTOPâusing its âGARâ-motifâbinds to its own transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Izumikawa et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that a similar mechanism may be occurring globally whereby introns that are slow to splice are bound by CHTOPâwhich has been shown to bind nascent RNA co-transcriptionallyâand this prevents both further binding by HNRNP proteins and intron excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Izumikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viphakone et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Another mechanism may be explained by the role of CHTOP in alternative polyadenylation (APA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viphakone et al., 2019</xref>). Previous work demonstrated that CHTOP specifically binds to the 3â² end of transcripts and CHTOP knockdown promotes changes in APA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viphakone et al., 2019</xref>). The length of poly(A) is a driver of exosome-mediated decay, whereby abnormally long poly(A) tailsâseen in DI-containing transcriptsâincreases exosome-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bresson and Conrad, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bresson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Muniz et al., 2015</xref>). Hyperadenylation occurs through poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) dependent stimulation of poly(A) polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bresson and Conrad, 2013</xref>). In MS023-treated cells, PABPN1 was specifically enriched in the chromatin and poly(A) fraction (p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, loss of CHTOP Rme2a may promote hyperadenylation and consequent exosomal degradation of DI-containing transcripts. Future studies will probe the role of the exosome in PRMT-regulated protection or decay of DI.</p><p>As PRMTs have thousands of diverse substratesâmany of which are involved in RNA homeostasisâthe effect of PRMTs on splicing integrity is likely to be multifactorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guccione and Richard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lorton and Shechter, 2019</xref>). Here, we highlighted both snRNPs and CHTOP as key mediators of PRMT-regulated DI. However, given the importance of both CHTOP and snRNPs in global RNA processing, why only a subset of alternative splicing events and transcripts are affected by their perturbation remains to be determined. Importantly, there are likely many other factors involved in regulating PRMT-dependent alternative splicing. Future work will be needed to characterize the methylarginine dependent mechanisms of post-transcriptional RNA processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Prior to mass spectrometry analysis, samples were desalted using a 96-well plate filter (Orochem) packed with 1 mg of Oasis HLB C-18 resin (Waters). Briefly, the samples were resuspended in 100 Âµl of 0.1% TFA and loaded onto the HLB resin, which was previously equilibrated using 100 Âµl of the same buffer. After washing with 100 Âµl of 0.1% TFA, the samples were eluted with a buffer containing 70 Âµl of 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA and then dried in a vacuum centrifuge. For LC-MS/MS acquisition, samples were resuspended in 10 Âµl of 0.1% TFA and loaded onto a Dionex RSLC Ultimate 300 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), coupled online with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chromatographic separation was performed with a two-column system, consisting of a C-18 trap cartridge (300 Âµm ID, 5 mm length) and a picofrit analytical column (75 Âµm ID, 25 cm length) packed in-house with reversed-phase Repro-Sil Pur C18-AQ 3 Âµm resin. Peptides were separated using a 60-min gradient from 4% to 30% buffer B (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid, buffer B: 80% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.

Cells were then centrifuged at 10,000Ã<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C and the supernatant was kept as the cytosolic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed once with hypotonic buffer using a wide-orifice tip and then resuspended in NLB (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 at 4Â°C, 0.1% NP-40, 400 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT supplemented with protease inhibitor, and 40 U/mL RNaseOUT) followed by rotation for 30 min at 4Â°C. The sample was then centrifuged at 10,000Ã<italic>g</italic> for 10 min and the supernatant was kept as the nucleoplasm, while the remaining material was washed once with NLB and kept as the chromatin fraction. RNA from each fraction was isolated using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RT-qPCR was performed as above. For western analysis, 10% of each fraction was set aside and diluted to 1Ã with Laemmli buffer. To isolate the chromaitn fraction for western analysis, after resuspension of nuclei in NLB, 10% was aliquoted into a low-adhesion microcentrifuge tube. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was saved as the nucleoplasm. The chromatin fraction was subsequently washed once with NLB and then resuspended again in NLB equivalent to the original volume and sheared with sonication. This was followed by addition of Laemmli buffer to 1Ã and western blotting with H3 (Abcam, ab1791), GAPDH (Abcam, ab9484), U1-70k (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-390988), LaminB2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA1-06104), CHTOP (LSBio, LS-B11259-50), Rme2a (CST, 13522), SNRPB (ProteinTech, 16807-1-AP), SNRPD3 (Abcam, ab157118), and Rme2s (CST, 13222) antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>FLAG co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>A549 cells were transduced with Sm expression constructs as above. Cells were harvested using trypsin (Corning), washed once with 4Â°C PBS, and then resuspended in NP-40 Lysis Buffer (0.5% NP-40, 50 mM Tris pH 8 at 4Â°C, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with 40 U/ml RNaseOUT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min followed by sonication for 5 s at 20% amplitude with a probe-tip sonicator using a 1/8 inch tip. Lysates were then spun at 10,000Ã<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C. Supernatants were transferred to new low-adhesion RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes and pre-cleared for 30 min with Protein G agarose (Millipore-Sigma) equilibrated in lysis buffer. The pre-cleared supernatants were again transferred to new low-adhesion RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes and normalized to the same protein concentration using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Primary antibody FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804; 5 Î¼g), SNRPB (ProteinTech, 16807-1-AP; 5 Î¼g), or control IgG (Abcam, ab46540; 5 Î¼g) was added and incubated overnight at 4Â°C with gentle rotation. The next morning, Protein G agarose was equilibrated in lysis buffer and added to the lysates at 4Â°C with gentle rotation for 2 hr. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 300 mM NaCl followed by resuspension in either 1Ã Laemmli buffer for western blotting or TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for northern blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Northern blotting</title><p>RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and coprecipitated with GlycoBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RNA pellet was resuspended in sample buffer (6.8 M Urea in TBE with 10% glycerol and 0.25% Bromophenol Blue/Xylene Cyanide), heated at 90Â°C for 3 min, followed by loading onto an 8% Urea Gel (National Diagnostics) that was pre-run for 45 min at 45 W. The gel was run for 1 hr at 45 W in 1Ã TBE (100 mM Tris, 100 mM Boric acid, and 0.2 mM EDTA) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose in 0.5Ã TBE at 30 mA for 4 hr at 4Â°C. Following transfer, RNA was crosslinked to the membrane at 120,000 Î¼J/cm<sup>2</sup> (UV Stratalinker 1800). 5â² end labeling of snRNA probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) was performed using ATP [<sup>32</sup>P] (PerkinElmer) with T4 PNK reaction (NEB). Unincorporated ATP [<sup>32</sup>P] was removed using a Microspin G-25 column (Cytiva). Post-transfer hybridization was performed at 37Â°C in a hybridization oven overnight with gentle agitation in hybridization buffer containing 100 mM NaHPO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.2, 750 mM NaCl, 1Ã Denhardtâs Solution (0.02% BSA, 0.02% Ficoll 400, and 0.02% Polyvinylpyrrolidone), 1% Herring sperm DNA, and 7% SDS. The next morning, the hybridization solution was carefully discarded according to institutional protocol and the membrane was washed twice with wash buffer (40 mM NaHPO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.2, 2% SDS, 1 mM EDTA). The wash buffer was also discarded according to institutional guidelines. The membrane was left to expose on a Phosphoimager screen (Cytiva) and imaged at 633 nm using a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Indirect immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells were seeded on coverslips (Corning) and either transduced with Sm proteins (as above) or allowed to grow in the presence of 0.01% DMSO, 1 ÂµM GSK591 (Cayman), or 1 ÂµM MS023 (Cayman) for 2 days. Cells were then washed with 37Â°C PBS (Hyclone) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 20â25Â°C for 10 min followed by washing with 4Â°C PBS. Residual aldehyde was quenched with 0.1 M glycine in 20â25Â°C PBS for 15 min. Permeabilization was performed using 0.1% Triton X-100 at 20â25Â°C with gentle rotation for 30 min. Cover slips were then washed with PBS and blocked for one hour using 0.1% Fish Skin Gelatin in PBS. Primary antibody for FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804; 1:50) or SNRPB (ProteinTech 16807-1-AP; 1:125) was added to the cover slip and incubated overnight at 4Â°C in blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody (Goat anti-Rabbit Dylight 488, Thermo Fisher Scientific 35552 or Goat anti-Mouse Alexa Fluor 555, Thermo Fisher Scientific A28180; 1:1000) with gentle rotation while protected from light for 1 hr at 20â25Â°C followed by PBS wash and mounting with DAPI prolong gold anti-fade (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Imaging was performed with an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope with a 60Ã objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All western blots were performed independently at least twice. RT-qPCR was performed at least three times with independent biological replicates. Statistical analyses were performed using either Prism software (version 8.3.1, GraphPad) or R (version 4.0.2). To compare general distributions, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. To compare median distribution changes, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. To account for differences in sample size between global and RI distributions, random sampling from the global population equivalent to the number of RI within the tested condition was performed. This process was repeated 1000 times after which the median p-value was reported. To compare means where only two groups exist, independent t-test was performed. To compare means where two categorical variables exist, two-way ANOVA with Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test was performed. GeneOverlap with Fisherâs exact test was used to determine ORs of RI overlap between different RNA-seq data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shen, 2020</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were excited about the potential insight from this study, but agreed on several additional experiments that are necessary to support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) First, the effectiveness and specificity of the chemical PRMT inhibitors needs to be confirmed by western blot or mass spectrometry of known specific targets</p><p>2) Secondly, it was agreed that the use of transcriptional inhibition to suggest post-transcriptional regulation is problematic in that transcriptional inhibition induces a cellular stress response. In order to make the important conclusion about post-transcriptional regulation of splicing the authors should sequence (or assess the splicing of a representative set of candidate genes) RNA from chromatin, soluble nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions. Such an analysis will also provide information on the regulation of splicing vs. export.</p><p>3) Regarding the conclusions about the functional impact of methylation of Sm proteins the authors should determine if the mutant proteins are incorporated into snRNPs and/or if there is a general impact on snRNP levels (reviewer 1 point 3) and also investigate the nucleo/cytoplasmic distribution of SmB to determine if methylation state regulates localization (reviewer 2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Show deltaPSI in Figure 1e not log(PRMT/DMSO) to be consistent and to clearly indicate the differences seen.</p><p>2) I don't understand the rationale of the statement &quot;a slower splicing rate should increase RI&quot; (line 188). Isn't it possible that a slower rate increases fidelity and thus increases intron removal at steady state, whereas rapid splicing might &quot;miss&quot; some introns? Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not sure it is fair to conclude that splicing rate leads to the conclusion that regulation by type I PRMTs is post-transcriptional.</p><p>3) In the Sm mutational experiments, are the R-A mutants incorporated into snRNPs? That is, is the impact due indirectly to a decreased number of snRNPs or a direct effect on the activity of the snRNPs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1: The inverse splicing of many RIs in response to the different inhibitors is evident in 1c, but these numbers add up to less than half of the introns affected by MS023 shown in f and g. If you measure these exons as a population (rather than comparing them one-for one) in the GSK591 treatment vs. the MS023 treatment, does the distribution move significantly in the opposite direction? The question is whether this subset is responding in the same inverse manner but is below significance threshold, or whether these may represent some indirectly affected second group.</p><p>Figure 2: This figure is difficult to follow, although along with Figure 3 makes the important observation that these effects are most likely post-transcriptional, given that the expected result for co-transcriptional effects would be the opposite of what is seen with MS023 treatment. Specifically, 2 c and d and 3 e are the critical pieces of data. Rearranging the order of the figure panels and potentially moving the more trivial results into supplemental might help clarify the presentation.</p><p>The measurement of splicing rates and the here is straightforward and directly determined by the experimental data. I'm less convinced that the PSI simulation in panel b is not a circular process, and more direct experimental data is required to make the argument that alternative splicing ratios are so universally and profoundly affected by elongation rates.</p><p>The fact that the data in panels g and h are contradictory to the elongation rate model of splicing (since splicing rates should be determined by the overall time to transcribe, which is significantly faster here, even though measured elongation and splicing rates are lower, in both treatments) supports the conclusion that the differential effects of PRMTi occurs post-transcriptionally. The current presentation of the data in the text, especially the concluding sentence (line 211 pg. 11) &quot;Taken together, these results support the conclusion that RI in GSK591- and MS023-treated cells share unique characteristics that increase their probability of post-transcriptional processing&quot; should more explicitly state that the unique characteristics referred to are that they don't behave according to the model-as written, the reader spends a lot of time trying to figure out how these seemingly contradictory data support the conclusion.</p><p>Figure 3: This is a difficult experiment, but really pins down the post-transcriptional effect on intron abundance.</p><p>Figure 4: It would be potentially very informative to see the soluble (nucleoplasmic) and cytoplasmic fractions of these blots-is there a pool of methylated SNRPB in steady-state that moves to the chromatin fraction upon demethylation (in other words, is the methylation state likely controlling the localization of the protein). The same fractionation on the arginine substitution mutants would further address the question.</p><p>Figure 7: The only part of the model that is not directly supported by the data here is the inhibition of RNA export and the promotion of post-transcriptional splicing via PRMT1 inhibition. If the observation were of spliced mRNA remaining nuclear in the presence of PRMT1 inhibition, that pathway could be inferred. However, in the absence of export, even fully-spliced mRNA might be turned over quickly. Alternatively, PRMT1 inhibition could result in a failure to protect DI-containing transcripts, which are then turned over in the nucleus. Dissecting this part of the pathway will likely require further experiments involving nuclear exosome inactivation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have several concerns that I feel need to be addressed before settling on these interpretations, including details of particular protein activities invoked, e.g. by CHTOP, where the experimental procedures do not necessarily match the question posed and/or the conclusions drawn.</p><p>1. The manuscript is really poorly written and hard to understand. The language is unnecessarily complicated and involves a lot of double negatives that seem unnecessary. For example, lines 15-18 in the abstract are literally impossible to understand. On line 22 &quot;Conversely&quot; is not understandable, because the results do recapitulate the splicing changes seen (as do the results in the previous sentence); &quot;similarly&quot; or &quot;in addition&quot; might be appropriate. This type of confusing language choice is pervasive.</p><p>2. The use of the term PRMTi obscures clarity about the specific experiments, which are done mostly with chemical inhibitors. In fact, the sentence &quot;We also examine which factors are responsible for PRMTi-mediated splicing consequences&quot; (lines 75-76) suggests PRMTi is a normal physiological pathway, which it is not. I strongly suggest the authors remove PRMTi as a term used in the paper. A mostly supplemental section uses a CRISPR interference strategy taken for validation, which was less robust that chemical inhibitor treatments. The authors must investigate the effects of chemical inhibition and CRISPR interference methods on dimethylarginine levels in order to correctly draw their conclusions! Other labs have reported only modest effects on sDMA and aDMA after even longer incubations.</p><p>Related to the above issue of language, the statement on lines 301-2 &quot;â¦. this suggested that SNRPB may also be involved in the regulation of GSK591-mediated RI.&quot; This is so confusing for the reader. Its sounds like SNRPB is an alternative splicing factor involved in regulating something that is not physiological. What does this sentence mean?</p><p>3. GSK591 inhibits PRMTs 5 and 9. It is stated on line 90 that &quot;PRMT5 is the primary Type II methyltransferase (Yang et al., 2015)&quot;, and Type II is dropped from discussion for the remainder of the manuscript. For example, the figure title for Figure 1 is &quot;Type I PRMTs and PRMT5 inversely regulate intron retention&quot;. Note that Yang et al. show that PRMT9 methylates SAP145 (SF3B2) and that knockdown affects splicing; SAP145 is a protein component of the U2 snRNP that is required for A complex formation. Therefore, ignoring PRMT9 is not justifiable. The authors should refer to Type II PRMTs throughout the text and in the title of the paper. As it stands, the title is not justified by the data.</p><p>4. Post-transcriptional splicing is investigated by inhibiting transcription in Figure 3. It is becoming increasingly clear that wholesale chemical inhibition of transcription or splicing can lead to a generalized stress response that may not reflect the &quot;normal&quot; unstressed situation. Would it not be possible to conduct their experiment in nucleoplasm versus chromatin, as was done by others and analyzed in Figure 6? This is especially frustrating, given the authors do do the fractionation in the context of figure 4.</p><p>5. In figure 4, the authors identify a post-translational mRNA interactome by isolating polyA+ RNA from chromatin. Overall, this is a really great undertaking with potentially high impact. However, few of the dots are connected for us in the context of this experiment. The rationale is that previous studies suggest retention of transcripts on chromatin. The interpretation of this figure is that PRMT inhibitors shift proteins aberrantly in and out of the chromatin-proximal polyA+ pool. To make this interpretation, it would be necessary to analyze all of the polyA+ interacting proteins in nucleoplasm and compare them with the pool of interactors in the chromatin fraction. Otherwise, other less direct interpretations could come into play. It is unclear how specific the polyA+ RNA isolated in this experiment is; how can we distinguish between background binding and polyA+ RNA specifically retained on chromatin due to continued processing? It would be great if the authors undertook some orthogonal experiments, e.g. through imaging, to characterize the localization patterns of snRNPs and CHTOP relative to one another and to chromatin/nascent transcripts in the presence and absence of the inhibitors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72867.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) First, the effectiveness and specificity of the chemical PRMT inhibitors needs to be confirmed by western blot or mass spectrometry of known specific targets</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that validating the effectiveness and specificity of the chemical PRMT inhibitors is crucial. We recently published an extensive mass spectrometry analysis of PRMT inhibition using the same inhibitors and the same A549 cells used in this study (Maron et al., iScience 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102971). We now clearly cite this work in the current paper to validate the use of the drugs, including on our main candidate proteins SNRPB/SmB and CHTOP. We also added new experiments comparing drug treatment to the PRMT knockdowns (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1). Finally, these PRMT inhibitors have been widely used and validated in many papers, which we now reference in the main text. Overall, we have strong support for the use of these inhibitors in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Secondly, it was agreed that the use of transcriptional inhibition to suggest post-transcriptional regulation is problematic in that transcriptional inhibition induces a cellular stress response. In order to make the important conclusion about post-transcriptional regulation of splicing the authors should sequence (or assess the splicing of a representative set of candidate genes) RNA from chromatin, soluble nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions. Such an analysis will also provide information on the regulation of splicing vs. export.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this critique in the revised Figure 6. In these new experiments, we performed the requested experiment by testing four introns (including a new representative RI in HNRNPH1) after fractionation into cytoplasmic, soluble nuclear, and chromatin fractions, with and without prior treatment with actinomycin D. As the corresponding gain or loss of intron retention is only found in the nuclear/chromatin fractions, the new data support our conclusion. Due to cost and time constraints (3 drugs in 3 fractions, with and without actinomycin D in triplicate is 54 new samples, making it currently cost and time prohibitive), we did not sequence these experiments. Our probed introns are representative and consistent throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the cellular stress response, there is no simple way to probe nascent and post-transcriptional consequences without the use of a transcriptional inhibitor like actinomycin D or a labeled ribonucleotide (which could also result in a stress response). It is also unclear from the literature how to mechanistically or conceptually separate stress response from specifically regulated consequences. As this is a broad subject outside the scope of the current manuscript, future studies are required to disentangle a general stress response from PRMT-mediated consequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding the conclusions about the functional impact of methylation of Sm proteins the authors should determine if the mutant proteins are incorporated into snRNPs and/or if there is a general impact on snRNP levels (reviewer 1 point 3) and also investigate the nucleo/cytoplasmic distribution of SmB to determine if methylation state regulates localization (reviewer 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for prompting us to strengthen the data in these studies. To test the functional role of methylarginine in Sm protein / snRNP assembly we added the following experiments to the manuscript:</p><p>1) We expressed Sm WT, RA, RK mutants and FLAG IPâd followed by western blotting for U1-70k, SMN, FLAG, and Rme2s;</p><p>2) In the FLAG IPâd material, we also northern blotted for U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNA and compared this to SmB IPâd snRNA;</p><p>3) We treated cells with the PRMT inhibitors and IPâd SmB followed by northern blotting for U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNA;</p><p>4) We expressed Sm WT, RA, RK mutants and performed indirect immunofluorescence for FLAG and SmB;</p><p>5) We performed indirect immunofluorescence for SmB in PRMT inhibited cells;</p><p>6) We western blotted for SmB and SmD3 across cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, and chromatin fractions following PRMT inhibition.</p><p>Together, these experiments demonstrate that despite having no detectable Rme2s on the mutant Sm proteins, as well as reduced Rme2s with the Type II inhibitor, the Sm-mutant and PRMT-inhibited cells all have appropriate snRNP assembly and nuclear import. The western blot for SmB and SmD3 across cellular fractions demonstrated a largely nucleoplasmic localization of both proteins in all tested conditions that increased following Type II PRMT inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Show deltaPSI in Figure 1e not log(PRMT/DMSO) to be consistent and to clearly indicate the differences seen.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that ÎPSI is a valuable metric for transcriptome-wide studies. However, we argue that the log2 representation is informative and the standard approach in this context of analysis of specific introns. log2 transformations are generally expected to be normally distributed and therefore allow us to use a t-test. Therefore, for the RT-qPCR analyses we maintained the use of log2 transformations and for RNA seq we used ÎPSI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I don't understand the rationale of the statement &quot;a slower splicing rate should increase RI&quot; (line 188). Isn't it possible that a slower rate increases fidelity and thus increases intron removal at steady state, whereas rapid splicing might &quot;miss&quot; some introns? Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not sure it is fair to conclude that splicing rate leads to the conclusion that regulation by type I PRMTs is post-transcriptional.</p></disp-quote><p>The primary indication that these introns are regulated post-transcriptionally is that the splicing rate is not inversely changed with PRMT inhibitors despite the changes seen in the poly(A) RNA. We have edited that paragraph to read:</p><p>ââ¦As we initially hypothesized that a slower splicing rate should increase RI, this result was surprisingly inconsistent with the PRMT-inhibited changes seen in poly(A) RNA (Figure 1b). These observations therefore suggested that changes in intron retention following PRMT inhibition were not entirely due to co-transcriptional splicing.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the Sm mutational experiments, are the R-A mutants incorporated into snRNPs? That is, is the impact due indirectly to a decreased number of snRNPs or a direct effect on the activity of the snRNPs?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments targeting the FLAG epitope located at the N-terminus of the Sm expression construct. Indeed, we enriched SMN and U1-70k, as seen by western blot. We also performed a northern blot for the major snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, U6) and detected all of them. We also performed a SNRPB/SmB IP followed by northern blotting for the major snRNAs to detect both endogenous and exogenous Sm protein assembly into snRNPs. We similarly observed intact snRNP assembly. We performed this experiment with the PRMT inhibitors and saw unperturbed snRNP assembly. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that exogenous Sm proteins are imported into the nucleus. Therefore, we now conclude in the manuscript text that snRNP assembly is unaffected by PRMT inhibition. Importantly, these results are consistent with prior literature indicating that deletion of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PRMT5 orthologue does not affect snRNP assembly (1) and that deletion of the Sm tails also does not perturb their transfer onto the SMN complex (2).</p><p>1.

Furthermore, we analyzed the splicing rate, time to transcribe, and probability of splicing prior to cleavage for the RI present in GSK591 and MS023 in the DMSO-treated cells as well (now included in Figure 2). This analysis revealed the same characteristics as seen with GSK591 or MS023 treatment: a slower splicing rate, faster time to transcribe, and higher probability of cleavage prior to splicing.

Note that Yang et al. show that PRMT9 methylates SAP145 (SF3B2) and that knockdown affects splicing; SAP145 is a protein component of the U2 snRNP that is required for A complex formation. Therefore, ignoring PRMT9 is not justifiable. The authors should refer to Type II PRMTs throughout the text and in the title of the paper. As it stands, the title is not justified by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have retitled the manuscript and included Type II (as opposed to PRMT5) in the text. We are, however, unaware of any published evidence that GSK591 inhibits PRMT9. All publications and reviews describing GSK591 only document its inhibition of PRMT5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Post-transcriptional splicing is investigated by inhibiting transcription in Figure 3. It is becoming increasingly clear that wholesale chemical inhibition of transcription or splicing can lead to a generalized stress response that may not reflect the &quot;normal&quot; unstressed situation. Would it not be possible to conduct their experiment in nucleoplasm versus chromatin, as was done by others and analyzed in Figure 6? This is especially frustrating, given the authors do do the fractionation in the context of figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we performed cellular fractionation in the presence of the PRMT inhibitors with and without actinomycin D treatment. This experiment demonstrated that the intron decay for our candidate introns is localized to the nucleoplasmic and chromatin fractionsâconsistent with nuclear detention (new Figure 6e). We also tried alternative approaches using 5-ethynyl uridine labeling of nascent RNA; however, these experiments had large technical hurdles. We hope to optimize and implement such approaches for future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In figure 4, the authors identify a post-translational mRNA interactome by isolating polyA+ RNA from chromatin. Overall, this is a really great undertaking with potentially high impact. However, few of the dots are connected for us in the context of this experiment. The rationale is that previous studies suggest retention of transcripts on chromatin. The interpretation of this figure is that PRMT inhibitors shift proteins aberrantly in and out of the chromatin-proximal polyA+ pool. To make this interpretation, it would be necessary to analyze all of the polyA+ interacting proteins in nucleoplasm and compare them with the pool of interactors in the chromatin fraction. Otherwise, other less direct interpretations could come into play. It is unclear how specific the polyA+ RNA isolated in this experiment is; how can we distinguish between background binding and polyA+ RNA specifically retained on chromatin due to continued processing? It would be great if the authors undertook some orthogonal experiments, e.g. through imaging, to characterize the localization patterns of snRNPs and CHTOP relative to one another and to chromatin/nascent transcripts in the presence and absence of the inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize the reviewerâs interest in our important experiment and that understanding how arginine methylation regulates the distribution of proteins between the nucleoplasm and chromatin fractions is important. We addressed this critique by probing the cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, and chromatin fractions by western blotting (shown in new Figure 6c). We and others hope to address this with higher resolution in our future work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
