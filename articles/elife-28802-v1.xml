Over the past several decades we have seen health warnings issued on a variety of environmental exposures, from cigarettes to tanning beds, and with good reason because they cause mutations. For multicellular organisms like humans, these mutations are strongly associated with cancer. But in bacteria, this is not true. In fact, the rate at which mutations occur sometimes increases to help bacteria cope with stressful environments.</p><p>Unlike bacteria, humans are eukaryotes – the name given to organisms whose cells contain different compartments separated by membranes, such as the nucleus of the cell. For years, we have assumed that eukaryotic microbes, like fungi and parasites, act more like humans than like bacteria because work in budding yeast (another eukaryote) has suggested this to be the case. However, recent work in disease-causing fungi has shown that, much like bacteria, elevated mutation rates may help them to respond to stress. This could also enable fungi to become resistant to drugs used to treat fungal infections.</p><p><italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic> is a fungus that causes human diseases including meningoencephalitis and a lung infection called pulmonary cryptococcosis. An ongoing outbreak of the fungus began in the Pacific Northwest of Canada in the late 1990s and emerged in the United States in 2006/2007. Among isolates closely related to those fungi causing the outbreak, three were found that appear to have a specific mutation in their DNA mismatch repair pathway, meaning that they may also experience a higher mutation rate. These strains are also less able to cause disease than others.</p><p>Billmyre et al. now demonstrate experimentally that all three isolates have a specific DNA mismatch repair defect, and show that these fungi experience elevated mutation rates, resulting in what is known as a hypermutator state. Furthermore, whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that these hypermutator strains are derived from the outbreak-causing fungi, and that their reduced ability to cause disease is likely a result of accumulating mutations and the loss of the ability to grow at the higher temperatures found in the human body.</p><p>Fungal infections are difficult to treat, in part because there are a limited number of available drugs. Elevated mutation rates will likely increase how often and how rapidly fungi develop resistance to these drugs. Understanding how commonly fungi exhibit a hypermutator state that could impact the development of drug resistance will therefore be important for treating patients with fungal infections, which account for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths annually worldwide.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</kwd><kwd>hypermutator</kwd><kwd>Cryptococcus gattii</kwd><kwd>homopolymers</kwd><kwd>phenotypic diversity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 AI39115-20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heitman</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI50113-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heitman</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Eukaryotic pathogens, like <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic>, can use elevated mutation rates to more rapidly adapt to stresses, such as drug challenges, but at the cost of lower fitness in less stressful environments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutation is the raw material of evolution. As a result, all organisms must strike a balance between allowing enough random mutations for selection to act upon, and the fact that most of these mutations are likely to be deleterious and must be purged from the population. This is particularly true for pathogenic microbes that take part in Red Queen conflicts with their hosts and require a continuous supply of mutations to remain competitive. In this case, increased pressure may exist to maintain an elevated mutation rate to increase the rate of adaptation. Increases in mutation rate may also serve to accelerate adaptation when microbes are introduced into new environments or encounter novel stresses, such as antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>Adaptive variation in mutation rate is common in bacteria. One example is the Long Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE), where defects in DNA repair emerged and the resulting hypermutator phenotype swept the population in six out of twelve <italic>E. coli</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>). Mutator alleles likely emerge frequently but are typically purged from the population because individual mutations are more likely to be deleterious than adaptive; as a result hypermutators generally produce less fit offspring than non-hypermutators. However, occasionally a sufficiently beneficial mutation is potentiated by the presence of the hypermutator and the hypermutator allele is able to hitchhike to higher frequency within the population. This is more likely to occur in populations at local evolutionary minima, where many different large-effect adaptive mutations are possible. For example, hypermutator phenotypes are common in isolates of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> growing within the lungs of patients with Cystic Fibrosis, where environmental conditions are constantly changing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oliver et al., 2000</xref>). This changing environment causes an ongoing need to adapt, and increases the likelihood of hypermutators emerging by increasing the target size for adaptive variation. However, once beneficial mutations have fixed, and organisms have adapted to their new environment, antimutator suppressor alleles can emerge to reduce the mutation rate or defective mutator alleles can even be replaced by functional alleles through horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wielgoss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denamur et al., 2000</xref>). This balance is likely critical to evolution in microbes as they face diverse stresses and environmental changes, and as a result over 1% of natural bacterial isolates display hypermutator phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeClerc et al., 1996</xref>). Even more extreme cases also exist, like in <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>M. genitalium</italic>, where the mismatch repair machinery has been completely lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Himmelreich et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In fact, many mutator phenotypes are the result of defects in mismatch repair, commonly referred to as MMR. In bacteria, MMR requires the MutHLS system, where MutS binds to mismatches and recruits MutL, which subsequently activates MutH to excise the mispair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Su and Modrich, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Au et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grilley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 1972</xref>). In eukaryotes, both the MutS and MutL families have expanded, yielding <underline>M</underline>ut<underline>S</underline> <underline>h</underline>omolog (MSH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reenan and Kolodner, 1992</xref>) and <underline>M</underline>ut<underline>L</underline> <underline>h</underline>omolog (MLH) families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strand et al., 1993</xref>). Heterodimers of various MSH family members participate in mismatch repair, but Msh2 in particular is a core component of the majority of mismatch repair pathways in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harfe and Jinks-Robertson, 2000</xref>). As a result, defects in MMR, and <italic>MSH2</italic> mutations in particular, result in elevated rates of simple mismatches, but also dramatically elevated rates of repeat tract instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strand et al., 1993</xref>), which are associated with hereditary colon cancer in humans. MMR also plays a role in rejecting heteroduplexes of divergent sequences during both mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Datta et al., 1997</xref>) and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alani et al., 1994</xref>), meaning that loss of the complex can lower species boundaries and allow increased recombination between divergent chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alani et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rayssiguier et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to bacteria, substantially less is known about hypermutators in natural populations of eukaryotes. Evolutionary theory predicts that the presence of sex abrogates selection for hypermutator strains by eliminating genetic linkage between the mutator allele and the associated beneficial mutations it hitchhikes upon to high frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tenaillon et al., 2000</xref>). Studies of allele incompatibility within the model fungus <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have supported this traditional paradigm. Incompatible alleles of <italic>PMS1</italic> and <italic>MLH1</italic> exist within the population, such that a cross of two strains with wildtype mutation frequency can give rise to progeny with elevated mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bui et al., 2015</xref>). However, the homozygous incompatible arrangement was not found among any of the original 65 strains examined, and was only identified within one clinical isolate of 1010 global diverse yeast isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bui et al., 2017</xref>) and four clinical strains out of 93 sequenced in a separate study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Skelly et al., 2017</xref>). This frequency is far below that of the individual alleles in the population, and in each case observed suppressors had arisen to restore a wildtype mutation rate despite the incompatibility. In contrast, eukaryotic mutators can adapt and thrive in clonally expanding populations such as in human tumor environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bielas et al., 2006</xref>). Recent studies have begun to challenge this dogma in eukaryotic microorganisms as well, with over 50% of clinical <italic>C. glabrata</italic> isolates harboring loss of function mutations in <italic>MSH2,</italic> resulting in loss of mismatch repair function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Healey et al., 2016</xref>). Two groups also recently independently identified hypermutators in the fungal pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>. In the first case, long branch lengths were observed in genome sequencing of serial isolates from a recurrent infections that are correlated with nonsense mutations in <italic>MSH2</italic>, <italic>MSH5</italic>, and <italic>RAD5</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rhodes et al., 2017</xref>.In the second case, two of eleven clinical isolates exhibited elevated mutation rate that is linked to either an <italic>MSH2</italic> nonsense mutation or multiple <italic>MSH2</italic> missense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyce et al., 2017</xref>). In previous work we also identified a clade of candidate hypermutators within the Pacific Northwest <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic> outbreak that contain a coding single base deletion within the critical mismatch repair component <italic>MSH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billmyre et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic>, is a basidiomycete human fungal pathogen previously known as <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> VGII and recently elevated to species level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hagen et al., 2015</xref>), although this decision is disputed by a portion of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kwon-Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hagen et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike the other species of the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> pathogenic species complex that infect immunocompromised hosts, <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> is characterized by its ability to cause infection in otherwise healthy hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Springer et al., 2012</xref>) and by loss of the RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feretzaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Souza et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> is responsible for an ongoing outbreak in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, which began in the late 1990's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kidd et al., 2004</xref>). This outbreak was originally analyzed using Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and shown to be comprised of three clonal expansions, denoted VGIIa, VGIIb, and VGIIc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fraser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrnes et al., 2010</xref>). These three subtypes differ in terms of virulence and total number of cases, with VGIIa responsible for the majority of infections. More recently, whole genome sequencing studies of these subpopulations showed that the clonal subtypes appeared to have different proximal geographic origins, and most interestingly, that VGIIa has three very closely related isolates, here referred to as VGIIa-like, that were considerably less virulent and differed in isolation location or date from the outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billmyre et al., 2014</xref>). We identified a candidate potential large effect mutation shared by these three diminished virulence isolates that resulted in a predicted non-functional Msh2. Here we show that these VGIIa-like isolates exhibit a <italic>bona fide</italic> hypermutator phenotype. Furthermore, we show that homopolymer runs are particularly unstable, and that these runs are common within the coding regions of genes in the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> genome. We predict that this results in dramatic phenotypic diversity from inactivation and possibly also activation or reactivation of genes. Finally, we show that the mutant <italic>msh2</italic> allele is not directly responsible for the decrease in virulence of the VGIIa-like isolates, nor does it appear to have directly played a role in the evolution of virulence in the VGIIa clonal outbreak. Rather, it appears to represent a parallel route of adaptation to a new environment in a successful lineage isolated from two continents over two decades and from both the environment and patient samples. This work suggests that hypermutator phenotypes are not limited to prokaryotes, but may represent a frequent avenue to evolutionary change and phenotypic diversity in eukaryotic microbes as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We previously identified a sublineage of strains highly related to the VGIIa outbreak in the Pacific Northwest denoted VGIIa-like, in part because they differed either in isolation location or time from the typical outbreak isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billmyre et al., 2014</xref>). The VGIIa-like sublineage is composed of three isolates: NIH444, a clinical isolate from Seattle in 1975, well before the start of the outbreak; ICB107, a clinical isolate from Brazil in 1981; and CBS7750, an environmental isolate from California in 1990. All three isolates are characterized by diminished virulence relative to the VGIIa clonal outbreak strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fraser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrnes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagen et al., 2013</xref>).

This allowed determination of the ancestral state of the multiple alleles differentiating the VGIIa and VGIIa-like groups. We also generated a second independent genome sequence for our original NIH444 isolate (NIH444(1) and NIH444(2)), as well as an NIH444 isolate acquired from a different lab (NIH444(v)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Springer et al., 2010</xref>).

Five SNPs are noncoding while 7 of the 8 remaining SNPs were nonsynonymous mutations.

This peak is likely a function of both the decreased stability of longer runs and the low quantity of longer homopolymer runs in the genome.

However, under highly stressful conditions, such as exposure to the drugs FK506/rapamycin at 37°C, the hypermutator was highly advantageous. In multiple replicates the hypermutator rapidly acquired resistance and overtook the entire co-culture. This suggests that mutator alleles can be advantageous when a population faces an evolutionary landscape where large effect beneficial mutations exist. In contrast, mutators are deleterious in landscapes where few large effect mutations can provide advantages.

In addition, a recent study of <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> has demonstrated that a substantial proportion of clinical isolates (&gt;50%) carry nonsynonymous mutations in the <italic>MSH2</italic> gene, some causing elevated mutation rates similar to the null phenotype and others with intermediate changes in mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Healey et al., 2016</xref>). The authors correlate the mismatch repair defects with multi-drug resistance. A second study with a different sample cohort confirmed the presence of <italic>MSH2</italic> mutations, but concluded that drug resistance was better correlated with drug exposure than with mismatch repair defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dellière et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast with the studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, here we identified a group of viable hypermutator strains resulting from a nonsense mutation in <italic>MSH2</italic>. These strains were isolated over a period of fifteen years from two different continents and include both clinical and environmental strains. Increases in mutation rate were similar, although slightly lower in magnitude, to those observed previously in the model yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> where <italic>msh2</italic> mutations increase resistance rate to Canavanine by 40 fold compared to 6.8 fold for 5-FOA here, or reversion of a 7xT run in a <italic>HOM3</italic> mutant by 662 fold compared to 120 fold for 7xC in <italic>FRR1</italic> here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marsischky et al., 1996</xref>). The mutation spectrum was also similar, as homopolymer run indels were responsible almost exclusively for mutations within run-containing genes in <italic>msh2</italic> mutants, but not in wildtype strains as previously reported in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tran et al., 1997</xref>). The <italic>msh2</italic> del131 allele carried by these strains appears to result in a complete loss of function, rather than simply reducing the efficiency of mismatch repair. This is distinct from the mutators identified in <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, and suggests that the VGIIa-like lineage is a successful and relatively long-lived hypermutator lineage, capable of both disseminating over a large area and persisting in the environment. <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic> may also represent an intermediate between mutator-rich <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and mutator-poor <italic>S. cerevisiae. C. deuterogatttii</italic> is not an obligate pathogen and can cycle between an environmental lifestyle and an infectious lifestyle as an ‘accidental pathogen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Springer et al., 2012</xref>). Elevated mutation rates may be selected for by Red Queen interactions with a host, meaning that pathogens like <italic>C. glabrata</italic> that grow only in association with their hosts would experience higher mutation rates than facultative pathogens like <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic>, or effectively nonpathogenic yeasts like <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> In fact, a putative recurrent infection of <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> was recently demonstrated to contain nonsense mutations in <italic>MSH2</italic>, <italic>MSH5</italic>, and <italic>RAD5,</italic> predicted to result in a mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rhodes et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition, a second recent study also identified two other hypermutator strains from clinical isolates of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyce et al., 2017</xref>). Boyce <italic>et al</italic>. went on to examine changes in mutation rate and spectrum with similar results to those presented here, although with a much larger induction of mutation rate in <italic>URA5</italic> than reported here (around 200 fold vs 6.8 fold). This could reflect differences between DNA repair in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic>. They also observed changes in stability of homopolymer runs, similar to those described here but in a second homopolymer-containing locus. Interestingly, this study also observed loss of ability to grow at high temperatures in one of three replicates of <italic>msh2</italic> mutants in an experimental evolution assay, like that observed here in the VGIIa-like hypermutator clade. Notable as well is that hypermutators in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> have thus far been observed only in clinical isolates, even in studies that included matched environmental sample populations like Boyce et al. This provides further evidence that microbial lifestyle may be affecting the frequency of mutator strains, with pathogens being more likely to evolve elevated mutation rate, perhaps in response to drug or host challenges.</p><p>An alternate hypothesis is that ploidy may play a role in the success of mutator strains. <italic>C. deuterogattii, C. neoformans,</italic> and <italic>C. glabrata</italic> exist primarily as haploids in nature, while <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is predominantly a diploid. Diploid strains are buffered from the effects of loss of function mutations like those observed in homopolymer runs in this study, which may reduce the supply of large effect beneficial mutations for mutator alleles to hitchhike upon in diploids. However, past work in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> suggests that diploids adapt more quickly in <italic>msh2</italic> mutant backgrounds, rather than less, suggesting that ploidy may play the opposite role, at least in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Evolutionary theory predicts that the admixture provided by sex in a population nullifies the ability of mutator alleles to hitchhike to high frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tenaillon et al., 2000</xref>). Unlike obligately sexual animals, or asexual bacteria, fungi can reproduce both sexually and asexually, with the frequency of sex varying substantially between different species. We previously described <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> as a species characterized by long periods of mitotic clonal expansion and only intermittent sexual crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billmyre et al., 2014</xref>). A contibuting factor is likely the highly biased mating type distribution in <italic>C. deuterogattii,</italic> as the vast majority of <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> isolates are <italic>MAT</italic>α, with only a handful of <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolates described globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrnes et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Cryptococcus deneoformans,</italic> which shares a similar biased mating type distribution, this has resulted in the development of a unisexual α-α sexual cycle, dispensing with the obligate need for a <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2005</xref>). This unisexual cycle can result in both de novo variation, but also recombination and admixture at similar levels to that observed in typical bisexual crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). However, no laboratory unisexual cycle has been observed in <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> to this point. Consequently, as strains are introduced to new locales, they may need to survive and adapt via mitotic growth without sexual crosses for long periods of time. This could elevate linkage between mutator alleles and the beneficial mutations they elicit, but also eliminate the ability to separate those beneficial mutations from additional deleterious alleles.</p><p>We also showed that hypermutators can allow both inactivating mutations in genes, and reversion of those mutations to the wildtype. Mismatch repair-defective mutator strains are characterized by particularly high rates of slippage within homopolymer runs, and these occur at run lengths that are common within fungal genomes. This may indicate that eukaryotes may harbor contingency loci featuring homopolymer runs, like those observed in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moxon et al., 2006</xref>). Fungal contingency loci could be critical for responses to antifungal agents, both in the environment and the clinical setting. In addition, variation could be important in host-pathogen interactions as well. For example, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, tandem repeats are enriched within cell surface genes, which could enable alteration of antigenic diversity during pathogenic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verstrepen et al., 2005</xref>). While these loci are unstable even in wildtype populations, defects in the MMR pathway could enhance this instability and result in increased diversity. In <italic>C. neoformans,</italic> a mutator phenotype has been previously described in a lab-passaged strain notable for frequent mutations in the RAM pathway, which enables a dimorphic transition between pseudohyphal and yeast phase growth, although the molecular basis of the elevated mutation rate is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Magditch et al., 2012</xref>). This transition is highly important for survival in the face of environmental threats such as amoeba, but compromises pathways responsible for high temperature growth, suggesting that oscillation between RAM+ and RAM- states may allow populations to survive as conditions change.</p><p>In addition, we provided evidence that the VGIIa-like lineage was not a subvirulent progenitor of the Pacific Northwest outbreak, in contrast with previous hypotheses from two groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billmyre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engelthaler et al., 2014</xref>). Rather, the VGIIa-like lineage is derived and may represent either an alternative pathway of adaptation or potentially an accelerated stage of the evolutionary trajectory of the outbreak. The ability to grow at high temperatures is a critical component of virulence for fungal pathogens. However, many pathogenic fungi are thought to be ‘accidental’ pathogens where virulence factors are selected for by other environmental factors. In this model, thermotolerance could be selected by high ambient temperatures in a non-host environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casadevall et al., 2003</xref>). Moving from a tropical/sub-tropical environment in South America to the more temperate climate of the Pacific Northwest may relieve this high temperature selection. Consequently, the loss of ability to grow under thermal stress observed in the VGIIa-like strains may be adaptive for the majority of their growth conditions in the environment, but also render them relatively avirulent in mammals. This could suggest that as the VGIIa outbreak strains continue to adapt to the Pacific Northwest, they will gradually lose virulence potential, like the VGIIa-like lineage, making the outbreak self-limiting over time. Alternatively, the defects could simply reflect a decrease in viability caused by a long period of growth with an elevated mutation rate, resulting in mutational meltdown. The most severe temperature defect was observed in ICB107, a strain isolated from a patient in Brazil and also the strain with the largest number of mutations separating it from the VGIIa group, which would support the second hypothesis. These strains may have been able to persist in the Pacific Northwest in spite of the high mutation load because of a bottleneck effect during their introduction.</p><p>Our original hypothesis was that the common variants that differentiated the VGIIa group from the progenitor of the VGIIa-like mutator group would explain the decline in virulence observed in the VGIIa-like strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billmyre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrnes et al., 2010</xref>). However, the <italic>msh2</italic> mutation, the only predicted large effect mutation, has no obvious immediate effect on virulence in a murine inhalation model. This is interesting, at least in part, because <italic>msh2</italic> mutants of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> were previously reported to exhibit a modest growth advantage in mouse lungs in pooled signature tagged mutant experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that the mutator strains are better able to adapt to growth in the mouse lung, but not in a way that correlates directly with virulence in a dissemination and survival model of virulence. Boyce et al. obtained similar results in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to those reported here, with <italic>msh2</italic>Δ and <italic>mlh1</italic>Δ mutants appearing neutral in a murine infection model, and <italic>pms1</italic>Δ mutants even relatively less virulent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyce et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, our results suggest that loss of virulence in the VGIIa-like strains may be a consequence of independent private mutations, i.e. each VGIIa-like strain is avirulent for its own reason. In previous work, CBS7750 and ICB107 have the most substantial virulence defects, while NIH444 has a more modest defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrnes et al., 2010</xref>). This is congruent with the fact that NIH444 has the shortest divergence from the VGIIa clonal group, while CBS7750 and ICB107 have much longer branches, and is also congruent with the high temperature growth defects we observed.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrated that mutation spectrum analysis could be utilized within a phylogeny to infer the presence of a hypermutator allele through an increase in the proportion of indels within homopolymer runs. In bacteria, the hypermutator state is often transient and wildtype mismatch repair is often restored via horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denamur et al., 2000</xref>). This paradigm could also operate in fungi, with sexual recombination replacing direct DNA transfer. However, these events are difficult to detect if the hypermutator allele is purged from the population by selection after it is separated from its linked beneficial allele. The widespread availability of whole genome sequencing could now allow changes in mutation spectrum to be used to detect episodic hypermutation throughout entire populations of microbes. We suspect that these episodes are common throughout the evolution of eukaryotic microbes and may be even more common among pathogenic microbes, reflecting their natural history as well as the result of Red Queen host-pathogen conflicts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.

The work focuses on the characterization of the msh2 mutants, which they show to yield a hypermutator phenotype (i.e., increased mutation rate). This work characterizes in detail the hypermutator phenotype and its effects on sequence diversity (e.g., hypermutation results in accumulation of indels in homopolymer runs) as well as on phenotypic diversity (e.g., they showed in competition assays that the msh2 mutation conferred a selective advantage under stress, but not in rich growth conditions). In addition, they used a phylogeny of the outbreak and related isolates to argue that the hypermutator phenotype did not cause the VGIIa outbreak. Finally, they concluded that the hypermutation phenotype was likely to &quot;result in a loss of virulence over time as mutations accumulate in critical pathways.&quot;</p><p>The novel part of this work is the finding that <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic> isolates have been found in nature that bear a defective DNA mismatch repair gene and display a mutator phenotype. Population genetic theory predicts that diploid organisms that undergo sex would not maintain mutators, because of fitness costs and removal of linkage between a mutator allele and a beneficial mutation. Natural isolates of prokaryotes that are mutators have been frequently observed, but at present there appears to be only two other examples in eukaryotes (in tumor cells – Healy et al., 2016 – and, in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> – Rhodes et al., 2017 and the recent study by Boyce et al. in mBio). The authors hypothesize that mutators were identified in <italic>C. deuterogatti</italic> because this organism primarily grows as a haploid and appears to undergo long periods of clonal expansion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should incorporate in the discussion of the manuscript the recent work by Boyce and colleagues (https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00595-17) on <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>. The study is very similar in premise to the work described in this manuscript, but because some of the experiments performed in the two studies are different as well as because the two organisms studied are closely related, the two manuscripts nicely complement each other. For example, the study by Boyce et al. examines the genetic impact of the hypermutator phenotype through very well done allele-swap experiments, and details the impact of these genotypes on clinically-important phenotypes such as drug resistance and virulence. It would be great to present and discuss these experiments in the context of this work, as they strengthen the case for the existence of hypermutators in fungal, and more generally eukaryotic, pathogens.</p><p>2) The existence of environmental MSH2 hypermutators in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species was also previously (recently) shown by Rhodes et al. The authors cite this study in their Discussion – they should also mention it in the Introduction of their manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28802.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should incorporate in the discussion of the manuscript the recent work by Boyce and colleagues (https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00595-17) on Cryptococcus neoformans.

We did not discuss this manuscript in our initial submission because it was not yet published and we were unaware of the content or that it had been submitted. We agree that it is nicely complementary to our finding of hypermutators in <italic>C. deuterogattii</italic> by extending the finding of hypermutators to the sibling species of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, and as such will add to our understanding of the presence of hypermutators in fungal pathogens. We have explicitly mentioned and cited the Boyce et al. manuscript now in the revised Introduction and also introduced more substantial commentary in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The existence of environmental MSH2 hypermutators in Cryptococcus species was also previously (recently) shown by Rhodes et al.
