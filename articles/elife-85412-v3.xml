DNA genomes to the host intranuclear environment play critical roles in determining virus fate. Recent advances in the application of chromosome conformation capture-based sequencing analysis (3 C technologies) have revealed valuable aspects of the spatiotemporal interplay of viral genomes with host chromosomes. However, to elucidate the causal relationship between the subnuclear localization of viral genomes and the pathogenic outcome of an infection, manipulative tools are needed. Rapid repositioning of viral DNAs to specific subnuclear compartments amid infection is a powerful approach to synchronize and interrogate this dynamically changing process in space and time. Herein, we report an inducible CRISPR-based two-component platform that relocates extrachromosomal DNA pieces (5 kb to 170 kb) to the <bold>nu</bold>clear <bold>p</bold>eriphery <bold>in</bold> minutes (CRISPR-nuPin). Based on this strategy, investigations of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a prototypical member of the human herpesvirus family, revealed unprecedently reported insights into the early intranuclear life of the pathogen: (I) Viral genomes tethered to the nuclear periphery upon entry, compared with those freely infecting the nucleus, were wrapped around histones with increased suppressive modifications and subjected to stronger transcriptional silencing and prominent growth inhibition. (II) Relocating HSV-1 genomes at 1 hr post infection significantly promoted the transcription of viral genes, termed an ‘Escaping’ effect. (III) Early accumulation of ICP0 was a sufficient but not necessary condition for ‘Escaping’. (IV) Subnuclear localization was only critical during early infection. Importantly, the CRISPR-nuPin tactic, in principle, is applicable to many other DNA viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intranuclear positioning</kwd><kwd>HSV-1</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin packaging</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/dcas9</kwd><kwd>DNA virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFC2305400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Pei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 31870157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Pei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017610</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCYJ20180307151536743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Pei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017610</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KQTD20180411143323605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Pei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016804</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCYJ20220530145810023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Pei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An inducible two-component CRISPR-based platform that rapidly repositions HSV-1 genomes to the nuclear edge unveils intranuclear space heterogeneity for the incoming viral genomes and dynamic stages of the host-virus interplay during early infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular chromosomes are not randomly positioned in the nucleus, and the dynamic organization of intranuclear DNA in space and time plays a fundamental role in regulating the cellular transcriptome. Recent innovations in mapping and manipulative technologies have boosted scientific enthusiasm to address the cause-effect relationship between gene transcriptional regulation and its relative intranuclear locus on the four-dimensional scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schoenfelder and Fraser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marchal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The recognition of the complexity and the critical role played by higher order genomic organization in transcriptional regulation has generated immense interest in the field of virology, which holds that DNA viruses, the co-evolved parasites of host machinery, are interrelated to and/or exploit 3D genome organization at the cell level. Currently, evidence supporting this concept is mostly from descriptive experiments identifying and/or characterizing host genomic hot spots in association with viral genomes using immunofluorescence staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or, more recently, by chromosome conformation capture (3 C)-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yue et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hensel et al., 2018</xref>). Few studies have examined the causal relationship underlying intranuclear host-virus spatial correlations, partly due to a lack of appropriate probes. Herein, we took advantage of the recent advances in CRISPR-based genome re-organization tools and constructed an inducible two-component CRISPR-nuPin platform that enabled repositioning of extrachromosomal DNA pieces to the nuclear edge within minutes. Furthermore, we used the system to interrogate the early intranuclear life of HSV-1, a prototypic medium-sized DNA virus, in space and time.</p><p>HSV-1, a member of subfamily <italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</italic>, family <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>, is a double stranded DNA virus of approximately 153 kb in size that infects over 66.7% of the population of 0–49 year-olds globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">James et al., 2020</xref>). A mature, infectious HSV-1 virion consists of a lipid envelope, the tegument layer and an icosahedral capsid wrapping around a single copy of the viral genome. HSV-1 uses the strongest molecular motor known (the portal vertex) to pack its negatively charged genome into a relatively tiny space, resulting in tens of atmospheres of pressure inside the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandariz-Nuñez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McElwee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). The viral capsid docks itself to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and the internal pressure provides an essential driving force for viral genome release and transportation through the NPC in a rod-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandariz-Nuñez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandariz-Nuñez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ojala et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Newcomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shahin et al., 2006</xref>). After genome ejection into the nucleus, HSV-1 initiates an active lytic replication cycle in almost every susceptible cell line in vitro, and three sets of viral genes, termed immediate early (α), early (β) and late genes (γ<sub>1</sub>, γ<sub>2</sub>), are to be expressed in a tightly regulated chronological order. The immediate events post nuclear entry of viral genomes center around a raging competition between the urge of the virus to express its transcripts and the repressive forces from the host to silence these exogenous DNAs. Abundant evidence shows that nuclear HSV-1 genomes are immediately sensed, assembled with histones, associated with de novo-formed nuclear bodies (PML bodies), and loaded with host proteins, including repressor complexes, to restrict viral transcription and defend against infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roizman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkham et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knipe and Cliffe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Everett et al., 2004</xref>). To counteract host intrinsic immunity, HSV-1 viral tegument protein αTIF (VP16) and its associated complex are transported into the nucleus independently of the viral capsid and initiate efficient transcription of α genes, including infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Triezenberg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stern and Herr, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babb et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douville et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabral et al., 2018</xref>). ICP0 is a 775 amino acid protein, multifunctional E3 ligase and promiscuous transactivator essential for the expression of post-α genes (β and γ genes) at a low multiplicity of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hagglund and Roizman, 2004</xref>). The protein executes multiple transcription-relevant functions: the dispersal of PML bodies through proteasome-dependent degradation of PML and Sp100, inactivation of the HDAC1/CoREST/LSD/REST repressor complex, recruitment of CLOCK H3/H4 acetyltransferases to activate viral transcription, removal of heterochromatin packaging of viral genomes and reduction of overall histone association of HSV-1 DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roizman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu and Roizman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu and Roizman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe and Knipe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalamvoki and Roizman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalamvoki and Roizman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). An intriguing but blurred aspect of these elegantly executed molecular tasks is the precise sequential order of these events and their relationship with the diverse spatial localizations of the viral genomes in the host nuclei.</p><p>Herein, utilizing the CRISPR-nuPin strategy, we took a very first step addressing the complicated and heterogeneous host-virus interactions on a four-dimensional scale and revealed several intriguing aspects of the early intranuclear life of HSV-1. In summary, we report that (I) the CRISPR-nuPin strategy is a two-component platform consisting only of a dCas9-emerin fusion protein and sgRNAs, which is smaller and simpler than most of the previously reported genome repositioning techniques. (II) CRISPR-nuPin drove relocation of extrachromosomal DNA pieces up to 170 kb to the inner nuclear margin efficiently and promptly upon electroporation of sgRNAs. CRISPR-nuPin can reposition target DNAs via a single sgRNA targeting site and thus has wide application to various DNA viruses replicating in the nucleus. (III) HSV-1 genomes deposited to the nuclear edge immediately upon entry were subjected to stringent transcriptional silencing and major growth inhibition, up to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20. (IV) dislodging HSV-1 genomes from their originally occupied spatial niches to the nuclear margin at 1 hpi significantly promoted viral gene expression and virus production (“Escaping”). (V) early accumulation of ICP0 protein was a sufficient but not necessary condition in “Escaping”. Interestingly, subnuclear localization bias was only detected during the early period of infection. Shortly after nuclear entry, HSV-1 genomes are no longer sensitive to subnuclear localization changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A two-component CRISPR-nuPin platform that mediates nuclear edging of extrachromosomal DNAs within minutes</title><p>The life cycle of many DNA viruses is in the range of hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roizman and Knipe, 2001</xref>). Therefore, the probing tool to interrogate the spatial interactions between viral genomes and the host subnuclear environment needs to act quickly. To simplify the DNA repositioning system and avoid the possible time lag introduced by a second layer of regulation (e.g. the abscisic acid inducible ABI-PYL1 system used by CRISPR-GO and CRISPR-based CLOuD9 or the CIBN-CRY2 system used by CRISPR-based LADL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morgan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), we tested whether a two-component strategy, including only a subnuclear locus-anchored dcas9 and a sgRNA, was able to mediate inducible and fleet relocation of viral DNA genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To achieve nuclear periphery docking, Flag-emerin-TEV (TEV protease recognition sequence)-GFP was fused to the C-terminus of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> dCas9 (D10A&amp;H840A), resulting in a fusion protein with a predicted size of 230 kDa (dCas9-emerin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Insertion of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the N- and C-termini of dCas9 enabled nuclear importation of the majority of dCas9-emerin, while Flag-tagged emerin localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>). We then constructed a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible dCas9-emerin-expressing HEp-2 cell line (dCas9-emerin) using a lentiviral transduction system and a HEp-2 cell line expressing only dcas9 protein, serving as a control cell line (dCas9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1 fig1s1sdata2 fig1s1sdata3">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1–3</xref>).

Colocalization of the anti-Flag antibody recognized epitope with the nuclear envelope (represented by NUP98 staining) along the outer edge of the DAPI-stained nuclear area indicated that the dcas9-emerin fusion protein was properly anchored to the inner nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3 fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 3 and 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata6 fig1s1sdata7 fig1s1sdata8">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 6–8</xref>).

More than 500 spots of each sampling group were counted, and their distribution pattern, either in the nuclear margin or in the inner nuclear space, was plotted. In brief, when a FISH-stained spot was partially exposed outside of or completely exposed but still adjacent to the DAPI region after 3D reconstruction, it was categorized as a border-located spot. When a FISH-stained spot was completely immersed in the DAPI region, it was counted as an inner nuclear space localized spot. FISH spots that were not associated with the DAPI area were dismissed during counting. A 3D cross-section image showing the relative position of nuclear edge spots to the DAPI-stained area is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata11">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 11</xref>). This concept applies to all the following experiments concerning the intranuclear localization of HSV-1 viral DNAs (the exact descriptive terms used include nuclear edge, nuclear margin, nuclear periphery, in proximity to the inner nuclear membrane, etc.) in this study. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, 10–20% of BAC DNAs started to be relocated away from the nuclear interior at 10 s post sgRNA electroporation, and more than 80% of BAC DNAs were relocalized to the nuclear edge after 3 min of sgRNA electroporation, while introduction of ctrl sgRNA barely had any detectable impact.</p><p>To test the repositioning efficiency of CRISPR-nuPin on the host genomic locus, dCas9-emerin cells were electroporated with sgRNA targeting the telomere region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata6 fig1sdata7">Figure 1—source data 6 and 7</xref>). To determine the subnuclear localization of telomeres, the nuclear margin was restrained to the space between the NUP98-stained nuclear envelope and the DAPI-stained area (a 3D cross-section image showing the relative position of nuclear edge spots to NUP98- and DAPI-stained areas is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata12">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 12</xref>). At 3 hr post sgRNA induction, approximately 38% of cellular telomeres were detected bound to the nuclear edge compared to approximately 25% at time 0 hr and 21% for ctrl sgRNA. Our results indicate that the CRISPR-nuPin system is capable of repositioning of extrachromosomal DNA of up to 170 kb in size to the nuclear periphery within minutes. Note that a single dot in the 3D reconstruction images represents single or multiple plasmids or BACs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HSV-1 genomes positioned to the nuclear margin were subjected to transcriptional repression</title><p>To replicate, most DNA viruses need to eject their genetic materials into the host nuclei and initiate viral genome transcription. It is conceivable that viral genomes encounter highly heterogenic microenvironments upon entry, even within the same nucleus. In fact, approximately 25% of the HSV-1 genomes are in proximity to the inner nuclear membrane during a natural infection, and the rest penetrate further into the nuclear interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). The distance from the center of a nuclear edge-localized HSV-1 FISH spot to the outline of DAPI was within 0.9 µm (median value 0.44 µm and 0.44 µm on average), and the diameter for an HSV-1 FISH spot was 0.59 µm on average under the experimental settings in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1 fig2s1sdata2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>). We then asked if viral DNAs preferred the nuclear interior to the nuclear edge for infection. To this end, 5 sgRNAs of different repeating numbers of targeting sites within the HSV-1 genome were designed to enable relocation of HSV-1 genomes in the CRISPR-nuPin platform. Cautions were made to avoid protein coding regions of the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). All sgRNAs were able to mediate significant inhibition of HSV-1 in dCas9-emerin cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). Since sgRNA2 binds to one site at the coding region for the 8.3 kb latency-associated transcript (LAT) precursor of HSV-1, which plays assumed limited role in HSV-1 lytic replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garber et al., 1997</xref>), and another site in the terminal repeat short regions (TRs), it was used to mediate BAC and HSV-1 genome repositioning in the rest of the experiments in this study (designated HSV-1 sgRNA). To exclude the effect of nonspecific factors such as dCas9-sgRNA binding to viral genomes or sgRNA-induced innate immune responses, HEp-2 cells expressing GFP, dCas9 or dCas9-emerin were transfected with a plasmid encoding ctrl sgRNA or HSV-1 sgRNA. The cells showed no essential differences in supporting HSV-1 infection, except for those producing both the dCas9-emerin fusion protein and the HSV-1 sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). The single-cycle growth kinetics of HSV-1 were examined in dCas9-emerin cells in the presence of ctrl sgRNA or HSV-1 sgRNA. In dCas9-emerin cells expressing the HSV-1 sgRNA, viral genomes were guided to the nuclear edge compared to the ctrl sgRNA group, and tethering viral genomes to the inner nuclear membrane led to reduced virus production at all time points, including the plateau phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1 fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 1 and 2</xref>).

The results were displayed as enrichment (fold) by comparing the fraction of viral promoters immunoprecipitated by anti-H3 to the fraction of GAPDH immunoprecipitated in the same reaction. Data is shown as mean ± SD, n = 3, and P values are calculated using the Student's t-test. n.s. represents not significant, p&gt;0.05 and ‘**’ represents p≤0.01.

Intriguingly, in the host nuclei with the viral genomes positioned to the nuclear edge, the mRNA levels of the representative viral genes of the three classes declined sharply to a significantly lower basal level before the transcription was fully activated. Although the launch of active transcription of ICP27, a representative α gene of HSV-1, in HSV-1 sgRNA-transfected dCas9-emerin cells was delayed by 30 min compared to that in the ctrl sgRNA group, the transcription rates were later comparable. The total amount of ICP27 mRNA synthesized by the nuclear-edged HSV-1 remained 10-fold lower than that synthesized by HSV-1 freely infecting the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

The observations in this set of experiments imply that deposition of HSV-1 genomes to the nuclear border led to decreased initial basal transcription, postponed full-speed transcription onset of viral gene cascades, severely delayed viral protein accumulation, inefficient replication of the virus, and ultimately reduced virus production.</p><p>The nuclear periphery is known to be decorated with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dekker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate whether viral genomes at the nuclear edge were subjected to histone-mediated transcriptional suppression, ChIP-qPCR examining the histone modification patterns at the promoter regions of HSV-1 α, β and γ genes was performed (antibody specificity test over IgG is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>).

At 0.5 hpi, for viral genomes positioned to the nuclear edge, the promoters of representative viral genes showed significantly decreased association with active histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K9ac) and increased association with repressively modified histones (H4K20me3, H3K9me3) compared with those in the ctrl sgRNA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

We hypothesized that during the process of intranuclear HSV-1 DNAs being sensed, recognized, marked, and eventually targeted (transcription suppression or degraded) by the host defense system, dragging away viral genomes from their original spots could interfere with these tightly regulated events and help virus escape. In this section, a series of experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis and probe the chronological order of host antiviral responses.</p><p>In several studies, it was reported that during HSV-1 infection, the virus disrupts the nuclear envelope and modifies and redistributes emerin via interaction with the viral helicase ICP8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sagou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maric et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore examined the distribution pattern of dcas9-emerin, NUP98 and emerin under our experimental conditions to address the reliability and applicability of CRISPR-nuPin. At up to 6 hpi (MOI of 5), the majority of emerin localized at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s1sdata1 fig3s1sdata2">Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>). At 3 hpi and 5 hpi, the nuclear envelope showed no observable disruption under a confocal microscope, and the distribution pattern of Flag-tagged dcas9-emerin was not distinguishable from that in the mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s1sdata3">Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 3</xref>). In addition, cells showed clear nuclear envelope disruption combined with aberrant localization patterns of Flag-dcas9-emerin at 16 hpi, which agrees with previous reports that virus-induced modifications to emerin and the nuclear envelope occur in the late postinfection period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s1sdata3">Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sagou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maric et al., 2014</xref>).

Examination of the subnuclear localizations of HSV-1 genomes at 5 min post sgRNA electroporation showed that CRISPR-nuPin mediated prompt and highly effective intranuclear relocation of viral genomes during active infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2 fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 2 and 3</xref>). Titration of the cell-associated viruses showed that the inhibitory effect imposed by nuclear edging of HSV-1 genomes was time sensitive and only effective during the very early and short period of time (approximately 0.5–1 hr under the current experimental conditions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). An intriguing finding was that the virus yield was significantly increased when HSV-1 genomes were dislocated from their initial intranuclear position to the nuclear rim at 1 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). Tracking the virus production at multiple time points during infection confirmed that repositioning HSV-1 genomes to the nuclear periphery at 1 hpi switched the virus production level to a significantly higher level as early as 4 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). We thus designated this promotive effect mediated by nuclear edging of HSV-1 genomes at 1–1.5 hpi as ‘Escaping’. ‘Escaping’ was not detected in dcas9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s1sdata4">Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 4</xref>).</p><p>One possible explanation for ‘Escaping’ was that placing viral genomes to the nuclear rim increases their chance and frequency of meeting the newly and cytosolically translated viral proteins passing through the NPC.

For the sake of simplicity, ‘Electroporation of HSV-1 sgRNA at 1 hpi during HSV-1 infection of dCas9-emerin cells’ is abbreviated as ‘E1hpi’. Compared with ctrl sgRNA electroporated cells, E1hpi led to significantly boosted transcription of representative viral genes starting from 3 to 4 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) and elevated protein synthesis of ICP0, ICP8, TK, and VP16 at 8 hpi and 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2 fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 2 and 3</xref>).

While ICP4 specifically activates viral β and γ genes and inhibits ICP0 and its own expression, ICP0 is a promiscuous transactivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roizman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Watson and Clements, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grondin and DeLuca, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Everett, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Michael and Roizman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohenzky et al., 1993</xref>). The fact that all classes of viral genes are simultaneously activated in ‘Escaping’ led to our further investigation of the necessity and sufficiency of ICP0 in this event. Although overexpression of the ICP0 protein mitigated the intranuclear spatial bias of HSV-1, placing incoming viral genomes to the nuclear edge still posed a significant disadvantage to virus growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

The virus titer induction level by E1hpi from three independent experiments was summarized and plotted. It is evident that overexpression of ICP0 before infection significantly reduced the ‘Escaping’ effect, suggesting that ICP0 accumulation early in infection contributed to this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1 fig4sdata7 fig4sdata8">Figure 4—source data 1; 7 and 8</xref>) individual experimental results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>.

Our two-component CRISPR-nuPin strategy allowed us to rapidly relocate extrachromosomal DNAs up to 170 kb in minutes, reduce the time lag resulting from chemical addition and/or diffusion, and manipulate subnuclear localization of viral genomes in the middle of infection <bold>in</bold> minutes. CRISPR-nuPin utilized a dCas9-emerin fusion protein to tether targeted DNAs to the inner nuclear envelope upon electroporation of sgRNAs. CRISPR-nuPin utilizes a dCas9-emerin fusion protein to tether targeted DNAs to the inner nuclear envelope upon electroporation of sgRNAs and is advantageous in several aspects: (I) CRISPR-nuPin is induced through electroporation of sgRNAs and mediates prompt repositioning of targeted DNAs to the nuclear edge. Theoretically, this two-factor strategy is applicable to varying subcellular docking sites. (II) CRISPR-nuPin operates in live cells and works efficiently and fleetly during active virus infection, making it a valuable tool to interrogate the complex virus-host interactions in space and time. (III) CRISPR-nuPin relocated the viral genome up to 150 kb without the requirement of repetitive targeting sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and thus, in principle, could be applied to a wide range of DNA viruses, providing a method of probing subcellular viral infections spatially and temporally that has never been seen before. The study herein represents the usage of CRISPR-nuPin to synchronize and investigate the 3D locations and virological fates of HSV-1 genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Nuclear periphery: an edge of darkness for DNA viruses?</title><p>The nuclear periphery is conventionally considered a region of inactive chromatin (the B compartments), and natural nuclear envelope association frequently correlates with transcriptional repression of endogenous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dekker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>).

This inconsistent sensitivity to the nuclear periphery implies that complex mechanisms regulate the transcription of a certain endogenous gene in addition to its physical positions in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reddy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumaran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchwalter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Robinett et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finlan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zullo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ruault et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janicki et al., 2004</xref>). During HSV-1 infection, approximately 25–30% of viral genomes localize at the nuclear edge in HEp-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). There is then a tantalizing question of whether the nuclear edge disfavours transcription of the incoming viral DNA compared with the inner nuclear space.</p><p>As observed in this study and other prior investigations, HSV-1 genes were transcribed at a basal level before the full onset of α gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Godowski and Knipe, 1986</xref>). In addition, in the case of HSV-1 infecting HEp-2 cells at an MOI of 5, the basal-level transcription lasted approximately 30 min post inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Tethering viral genomes to the inner nuclear envelope before or early (up to 0.5 hr at an MOI of 1) in this time window resulted in increased association with repressive histones, stronger transcriptional suppression, and prominently reduced virus yields. This provided the first experimental evidence showing that the nuclear edge imposes a more stringent transcription silencing on incoming viral DNA and that viral genomes entering deeper into the nucleus can be more efficiently transcribed and replicated. We thus referred to this phase as the nuclear periphery sensitive phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proposed stages of the early intranuclear life of HSV-1.</title><p>The schematic depicts the effects of intranuclear repositioning of viral genomes on HSV-1 infection within the initial hours of entering eukaryotic cells.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85412-fig5-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Prior studies have shown that HSV-1 tends to be targeted to the nuclear lamina and relies on A-type lamins for efficient replication and to avoid heterochromatin packaging and that HSV-1 growth was significantly compromised in lamina-deficient MEF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Silva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Everett and Murray, 2005</xref>). Despite the fact that the A-type lamin-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts used in previous studies may have inherent defects concerning nuclear envelope integrity, genome organization, heterochromatin distribution, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sullivan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nikolova et al., 2004</xref>), it is evident that it participates in the nuclear importation and organization of VP16-induced complex (VIC) formation and facilitates the transcriptional activation of viral α genes. Herein, we found that tagging HSV-1 genomes upon entry or during the first 30 min in infection to the inner nuclear membrane significantly inhibits virus transcription, including that of α genes. It should be noted that the exact meanings of ‘the nuclear edge’ and ‘the nuclear periphery’ in these studies are different at the molecular level, although they may be measured similarly under a microscope. In the CRISPR-nuPin platform, HSV-1 genomes are led directly to the surface of the inner nuclear membrane by the fusion dcas9-emerin, which likely overlays with or is embedded within the nuclear lamina. These observed inconsistencies raise a series of interesting and scientifically significant questions, starting with whether tagging HSV-1 DNAs to the inner nuclear membrane is fundamentally different from bringing them close to the lamins and why. HSV-1 genomes are transported to the nuclear pore complex in the virion and ejected into the nucleus using a pressure-driven mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandariz-Nuñez et al., 2019</xref>), which is independent and distinct from the transportation and importation of VIC components VP16 and HCF-1. However, their exact difference in space and time and the molecular mechanisms mediating their encounters remain unclear. Further investigations regarding how and when the nuclear lamina helps to increase the chance of encounter between HSV-1 DNA and VIC and whether nuclear inner membrane tagging of viral genomes opposes it may shed light on this enigma. In these studies, particular attention should be paid to the timeframe post infection and the infection conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Spatial-temporal interactions between HSV-1 and host factors: fierce competition with heterogeneity</title><p>In HEp-2 cells infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 1, HSV-1 genomes were poised for efficient infection and no longer susceptible to nuclear peripheral positioning-mediated suppression after 0.5 hpi. We referred to this period as the second phase of early infection—the nuclear periphery noninhibitive phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, there was a short time window (0.5–1.5 hpi) when repositioning HSV-1 genomes away from their previously occupied slots by CRISPR-nuPin to the nuclear rim significantly promoted viral transcription in a replication-independent mechanism. This effect could be due to either or a combination of the two sequential events: removal of viral genomes from their prior niches and relocation of viral genomes to the nuclear fringe.</p><p>One possible hypothesis that fits into this scenario is that during this phase (0.5–1.5 hpi at an MOI of 1), inhibitory factors are flooding HSV-1 genomes to restrict viral transcription, which is counteracted by ICP0, and therefore, HSV-1 genomes being relocalized intranuclearly helps the virus to escape from the incoming restriction (‘Escaping’). If this hypothesis holds true, enhancing the mobility of HSV-1 genomes during this phase or relocating viral genomes to any other intranuclear positions should result in a comparable ‘Escaping’ effect. Another possible explanation for this phenomenon is that repositioned viral genomes gain greater access to pro-viral factors at the nuclear boundary. Should the second scenario prove accurate, the ‘Escaping’ effect would only occur when viral genomes are relocated close to the inner nuclear membrane at 1 hpi.</p><p>At 2 hpi in HEp-2 cells exposed to HSV-1 at an MOI of 1, repositioning of viral genomes within the nucleus ceased to have a discernible effect on the ultimate virus yield.

virus replication. By infecting cells that express a fusion protein between Cas9 and emerin, a nuclear matrix protein, the addition of guide RNAs that target the herpes virus DNA genome quickly localize it to the nuclear membrane. Initial inhibition of viral gene expression, followed by release of that inhibition in just one hour, was observed. This is an interesting approach to test the importance of localization within the nucleus that is reveals both an effect of 'tethering' and a pathway for escape of that tethering, using a method relevant to other viral and non-viral nucleic acids.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85412.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kirkegaard</surname><given-names>Karla</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.04.08.487454">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.08.487454v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Rewriting the interpretations of the timing of DNA relocalization. Repeatedly there are statements of &quot;instant&quot; relocalization, but these are based on the observations of shifted distributions at the &quot;10 second&quot; samples. From the written methods it appears that 4% PFA fixation was employed at RT for 15 minutes. PFA is not an instantaneous fixative that locks components in place. A great article detailing some of the assumptions of fixation is Schnell U et al. Immunolabeling artifacts and the need for live-cell imaging. Nat Meth. 2012 Jan 30;9(2):152-8. The data support an interpretation of rapid relocalization within minutes of application.</p><p>2) Interpretation of DNA localization data and description of imaging methodology. The images and 3D reconstruction are striking, but there are critical details missing from the methods that directly influence the interpretation of the data. Line 689 claims confocal microscopy, but then states an N-STORM microscope was used. If these images were acquired with super-resolution methods, then those methods should be detailed. If these are standard confocal images, then the measurements provided in the results (lines 203-207) are imprecise. Theoretically a confocal can achieve xy-resolution between 250 – 400 nm, depending on acquisition parameters. Superresolution could achieve the resolutions reported.</p><p>3) The employ of euphemism and evocative language detracts from the explanation and interpretation of results. Especially, the use of driving euphemisms like &quot;full-speed&quot; (line 244) and &quot;higher gear&quot; (line 247) to convey changes in transcript measurements implies that control of transcript abundance occurs at the level of transcription initiation. Please directly stated the observed measurement is sufficient to explain that sgRNA type has an effect on the extent of RNA accumulation, with HSV-specific guides reducing target RNA detection.</p><p>4) The replicate number of experiments. Line 754-755, &quot;Key experiments (Figure 1 F and H, Figure 2 A-H, Figure 3 E, and F, and Figure 4 A-I) were repeated three times or more to ensure reproducibility.&quot; This statement does not address the data that are displayed or the representation of error bars. How many replicates were measured for each condition in each graph? How many times were Western Blot experiments repeated? For the % distribution, how many nuclei are represented in the 'number of spots' values? The prior statement says qPCR was triplicate measured from a single sample, yet those experiments are presented in 2F and G which were repeated multiple times. Clarifications of the replicate numbers for all experiments need to be made as they relate to the data presented.</p><p>5) Additional control experiments and data presentation are needed to support the stated results. Specific examples:</p><p>a. Line 344 &quot;were detected in both HSV-1 genome-edged and naturally dispersed groups with no distinguishable overall pattern differences.&quot; This declaration is not sufficiently supported by the presented data. How many cells were imaged to reach this conclusion? Looking at the data suggests asymmetry of ICP8 distribution. What is the frequency of each class of ICP8 distributions? What are the criteria for classification? Size of aggregate? Please either revise this statement or provide additional analysis of the data.</p><p>b. Line 369 &quot;the immunofluorescence staining results…&quot; The immunofluorescence data lack appropriate controls for infection. Quantitation of fluorescence intensity or classification of structures across a population of image cells needs to be presented, instead of showing a non-staining cell from the control and a stained cell from the treatment.</p><p>6) Line 499 &quot;suggested that ICP0 was sufficient…&quot; 3Logic throughout the manuscript needs some re-phrasing. For example, the conclusion that ICPO is 'sufficient but not necessary' for the relief of viral gene expression is difficult for this reviewer to understand. It simply seemed not to be necessary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85412.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Rewriting the interpretations of the timing of DNA relocalization.

We utilized a N- STORM microscope (A1R N-SIM N-STORM), which is equipped with a high- resolution galvano (non-resonant) scanner and an ultrahigh-speed resonant scanner, for confocal imaging. The immunofluorescence and DNA FISH images used for 3D reconstruction were traditional confocal images, without the use of super-resolution methods. The revised material and method section includes details on the image and the microscope information. The updated description is as follows:</p><p>&quot;Confocal images of the cell samples were captured using a Nikon microscope (A1R N-SIM N-STORM) equipped with 100X oil immersion lenses.” (Line 724-726).</p><p>We concur with the reviewers that the resolution limit of the confocal images is not less than 250 nm. In this study, confocal microscopy combined with 3D reconstruction is adequate for determining the location of FISH signals in relation to the peripheral zone of the nucleus (the definition of nuclear-edged versus intranuclear viral genomes is elaborated in the manuscript (Line 167-line 171)). We would also like to clarify that we do not intend to claim to have measured distances that fall below the confocal resolution. To prevent any confusion, we have made modifications to our description and numbers in the manuscript (Line 204-207).</p><p>While the confocal resolution limit is greater than 250 nm, the pixel size of the images used in this study was set between 50-100 nm. Therefore, in Sup Figure 2 B, the calculation of the distance between the center of a FISH spot and the edge of the DAPI area in these confocal images could result in numbers smaller than the confocal microscopy resolution limit if the FISH spots are located near the DAPI edge. We have included a supplement to the material and method section to explain the distance measurement method used in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 B. The updated description is as follows:</p><p>&quot;In Figure 2—figure supplement 1 B, the distance between the FISH spots and the nuclear periphery (DAPI edge) in the confocal images was determined using ImageJ software with an image ruler. The shortest distance between the center of a FISH spot and the DAPI edge was measured by the straight-line selection tool in ImageJ. We measured 100 nuclear-edged FISH puncta and generated a frequency distribution graph using GraphPad Prism.&quot; (Line 734-739 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The employ of euphemism and evocative language detracts from the explanation and interpretation of results.

As per previous research, α genes of HSV- 1 are silenced by host factors, including heterochromatin packaging, upon nuclear entry of HSV-1 viral genomes. These genes are then transcriptionally induced by viral protein VP16, acting in concert with Oct-1 and HCF-1 through a cis-acting site in the promoter domain of α genes (J Virol. 1991 Jul; 65(7): 3504–3513. Doi: 10.1128/jvi.65.7.3504-3513.1991). We believed that increased heterochromatin packaging (Figure 2 F, G) on nuclear edged HSV-1 genomes caused a delay in the onset of full-speed transcriptional activation of HSV-1 α genes. Once α gene transcription was fully activated, the rate of transcription was similar.</p><p>We understand the concerns raised by the editors and reviewers and have rephrased the description in Line 244-247 to make it simpler and clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The replicate number of experiments.

For publication purposes, we presented a representative dataset of one experiment for Figure 1 E-H. This dataset was counted independently by at least two individual students, who counted at least 500 spots and about 27-250 nuclei per experimental group. The total number of nuclei counted varied in different experiments due to variations in spot numbers per nucleus. Additional details have been added to the figure legends in the revised manuscript.</p><p>When counting the intranuclear localizations of the spots, the students were instructed to count 100-300 spots at a time, resulting in a Peripheral vs. total % value. We counted 4-5 sets of 100-300 spots in images from the same experimental group, resulting in 4 or 5 values that gave the error bar shown in Figure 1 F, H, and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 I. We have added this counting method in the material and methods section of the revised manuscript (Line 796-798).</p><p>All other relevant details are provided in the source data files uploaded with the manuscript.</p><p>For Figure 2 A-H, Figure 3 E-F, Figure 4 A-I, we independently repeated the experiments more than three times and obtained consistent results. The representative experiment data was presented with triplicate measures of a single sample.</p><p>We routinely performed qPCR assay using aliquoted triplicates from a single experimental sample. The qPCR experiments were independently repeated, and the results were consistent.</p><p>An excel file containing details of how many times each experiment was independently repeated is provided in our uploaded source file (Supplementary File 1: Repeat numbers of key experiments).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Additional control experiments and data presentation are needed to support the stated results.

We agree with the comment that we did not thoroughly consider this specific point. Since this is not a very relevant statement, we have removed the unsupported assumptions in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

We have updated Figure 4 E with images showing more cells exhibiting positive ICP0 expression. We would like to kindly remind editors and reviewers that at this time point post infection, all virus proteins were either not yet expressed or expressed at very low levels.</p><p>It is important to note that we do not consider immunofluorescence staining as a reliable method for directly comparing or quantifying protein levels. Consequently, we determined the protein level of ICP0 using a western blot analysis, as presented in Figure 4 D.</p><p>Moreover, we wish to clarify that the purpose of Figure 4 E is not to claim any differences in intranuclear ICP0 distribution between the two compared groups. Instead, its purpose is to provide additional support for the findings presented in Figure 4 D. This is emphasized in the manuscript on Line 370- 372, where we state:</p><p>&quot;The immunofluorescence staining results of E1hpi cells at 1.5 hpi with anti-ICP0 antibody agreed with the observation (Figure 4 E).&quot; In response to the reviewer's inquiry, we have also conducted a repeat of the experiment depicted in Figure 4 E, utilizing viral DNA FISH to stain HSV-1 infection (panel A and Response to reviewers source data 1). The results revealed that cells positive for HSV-1 DNA FISH generally exhibited lower levels of intranuclear ICP0 staining.

To avoid overinterpretation, we exercised caution in describing, concluding, and discussing the experimental results in the manuscript.
