to transduction channels. Because direct mechanical stimulation of tip links has not been experimentally possible, this hypothesis has not been tested. We have engineered DNA tethers that link superparamagnetic beads to tip links and exert mechanical forces on the links when exposed to a magnetic-field gradient. By pulling directly on tip links of the bullfrog's sacculus we have evoked transduction currents from hair cells, confirming the hypothesis that tension in the tip links opens transduction channels. This demonstration of direct mechanical access to tip links additionally lays a foundation for experiments probing the mechanics of individual channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16041.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16041.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16041.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals with backbones, the inner ear is responsible for both hearing and balance. Sound waves and head movements apply a mechanical force to hair cells inside the inner ear. This causes the cells to produce electrical signals that ultimately communicate information about the sound or movement to the brain. The apparatus that converts mechanical forces into electrical signals is called the hair bundle, which is an upright cluster of small rods called stereocilia that protrude from the hair cell's flattened top surface. Fine filaments called tip links connect the stereocilia within a hair bundle to one another.</p><p>It is thought that the mechanical deflection of a hair bundle tenses the tip links and opens ion channels – molecular pores through which ions can pass – that are attached to the tip links. The resultant flow of ions across the hair cell's membrane would then cause a voltage change that in turn triggers the cell’s electrical response. It has not been possible to test this hypothesis, however, because the position of the tip links within a hair bundle prevents them from being stimulated directly in experiments.</p><p>Basu et al. have now used specific antibody molecules to attach tip links to magnetic beads using a strand of DNA. The DNA acted as a string that penetrated into the hair bundles, connecting the tip links to magnetic beads outside the bundles. This meant that moving the bead by applying a magnetic force to it pulled upon the tip links, and the investigators observed that this activated the associated ion channels. The resultant electrical signals confirmed that tip links play a role in the responses of hair cells.</p><p>Although there are methods that allow the electrical activity from a single ion channel to be recorded, the new approach provides an opportunity for studying the mechanical activity of a channel as well. Future studies could therefore investigate the mechanical and electrical signals associated with individual tip links and the ion channels to which they attach in order to investigate the specific role they play in hearing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16041.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16041.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>auditory system</kwd><kwd>bullfrog</kwd><kwd>mechanoelectrical transduction</kwd><kwd>vestibular system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basu</surname><given-names>Aakash</given-names></name><name><surname>Lagier</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Vologodskaia</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><name><surname>Fabella</surname><given-names>Brian A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hudspeth</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability of hair cells to produce an electrical signal in response to a mechanical stimulus stems from tension in the elastic tip links within the bundles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair cells occur universally in the auditory and vestibular systems of vertebrates, where they transduce mechanical stimuli into electrical responses and thus initiate the perception of sounds and accelerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hudspeth, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2014</xref>). The apical surface of a hair cell bears a hair bundle comprising actin-filled stereocilia whose gradation in height forms a bevel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The tip of each stereocilium is connected to the side of the tallest adjacent stereocilium through a protein filament, the tip link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pickles et al., 1984</xref>). The upper two-thirds of this link comprises a parallel dimer of cadherin 23 (CDH23) molecules whereas the lower third encompasses a parallel dimer of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kazmierczak et al., 2007</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16041.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental configuration and control experiments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In diagrams of a hair cell at rest (top) and during excitatory stimulation (bottom), the magnified images show how hair-bundle deflection is thought to raise the tension in tip links and thus open transduction channels.

Electrophysiological and mechanical evidence suggests that deflection increases the tension in an elastic structure, the gating spring, that communicates force to the transduction channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corey and Hudspeth, 1983a</xref>). Several lines of circumstantial evidence support the hypothesis that the tip link constitutes at least a portion of the gating spring: the stereociliary tips are the site of transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hudspeth, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beurg et al., 2009</xref>); the orientation of the tip links corresponds to the hair bundle's axis of maximal sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shotwell et al., 1981</xref>); and the responsiveness vanishes when the tip links are disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assad et al., 1991</xref>). Nevertheless, the critical role of tip-link tension in gating mechanoelectrical-transduction channels has never been tested directly.</p><p>Because they occur in the narrow spaces between the tips of contiguous stereocilia, tip links are not readily accessible to experimental manipulation. As a consequence, the stimulation of transduction channels has heretofore been limited to the deflection of entire hair bundles. We have developed a method of applying mechanical force specifically to tip links, allowing us to test directly the hypothesis that tip-link tension gates the transduction channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To apply tension at a defined position on each of a large number of tip links, we raised a polyclonal antiserum against a specific epitope near the carboxyl terminal of the bullfrog's CDH23, and thus at the links' upper ends. Because each tip link resides in a confined space at the hair bundle's top, it is impractical to ligate the antibodies directly to a probe particle for use with optical or magnetic tweezers. We therefore created a mechanical tether for the tip link by interposing a 3 kb, double-stranded DNA molecule between the attached antibody and a 1 μm-diameter superparamagnetic bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The DNA molecule was obtained by PCR of a plasmid with primers that incorporated biotin and fluorescein moieties at the molecule's opposite ends. The biotinylated terminus bound through a streptavidin molecule to a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, which in turn bound the rabbit anti-CDH23. The fluorescein-modified end of the DNA adhered to a superparamagnetic bead coated with anti-fluorescein. The tether provided sufficient separation between the tip link and the relatively large bead to overcome the problem of steric inaccessibility.</p><p>Control experiments confirmed that the DNA tethers functioned as intended. First, the anti-CDH23 antibodies labeled the stereociliary tips in living hair cells of the bullfrog's sacculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The antibodies' binding to cadherin isoforms was also confirmed for both saccular and brain tissue by Western blot analysis. Following synthesis of the complete tether, superparamagnetic beads localized to the regions of the tip links but were absent if the primary antibody, secondary antibody, or streptavidin was omitted during the process of tether synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Finally, as expected for DNA tethers, treatment of the preparation with DNAse liberated the superparamagnetic beads.</p><p>The otolithic membrane that covered the hair bundles was removed enzymatically, exposing the tip links to the components of the DNA tethers. After completing tether synthesis we placed the chamber beneath an electromagnet and used magnetic force to pull the tethered beads directly upward, parallel to the stereocilia. If an increase in tip-link tension opens mechanoelectrical-transduction channels, pulling the links upward should elicit ionic currents into the hair cells and thus produce a transepithelial electrical response termed the microphonic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corey and Hudspeth, 1983b</xref>). Detected with electrodes in the two compartments of a recording chamber, such a signal reflects the total transduction current traversing the saccular epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16041.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Electrical responses to magnetic stimulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The diagram shows a sacculus mounted in a two-compartment chamber beneath an electromagnet. The otolithic membrane has been removed and superparamagnetic beads (red dots) are attached to the tip links through DNA tethers. (<bold>B</bold>) Brief magnetic stimuli of opposite polarities, which are denoted by the voltages applied to the magnet, elicit transepithelial electrical responses. Exposure of the preparation to 1 mM gentamicin blocks these physiological responses, leaving only artifacts that are eliminated by averaging the signals obtained from stimuli of opposite polarity. (<bold>C</bold>) Longer stimuli demonstrate the persistence of transduction currents without the extensive adaptation observed during conventional stimulation. The stimulus traces shown produced the largest response; successively smaller responses were generated by lowering the voltage supplied to the magnet in steps of 0.2 V. (<bold>D</bold>) To eliminate the possibility that magnetic stimulation pulls hair bundles in the excitatory direction, most of the beads can be removed and the preparation tilted by 10°. (<bold>E</bold>) Brown superparamagnetic beads initially cover the apical surface of a mounted sacculus (left). Scraping away most of the beads (center) leaves only the beads attached to hair bundles of similar orientations (arrowheads), sensitive to stimulation away from the saccular nerve (N). Further manipulation removes nearly all the beads (right). The dashed line circumscribes the region in which hair cells occur. (<bold>F</bold>) Although smaller than the control response (top), an electrical response nevertheless persists after removal of most beads (middle). With the beads localized to one region with similar hair-bundle orientations, magnetic force pulls those bundles upward and toward their short edges. Removing the remaining beads eliminates the response (bottom). The calibration bars in (<bold>C</bold>) apply to this panel as well. (<bold>G</bold>) Addition to the artificial perilymph in the top chamber of 1 mM EGTA, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator that dissociates tip links, abolished the electrical response.

To confirm that these signals originated primarily from transduction channels, we conducted control experiments in the presence of 1 mM gentamicin, a blocker of transduction channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kroese et al., 1989</xref>). We then detected only small, magnetically induced artifacts during stimulation of either polarity. Moreover, no response was observed when the primary antiserum was omitted from the preparative procedure.</p><p>As a result of the electromotive force induced by the changing magnetic field, we expected our recordings to include stimulus artifacts. Because the pulling force on a superparamagnetic bead does not depend on the direction of the current through the electromagnet, the physiological responses to stimuli of opposite polarities should have been identical. The artifacts, however, should have reversed signs in accordance with Faraday’s law. To separate the transduction responses from artifacts, we therefore applied to the magnet successive voltage pulses of a constant magnitude but opposite polarities. By averaging the responses to these two stimuli we removed the artifacts and preserved only the responses owing to mechanoelectrical transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The peak response in nine experiments was 38.7 ± 9.8 μV (mean ± standard deviation), roughly one-tenth the maximal value expected if every tip link were stimulated. That the responses to currents of opposite polarity were largely the same also indicated that the signals originated primarily from mechanoelectrical transduction rather than electromagnetic interference. As expected, gentamicin treatment revealed that the residual artifacts were equal and opposite and summed to zero.</p><p>Although the signals elicited by conventional hair-bundle deflection adapt rapidly to a plateau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eatock et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shepherd and Corey, 1994</xref>), the responses elicited by protracted magnetic stimulation declined gradually over several seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Conventional stimulation of a hair bundle is thought to tense each tip link and open the associated channels. Aided by the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the myosin molecules that secure the upper ends of the tip links, this tension then declines, resulting in adaptation of the electrical response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Howard and Hudspeth, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Assad et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hacohen et al., 1989</xref>). Magnetic stimulation, in contrast, should pull the top ends of the tip links upward. This force not only opened transduction channels but evidently restrained the insertional plaques from descending as well. Recovery from the vertical offset of the plaques might explain why the electrical response relaxed far more slowly than during conventional adaptation. Because the magnitude of the response was sensitive to the strength of magnetic stimulation, the long plateau observed during protracted magnetic stimulation did not stem from saturation of the response.</p><p>Imperfect positioning of the saccular epithelium in the experimental chamber might have created a tilt between the preparation and the direction of the magnetic-field gradient. If this were the case, any component of magnetic force directed toward the tall edges of hair bundles would have excited a response by the conventional mechanism of bundle deflection. Although that form of stimulation would be difficult to reconcile with the protracted adaptation observed during extended magnetic stimulation, we nevertheless performed an additional experiment to eliminate this possibility and ensure that the measured potentials resulted from upward tension in the tip links. The preparation was positioned in a sample holder with a 10° tilt between the saccular epithelium and the plane of the magnet's pole piece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). After tethering superparamagnetic beads as usual, we scraped away most of the beads with an eyelash, leaving beads and intact hair bundles only in the segment of the epithelium opposite the saccular nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Throughout that region the hair bundles display a common direction of excitability away from the nerve. In the tilted configuration any magnetic force tangent to the epithelial surface would have pulled the hair bundles toward their short edges and would therefore have countered the conventional electrical response. Even under these conditions we observed a transduction current of the usual polarity but of diminished magnitude owing to the removal of most tethered beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As expected, the response vanished when the remaining beads had been scraped away.</p><p>Attachment of the magnetic tethers to cadherins on hair-cell surfaces rather than to fully formed tip links might elicit extraneous responses independent of the transduction process. To eliminate this possibility, we dissociated tip links by treatment with 1 mM EGTA. Under these conditions the summed response fell to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that the responses stemmed from traction on tip links.</p><p>In order to quantify the stimulus, we calibrated the force exerted by the magnet on a superparamagnetic bead attached to a glass surface through a DNA tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gosse and Croquette, 2002</xref>). The lateral Brownian fluctuations of the tethered bead were measured at 250 frames per second with a video camera (Redlake MotionScope 2000S, DEL Imaging Systems).

By overcoming this limitation, our experiments have demonstrated that upward force on tip links generates transduction currents independent of hair-bundle deflection. As expected, these responses vanish in the presence of a channel blocker. The observed responses accord well with the values expected on the basis of the calibrated magnetic force on tethered beads and the gating-spring theory for transduction by hair cells.</p><p>More than three decades after the postulation that tension in gating springs within the hair bundle opens transduction channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corey and Hudspeth, 1983a</xref>) and the subsequent suggestion that tip links constitute those elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pickles et al., 1984</xref>), the present observations provide direct support for both hypotheses.

First, a cluster of hair bundles representing about one-seventh of the saccular complement produces a peak transepithelial response near 500 μV during conventional stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corey and Hudspeth, 1983b</xref>), so activating every cell in the sensory epithelium would yield about 3500 μV. The second approach is to consider that an individual hair cell from the frog's sacculus typically produces a peak transduction current of 200 pA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillespie and Hudspeth, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheung and Corey, 2006</xref>), so the 2000 or so cells in a medium-sized sacculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacobs and Hudspeth, 1990</xref>) would yield a total current of about 400 nA. Returning across an epithelium of resistance 10 kΩ, that current would yield a transepithelial signal of 4000 μV, a value in good agreement with the first calculation. If magnetic stimulation were to increase the open probability of all the preparation's transduction channels by 10% as calculated from our calibration of the magnetic force, the magnetic stimuli would be expected to produce signals of 350–400 μV at most. The value would be approximately one-tenth as great on the basis of <italic>ab initio</italic> calculations. Because only a small fraction of the tip links are attached to beads, however, the actual responses should be still smaller.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank T Bartsch for assistance in the magnetic calibration experiments and C Kirst and members of our research group for comments on the manuscript.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Direct mechanical stimulation of tip links in hair cells through DNA tethers&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript reports that transepithelial currents can be evoked by directly pulling on CDH23 via an antibody using a magnetic field. This is an important and new result if the authors can convincingly show that in their experiments they are pulling on tip links (rather than CDH23 molecules not assembled into tip links) and that the force is not moving the hair bundle. While the work presented in the manuscript is strong, it is not yet fully convincing and a specific additional experiment is needed to show that the stimulation due to upward forces indeed depends on the presence of intact tip links on which the force is applied.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should demonstrate that the upward force is exerted on tip links and not on Cadherin 23 molecules that are present on the cell surface but are not part of a tip-link spanning neighbouring stereocilia. This can be shown using BAPTA treatment which severs the tip-links. As a result of this treatment, the direct hair bundle stimulation should no longer be observed as there are not tip links left to which the force can be applied.</p><p>A second point concerns the calibration and the estimation of the applied forces. This is presented in the supplement and is not very clearly presented. As this is an important part of the work it should be clearly discussed in the main text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16041.006</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors should demonstrate that the upward force is exerted on tip links and not on Cadherin 23 molecules that are present on the cell surface but are not part of a tip-link spanning neighbouring stereocilia.

We have added an illustration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) portraying an equivalent experiment that we had already performed: the response to magnetic stimulation drops to zero when the preparation is treated with 1 mM EGTA. Like other Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators, this substance dissociates tip links and arrests mechanoelectrical transduction. We have also included the following in the main text: &quot;Attachment of the magnetic tethers to cadherins on hair-cell surfaces rather than to fully formed tip links might elicit extraneous responses independent of the transduction process. To eliminate this possibility, we dissociated tip links by treatment with 1 mM EGTA. Under these conditions the summed response fell to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that the responses stemmed from traction on tip links.&quot;</p><p><italic>A second point concerns the calibration and the estimation of the applied forces. This is presented in the supplement and is not very clearly presented. As this is an important part of the work it should be clearly discussed in the main text.</italic></p><p>In response to this comment, we have transferred the section describing the force calibration to the main text. We have also added detail and attempted to be more explicit about the procedure. The following has now been added to the main text:</p><p>&quot;In order to quantify the stimulus, we calibrated the force exerted by the magnet on a superparamagnetic particle attached to a glass surface through a DNA tether (Gosse and Croquette, 2002). […] By measuring the lateral displacement <italic>&lt;δx<sup>2</sup>&gt;</italic> and numerically solving <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">equations (1) and (2)</xref> for 16 determinations, we estimated a magnetic force at the position of the specimen of 0.48 ± 0.07 pN (mean ± standard deviation).&quot;</p><p>We have retained the ab initio estimation for force from the nominal properties of the bead and the field strength and gradient in the Materials and methods. We have also conducted additional calibration experiments and report the results:</p><p>&quot;Using a Hall-effect magnetometer (OHS3150U; TT Electronics/Optek Technology), we measured a magnetic field strength of 49 mT (490 G) at a distance of 4.1 mm from the magnet's pole piece and along its center axis. […] An ab initio calculation provides only a lower estimate of the magnetic force, however, and requires scaling by an empirically determined factor to accord with measured values (Lipfert et al., 2009; Shevkoplyas et al., 2007).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
